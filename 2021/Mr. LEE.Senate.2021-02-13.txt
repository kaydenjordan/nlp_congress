 Mr. President, I have a point of order.   Mr. President, moments ago, House Manager Cicilline--   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will withhold. I am advised by  the Parliamentarian that debate is not in order.    I appeal the ruling of the Chair that debate is not in  order.    There is clearly a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. A quorum has been suggested, and the clerk  will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to suspend the quorum  call.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Objection is heard.    Mr. President, I withdraw my appeal.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The appeal is withdrawn.   The Chair would advise everybody that the evidentiary record is  closed. S. Res. 47 described the scope of those things not admitted  into evidence as those referenced at trial. New evidence is not  permitted in closing argument. References to such new evidence will be  stricken.   Who seeks recognition?   The House managers have the floor if they wish to resume.   The House managers.   Ms. Manager DEAN. Mr. President, esteemed Senators, good afternoon.   We are grateful for your kind attention this week as we engaged in a  process formulated and put to paper by the Founders in my home city of  Philadelphia, which is getting its fair share of attention this week,  in 1787--234 years ago.   My colleague Mr. Cicilline addressed the importance of the  President's dereliction of duty. I will focus on three specific aspects  of this case which the defense has raised questions about.   First, the defense suggests that this was just one speech and one  speech cannot incite insurrection, and the defense suggested, because  the attack was preplanned by some insurrectionists, Donald Trump is  somehow not culpable. Both of these things are, mainly, not true nor  are they what we allege.   So let's be clear. We are not suggesting that Donald Trump's January  6 speech by itself incited the attack. We have shown that his course of  conduct leading up to and including that speech incited the attack. The  defense is correct that the insurrection was preplanned. That supports  our point. We argue and the evidence overwhelmingly confirms that  Donald Trump's conduct over many months incited his supporters to  believe, one, his big lie, that the only way he could lose was if the  election were rigged; two, that, to ensure the election would not be  stolen to prevent the fraud, they had to stop the steal; and, three,  they had to fight to stop the steal or they would not have a country  anymore.   This conduct took time, and it culminated in Donald Trump's sending a  ``save the date'' on December 19, 18 days before the attack, telling  his base exactly when, where, and who to fight. While he was doing  this, he spent $50 million from his legal defense fund to  [[Page S725]]  simultaneously broadcast his message to ``stop the steal'' over all  major networks. Donald Trump invited them; he incited them; then he  directed them.   Here are a few clips that will help bring that story to light.   (Video presentation of 7-19-2020.)         The big lie.    (Text of video presentation of 7-19-2020.)         Mr. Wallace. Can you give a direct answer you will accept       the election?        President TRUMP. I have to see. Look, I have to see. No,       I'm not going to just say yes.    (Text of video presentation of 7-30-2020.)         President TRUMP. This election will be the most rigged       election in history.    (Text of video presentation of 7-31-2020.)         President TRUMP. This is going to be the greatest election       disaster in history.    (Text of video presentation of 8-24-2020.)         President TRUMP. The only way they can take this election       away from us is if this is a rigged election. We're going to       win this election.    (Text of video presentation of 9-12-2020.)         President TRUMP. It's a rigged election. That's the only       way we are going to lose.    (Text of video presentation of 9-23-2020.)         Unidentified Speaker. Do you commit to making sure that       there's a peaceful transfer of power?        President TRUMP. Get rid of the ballots, and you'll have a       very trans---you'll have a very peaceful--there won't be a       transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation.    (Text of video presentation of 9-25-2020.)         President TRUMP. That's the only way we're going--that's       the only way we're going to lose is if there's mischief,       mischief, and it'll have to be on a big scale, so be careful.    (Text of video presentation of 10-8-2020.)         President TRUMP. But this will be one of the greatest       fraudulent--most fraudulent elections ever.    (Text of video presentation of 10-26-2020.)         President TRUMP. I'm not going to let this election be       taken away from us. That's the only way they're going to win       it.    (Text of video presentation of 11-4-2020.)         President TRUMP. This is a fraud on the American public.        (People chanting: ``Yeah.'')        This is an embarrassment to our country.        (People chanting: ``Yeah.'')        We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did       win this election.        (People chanting: ``Yeah.'')    (Text of video presentation of 11-5-2020.)         President TRUMP. We were winning in all the key locations       by a lot, actually, and then our numbers started miraculously       getting whittled away in secret, and this is a case where       they're trying to steal an election. They're trying to rig an       election, and we can't let that happen.    (Text of video presentations of 12-2-2020.)         President TRUMP. You can't let another person steal that       election from you. All over the country, people are together       in holding up signs: ``Stop the steal.''        President TRUMP. If we don't root out the fraud--the       tremendous and horrible fraud--that has taken place in our       2020 election, we don't have a country anymore.    (Text of video presentation of 12-22-2020.)         President TRUMP. We cannot allow a completely fraudulent       election to stand.    (Text of video presentations of 1-4-2021.)         President TRUMP. We're going to fight like hell, I'll tell       you right now.        (People chanting: ``Yeah.'')        President TRUMP. If you don't fight to save your country       with everything you have, you're not going to have a country       left.        President TRUMP. We will not bend. We will not break. We       will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up.       We will never back down. We will never ever surrender.    (Text of video presentations of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. All of us here today do not want to see       our election victory stolen. We will never give up. We will       never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when       there's theft involved.        (People chanting: ``Yeah.'')        President TRUMP. And to use a favorite term that all of you       people really came up with: We will stop the steal.        President TRUMP. Because you'll never take back our country       with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be       strong.        President TRUMP. Make no mistake, this election was stolen       from you, from me, from the country.        And we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don't fight       like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.    Our point is this: This was not one speech. This was a deliberate,  purposeful effort by Donald Trump, over many months, that resulted in  the well-organized mob attack on January 6.   That brings me to my second point, the violence.   Defense counsel argues that there is no way that Donald Trump could  have known what would happen. Yet we are not suggesting nor is it  necessary for us to prove that Donald Trump knew every detail of what  would unfold on January 6 or even how horrible and deadly the attack  would become, but he did know, as he looked out on that sea of  thousands in front of him--some wearing body armor and helmets, others  carrying weapons--that the result would be violence. The evidence  overwhelmingly demonstrates this.   A few points on this.   Donald Trump knew the people he was inciting leading up to January 6.  He saw the violence they were capable of. He had a pattern and practice  of praising and encouraging supporters of violence, never condemning  it.   It is not a coincidence that those same people--the Proud Boys, the  organizer of the Trump caravan, the supporters and speakers at the  second Million MAGA March--all showed up on January 6.   And Donald Trump's behavior was different. This was not just a  comment by an official or a politician fighting for a cause; this was  months of cultivating a base of people who were violent, praising that  violence, and then leading them--leading that violence, that rage  straight to a joint session of Congress, where he knew his Vice  President was presiding.   And Donald Trump had warnings about the crowd in front of him on  January 6. There were detailed posts online of attack plans. Law  enforcement warned that these posts were real threats and even made  arrests in the days leading up to the attack. There were credible  reports that many would be armed and ready to attack the Capitol.   Despite these credible warnings of serious, dangerous threats to our  Capitol, when the crowd was standing in front of the President, ready  to take orders and attack, he said:         We're going to the Capitol.        And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight       like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.    Here is a short clip.   (Text of video presentation of 9-29-2020.)         President TRUMP. What do you want to call them? Give me a       name. Give me a name. Who would you like me to condemn? Who       would you like me to condemn?        Mr. Wallace. White supremacists and--        President TRUMP. Proud Boys? Stand back and stand by.    (Video presentation of 10-31-2020.)   (Text of video presentation of 11-1-2020.)         President TRUMP. It is something. Do you see the way our       people, they--you know, they were protecting his bus       yesterday because they are nice. So his bus--they had       hundreds of cars: Trump, Trump. Trump and the American flag.       That's what--you see Trump and American flag.    (Text of video presentation of 12-12-2020.)         At the first Million MAGA March we promised that if the GOP       would not do everything in their power to keep Trump in       office, that we would destroy the GOP. And as we gather here       in Washington, DC, for a second Million MAGA March, we are       done making promises. It has to happen now. We are going to       destroy the GOP.        (People chanting: ``Destroy the GOP.'')    (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. Because you'll never take back our country       with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be       strong.    (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Senators, the violence on January 6 was demonstrably foreseeable.  Trump even said so himself at 6:01 p.m. the day of the attack. The last  thing he said before he went to sleep, ``These are the things that  happen.'' He foresaw this, and he admitted as much.   That brings me to my final point, the insurrectionists.   Defense counsel has suggested these people came here on their own.  The defense brief states that the insurrectionists ``did so [for] their  own accord and for their own reasons and are being criminally  prosecuted.''  [[Page S726]]    It is true that some insurrectionists are being prosecuted, but it is  not true that they did so of their own accord and for their own  reasons. The evidence makes clear the exact opposite--that they did  this for Donald Trump at his invitation, at his direction, at his  command. They said this before the attack, during the attack. They said  it after the attack.   Leading up to January 6, in post after post, the President's  supporters confirmed this was for Donald Trump; it was at his  direction.   One supporter wrote:         If Congress illegally [certified] Biden, . . . Trump would       have absolutely no choice but to demand us to storm the       Capitol and kill/beat them up for it.    They even say publicly, openly, and proudly that President Trump  would help them commandeer the National Guard so all they have to do is  overwhelm 2,000 Capitol Police officers.   During his speech on January 6, Trump supporters chanted his words  back to him. They even live-tweeted his commands, as Ms. DeGette showed  you.   During the attack, the insurrectionists at the Capitol changed Donald  Trump's words from his tweets, rallies, and from the speech of the 6th.   They held signs that said--and chanted--``Fight for Trump.'' ``Stop  the steal.''   They read his tweets over bullhorns, amplifying his demands.   Another rioter, while live-streaming the insurrection from the  Capitol, said:         He'll be happy. We're fighting for Trump.    What is more, the insurrectionists were not hiding. They believed  they were following the orders from our Commander in Chief. They felt  secure enough in the legitimacy of their actions to take selfies, to  post photos and videos on social media.   After the attack, rioter after rioter confirmed this too.   Jenna Ryan, who was later accused for her role in the insurrection,  said:         I thought I was following my President. I thought we were       following what we were called to do.        President Trump requested that we be in DC on the 6th.    When it became clear that Donald Trump would not protect them, some  of his supporters said they felt ``duped''; they felt ``tricked.''   Listen to some of this evidence.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Ms. Pierson. And even if they think for a second that       they're going to get away with this today, they got another       thing coming because today is just a day, and today is just       the beginning. They haven't seen a resistance until they have       seen a patriot fight for their country. If you die today--    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The parties will withhold. The parties  will withhold.   The evidentiary record is closed.   S. Res. 27 describes the scope of those things admitted into evidence  as those referenced in trial. New evidence is not permitted in closing  arguments. References to such new evidence will be stricken.   Who yields time?   Ms. Manager DEAN. Mr. President, the statement was in evidence; the  slide was not, so we will withdraw the slide, but the statement was in  evidence.   They told you themselves they were following the President's orders,  and you will see something clearly--Donald Trump knew who these people  were.   As the slide shows, the people he cultivated, whose violence he  praised, were all there on January 6--the Proud Boys, who Donald Trump  told to ``stand back and stand by'' in September of 2020; Keith Lee,  organizer of the Trump caravan that tried to drive the Biden campaign  bus off the road; Katrina Pierson, the speaker at the second Million  MAGA March--they were all there.   The video you are about to see is in the Record.   Oh, correction. The Record did include, appropriately, the last  video, so we will keep that in the Record, and I will keep it in my  closing remarks.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senators will take their seats. The Senate  will be in order.   The Representative may continue.   Ms. Manager DEAN. Thank you, Mr. President.   I have to say, that of all the trials I have ever been a part of,  this is certainly one of them.   As the slides show, the people he cultivated, whose violence he  praised, were all there on January 6--the Proud Boys, who Donald Trump  told to ``stand back and stand by'' in September of 2020; Keith Lee,  the organizer of the Trump caravan that tried to drive the Biden  campaign bus off the road; Katrina Pierson, the speaker at the second  Million MAGA March--they were all there.   Here is one final clip, also submitted in the Record.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Senators, some of the insurrectionists are facing criminal charges.  Donald Trump was acting as our Commander in Chief; he was our  President. He used his office and the authority it commands to incite  an attack, and when Congress and the Constitution were under attack, he  abandoned his duties, violated his oath, failing to preserve, protect,  and defend.   That is why we are here--because the President of the United States,  Donald J. Trump, incited and directed thousands of people to attack the  legislative branch. He knew what his supporters were capable of. He  inflamed them, sent them down Pennsylvania Avenue, not on any old day  but on the day we were certifying the election results. As they were  banging on our doors, he failed to defend us because this is what he  wanted. He wanted to remain in power. For that crime against the  Republic, he must be held accountable.    Senators, the insurrectionists are still listening.   Before I end, I must admit, until we were preparing for this trial, I  didn't know the extent of many of these facts. I witnessed the horror,  but I didn't know. I didn't know how deliberate the President's  planning was, how he had invested in it, how many times he incited his  supporters with these lies, how carefully and consistently he incited  them to violence on January 6.   While many of us may have tuned out his rallies, I also did not know  the extent that his followers were listening, were hanging on his every  word, and honestly, I did not know how close the mob actually came to  their violent end, that they were just steps away from all of us, that  the death toll could have been much higher but for the bravery of men  and women who protect us.   But now we know. We know the bravery of people like Officer Goodman  and all the men and women of the Capitol Police, of the custodians who  with pride and a sense of duty in their work cleaned up shattered  glass, splintered wood, and blood-stained floors. We know the sacrifice  of life and limb.   We know what Donald Trump did. We know what he failed to do. Though  it is difficult to bear witness and face the reality of what happened  in these halls, what happens if we don't confront these facts? What  happens if there is no accountability?   For those who say we need to get past this, we need to come together,  we need to unify, if we don't set this right and call it what it was-- the highest constitutional crime by the President of the United  States--the past will not be past. The past will become our future for  my grandchildren and for their children.   Senators, we are in a dialogue with history, a conversation with our  past with a hope for our future. Two hundred and thirty-four years from  now, it may be that no one person here among us is remembered. Yet,  what we do here, what is being asked of each of us here in this moment,  will be remembered. History has found us. I ask that you not look the  other way.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. I would now like to bring up Mr. Neguse   Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, there is  an old quote from Henry Clay, a son of Kentucky, that ``courtesies of a  small and trivial character are the ones [that] strike deepest in the  grateful and appreciating heart.''   I want to say on behalf of all the House managers that we are very  grateful for the courtesies that you have extended to us and the  President's counsel during the course of this trial.   You have heard my colleague Manager Dean go through the overwhelming  evidence that makes clear that President Trump must be convicted and  disqualified for his high crime. I am not going to repeat that  evidence; it speaks for itself.  [[Page S727]]    Earlier in this trial, you might recall a few days ago that I  mentioned my expectation that President Trump's lawyers might do  everything they could to avoid discussing the facts of this case, and I  can understand why. I mean, the evidence that all of us presented, that  Manager Dean has summarized, is pretty devastating. So rather than  address it, the President has offered up distractions, excuses,  anything but actually trying to defend against the facts.   They said things like President Trump is now a private citizen, so  the criminal justice system can deal with it, or that we haven't set a  clear standard for incitement--we talked a lot about due process--and  that all politicians say words like ``fight.''   I would like to take a minute to explain why each of those  distractions are precisely that--distractions--and why they do not  prevent in any way this Senate from convicting President Trump.   No. 1, every President is one day a private citizen, so the argument  that because President Trump has left office, he shouldn't be impeached  for conduct committed while he was in office doesn't make sense. I  mean, why would the Constitution include the impeachment power at all  if the criminal justice system serves as a suitable alternative once a  President leaves office? It wouldn't.   Impeachment is a remedy separate and apart from the criminal justice  system, and for good reason. The Presidency comes with special powers,  extraordinary powers not bestowed on ordinary citizens, and if those  powers are abused, they can cause great damage to our country, and they  have to be dealt with in a separate forum, this forum.   It would be unwise to suggest that, going forward, the only  appropriate response to constitutional offenses committed by a  President are criminal charges when the President returns to private  life. That is not the kind of political system any of us want, and it  is not the kind of constitutional system the Framers intended.   Second, it is true we have not cited criminal statutes establishing  elements of incitement because, again, this isn't a criminal trial. It  is not a criminal case. President Trump is charged with a  constitutional offense, and you are tasked with determining whether or  not he committed that high crime as understood by our Framers.   So the relevant question, which President Trump's lawyers would have  you ignore, is, Would our Framers have considered a President inciting  a violent mob to attack our government while seeking to stop the  certification of our elections--would they have considered that an  impeachable offense? Who among us, who among us really thinks the  answer to that question is no?   Third, due process. So just to be absolutely clear, the House, with  the sole power of impeachment, determines what the process looks like  in the House, and the Senate does the same for the trial.   During this trial, the President has counsel. They have argued very  vigorously on his behalf. We had a full presentation of evidence,  adversarial presentations, motions. The President was invited to  testify. He declined. The President was invited to provide exculpatory  evidence. He declined. You can't claim there is no due process when you  won't participate in the process.   And we know this case isn't one that requires a complicated legal  analysis. You all--you lived it. The managers and I, we lived it. Our  country lived it. The President, in public view, right out in the open,  incited a violent mob, a mob that temporarily, at least, stopped us  from certifying an election. If there were ever an exigent  circumstance, this is it.   No. 4, we all know that President Trump's defense, as we predicted,  spent a lot of time--all the time comparing his conduct to other  politicians using words like ``fight.'' Of course, you saw the hours of  video. As I said on Thursday, we trust you to know the difference  because what you will not find in those video montages that they showed  you is any of those speeches, those remarks culminating in a violent  insurrection on our Nation's Capitol. That is the difference.   The President spent months inflaming his supporters to believe that  the election had been stolen from him, from them, which was not true.  He summoned the mob, assembled the mob, and when the violence erupted,  he did nothing to stop it; instead, inciting it further.   Senators, all of these arguments offered by the President have one  fundamental thing in common--one. They have nothing to do with whether  or not--factually, whether or not the President incited this attack.  They have given you a lot of distractions so they don't have to defend  what happened here on that terrible day, and they do that because they  believe those distractions are going to work, that you will ignore the  President's conduct instead of confronting it.   I think they are wrong. Some of you know this already. I am the  youngest member of our manager team by quite a few years, so perhaps I  am a bit naive, but I just don't believe that. I really don't. I don't  believe their effort is going to work, and here is why: because I know  what this body is capable of.   I may not have witnessed it, but I have read about it in the history  books. I have seen the C-SPAN footage, archives, sometimes have watched  them for hours--yes, I have actually done that--and the history of our  country in those books and in those tapes, the history of this country  has been defined right here on this floor.   The 13th Amendment, the amendment abolishing slavery, was passed in  this very room. In this room--not figuratively, literally where you all  sit and where I stand. In 1964, this body, with the help of Senators  like John Sherman Cooper and so many others, this body secured passage  of the Civil Rights Act. We made the decision to enter World War II  from this Chamber.   We have certainly had our struggles, but we have always risen to the  occasion when it mattered the most, not by ignoring injustice or  cowering to bullies and threats but by doing the right thing, by trying  to do the right thing, and that is why so many nations around the world  aspire to be like America. They stand up to dictators and autocrats and  tyrants because America is a guiding light for them, a North Star. They  do so, they look to us because we have been a guiding light, a North  Star in these moments because the people who sat in your chairs, when  confronted with choices that define us, rose to the occasion.   I want to offer one more example of a decision made in this room by  this body that resonated with me. The first day I stood up in this  trial, I mentioned that I was the son of immigrants, like many of you,  and many Senators graciously approached me after my presentation and  asked me where my parents were from, and I told folks who asked that my  folks were from East Africa.   In 1986, this body considered a bill to override President Reagan's  veto of legislation opposing sanctions on South Africa during  apartheid. Two Senators who are sitting in this room, one Democrat and  one Republican, voted to override that veto.   That vote was not about gaining political favor. In fact, it was made  despite potentially losing political favor. And I have to imagine that  that vote was cast, like the decisions before it, because there are  moments that transcend party politics and that require us to put  country above our party because the consequences of not doing so are  just too great. Senators, this is one of those moments.    Many folks who are watching today's proceedings may not know this,  but House Members like me, Manager Raskin, and fellow managers, we are  not allowed on the Senate floor without express permission. No one is.  Certainly, the Senators are aware of that.   This floor is sacred. It is one of the reasons why I, like so many of  you, were so offended to see it desecrated by that mob and to see those  insurrectionists diminishing it and devaluing it and disrespecting  these hallowed Halls that my whole life I held in such awe.   Because of those rules that I just mentioned, this will be the only  time I have the privilege to stand before you like this. When the trial  is over, I will go back to being not impeachment manager but to being  just a House Member. The trial will end, and we will resume our lives  and our work.   But for some, there will be no end--no end to the pain of what  happened on January 6. The officers who struggled to recover from the  injuries they sustained to protect us, they struggle to  [[Page S728]]  recover today, and the families who continue to mourn those whom they  lost on that terrible, tragic day.   I was struck yesterday by defense counsel's continued references to  hate. One of my favorite quotes of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.--it is  one that has sustained me during times of adversity, and I suspect it  has sustained some of you:         I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a       burden to bear.    This trial is not born from hatred--far from it. It is born from a  love of country--our country--and our desire to maintain it and our  desire to see America at its best. And in those moments that I spoke  of--the Civil Rights Act and so much more--we remember those moments  because they helped define and enshrine America at its best.   I firmly believe that our certification of the electoral college  votes in the early hours of January 7, our refusal to let our Republic  be threatened and taken down by a violent mob, will go down in history  as one of those moments too. And I believe that this body can rise to  the occasion once again today by convicting President Trump and  defending our Republic.   And the stakes--the stakes--could not be higher, because the cold,  hard truth is that what happened on January 6 can happen again. I fear,  like many of you do, that the violence we saw on that terrible day may  be just the beginning. We have shown you the ongoing risks and the  extremist groups that grow more emboldened every day.   Senators, this cannot be the beginning. It can't be the new normal.  It has to be the end. That decision is in your hands.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, Senators, my daughter Hannah said  something to me last night that stopped me cold and brought me up  short. The kids have been very moved by all the victims of the  violence, the officers and their families, but Hannah told me last  night she felt really sorry for the kid of the man who said goodbye to  his children before he left home to come and join Trump's actions.  Their father had told them that their dad might not be coming home  again, and they might never see him again. In other words, he was  expecting violence and he might die, as insurrectionists did. And that  shook me.   Hannah said: How can the President put children and people's families  in that situation and then just run away from the whole thing?   That shook me, and I was filled with self-reproach because, when I  first saw the line about ``your father going to Washington and you  might not see him again,'' I just thought about it, well, like a  prosecutor, like a manager. I thought: What damning evidence that  people were expecting lethal violence at a protest called by the  President of the United States in saying their final goodbyes to their  kids. But Hannah--my dear Hannah--thought of it like a human being. She  thought of it--if you will forgive me--like a patriot, someone who just  lost her brother and doesn't want to see any other kids in America go  through that kind of agony and grief.   Senators, when I say all three of my kids are better than me, you  know that I am not engaged in idle flattering. Maybe some of you feel  the same way about your kids. They are literally better people. They  have got a lot of their mom inside of them. They are better than me.  And Hannah saw through the legality of the situation. She saw through  the politics of the situation, all the way to the humanity of the  situation and the morality of the situation. That was one of the most  patriotic things I ever heard anybody say.   The children of the insurrectionists, even the violent and dangerous  ones--they are our children too. They are Americans, and we must take  care of them and their future. We must recognize and exorcise these  crimes against our Nation, and then we must take care of our people and  our children--their hearts and their minds. As Tommy Raskin used to  say: It's hard to be human.   Many of the Capitol and Metropolitan police officers and Guards men  and women who were beaten up by the mob also have kids. You remember  Officer Fanone, who had a heart attack after being tased and roughed up  for hours by the mob, and then begging for his life telling the  insurrectionists that he had four daughters, and that just about broke  my heart all over again. We talked about this for a long time last  night. My kids felt terrible that other kids' fathers and mothers were  pulled into this nightmare by a President of the United States.   Senators, we proved to you he betrayed his country. We proved he  betrayed his Constitution. We proved he betrayed his oath of office.  The startling thing to recognize now is that he is even betraying the  mob. He told them he would march with them, and he didn't. They  believed the President was right there with them, somewhere in the  crowd, fighting the fantasy conspiracy--steal the election and steal  their country away from them. They thought they were one big team  working together. He told them their great journey together was just  beginning, and now there are hundreds of criminal prosecutors getting  going all over the country and people getting set to say goodbye to  members of their family.    And the President who contacted them, solicited them, lured him,  invited them, and incited them, that President has suddenly gone quiet  and dark, nowhere to be found. He cannot be troubled to come here to  tell us what happened and tell us why this was the patriotic and the  constitutional thing to do.   Senators, this trial, in the final analysis, is not about Donald  Trump. The country and the world know who Donald Trump is. This trial  is about who we are--who we are. My friend, Dar Williams, said that  sometimes the truth is like a second chance. We have got a chance here  with the truth.   We still believe in the separation of powers. President Trump tried  to sideline or run over every other branch of government, thwart the  will of the people at the State level, and usurp the people's choice  for President.   This case is about whether our country demands a peaceful, nonviolent  transfer of power to guarantee the sovereignty of the people. Are we  going to defend the people who defend us, not just honor them with  medals, as you rightfully did yesterday, but actually back them up  against savage, barbaric insurrectionary violence? Will we restore the  honor of our Capitol and the people who work here? Will we be a  democratic nation that the world looks to for understanding democratic  values and practices and constitutional government and the rights of  women and men? Will the Senate condone the President of the United  States inciting a violent attack on our Chambers, our offices, our  staff, and the officers who protect us?   When you see the footage of Officer Hodges stuck in the doorway,  literally being tortured by the mob--if the government did that to you,  that would be torture. And when you see that footage, and he is  shouting in agony for his dear life, it is almost unwatchable. When the  Vice President of the United States escapes a violent mob that has  entered this Capitol Building seeking to hang him and calling out  ``traitor, traitor, traitor,'' and when they shut down the counting of  the electoral college votes, is this the future you imagined for our  kids? Is it totally appropriate, as we have been told? Or as  Representative Cheney said, is it the greatest betrayal of the  Presidential oath of office in the history of our country?   And if we can't handle this together as a people--all of us-- forgetting the lines of party and ideology and geography and all of  those things, if we can't handle this, how are we ever going to conquer  the other crises of our day?   Is this America? Is this what we want to bequeath to our children and  our grandchildren?   I was never a great Sunday school student. Actually, I was pretty  truant most of the time. But one line always stuck with me from the  Book of Exodus as both beautiful and haunting, even as a kid, after I  asked what the words meant.         Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.        Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.    The officer who got called the N-word 15 times and spent hours with  his colleagues battling insurrectionists who had metal poles and  baseball bats and hockey sticks, bear spray, and Confederate battle  flags posed the right question to the Senate and to all of us:         Is this America?   [[Page S729]]     Dear Senators, it is going to be up to you, and whatever committees  and subcommittees you are on, whatever you came to Washington to do to  work on--from defense to agriculture, to energy, to aerospace, to  healthcare--this is almost certainly how you will be remembered by  history. That might not be fair. It really might not be fair, but none  of us can escape the demands of history and destiny right now. Our  reputations and our legacy will be inextricably intertwined with what  we do here and with how you exercise your oath to do impartial  justice--impartial justice.   I know and I trust you will do impartial justice, driven by your  meticulous attention to the overwhelming facts of the case and your  love for our Constitution, which I know dwells in your hearts.   ``The times have found us,'' said Tom Paine, the namesake of my son.  ``The times have found us.'' Is this America? What kind of America will  we be? It's now literally in your hands. Godspeed to the Senate of the  United States.   We reserve any remaining time.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House has reserved 28 minutes.
