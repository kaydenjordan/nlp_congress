 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the migrants and  asylum-seekers who have been sheltered by Jewish Family Service of San  Diego.   On October 1, 2018, Jewish Family Service, along with other members  of the San Diego Rapid Response Network, heeded an important call.  These organizations were alerted that, due to a drastic change in  policy, women and children were being left on the side of the road.  They were released with nowhere to go and no resources to get to their  final destination.   These nonprofits decided that they would not stand idly by and would  assist these deserted families. Despite all the obstacles the  organizations faced, they dedicated themselves to welcoming the  stranger.   Jewish Family Service Shelter is now in its seventh location, where  it has served 21,000 individuals. The shelters have provided a safe and  welcoming place to sleep, fresh new clothes, warm meals, and travel  assistance.   I have had the opportunity to tour some of the facilities and believe  they follow the teaching of Leviticus 19: ``You shall treat the alien  who resides with you no differently than the natives born among you. .  . .''   I thank Jewish Family Service and the organizations of the San Diego  Rapid Response Network for their efforts.                            ____________________
