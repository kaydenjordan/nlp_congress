 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  country music legend, Mickey Gilley. Mickey Gilley passed away  Saturday, May 7, in Branson at the age of 86.   Born on March 9, 1936, Mickey was a native of Natchez, Mississippi,  where he grew up around his two famous cousins, Jerry Lee Lewis and  Jimmy Swaggart.   In his career, Mickey earned 39 top 10 hits and 17 number-one songs,  with six Academy of Country Music Awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk  of Fame, and was a member of the 2011 Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.  Gilley was also one of few artists to have received the Academy of  Country Music's Triple Crown Award.   But it was the opening of a country dance club bearing his name that  changed the world of country music  [[Page H4913]]  forever. It was 1971 when Mickey Gilley officially opened the doors of  his famous honky-tonk, Gilley's.   Gilley's reputation grew so much that Hollywood even took notice with  the hit movie, ``Urban Cowboy''--some of y'all have probably seen it-- where he even made an appearance alongside John Travolta, Debra Winger,  and Johnny Lee.   Inspired by the real-life romance of a pair of the club's patrons,  ``Urban Cowboy'' put Gilley's on the map, revived music careers,  launched other careers, introduced two-stepping to a whole new  audience, and created a lifestyle that has been adopted by millions.                                time  1815    Following his role in ``Urban Cowboy,'' Mickey Gilley found himself  performing in the main showrooms in places like Las Vegas, Reno, Tahoe,  Atlantic City, and even traveling to Europe to perform. Gilley even  performed for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Over the  decades, Gilley appeared in a number of popular television series,  including ``The Fall Guy,'' ``Fantasy Island,'' ``Dukes of Hazzard,''  ``Murder, She Wrote,'' and ``CHiPS.''   Not only will Mickey Gilley's music live on in the hearts of so many  who loved his music, but his cultural influence cannot be understated.  ``Urban Cowboy'' became an American phenomenon, and it was influenced  by the real-life stories of Gilley's patrons Dew Westbrook and Betty  Helmer. ``Urban Cowboy'' told the story of a west Texas farmhand new to  the area and working his job at a refinery.   This film introduced country-western dance to America and created a  lifestyle adopted by millions. Even more surprisingly, it directly  resulted in the most unlikely outcome of all, country-western music  becoming mainstream. Once considered outdated hillbilly attire, cowboy  hats and belt buckles were back in, and they became high fashion.   Recently, on Saturday, July 29, Mickey Gilley came to the Galveston  Regional Chamber of Commerce's celebration: ``The 50th Anniversary of  Gilley's and the 42nd Anniversary of Urban Cowboy.'' It was a great  celebration with thousands, and Mickey sang for us, delighting the  crowd. We even presented him with a copy of a tribute I did to him on  the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives and a plaque  commemorating the event.   Mickey Gilley will be missed, but his legacy will live on not only in  the hearts and minds of those who loved his music, but also in  America's love for country music. Wrangler jeans, cowboy boots, and  pickup trucks will all be remembered because of him. Mickey Gilley has  even been featured in the popular ``Texas Hot Country Magazine.''   Gilley was preceded in death by his wife, Vivian, who passed in 2019.  He is survived by his wife, Cindy Loeb Gilley; his children, Kathy,  Michael, Gregory, and Keith Ray; four grandchildren; nine great- grandchildren; and his cousins Jerry Lee Lewis and Jimmy Swaggart.   Thank you, Mickey Gilley, for introducing our way of life to the  world. You will forever be a legend.                        Mourning the Loss of Ken Clark     Madam Speaker, I have one more notable who has  passed in our great district, so will also commemorate him.   I rise today to mourn the loss of our great Galveston County Precinct  4 Commissioner, Ken Clark. He was Galveston County's longest-serving  elected official. Ken had become a commissioner in 1998, and he has  been an active member of our community for even longer.   Ken has been an instrumental community leader for several decades and  a dedicated public servant. In his time, he has served on the State  Republican Executive Committee, he has served as Sergeant at Arms of  the Republican Party of Texas, he has served as Galveston's Municipal  Utility District president, and received the Republican Party's  Volunteer of the Year award. Ken also worked extensively with a wide  variety of community organizations and tirelessly worked to improve the  lives of those who lived in Galveston County.   I first met Ken when he worked on former Congressman Steve Stockman's  campaign. Ken was a go-getter, a great conservative, and a great  Republican back then and even more so now. Ken was a devoted public  servant, a husband, a father, and a mentor. He loved Jesus Christ, and  it showed.   Commissioner Clark, you will be sorely missed, but we will see you  again. In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers are with you and your  wonderful wife, Sherry, and y'all's seven children.
