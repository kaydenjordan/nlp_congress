 Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 823, a bill that creates  land restrictions for approximately 400,000 acres of land in Colorado  in the form of new wilderness, permanent mineral withdrawals, as well  as recreation and conservation areas.   While the goals of the public lands legislation in this bill are  certainly admirable and well-intended, and I have great respect for the  bill's sponsor, my friend and fellow Coloradan, Congressman Neguse, it  is clear that this proposal lacks the type of local consensus required  for a bill of this scale.   I am proud to call Colorado home, and I am honored to represent the  Fifth District of Colorado. I truly believe our State is the most  beautiful in the Union, and myself and the bill's sponsor and other  Representatives from Colorado that you will hear from during our debate  would agree with me on that. We love our State, and we are very proud  of it.    As is the case for most Western States, Colorado has a large amount  of public lands, with roughly one-third of the State under Federal  management. These rich and diverse public lands provide countless  outdoor recreation opportunities, habitat for wildlife, and significant  economic benefits for our rural communities and our State as a whole.   Because of these diverse uses of our public lands, it is vital that  the land management decisions we make find balance and common ground. I  regret to say today that this bill before us falls short on both  counts.   To put the enormity of this bill into perspective, Madam Chairman,  this bill affects a total acreage that is nine times the size of  Washington, D.C. A bill of this magnitude should not be forced through  along partisan party lines, yet that is what we are facing today.   Public lands decisions should be made with local collaboration and  input. They have real consequences for communities on the ground who  live near these public lands.   It is troubling to note that 65 percent of the lands affected by the  bill before us are located in Congressman Tipton's district. Not only  was Mr. Tipton not meaningfully consulted on this legislation, but he  was not even made aware of it until the day that it was publicly  announced.   It is not against the law to write bills affecting other people's  districts, but I think that consensus and collaboration require that  they should be brought into the loop and be part of the process.   Subsequent efforts to engage on this legislation and find compromise  have been largely ignored. That lack of engagement sadly continues  today.                                time  1815    Mr. Tipton, for instance, offered 10 good faith amendments that  raised specific concerns that his constituents have brought to him  concerning this bill. Only three of these were made in order by the  Democrat-controlled Rules Committee.   Substantial stakeholder concerns about this bill have been raised by  impacted counties, recreation groups, forestry health advocates, as  well as the relevant Federal agencies.   One particularly worrying concern has been raised by the National  Guard Bureau--not the State, but the national National Guard Bureau-- about this bill's impact on the Colorado Army National Guard's High  Altitude Aviation Training Site, or HAATS, that has yet to be resolved.   Proposed wilderness expansions in Colorado around the Colorado Army  National Guard's HAATS, or High Altitude Aviation Training Site, are  creating concerns about the future of the site's ability to ensure  military readiness for the men and women who may be deployed to combat  zones in the Middle East.   This HAATS site is a treasure. It is the only place in the country  where high-altitude rotary-wing aircraft can get the training in real- life conditions that they will encounter overseas in places like  Afghanistan or training for search and rescue in mountainous areas  around the country or around the world.   So this is a treasure. It is a unique site that must be protected.  And it is a collection of sites. It is not just one landing zone. It is  a multitude of landing zones.   While the sponsors of the CORE Act have indicated that their goal is  to protect HAATS, the only way to provide certainty for HAATS is to  codify the existing Department of Defense guidance for aircraft flying  over Colorado wilderness areas.   As with any compromise, balance is key. There is no room for winner- take-all mentalities if you want to achieve lasting public land  management agreements. This bill, unfortunately, has chosen a winner- take-all path that may deliver some great press releases momentarily  but will ultimately fall short of becoming law. I believe this bill  will not be supported in the other body and is certainly not supported  by the administration.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I do agree with my colleague from Denver that the  outdoor recreation industry in Colorado is a thriving and vital part of  our State's economy. We have such good material, such a good  environment to work with that it is no wonder.   I would have to point out that, fortunately, the lands that are under  consideration in this bill already have one form of protection or  another due to being wilderness study areas or other types of Federal  lands. The development that was being mentioned--one football field  every 30 seconds--doesn't apply to these lands. These lands are not in  that category.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado.    Madam Chair, reclaiming my time, I understand where the  gentlewoman is coming from.   Without getting into the philosophical area for time constraints over  restricting lands that very few people can enter into as opposed to  having lands as open as possible for as many people and many uses as  possible, which I think is a balance we have to strike--there has got  to be a place for both--I think we need to keep our discussion for the  next part of our debate on the local collaboration, or lack thereof.   Madam Chair, for that reason, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H8650]]    Madam Chair, I would point out that Mr. Tipton offered 10 amendments  in the Rules Committee, only three of which were adopted. There were  seven amendments right there that were not even brought to the floor  for debate. I think that that is unfortunate.   Madam Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McClintock) who is the ranking member on the Subcommittee on  Water, Oceans, and Wildlife on the Natural Resources Committee.                                time  1845     Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), who has a master's degree in forestry from  Yale University.    Madam Chair, I yield the gentleman from Arkansas an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Chair, I am ready to close, if that is where the  gentleman from Colorado stands, also.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, let me say that I am informed that Garfield and Montrose  Counties, although they are comfortable with certain portions of the  bill, are not willing to endorse the bill as a whole.   Also, I want to say that Colorado Springs Utilities in my district,  representing about half a million people, and the Aurora Water District  have raised concerns that the Camp Hale National Historic Landscape  designation will negatively impact their existing and future water  rights. These concerns have gone unaddressed.   I finish by stating what the administration, the Office of Management  and Budget, says about this bill, which means, basically, that they  have concerns that, if not addressed, will result in a veto of this  bill, and it will not become law.   ``The administration opposes H.R. 823, the Colorado Outdoor  Recreation and Economy Act. This bill would impose land restrictions on  nearly 400,000 acres of land in Colorado and would reduce areas open  for motorized recreation. The administration has pledged to expand  access to America's public lands; increase hunting, fishing, and  recreational opportunities nationwide; and enhance conservation  stewardship. H.R. 823, however, would not achieve these goals in a  balanced way, and the administration opposes it as it is currently  drafted.''   It goes on to say, among other things, ``Rural communities have  raised concerns that the land-use restrictions included in H.R. 823  would have negative effects on local economies, and, as evidenced by  the committee process, it appears that local sentiment has not been  adequately taken into account when developing this bill. The  administration, therefore, opposes H.R. 823 in its current form, but it  is willing to work with the Congress to improve it if the bill is  considered further.''   So if it were presented to the President in its current form, his  advisers would recommend he veto it.   I also have the understanding that the Senate will not take up this  bill either.   Maybe it is an interesting exercise that we are doing here, but it is  not  [[Page H8652]]  anything that is going to result in a law.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and let's move  on from here. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I will agree there is a good amendment here  that we can all support.   The underlying bill designated 28,000-some-odd acres surrounding Camp  Hale as the first-ever National Historic Landscape.   Now, Camp Hale was a U.S. Army training facility for what became the  10th Mountain Division, and it was established in 1942 in Colorado to  provide winter and mountain warfare training during World War II. It  was also used during the Cold War as well.   This amendment would add veteran outreach and engagement activities  to the proposed management plan. It is a good amendment. It would  rightfully prioritize outreach and involvement of our Nation's  veterans, so I would agree with the amendment and ask that my  colleagues vote ``yes'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
