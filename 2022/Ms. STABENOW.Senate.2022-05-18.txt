 Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I remember being a new mom and then a  new grandma, and all you want to do is hold your baby close and savor  every single moment. Instead, parents across the country right now are  in a panic--forced to search high and low to find baby formula, the  safe baby formula that they need, any safe baby formula.   Almost half of all of our babies born in the United States receive  their baby formula through a really important program called WIC--the  Women, Infants, and Children program--that we are so proud of, and it  is something that has made sure that safe baby formula and healthy food  is available for pregnant moms and for babies throughout the first  years of a baby's life. So, as all of this has happened now with this  emergency--and it is a huge emergency, a huge crisis--there are no  options here when children--you know, when babies need to eat. When  babies are born, they need safe baby formula.   This has been an ``all hands on deck'' moment for all of us. That is  why, as chair of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry  Committee--and I am so proud the Presiding Officer is a member of our  committee, is a very valued member of our committee--I am joined with  our ranking member, John Boozman, to introduce legislation today to  make sure that the USDA can be as flexible as possible in getting our  moms and dads and, most importantly, babies the critical baby formula  that they need right now.   We are doing this in conjunction with the House, which also has  bipartisan legislation. It is my understanding that they will be voting  on that soon, and I am hopeful that we can do the same thing. This  should be something that brings us all together as quickly as possible.   As an example, the reason we need the bill dealing with WIC--and  there is a lot and so much positive that comes from this program. But  right now, we make sure that there are safety standards, high-quality  safety standards, and that we negotiate, through a competitive process,  the best price for moms and babies, but we now need to have flexibility  so when a family--for instance, maybe, in Traverse City, MI, or in  Lansing or in Detroit--goes to a grocery store and there is only one  brand on the shelf and it is not the brand under the WIC contract, that  they can buy it. If that is the only thing available, they need to be  able to use their WIC support to be able to purchase that.   That is something that our USDA Secretary has jumped into gear to be  able to make that happen, but we have got to make sure that that can  continue, or we have got to make sure if a parent, again, goes to the  store and there are different sizes of formula cans or different  prescriptions that normally would not fit under the WIC contract, that  they can waive those because we have to be able to get whatever is safe  baby formula to families as quickly as possible.   These may sound like small things, but they are the difference right  now between whether or not our families on WIC are able to actually get  the formula that they need.   In order to make sure that that continues, we have introduced  legislation that will guarantee that the flexibilities the USDA needs  will continue beyond the public health pandemic flexibilities that they  are currently operating under. They have short-term flexibilities  because of the public health pandemic. We want to make sure this is  permanent and that whether it is a recall, a safety recall, a supply  chain breakdown--whatever it is--that, with all hands on deck, the USDA  has the capacity--the authority, the tools--to be able to move forward  and make sure that they can respond as quickly as possible.   We also want to guarantee that formula manufacturers that want to  compete for these WIC contracts have a plan in place to respond to any  kind of shortage so we don't have this situation happen again. There is  just no excuse, frankly, for what happened here.   I want to thank Secretary Vilsack and the USDA for moving quickly  once they were notified about the Abbott plant shutdown.   I am deeply concerned that they were not given a heads-up earlier.  The FDA was working for months, evidently--for a few months--with  Abbott around concerns as it related to the safety standards and so on  at the plant, and the USDA needed to know sooner so that they could  prepare sooner. They understand how serious this is, what an emergency  it is. So, when they found out, they went immediately into gear to make  sure that our moms and babies, if at all possible, in any way possible,  could get what they need. That has to be a top priority, not just for  the moms and babies on WIC; all moms, all parents, all babies need to  make sure that it is an ``all hands on deck'' and that we are moving as  fast as possible.   That is why I also want to thank President Biden and the FDA for  working with other baby formula manufacturers to increase supplies.   Supplies are going up. I am very anxious to see more manufacturers of  baby formula. I think we, as in every area, it seems, of our economy,  have too much consolidation--that is certainly true here--and we need  more competition, and we need more baby formula manufacturers competing  for our contracts. We need to have a contract that gives the best price  to WIC's moms and dads and babies, but we need to make sure that we  have as many large and small companies that are competing for that to  be able to make sure that we have the formula available and that we are  getting the very best price.   I also want to thank them for carefully and thoughtfully opening up  imports from the European Union. We certainly have other countries that  have the same very high safety standards that we do. We have got to  make sure that anything that comes in is of the very highest safety  standard.   We know that, right now, we have got to make sure that baby formula  is on the shelf. Children--babies--need this every day, not ``let's  wait a month or 2 months.'' This is like today that this needs to be  happening. Again, there needs to be a sense of urgency to do whatever  we can related to this issue and look at all aspects of it to make sure  that this does not happen again, if at all possible. This should not be  happening again.   Within our WIC bill, we are focused on what we can do to support the  USDA to have the maximum flexibilities to support moms and babies and  on what we can do to make sure the manufacturers are prepared if  something  [[Page S2591]]  like this were to happen--some shortage--down the road. We need to make  sure that we are looking at every aspect of this and acting now, as  fast as possible, and then preparing for the future.   I want to thank, again, Senator Boozman and welcome all of our  Members on both sides of the aisle to join us in what, I hope, will be  legislation that moves very, very quickly.   The Access to Baby Formula Act is something that every single Member  of the U.S. Senate should be supporting so that we can move this  legislation out as quickly as possible, working with the House, and  getting this done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I remember being a new mom and then a  new grandma, and all you want to do is hold your baby close and savor  every single moment.
