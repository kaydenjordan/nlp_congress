 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support  for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's pick to replace Justice  Scalia on the Supreme Court. On Monday, his nomination passed out of  the Senate Judiciary Committee, and we expect to confirm him before the  end of the week. I am tremendously excited to have him on the bench.  Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has proven time and again that he  is exceptionally qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. He has been  praised and endorsed by members on both sides of the political  spectrum, the left and the right.   As a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006, after  being unanimously confirmed by this body, Judge Gorsuch has proven he  is as mainstream as they come. In fact, of the 800-plus opinions that  he has written for the Tenth Circuit, less than 2 percent, or 14  opinions, have drawn dissents from his colleagues. In other words, 98  percent of his opinions have been unanimous. That is even more  remarkable when you look at the makeup of the Tenth Circuit--12 of the  judges were appointed by Democratic Presidents, while only 5 were  appointed by Republicans. It does not get much more mainstream than  that.   During his confirmation hearings last month, Judge Gorsuch again  proved that he is eminently qualified to serve on the bench of our  Nation's highest Court. Let me share some of his quotes from his  hearing:   ``The Constitution doesn't change. The world around us changes.''   ``I don't believe in litmus tests for judges.''   ``If I'm confirmed, I will do all my powers permit, to be a faithful  servant to the Constitution and laws of this great nation.''   One last quote:         As a judge now for more than a decade, I've watched my       colleagues spend long days worrying over cases. Sometimes the       answers we reach aren't the ones we personally prefer.       Sometimes the answers follow us home at night and keep us up.       But the answers we reach are always the ones we believe the       law requires. And for all its imperfections, I believe that       the rule of law in this nation truly is a wonder. And that       it's no wonder that it's the envy of the world.    It is clear that Judge Gorsuch is qualified to serve on the Supreme  Court and that he understands the role of a judge: to interpret the  law, not to make the law.   To that end, I would also like to highlight Judge Gorsuch's in-depth  understanding of the separation of powers doctrine, and I am optimistic  that Judge Gorsuch will carefully scrutinize cases and controversies  that involve executive overreach.   The past 8 years have seen an unprecedented expansion of the  administrative state. This has come at the expense of both the  legislative branch, whose purpose is to make laws, and the judicial  branch, whose purpose is to interpret the law and decide on a specific  law's constitutionality. But more concerning than that, it has also  come at the expense of American citizens.   Overreach by executive agencies has led to regulatory expansion that  results in the Federal Government involving itself in nearly every  facet of our lives on a daily basis. This expansion has been permitted,  in part, to U.S. courts relying on the flawed Chevron doctrine to show  great deference to agency interpretation of the laws passed by  Congress. As a result, agencies have been able to broadly interpret  laws in a way that has allowed them to expand their regulatory  authority far beyond what Congress ever intended.   Fortunately, U.S. judges are beginning to question the Chevron  doctrine and its impact on the separation of powers doctrine relied on  by our Founding Fathers and affirmed in the U.S. Constitution. Judge  Gorsuch is one of those judges. Regarding Chevron, Judge Gorsuch has  written that Chevron seems to be no less than a judge-made doctrine for  the abdication of the judicial duty that prevents American courts from  fulfilling their constitutionally delegated duty--interpreting what the  law actually intends.   Careful judicial scrutiny and interpretation of the law will allow  courts to rein in agency actions that are inconsistent with the law and  beyond the bounds of what Congress intended.   In his concurrence in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, Gorsuch argues  that the Administrative Procedure Act vests in the courts the  responsibility to ``interpret statutory provisions and overturn agency  action inconsistent with those provisions'' and questions the idea that  Congress ``intended to delegate away its legislative power to executive  agencies.''   Judge Gorsuch takes his duty as a judge with the utmost seriousness.  He seeks to interpret the law the way Congress intended, not in the way  an executive agency wants it to be.   His careful and academic approach to judicial review is well-suited  for our Nation's highest Court. I am confident that Judge Gorsuch will  respect and enforce the constitutionally affirmed separation of powers  doctrine that in recent years has been diluted by executive agencies  broadly interpreting laws, resulting in regulatory overreach. This has  minimized the role of Congress in the legislative process. As a result,  the voices of American citizens have also been minimized and replaced  with unelected Washington bureaucrats who think they know what is best  for all Americans.   Judge Gorsuch is one of the finest judges our Nation has to offer.  The knowledge and careful deliberation he will bring to the Court will  result in rulings that reflect justice, fairness, and an interpretation  of what the law is and what Congress intended it to be, not what  administrative agencies want it to be.   Despite impeccable credentials, we are in a situation today because  of a precedent set in November 2013 by then-Majority Leader Harry Reid  and his conference. Former Leader Reid's use of a so-called nuclear  option in 2013 meant the Senate could reinterpret its rules via simple- majority vote. Former  [[Page S2317]]  Leader Reid accomplished this by challenging a ruling of the Chair with  regard to the number of votes needed to end debate on certain  nominations.   The Standing Rules of the Senate require the support of a  supermajority, or 67 percent of Senators, to change the rules. To  challenge the ruling of the Chair, Reid only needed a majority vote to  overturn the Presiding Officer's correct interpretation of the written  rule. In other words, Former Leader Reid broke the rules to change the  rules and, by default, broke precedent to change the precedent moving  forward as well.   Based on this new precedent set by Former Leader Reid, the Senate is  likely to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court by a simple- majority vote. Because the Senate has always operated on precedent, we  will likely follow this new precedent to approve Judge Gorsuch's  nomination later this week.   When he is confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will make a tremendous addition  to the Supreme Court. His lifetime of defending the Constitution and  applying the law as it was written provides clear evidence that he has  the aptitude for this lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest  Court.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
