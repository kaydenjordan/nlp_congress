 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of the  Fifth District who are tired of the Democrats focusing on political  games.   This past weekend, at an American Legion dinner, I was handed this  note: Pass USMCA.   Folks at home want Congress to act on jobs, the economy, and lower  healthcare costs; but what they are hearing from the Democrats in the  House: secret proceedings that deny access to House Members who do not  serve on the respective committees; no press access; no ability to  defend oneself by bringing witnesses, taking depositions, or having  one's attorney present; and being accused by an unknown witness who  claims secondhand knowledge.   Where is the pride that we have in our sense of justice? Where is due  process? Where are the rules? Where are the American values of fair  play? Where is the evidence? Where is the House vote?   Read the unclassified transcript. The Democrats created a Star  Chamber. This is a bold attempt to overturn the 2016 election. It is  time to shine a bright light on what is going on.                            ____________________
