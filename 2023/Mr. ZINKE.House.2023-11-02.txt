 Madam Chairman, the gentlewoman from Maine may have  mentioned that this affects all monuments. In fact, it does not.   As a former Secretary, monuments are under the Antiquities Act, and  there are about 163, as I recall. This only pertains to monuments that  commemorate the Founding Fathers of the United States on land under the  jurisdiction of the Department. I don't recall how many monuments are  to the Founding Fathers, but there are not many. I don't recall any  being a safety issue.   As a matter of fact, I recall all of them being a part of our history  and an important part of our history for all to learn. This does not  affect all monuments or the safety. What it affects is the very essence  of the country, and I support this amendment.
