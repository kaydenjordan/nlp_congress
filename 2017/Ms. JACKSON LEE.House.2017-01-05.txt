 Section 2:   ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen  every second year by the people of the several States, and the electors  in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of  the most numerous branch of the State legislature.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule  and the underlying bill.   I oppose this rule because it makes in order H.R. 26, the Regulations  from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, which is a radical  measure that could make it impossible to promulgate safety regulations  to protect the public.   I oppose this rule because it would effectively shut down the entire  U.S. regulatory system, amending in one fell swoop every bedrock  existing regulatory statute.   The legislation is clearly designed to stop all regulation dead in  its tracks--no matter the threat to health, safety or the economy.   It would neuter the current system's reliance on science, expertise,  and public participation in developing regulations.   H.R. 26 would reshape the regulatory system to work as it did in the  19th Century, before the abuses of the robber barons led Congress to  create a modern and more efficient system to protect public health and  safety.   The REINS Act would require both houses of Congress to approve any  major rule within a limited period of time in order for it to take  effect.   Effectively, this would allow either house of Congress to block rules  simply through inaction, even when an existing statute required action.   The legislation would disempower every federal agency, effectively  rendering their rulemaking activities advisory opinions with no force  of law.   Under REINS, even rules to handle emergencies could be in effect for  only 90 days absent Congressional approval.   H.R. 26 is so grossly slanted against regulation that it will allow  lawsuits to proceed against any regulation Congress could actually  manage to approve.   And the latest version of the bill delays its effective date for a  year so that any Trump Administration efforts to repeal existing  regulations would not get caught up in the REINS Act trap--another  indication that the REINS Act would be expected to stop any regulatory  action from moving forward (because repealing regulations must be done  through regulation, so repeals would in fact trigger REINS.)   In addition to representing an overwhelming threat to the public,  H.R. 26 is also bad for business.   The legislation would require businesses to have to lobby Congress  for each and every significant regulatory change they wanted--no matter  whether those were new regulations, changes in regulation or repeal; no  matter whether the regulatory issues involved disputes between  different industries; no matter how technical the issues involved.   H.R. 26 would, in fact, make the regulatory system less predictable  for industry and would disadvantage any industry that did not have a  large political presence.   It is difficult to exaggerate how fundamentally this alarming piece  of legislation would change American government and how hard it would  make it to protect the public.   This legislative effort is the ultimate giveaway to special  interests.   Under H.R. 26, any special interest could simply use its political  clout in one chamber of Congress to sideline such vital public  protections as limiting the amount of lead in children's products,  preventing salmonella contamination in eggs, reducing emissions of  toxic air pollutants or banning predatory banking practices.   The REINS Act constitutes the ultimate overreach as well, not only  because of the impact it would have, but because Congress already has  ample tools to control the regulatory system.   Congress is already vested with the authority to vote to block a  specific regulation at any time.   And regulation is permitted only pursuant to statutes that Congress  has passed and can amend or repeal.   Under current law, agencies must keep a record of their interactions  with industry and other entities interested in the regulatory process  and provide a clear record of their decision-making (which often must  be able to hold up in court).   Because agencies often take years to review the scientific and  technical evidence relevant to a decision, throwing every final  decision to Congress would undermine this entire process.   In addition, courts can review regulations and an elaborate public  process that can stretch out for years must be followed to issue a  regulation.   Instead, under this legislation, Congress would have to make  relatively rapid decisions, often behind closed doors, and it would not  be legally held to any standard of technical review.   Businesses would no longer have an incentive to cooperate with  agencies and provide  [[Page H122]]  arguments and evidence because they could just take their chances with  the political process, which they would no doubt try to influence with  campaign contributions.   Ultimately, decisions on regulations would be determined solely by  political horse-trading among Members of Congress.   Agencies issue 50 to 100 major rules a year dealing with everything  from Medicare reimbursement to railroad safety to environmental  protection.   But, under H.R. 26, Congress would have 70 legislative days to  second-guess each and every decision covered by the Act.   Because failure to take action would kill any safeguard, Congress  would be forced to hold hearings in a short time on technical issues-- or worse, forgo hearings and race the 70-day clock with even less  information and debate.   This body has already allowed backlog to clog the channels of its  current docket, and this legislation would require that as many as 100  additional measures come to the floor.   This is not an effort to drain the swamp; this is a divisive and  manipulative tactic employed to clog the drain.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it, this merry-go-round  legislative scheme and the irresponsibility of the House majority in  wasting time trying to shut down the entire regulatory system (because  it cannot win through time-honored, Constitutional legislative  processes) entirely disregard the administrative public support efforts  in place to protect food safety, air and water quality and to limit the  manipulation of our economic system by special interests.   The REINS Act is tantamount to a coup--a right-wing takeover to block  future agency actions regardless of public desires.   The exceptional Americans we serve deserve a Congress that does its  job and keeps our time-honored institutions functioning.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this rule and the underlying  bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 22 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution       the House shall proceed to the consideration, without       intervention of any point of order, in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 23) expressing the sense of the House of       Representatives and reaffirming long-standing United States       policy in support of a negotiated two-state solution to the       Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the resolution and preamble to adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question       except one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Foreign Affairs.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Resolution 23.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, today, in the Senate, the other body,  unfortunately, joined the pathway of destruction for most Americans and  voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. These are not my words, the  pathway of destruction, but is evidence what will happen to millions  and millions of Americans. By repealing without a replacement, which  does not exist, insurance will be taken away from 32 million working  families. Now, some 4 million uninsured children will have no  insurance.   Let me be very clear that many of these individuals do not have  college degrees. Many of them, the voters of those who now will take  the rein of government. Healthcare premiums will increase by 50 percent  for millions of Americans. Hundreds of billions of dollars will go to  tax breaks for insurance companies while eliminating the tax credits  and subsidies for millions of working families.   It will take healthcare coverage away from millions of low- and  moderate-income Americans by cutting Medicaid, and it will close rural  hospitals and public hospitals that provide the lifeline for many  Americans. It will cut off Federal funds for health care for women  through Planned Parenthood. And yes, it will eliminate and have cuts in  Medicare and Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, this is a pathway of disaster. We should not repeal the  Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________
