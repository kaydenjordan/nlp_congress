 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to discuss President  Biden's nominee to serve as one of our Nation's chief banking  regulators.   About a month ago, President Biden announced his intention to  nominate Cornell University Law Professor Saule Omarova to serve as  Comptroller of the Currency.   I was on the floor recently, and I spoke about her nomination. And I  noted at the time that she has been celebrated on the far left for  promoting ideas that she herself has described as ``radical.'' It is  one of the few things on which I agree with her. These are radical  ideas. In fact, they are very radical ideas.   And most disturbing about this is they demonstrate--these ideas of  hers--a very clear aversion to America's free enterprise system at a  very fundamental level, despite the fact that our free enterprise  system has produced an incredible level of prosperity and standard of  living.   I have to say, I don't think I have ever seen a more radical choice  for any regulatory spot in our Federal Government that I can think of  than Professor Omarova. And let me be clear. That assessment is based  on the things that Professor Omarova has written and said in her own  words, often quite recently.   So today I want to focus on just one of the radical ideas that she  presented in great detail in a paper that she wrote in 2016--not  exactly ancient history. This is her plan to have the Federal  Government set wages and prices for large sectors of the U.S. economy;  in fact, the most important goods and services in our economy.   Under her plan, the Federal Government would designate--and these are  her words--``systemically important prices and indexes'' or ``SIPIs.''  She creates an acronym for these things; she calls them SIPIs--for the  Federal Reserve to regulate.   So she details five different approaches, different ways, that the  government could regulate and take control over these prices of these  systemically important goods. And they are all--it is all a terrible  idea based on the completely erroneous premise that somehow the  government knows what the price of these things should be.   But among all of them, one that is maybe the most troubling is one  that she describes here. And this is what Professor Omarova argued. She  says: ``The . . . final regulatory option we think worth considering is  . . . price maintenance--typically within some band--through OMOs.''   Now, OMO stands for open market operations, and that is an operation  that the Federal Reserve engages in. But the Fed uses open market  operations--or OMOs, in Professor Omarova's lexicon--to just buy and  sell securities for one purpose, and that is to manage the amount of  money in the supply--in the economy, to manage monetary policy, to do  it by managing the supply of money. That is it.   What Professor Omarova is advocating for is a radical departure from  this very, very narrow and limited activity. What her plan would do is  to empower the Fed--and these are her  [[Page S7113]]  words--``to buy and sell in markets . . . with a view to keeping  particular [systemically important prices] within particular bands  thought necessary for the purposes of maintaining systemic stability.''   Wow. Now, what kind of prices does Professor Omarova have in mind for  the Fed to control by buying and selling these commodities? Well, she  tells us. She says:         Various candidate SIPIs here come to mind. . . . Certain       sensitive commodity prices--those for widely used fuels,       foodstuffs, and some other raw materials, for example--      constitute another class of candidates. Finally, wage or       salary indices constitute yet another class of candidates.    Now, here are some of the other candidates for price controls that  she has in mind: ``home prices,'' ``productive inputs'' such as  ``energy,'' ``certain . . . metals, and other natural resources.''   In other words, like all the most important commodities in America,  under Professor Omarova's radical plan, it would be the government that  would set these prices rather than a free market determining how these  prices should be set. The government would control everything from the  size of your paycheck to the amount you pay at the grocery store for a  gallon of milk or a gallon of gasoline.   There is no more allocation of scarce goods based on who values them  the most--the brilliance of the way that a spontaneous market allocates  resources automatically to their best and highest use and enables us to  have the lowest possible cost for the most possible goods. None of  that. No more.   We will have a committee--it is called the Fed Open Market  Committee--and they will dictate the prices that we will pay and how  the resources of America will be allocated.   Now, if her radical idea sounds familiar, that is because it is  familiar. It has been tried--been tried several times--repeatedly, and  every single time it has failed spectacularly, time and again, in all  the centrally planned economies in the world, especially the Soviet  Union.   In fact, Soviet efforts to control prices in their economy were so  abysmal, they failed so badly that they spawned countless jokes within  the Soviet Union that illustrate the folly of central planning, the  inherent impossibility of central planning.   One of my favorites is about a guy who walks into a store. He walks  up to the shopkeeper and says: You don't have any meat, do you?   And the shopkeeper replies: No, we don't have any fish. It is the  store next door that doesn't have any meat.   So we can laugh about these things that people living under the  misery of the Soviet Union, they had a sort of gallows humor about the  misery of their circumstances.   But the fact is, it was this notion that a really smart committee at  the center of the government could dictate the prices and the  allocation of all resources; that idea is what caused the misery-- ultimately, of course, caused the collapse of the Soviet Union.   This is what happens anywhere where governments try to control what  should be left to the free men and women in terms of allocating  resources. Government-run economies, like the very one that Professor  Omarova is proposing--they don't work.   And let me stress a point that I have made before about Professor  Omarova. The fact that she was born and raised in the Soviet Union has  absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the Senate should confirm  her to run a major financial agency.   There are some unbelievably wonderful, successful, patriotic,  terrific American citizens who had the misfortune of growing up behind  the Iron Curtain. That has nothing to do with whether or not she is  qualified for this job. It is her advocacy for the policies that, in  disturbing ways, resemble those of the Soviet Union--that is what  should inform our judgment about whether this person should be the  chief regulator of the Nation's federally chartered banks.   Now, Professor Omarova would likely argue that her centrally planned  economy would be different. That is always the case. This time we will  get socialism right. As her paper notes, the Fed does already use open  market operations to implement monetary policy. That is true. So why  not let the Fed use a similar mechanism to set and maintain stable  prices for all kinds of important assets?   Well, the answer is simple: Making decisions about what individual-- maybe dozens, maybe hundreds of individual assets across something as  complex as our entire economy, what they should cost, how they should  be allocated, that is an impossibly complex endeavor. There is no  technocrat, no bureau, no committee, no agency--there is no entity that  can figure that out.   It is the organic decisions, individual decisions, of millions of  free people that spontaneously create the allocation that maximizes the  well-being of the people of a free society.   By the way, there is a pretty strong case to be made that the  government doesn't do such a great job on monetary policy either.  People that we have serious doubts about how well they set the price of  a single thing--namely, the U.S. dollar--do we want them directly  controlling the prices of everything or at least everything that is  important? I think not.   So the more I read the radical ideas that Professor Omarova has  advocated for and the more I think about the damage this would do to  our economy and our society, the more troubled I am by her nomination.  So I strongly urge President Biden to reconsider his nomination, his  decision to nominate her.
