 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill.   Today, in my community and across our country, far too many Americans  lack adequate access to fair housing, quality healthcare, and simple  legal services, and too many of those Americans are veterans.   Today, women continue to take on new roles and responsibilities in  every branch of our armed services. According to Iraq and Afghanistan  Veterans of America, more than 345,000 women have deployed since 9/11.   When these women return home, they face different challenges than  their male counterparts, and they are disproportionately affected by  crises that affect veterans of both genders, like homelessness, with  women veterans making up the fastest growing portion of the homeless  vet population.    Last week, I had the privilege of speaking with women veterans in my  district about these issues and other issues, and I heard how critical  these problems are for them.    That is why I am so proud to have introduced the Improving  Legal Services for Female Veterans Act, which is included in the  Deborah Sampson Act.   The very least that our men and women in uniform should be able to  expect once they come home is that they won't have to fight for basic  dignity, support, and opportunity after they put their lives on the  line for our country.
