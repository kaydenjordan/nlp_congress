 Madam Speaker, I stand before you to talk about two  topics: The confirmation of Judge Jackson, as well as the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund.   Judge Jackson is more qualified than the people with whom she will  serve, and she is not soft on crime. It is why she has the endorsement  of the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of  Police Chiefs, hardly the radical left.   As we look at the opportunity to make history, we want to make sure  that our Supreme Court is representative and reflective of our entire  Nation.   Judge Jackson deserves confirmation. She has earned it, and she will  be someone that we are proud to have on the Supreme Court.                              Restaurant Relief     Madam Speaker, this week is one to celebrate. After  almost a year of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, the House will  finally take up legislation to replenish the Restaurant Revitalization  Fund and move us one step closer to getting much-needed relief for  restaurants across the finish line.   The funds provided by Congress in 2021 were a lifeline for so many  businesses in Washington State and across our Nation. Restaurants were  hit especially hard by highly transmissible COVID-19 variants, staffing  shortages, supply chain issues, and inflation, which only added to the  existing challenges and long-term effects that brought many to the  brink of closing their doors for good.   Restaurants have lost 2 years' worth of revenue, and it will take  them years to recover and repay their debts. In fact, in Washington  State alone, the average full-service restaurant reports being $160,000  in debt, and it would take them over 3 years to repay it.   I know how critical this second round of funding is because I  regularly hear about it from my constituents. The south Puget Sound of  Washington State is the proud home of so many small, local restaurants,  including Vien Dong in the Lincoln International District and Budd Bay  Cafe in Olympia, to name a few.   Many businesses are still struggling to get back on their feet, and  most were shut out from ever receiving relief in the first place.   That is why on February 10, I led the Washington State delegation in  sending a letter to congressional leadership urging them to replenish  the Restaurant Revitalization Fund and help these employers and  employees in need as soon as possible.    These businesses are often neighborhood anchors and family-owned.  They are often owned by women, veterans, minorities, and immigrants.  They are a critical part of the south Sound and Washington State's  economy. We must do everything we can to support them and push for an  equitable and inclusive recovery.                            ____________________
