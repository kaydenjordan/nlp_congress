 MALONEY of New York. Madam Chair, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 5687. When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, its entire  electrical grid was destroyed and millions of its citizens were without  power. It took years to rebuild a lot of that infrastructure and just  when it was getting repaired, it was struck by another natural  disaster, another huge earthquake on January 7. That led to yet another  round of power outages and even more suffering and deaths in Puerto  Rico.   This bill will provide desperately needed disaster relief that will  allow the island to rebuild its infrastructure and revitalize its  economy. Puerto Rico is home to 3.2 million U.S. citizens, and when  disaster strikes, Congress has a duty to step up and provide all the  support our fellow Americans need.   I want to thank Chairwomen Velazquez and Lowey for their passionate  work on this bill and their help for Puerto Rico. I urge a ``yes'' vote  on this bill. It is desperately needed.
