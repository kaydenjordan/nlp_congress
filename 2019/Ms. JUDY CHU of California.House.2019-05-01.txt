 Madam Speaker, climate change is a crisis  that demands our immediate attention. Its effects are ongoing. It will  impact all of us eventually, whether through worse storms, bigger  wildfires, less food and water, or conflicts over resources.   The good news is, we still have the time and ability to halt the  worst effects. That is what the Paris climate agreement achieved. This  landmark agreement was the first ever to unite 195 countries around the  common goal of protecting our planet from the worst impacts of our own  actions. That is why we must pass H.R. 9, to keep the President from  pulling us out of this deal and require the administration to develop  concrete plans to meet our emissions reduction targets.   Under the Paris Agreement, each country agreed to meet our own goals  to keep global temperatures from raising more than 2 degrees Celsius.  Despite Trump's step backwards, I am proud that my State of California  shows change can be made with commonsense steps.   Investments in important technologies like renewable energy, clean  cars, and green buildings mean that California is on track to drop our  emissions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. Now the Federal  Government must follow.   The urgency of fighting climate change cannot be in question. Neither  can our commitment to the Paris Agreement. I urge passage of this bill.                                time  1315
