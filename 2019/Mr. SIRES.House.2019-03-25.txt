Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 920, the Venezuela Arms Restriction  Act, as amended, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 920.   I would like to begin by thanking Ms. Shalala for her leadership in  authoring this important piece of legislation. She has been a leading  voice in supporting the Venezuelan people.   Sadly, human rights violations in Venezuela are nothing new. In  recent months, Nicolas Maduro and his cronies have intensified their  brutal crackdown on those who have bravely and peacefully pushed for  change.   With an increasing wave of demonstrations protesting the Maduro  regime, Congress must do all it can to support efforts by the  Venezuelan people to restore its democracy. This means making sure that  weapons from the United States aren't being used to commit these  horrific acts of violence against civilians. U.S. companies and  individuals should not be able to profit from the repression of the  Venezuelan people.   H.R. 920 codifies existing restrictions on arms exports to  Venezuela's security forces and adds new restrictions on items like  tear gas and riot gear that have been used to suppress peaceful  protestors.   As the protests continue, you can be sure that the Maduro regime will  do everything it can to silence the Venezuelan people; so Congress must  do everything in its power to keep these dangerous items out of the  hands of the Venezuelan security forces.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Shalala), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Ms. Shalala for her strong and timely  leadership on this legislation. It shows a strong commitment to the  Venezuelan people and to our constituents who care so deeply about this  issue.   The human rights situation in Venezuela is absolutely deplorable, and  it is important that we take the commonsense steps in this legislation  to help end the ongoing repression. Passing this measure will send an  important message that Congress stands with the Venezuelan people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 854) to provide humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan people,  including Venezuelan migrants and refugees in the Americas and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 854         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(6) A strategy for future efforts to provide humanitarian       assistance to the people of Venezuela that includes a       description of future efforts regarding the matters described       in paragraphs (1) through (5).       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF CONGRESS.

(c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be       necessary for each of fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to carry out       this section.

In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the following:        (A) The Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives.        (B) The Committee on Appropriations of the House of       Representatives.        (C) The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 854, the Humanitarian Assistance to  the Venezuelan People Act of 2019, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I  thank Ms. Mucarsel-Powell for her leadership on this important issue.  From her first day as a Member of Congress, Ms. Mucarsel-Powell made it  clear that supporting the Venezuelan people and making sure they  receive the humanitarian assistance they need would be at the top of  her agenda. I am proud to partner with her on this bill.   Over the last few years, we have watched in horror as the Venezuelan  economy collapsed and rule of law in that country evaporated. Today,  the man-made crisis created by the Chavez-Maduro regime in Venezuela  has reached unthinkable levels.   Ninety percent of the Venezuelan population lives in poverty. Earlier  this month, the country suffered another massive blow when its electric  grid collapsed. This made it impossible to refrigerate food, and some  Venezuelans could no longer receive necessary medical treatments.   These tremendous hardships have generated a mass exodus from  Venezuela. Almost 10 percent of the population has fled the country  over the last 3 years. The United Nations projects that by the end of  this year, Venezuelans would make up the largest refugee population in  the world.   As suffering is only expected to worsen, Congress must do everything  it can to help the people of Venezuela. Ms. Mucarsel-Powell's  legislation addresses the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela head-on by  authorizing new funding and requiring that USAID and the State  Department develop a humanitarian assistance strategy for the  Venezuelan people in Venezuela and throughout the region.                                time  1700    Other countries in the region and particularly our close allies,  Colombia, have done so much to open up their hearts and their borders  to the Venezuelan refugees. It is important that the United States help  ease the burdens on our regional partners, and this bill is an  important step forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the author of this bill,  the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Mucarsel-Powell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   I would like to once again thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Mucarsel-Powell) for her remarkable leadership on this issue, which  demonstrates her strong commitment to the Venezuelan people and to her  constituents who care so deeply about this issue.   It is crucial that we stand with our partners and allies in the  region to provide desperately needed assistance to the Venezuelan  people and help relieve the burden that Colombians and Venezuela's  other neighbors have taken on over the last few years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2771]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1616) to prioritize the efforts of and enhance coordination among  United States agencies to encourage countries in Central and Eastern  Europe to diversify their energy sources and supply routes, increase  Europe's energy security, and help the United States reach its global  energy security goals, and for other purposes, as amended.

SEC. 5. PROGRESS REPORTS.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act and annually thereafter for seven years, the       President shall transmit to the Committee on Foreign       Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs       of the House of Representatives a report on progress made in       providing assistance for projects under section 4 that       includes the following:        (1) A description of the energy infrastructure projects the       United States has identified for such assistance.        (2) For each such project, the following:        (A) A description of the role of the United States in the       project, including in early-stage project support and late-      stage project support.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1616, the European Energy Security  and Diversification Act of 2019, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the European Energy Security and  Diversification Act of 2019.   I would like to thank my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee,  Mr. Kinzinger and Mr. Keating, for introducing this bipartisan  legislation.   When we look at the full scope of Vladimir Putin's nefarious behavior  throughout the world, we see it take many shapes: insidious attempts to  influence democratic elections, incursions into the sovereign territory  of other nations, and military exercises designed to intimidate its  neighbors.   But this legislation addresses yet another tool in Putin's arsenal:  the manipulation of natural resources.   More and more, we see Russia using energy as a weapon to blackmail  countries depending on Russian energy sources. The European Union and  many of our allies and partners in Europe recognize this threat and  have begun to take steps to reduce their vulnerability to Russian  pressure.   This bill will ramp up American support for Europe's energy security  and reduce dependence on Russia, including financial support for  projects that better connect European energy networks and improve  energy efficiency.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  want to thank, again, Mr. Kinzinger and Mr. Keating for their work on  this bill to bolster our allies in the face of Russian pressure.   This is a good measure that addresses Russia's use of energy to  exploit and blackmail countries around the world, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
