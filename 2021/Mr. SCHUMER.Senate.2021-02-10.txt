 Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, no  motions were filed this morning. So we will proceed to the House  managers' presentation. We anticipate two 10-minute breaks and a 45- minute dinner break around 6 p.m.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 47,  the managers for the House of Representatives have 16 hours to make a  presentation of their case.   The Senate will now hear you. We recognize Mr. Manager Raskin to  begin the presentation of the case for the House of Representatives.   Mr. Raskin.                            Managers' Presentation    Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.   Members of the Senate, good morning, good day.   Some people think this trial is a contest of lawyers or, even worse,  a competition between political parties. It is neither. It is a moment  of truth for America.   My late father, Marcus Raskin, once wrote:         Democracy [needs] a ground to stand upon. And that ground       is the truth.    America needs the truth about ex-President Trump's role in inciting  the insurrection on January 6 because it threatened our government, and  it disrupted--it easily could have destroyed--the peaceful transfer of  power in the United States for the first time in 233 years.   It was suggested yesterday by President Trump's counsel that this is  really like a very bad accident or a natural disaster, where lots of  people get injured or killed, and society is just out looking for  someone to blame. And that is a natural and normal human reaction,  according to the President's counsel, but he says it is totally unfair  in this case.   President Trump, according to Mr. Castor, is essentially an innocent  bystander who got swept up in this catastrophe but did nothing wrong.  In this assertion, Mr. Castor unerringly echoes his client, ex- President Trump, who declared after the insurrection that his conduct  in the affair was ``totally appropriate,'' and, therefore, we can only  assume he could do and would do the exact same thing again because he  said his conduct was totally appropriate.   So now the factual inquiry of the trial is squarely posed for us. The  jurisdictional constitutional issue is gone. Whether you were persuaded  by the  [[Page S616]]  President's constitutional analysis yesterday or not, the Senate voted  to reject it. And so the Senate is now properly exercising its  jurisdiction and sitting as a Court of Impeachment conducting a trial  on the facts. We are having a trial on the facts.   The House says ex-President Donald Trump incited a violent  insurrection against Congress and the Constitution and the people. The  President's lawyers and the President say his conduct was totally  appropriate and he is essentially an innocent victim of circumstances,  like the other innocent victims that we will see getting caught up in  all of the violence and chaos, over the next several days.   The evidence will be for you to see and hear and digest. The evidence  will show you that ex-President Trump was no innocent bystander. The  evidence will show that he clearly incited the January 6 insurrection.  It will show that Donald Trump surrendered his role as Commander in  Chief and became the ``inciter in chief'' of a dangerous insurrection,  and this was, as one of our colleagues put it so cogently on January 6  itself, ``the greatest betrayal of the presidential oath in the history  of the United States.'   The evidence will show you that he saw it coming and was not remotely  surprised by the violence. And when the violence inexorably and  inevitably came as predicted and overran this body and the House of  Representatives with chaos, we will show you that he completely  abdicated his duty as Commander in Chief to stop the violence and  protect the government and protect our officers and protect our people.   He violated his oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the  Constitution, the government, and the people of the United States.   The evidence will show you that he assembled, inflamed, and incited  his followers to descend upon the Capitol to ``Stop the Steal,'' to  block Vice President Pence and Congress from finalizing his opponent's  election victory over him.   It will show that he had been warned that these followers were  prepared for a violent attack, targeting us at the Capitol through  media reports, law enforcement reports, and even arrests.   In short, we will prove that the impeached President was no innocent  bystander whose conduct was totally appropriate and should be a  standard for future Presidents, but that he incited this attack, and he  saw it coming.   To us, it may have felt like chaos and madness, but there was method  in the madness that day. This was an organized attack on the counting  of the electoral college votes in joint session of the U.S. Congress  under the Twelfth Amendment and under the Electoral Count Act to  prevent Vice President Mike Pence and to prevent us from counting  sufficient electoral college votes to certify Joe Biden's victory of  306 to 232 in the electoral college--a margin that President Trump had  declared a landslide in 2016.   When my colleague Mr. Neguse speaks after me, he will set forth in  detail the exact roadmap of all the evidence in the case. My fellow  House managers and I will then take you through that evidence step-by- step so everyone can see exactly how these events unfolded.   But I want to tell you a few key reasons right now that we know this  case is not about blaming an innocent bystander for the horrific  violence and harm that took place on January 6. This is about holding  accountable the person singularly responsible for inciting the attack.   Let's start with December 12. You will see during this trial a man  who praised and encouraged and cultivated violence. ``We have just  begun to fight!'' he says more than a month after the election has  taken place, and that is before the second Million MAGA March, a rally  that ended in serious violence and even a burning of a church. And as  the President forecasted, it was only the beginning.   On December 19, 18 days before January 6, he told his base about  where the battle would be that they would fight next. January 6 would  be ``wild,'' he promised. ``Be there, will be wild!'' said the  President of the United States of America. And that, too, turned out to  be true.   You will see in the days that followed, Donald Trump continued to  aggressively promote January 6 to his followers. The event was  scheduled at the precise time that Congress would be meeting in joint  session to count the electoral college votes and to finalize the 2020  Presidential election.   In fact, in the days leading up to the attack, you will learn that  there were countless social media posts, news stories, and, most  importantly, credible reports from the FBI and Capitol Police that the  thousands gathering for the President's Save America March were  violent, organized with weapons, and were targeting the Capitol. This  mob got organized so openly because, as they would later scream in  these halls and as they posted on forums before the attack, they were  sent here by the President. They were invited here by the President of  the United States of America.   And when they showed up, knowing of these reports that the crowd was  angry and they were armed, here is what Donald Trump told them.  President Trump whipped the crowd into a frenzy, exhorting followers:         If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a       country anymore.    And then he aimed straight at the Capitol declaring:         You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have       to show strength, and you have to be strong.    He told them to ``fight like hell,'' and they brought us hell on that  day.   Incited by President Trump, his mob attacked the Capitol. This  assault unfolded live on television before a horrified nation.   According to those around him at the time, this is how President  Trump reportedly responded to the attack that we saw him incite in  public: Delight, enthusiasm, confusion as to why others around him  weren't as happy as he was.   Trump incited the January 6 attack, and when his mob overran and  occupied the Senate and attacked the House and assaulted law  enforcement, he watched it on TV like a reality show. He reveled in it,  and he did nothing to help us as Commander in Chief. Instead, he served  as the ``inciter in chief,'' sending tweets that only further incited  the rampaging mob. He made statements lauding and sympathizing with the  insurrectionists.   At 4:17 p.m.--over 3 hours after the beginning of the siege--for the  very first time, he spoke out loud--not on Twitter. He spoke out loud  to the American people. Here is what he said:   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. I know your pain. I know you're hurt.    So you might be saying: All right, the President is going to console  us now. He is going to reassure America. He knows our pain. He knows we  are hurt. We have just seen these horrific images of officers being  impaled and smashed over the head. We have just been under attack for 3  hours. But here is what he actually goes on to say:   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. I know your pain. I know you're hurt. We       had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide       election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side.    So you would think he is about to decry the mayhem and violence, the  unprecedented spectacle of this mob attack on the U.S. Capitol, but he  is still promoting the big lie that was responsible for inflaming and  inciting the mob in the first place.   If anyone ever had a doubt as to his focus that day, it was not to  defend us; it was not to console us. It was to praise and sympathize  and commiserate with the rampaging mob. It was to continue to act as  ``inciter in chief,'' not Commander in Chief, by telling the mob that  their election had been stolen from them.    Even then, after that vicious attack, he continued to spread the big  lie. And as everyone here knows, Joe Biden won by more than 7 million  votes and 306 to 232 in the electoral college. But Donald Trump refused  to accept his loss even after this attack, and he celebrated the people  who violently interfered with the peaceful transfer of power, for the  first time in American history, and did that at his urging.   And when he did, in this video, finally tell them to go home in  peace, he added this message:         We love you. You're very special.   [[Page S617]]     Distinguished Members of the Senate, this is a day that will live in  disgrace in American history; that is, unless you ask Donald Trump  because this is what he tweeted before he went to bed that night at  6:01 p.m.--not consoling the Nation, not reassuring everyone that the  government was secure, not a single word that entire day condemning the  violent insurrection.   This is what he says:         These are the things and events that happen when a sacred       landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously       stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &       unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace.       Remember this day forever!    ``These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide  election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from  great patriots. . . . '' In other words, this was all perfectly natural  and foreseeable to Donald Trump. At the beginning of the day, he told  you it was coming. At the end of the day, he basically says: I told you  this would happen. And then he adds: ``Remember this day forever!'' But  not as a day of disgrace, a day of horror and trauma, as the rest of us  remember it, but as a day of celebration, a day of commemoration.   And if we let it be, it will be a day of continuation, a call to  action, and a rallying cry for the next rounds of insurrectionary  justice because all of this was totally appropriate.   Senators, the stakes of this trial could not be more serious. Every  American--young and old and in between--is invited to participate with  us in this essential journey to find the facts and share the truth.  Trials are public events in a democracy, and no trial is more public or  significant than an impeachment trial.   Because the insurrection brought shocking violence, bloodshed, and  pain to the Nation's Capitol, and we will be showing relevant clips of  the mob's attack on police officers and other innocent people, we do  urge parents and teachers to exercise close review of what young people  are watching here, and please watch along with them if you are allowing  them to watch.   The impeachment managers will try to give warnings before the most  graphic and disturbing violence that took place is shown.   We believe that the managers' comprehensive and meticulous  presentation will lead to one powerful and irresistible conclusion:  Donald Trump committed a massive crime against our Constitution and our  people and the worst violation of the Presidential oath of office in  the history of the United States of America. For this, he was impeached  by the House of Representatives, and he must be convicted by the United  States Senate.   Before I close, I want to address a constitutional issue still  lingering from yesterday's argument. The President, obviously, is still  exploring ways to change the subject and talk about anything other than  his responsibility for inciting the attack.   We heard a lot yesterday about his claim that this incitement of the  insurrection was perfectly appropriate because it is somehow protected  by the First Amendment, and this little diversion caught my eye because  I have been a professor of constitutional law and the First Amendment  for decades.   And as we will demonstrate over the course of the trial, the factual  premise and the legal underpinnings of that claim are all wrong. They  present President Trump as merely like a guy at a rally expressing a  political opinion that we disagree with, and now we are trying to put  him in jail for it. That has nothing to do with the reality of these  charges or his constitutional offense.   The particular political opinions being expressed are not why we  impeached the President and have nothing to do with it. It makes no  difference what the ideological content of the mob was, and if we  license and forgive incitement to violent insurrection by militant  Trump followers this week, you can be sure there will be a whole bunch  of new ideological flavors coming soon.   As we will demonstrate with overwhelming evidence, portraying Trump  as a guy on the street being punished for his ideas is a false  description of his actions, his intent, and the role that he played on  January 6, when he willfully incited an insurrectionary mob to riot at  the Capitol.   Last week, 144 constitutional scholars, including Floyd Abrams, a  ferocious defender of free speech; Charles Fried, President Reagan's  Solicitor General; Steven Calabresi, the cofounder of the Federalist  Society, released a statement calling the President's First Amendment  arguments ``legally frivolous''--``legally frivolous''--adding:         [W]e all agree that the First Amendment does not prevent       the Senate from convicting President Trump and disqualifying       him from holding future office.    They went on to say:         No reasonable scholar or jurist could conclude that       President Trump had a First Amendment right to incite a       violent attack on the seat of the legislative branch, or then       to sit back and watch on television as Congress was       terrorized and the Capitol sacked.    Incitement to violence is, of course, not protected by the First  Amendment. That is why most Americans have dismissed Donald Trump's  First Amendment rhetoric simply by referring to Justice Oliver Wendell  Holmes's handy phrase: You can't shout ``fire'' in a crowded theater.   But even that time-honored principle doesn't begin to capture how  off-base the argument is. This case is much worse than someone who  falsely shouts ``fire'' in a crowded theater. It is more like a case  where the town fire chief, who is paid to put out fires, sends a mob  not to yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater but to actually set the  theater on fire; and who then, when the fire alarms go off and the  calls start flooding in to the fire department asking for help, does  nothing but sit back, encourage the mob to continue its rampage, and  watch the fire spread on TV, with glee and delight.   So then we say this fire chief should never be allowed to hold this  public job again and ``you are fired, and you are permanently  disqualified''--and he objects. And he says we are violating hi free  speech rights just because he is pro-mob or pro-fire or whatever it  might be.    Come on. I mean, you really don't need to go to law school to figure  out what is wrong with that argument. Here is the key. Undoubtedly, a  private person can run around on the street expressing his or her  support for the enemies of the United States and advocating to  overthrow the United States Government.   You have got a right to do that under the First Amendment, but if the  President spent all of his days doing that, uttering the exact same  words, expressing support for the enemies of the United States and for  overthrowing the government, is there anyone here who doubts that this  would be a violation of his oath of office to preserve, protect, and  defend the Constitution of the United States and that he or she could  be impeached for doing that?   Look, if you are President of the United States, you have chosen a  side with your oath of office, and if you break it, we can impeach,  convict, remove, and disqualify you permanently from holding any office  of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.   As Justice Scalia once said, memorably, ``You can't ride with the  cops and root for the robbers.'' And if you become ``inciter in chief''  to the insurrection, you can't expect to be on the payroll as Commander  in Chief for the Union.   Trump was the President of the United States, and he had sworn to  preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. He had an affirmative,  binding duty, one that set him apart from everyone else in the country,  to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, including all the  laws against assaulting Federal officers, destroying Federal property,  violently threatening Members of Congress and the Vice President,  interfering with Federal elections, and dozens of other Federal laws  that are well known to all of you.   When he incited insurrection on January 6, he broke that oath. He  violated that duty. And that is why we are here today, and that is why  he has no credible constitutional defense.   I will tell you a final, sad story in this kaleidoscope of sadness  and terror and violence. One of our Capitol officers who defended us  that day was a longtime veteran of our force, a brave and honorable  public servant who spent several hours battling the mob as part of one  of those blue lines defending the Capitol and our democracy.  [[Page S618]]    For several hours straight, as the marauders punched and kicked and  mauled and spit upon and hit officers with baseball bats and fire  extinguishers, cursed the cops and stormed our Capitol, he defended us,  and he lived every minute of his oath of office. And afterward,  overwhelmed by emotion, he broke down in the Rotunda and he cried for  15 minutes and he shouted out:         I got called an n-word 15 times today.    And then he reported:         I sat down with one of my buddies, another Black guy, and       tears just started streaming down my face. [And] I said,       ``What the [F], man? Is this America?''    That is the question before all of you in this trial: Is this  America? Can our country and our democracy ever be the same if we don't  hold accountable the person responsible for inciting the violent attack  against our country, our Capitol, and our democracy and all of those  who serve us so faithfully and honorably? Is this America?   Mr. Neguse will now provide a roadmap, a roadmap of our evidentiary  case.   Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, counsel,  like several of you, I am a child of immigrants. And as a son of  immigrants, I believe firmly in my heart that the United States is the  greatest Republic that this world has ever known.   A hallmark of our Republic since the days of George Washington has  been the peaceful transfer of power. For centuries, we have accepted it  as fact.   Unfortunately, sadly, we know now that we can no longer take that for  granted because, as Lead Manager Raskin explained, on January 6, the  peaceful transition of power was violently interrupted when a mob  stormed this Capitol and desecrated this Chamber.   As you will see during the course of this trial, that mob was  summoned, assembled, and incited by the former President of the United  States, Donald Trump, and he did that because he wanted to stop the  transfer of power so that he could retain power, even though he had  lost the election. And when the violence erupted, when they were here  in our building, with weapons, he did nothing to stop it.   If we are to protect our Republic and prevent something like this  from ever happening again, he must be convicted.   Now, I want to be very clear about what we will show you during the  course of this trial. As my fellow managers present our case to you  today, tonight, and tomorrow, it will be helpful to think about  President Trump's incitement of insurrection in three distinct parts:  provocation, the attack, and the harm.   Let's start with the provocation. We will show, during the course of  this trial, that this attack was provoked by the President, incited by  the President, and, as a result, it was predictable, and it was  foreseeable. And, of course, that makes sense.   This mob was well orchestrated. Their conduct was intentional. They  did it all in plain sight--proudly, openly, and loudly--because they  believed, they truly believed that they were doing this for him; that  this was their patriotic duty.   They even predicted that he would protect them. And for the most  part, they were right. In his unique role as Commander in Chief of our  country and as the one person whom the mob was listening to and  following orders from, he had the power to stop it, and he didn't.   Now, some have said that President Trump's remarks, his speech on  January 6, was just a speech. Well, let me ask you this: When in our  history has a speech led thousands of people to storm our Nation's  Capitol with weapons, to scale the walls, break windows, kill a Capitol  Police officer?   This was not just a speech. It didn't just happen. And as you  evaluate the facts that we present to you, it will become clear exactly  where that mob came from, because here is the thing: President Trump's  words, as you will see, on January 6 in that speech, just like the  mob's actions, were carefully chosen. Those words had a very specific  meaning to that crowd. And how do we know this? Because in the weeks  prior to, during, and after the election, he used the same words over  and over and over again. You will hear over and over three things--you  can see them on the screens--first, what Lead Manager Raskin referred  to as the ``big lie,'' that the ``election was stolen, full of fraud,  rigged.'' You will hear over and over him using that lie to urge his  supporters to ``never concede'' and ``stop the steal.'' Finally, you  will hear the call to arms, that it was his supporters' patriotic duty  to fight like hell. To do what? To stop the steal. To stop the election  from being stolen by showing up in this very Chamber. To stop you. To  stop us.   I respectfully ask that you remember those three phrases as you  consider the evidence today--``The election was stolen,'' ``Stop the  Steal,'' and ``Fight like hell''--because they did not just appear on  January 6. Let me show you what I mean. Let's start with the ``big  lie.''   You will see during this trial that the President realized, really by  last spring, that he could lose, he might lose the election. So what  did he do? He started planting the seeds to get some of his supporters  ready by saying that he could only lose the election if it was stolen.   In other words, really what he did was create a no-lose scenario:  either he won the election or he would have some angry supporters--not  all but some--who believed that if he lost, the election had to be  rigged, and they would be angry because he was telling Americans that  their vote had been stolen. And in America, our vote is our voice. So  his false claims about election fraud, that was the drumbeat being used  to inspire, instigate, and ignite them, to anger them.   Watch this clip.   (Text of video presentation.)         President TRUMP. Because we are not going to let this       election be taken away from us. That's the only way they are       going to win this. We are not going to let it happen.        (Applause.)        It is the only way we can be--it is the only way we can       lose, in my opinion, is massive fraud.    We all know what happened after that. He lost. He lost the election.  But remember, he had that no-lose scenario that I referenced earlier.  He told his base that the election was stolen, as he had forecasted,  and then he told them: Your election has been stolen, but you cannot  concede. You must stop the steal.   (Text of video presentation.)         President TRUMP: You can't let another person steal that       election from you. All over the country, people are together       in holding up signs: `Stop the Steal.'        The Democrats are trying to steal the White House. You       cannot let them. You just can't let them.    Now, while he is inciting his supporters, he is also simultaneously  doing everything he possibly can to overturn the election.   First, he begins with the courts--a legitimate avenue, legitimate  avenue--to challenge the election, but he ignores all of their adverse  rulings when all of his claims are thrown out.   Then he moves on to try to pressure State election officials to block  the election results for his opponent even though he had lost in their  States. You will hear my fellow managers discuss that in detail.   Then he tries to threaten State election officials to actually change  the votes to make him the winner, even threatening criminal penalties  if they refused.   He had the Justice Department investigate his claims, and even they  found no support for those claims. So he tried to persuade some Members  of his party in Congress to block the certification of his vote with  attacks in public forums.   When that failed, he tried to intimidate the Vice President of the  United States of America to refuse to certify the vote and send it back  to the States.   None of it worked. So what does he do, with his back against the  wall, when all else has failed? He turned back to his supporters. He  had already spent months telling them that the election was stolen, and  he amplified it further. He turned it up a notch. He told them that  they had to be ready not just to stop the steal but to fight like hell.   (Text of video presentation.)         President TRUMP. We are going to fight for the survival of       our nation. And we are going to keep on fighting.        We will never surrender, we will only win.        Now is not the time to retreat. Now is the time to fight       harder than ever before.        We have to go all the way. We are going to fight like hell,       I will tell you right now.        We will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield. We       will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back       down. We will never, ever surrender.   [[Page S619]]     You will see that in the months the President made thes statements,  people listened. Armed supporters surrounded election officials' homes.  The secretary of state for Georgia got death threats. Officials warned  the President that his rhetoric was dangerous, and it was going to  result in deadly violence. And that is what makes this so different,  because when he saw firsthand the violence that his conduct was  creating, he didn't stop it. He didn't condemn the violence. He incited  it further, and he got more specific. He didn't just tell them to fight  like hell; he told them how, where, and when. He made sure they had  advance notice, 18 days' advance notice. He sent this ``save the date''  for January 6. He told them to march to the Capitol and fight like hell  on January 6, as Lead Manager Raskin said, the exact same day we were  certifying the election results. What time was that rally scheduled  for? The exact same time that this Chamber was certifying the election  results in joint session. When did he conclude his speech? Literally  moments before Speaker Pelosi had gaveled us into session.    Many of us were in the House during that joint session of Congress. I  was sitting two rows behind Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell. I  remember it vividly. And as we were standing there fulfilling our  solemn oath to the Constitution, the President was finishing his speech  just a couple of miles away. How did he conclude that infamous speech?  With a final call to action. He told them to march down Pennsylvania  Avenue, to come here; that it was their patriotic duty because the  election had been stolen. And when they heard his speech, they  understood his words and what they meant because they had heard it  before.   Let's take just a minute and really look at his words on January 6 as  he spoke at the Save America rally. Remember, I told you you would hear  three phrases: ``The election was stolen,'' ``Stop the Steal,'' and  ``Fight like hell.'' Let's start with that first phrase.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)        President TRUMP. All of us here today do not want to see       our election victory stolen.        There has never been anything like this. It is a pure theft       in American history. Everybody knows it. Make no mistake,       this election was stolen from you, from me, and from the       country.    Now, of course, each of you heard those words before. So had the  crowd. The President had spent months telling his supporters that the  election had been stolen, and he used this speech to incite them  further, to inflame them, to stop the steal, to stop the certification  of the election results.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. We will never give up, we will never       concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's       theft involved. And to use a favorite term that all of you       people really came up with: We will stop the steal.        We must stop the steal.    Finally, the President used the speech as a call to arms. It was not  rhetorical. Some of his supporters had been primed for this over many  months. As you will learn, days before this speech, as Lead Manager  Raskin noted, there were vast reports across all major media outlets  that thousands of people would be armed, that they would be violent.  You will learn that Capitol Police and the FBI reported in the days  leading up to the attack that thousands in the crowd would be targeting  the Capitol specifically, that they had arrested people with guns the  night before the attack on weapons charges.   And this is what our Commander in Chief said to the crowd in the face  of those warnings, right before they came here.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. We will not let them silence your voices.       We're not going to let it happen. Not going let it happen.        (People chanting: ``Fight for Trump.'')        President TRUMP. Thank you. And you have to get your people       to fight because you'll never take back our country with       weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be       strong. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't       fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.    ``You have to get your people to fight,'' he told them.   Senators, this clearly was not just one speech. It didn't just  happen. It was part of a carefully planned, months-long effort with a  very specific instruction: Show up on January 6, and get your people to  fight the certification.   He incited it. It was foreseeable. And again, you don't have to take  my word for it. The President's former Chief of Staff--he is a retired  marine, four-star general, was confirmed by this body to be the  Secretary of Homeland Security, overwhelming vote--that man was John  Kelly. On the day after the insurrection, he said this:   (Text of video presentation.)          Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess for a 15-minute break.   There being no objection, at 1:39 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 2:04 p.m., whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the President pro tempore.                      Managers' Presentation--Continued    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Raskin.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.   My colleagues Madeleine Dean and Ted Lieu will now detail former  President Trump's increasingly desperate attempts to stop the steal.   Ms. Manager DEAN. Mr. President, esteemed Members of the Senate, it  is my solemn honor to be before you today.   I am Madeleine Dean, Congresswoman from the Fourth Congressional  District of Pennsylvania. I am a lawyer. I am a former professor of  writing. I am a sister. I am a wife. I am a mother. I am a grandmother  to three, with fourth on her way. I am a person of faith. And I am an  American.   Along with Manager Lieu, I will present the actions of a desperate  President, and we will present evidence today of a class of public  servants who, standing up to enormous pressure from the President of  the United States, did the right thing and upheld their oaths.   My colleagues just presented evidence of President Trump's months- long effort to incite his base, leading them to believe the election  was stolen, that they needed to fight like hell to stop the steal on  January 6.   These weren't President Trump's only efforts to overturn the results.  Manager Lieu and I will present evidence of President Trump's  relentless, escalating campaign to fabricate an election victory by  ignoring adverse court rulings, pressuring and threatening election  officials, attacking Senators and Members of Congress, pressuring the  Justice Department, and finally bullying his own Vice President.   President Trump and his allies filed 62 separate lawsuits in Federal  courts across more than half a dozen States and the District of  Columbia, including Pennsylvania, my home State, as well as Arizona,  Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, and Wisconsin. Of the 62  postelection legal challenges, he lost 61. Only one was successful, and  that case involved ballot curing in Pennsylvania and had no impact on  President Biden's 80,555-vote victory in our Commonwealth.   To be clear, not a single court, not a single judge agreed that the  election results were invalid or should be invalidated. Instead, court  after court reviewing these challenges said these cases were ``not  credible,'' ``without merit,'' ``based on nothing but speculation,''  and ``flat out wrong.''   The judiciary resoundingly rejected Trump's fraud allegations and  upheld the election results, but it was more than that. The court said  these cases were different; they were dangerous to our democracy. For  an example, in an opinion by United States District Court Judge Matthew  Brann from Pennsylvania, he said:         [T]his Court has been presented with strained legal       arguments without merit and speculative accusations. . . . In       the United States of America, this cannot justify the       disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the       voters of its sixth most populated state. Our people, [and]       laws, and institutions demand more.        Because this Court has no authority to take away the right       to vote of even a single person, let alone millions of       citizens, it cannot grant Plaintiff's requested relief.    That decision by Judge Brann was affirmed on appeal by Judge  Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee who agreed and wrote:         The Campaign's claims have no merit. The number of ballots       it specifically challenges is far smaller than the roughly       81,000-vote margin of victory. And it never claims fraud or       that any of the votes were cast by illegal voters. Plus,       tossing out millions of mail-in ballots would be drastic and       unprecedented, disfranchising a huge swath of the electorate       and upsetting all down-ballot races.    Similarly, as Judge Linda Parker of the Eastern District of Michigan  framed it--she said:         [S]tunning in its scope and breathtaking in its reach. If       granted, th relief would disenfranchise the votes of . . .       more than 5.5 million Michigan citizens who, with dignity,       [and] hope, and a promise of a [vote], participated in the       2020 General Election.    Donald Trump told his supporters: They are stealing the election.  They took away your vote. It is rigged.   That was not true. According to judge after judge, the truth was  exactly the opposite.   Trump was not suing to ensure election integrity; he was pursuing  lawsuits that would, in effect, strip away American votes so that he  could win. In other words, Donald Trump was asking the judiciary to  take away votes from Americans so that he could steal the election for  himself.   Then, after losing in all the courts, Trump turned to another tactic:  pressuring and threatening election officials. You saw what happened in  Michigan after Trump attacked the State and its election officials. His  supporters surrounded the secretary of state's home, as you saw in the  earlier slide, chanting, calling her a felon.   On November 17, the Board of Canvassers for Wayne County, MI, home to  Detroit, unanimously certified the election results for Biden. That  same night, after their vote to certify the results, Trump called the  two Republican members of that board, pressuring them to change their  minds. The call worked. The next day, both Monica Palmer and William  Heartmann, the Republican board members, attempted to rescind their  vote to certify Michigan's election results, but they simply couldn't.   President Trump didn't stop there. He then contacted majority leader  of the Michigan Senate, Mike Shirkey, and the speaker of the Michigan  House, Lee Chatfield, to lobby them to overturn Michigan's results.  Trump invited Mr. Chatfield and Mr. Shirkey to Washington to meet with  him at the White House, where the President lobbied them further.   Let's be clear. Donald Trump was calling officials, hosting them at  the White House, urging them to defy the voters in their State and  instead award votes to Trump. The officials held strong, and so Trump  moved on to a different State, my home State of Pennsylvania. I am  certain my Senators, Casey and Toomey, remember what happened there.   In early December, as he did in Michigan, he began calling election  officials, including my former colleagues in the Pennsylvania  Legislature, Republicans, Majority Leader Kim Ward  [[Page S625]]  and Speaker of the House Bryan Cutler. Majority Leader Ward said the  President called her to ``declare there was a fraud in the voting.''   Then, on November 25, President Trump phoned in to a Republican State  senate policy hearing, trying to convince the Republican legislators,  senators, and house members that there had been a fraud in the vote. He  even had his lawyer hold a phone up to the microphone in that hearing  room so the committee could hear him. Here is what he said:   (Text of audio presentation.)         President TRUMP. We can't let that happen. We can't let it       happen for our country. And this election has to be turned       around because we won Pennsylvania by a lot, and we won all       of these swing States by a lot.    This was a gathering--I have attended many, I have to tell you, as a  former State legislator, a lot of policy hearings. I have to say with  some confidence, that was likely the first time a President of the  United States of America called in to a State legislative policy  hearing.   And, remember, here is the President saying he won Pennsylvania, and  Pennsylvania had been certified, that Biden had won by more than 80,000  votes.   Less than a week after calling in to that meeting, he invited  multiple Republican members of the Pennsylvania Legislature to the  White House--the same scheme he had used on the Michigan legislators.  It didn't work with those public servants either.   Think about it. The President of the United States was calling public  officials, calling from the White House, inviting them into the Oval  Office, telling them to disenfranchise voters of their State, telling  them to overturn the will of the American people. All so he could take  the election for himself.    And then in Georgia, a State Trump had counted on for victory, his  conduct was perhaps the most egregious. On November 11, Republican  Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger confirmed that he believed  ballots were accurately counted for Biden.   Trump went on a relentless attack. Here are just a few examples. In  all, Trump tweeted at Raffensperger 17 times in the coming weeks--there  are just a few--calling him a ``disaster,'' ``obstinate,'' not having a  clue, being played for a fool, and being a ``so-called Republican,''  all because Raffensperger was doing his job, ensuring the integrity of  our elections.   And these attacks had consequences. Mr. Raffensperger and his family  received death threats:         Your husband deserves to face a firing squad.        You better not botch this recount. Your life depends [upon]       it.        The Raffenspergers should be put on trial for treason and       face execution.    Just some of the threats they received. After these death threats, on  November 25, Mr. Raffensperger wrote an op-ed, where he said:         My family voted for [Trump], donated to him and are now       being thrown under the bus by him.    But he also noted:         Elections are the bedrock of our democracy. They need to be       run fairly and, perhaps more [importantly], impartially.       That's not partisan. That's just American.    It is important to remember that this wasn't just a random attack.  Trump wasn't just criticizing a politician over policy or saying he  didn't agree. Donald Trump was savagely attacking a secretary of state  because the official did his job and certified the State according to  how the people in that State voted.   Donald Trump was trying to undermine our elections by taking votes  away from the American people so that he could remain President, and he  was willing to blame and betray anyone--anyone--even his own  supporters, if they got in the way. Remember, Senators, those threats  were to Mr. Raffensperger's family.   So some may say Trump didn't know his attacks against Mr.  Raffensperger would result in death threats--except that all of this  was very public. The secretary published his op-ed in USA TODAY, and  major networks, including FOX, covered the threats against the  Raffenspergers.   What did Trump do? Did he stop? Did he say: No, no, supporters; that  isn't what I meant? No. He doubled down.   Let's see the evidence.   (Text of audio presentation of 11-26-2020.)         President TRUMP. This was a massive fraud. This should       never take place in this country. We're like a third world       country. Look at--look at Georgia. But I understand the       secretary of state who is really, uh, uh, he's an enemy of       the people. The secretary of state--and whether he's       Republican or not, this man, what he's done.        . . . this character in Georgia, who is a disaster.    Let that sink in. A Republican public servant doing his job, whose  family had just received death threats, and the President of the United  States labeled him ``an enemy of the people.''   And that is why this is different, because this was not just one  attack or one comment. This was attack after attack in the face of  clear threats of violence.   And on December 1, another official, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican  who voted for Trump, made this point and appealed directly to our  President to stop his dangerous conduct:   (Text of audio presentation 12-1-20.)          Yes. I ask unanimous consent that we recess until 4 p.m.   There being no objection, at 3:43 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 4:08 p.m., whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the President pro tempore.                      Managers' Presentation--Continued    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Could we have order in the Senate, please.   Mr. Raskin.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.   Members of the Senate, at this point, Representatives Plaskett and  Swalwell will take you through the actual day of the attack. They will  recreate the attack as it unfolded, focusing on the threats to Vice  President Pence, Speaker Pelosi, the joint session, and law  enforcement.   I do want to alert everyone that there is some very graphic, violent  footage coming, so people are aware.   I am going to call, again, on Ms. Plaskett, who I should also tell  you went to work at the Department of Justice and was the senior  counsel for Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson under Attorney  General Ashcroft. So she is a very well trained and experienced  prosecutor, as you can tell.   Ms. Manager PLASKETT. Mr. President, Senators, almost all of us were  here on January 6, and we all have our individual experiences: what we  felt, what we saw, what we heard. We have seen clips and reports in the  media, but I have to tell you, it was not until preparing for this  trial that I understood the full scope and learned the information that  you are going to see that I understood the effort to attack our seat of  government in order to carry out President Trump's mission to prevent  the certification of a Presidential election. It was an attack to our  Republic, to our democratic process.   My colleagues, Manager Swalwell, and I are going to walk you through  the attack on the Capitol that day and the danger that it posed to the  Vice President, to the Speaker of the House, to you all as Senators, my  colleagues in the House, Capitol Police, and everyone who works in and  around this Capitol.   As you have heard, President Trump had been telling his supporters  and his millions of Twitter followers that Pence had the ability to  secure the Presidency for Trump; that Mike Pence alone had the power to  overturn the election results if he would just do it.   But at 12:55 p.m., on January 6, Vice President Pence formally  refused the President's demand.   He wrote, and I quote:         It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and       defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming       unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes       should be counted and which should not.    Pence ended his letter with a passage including the words:         I will do my duty.    Even though the count resulted in the defeat of his party and his own  candidacy, Vice President Pence had the courage to stand against the  President, tell the American public the truth, and uphold our  Constitution. That is patriotism.   That patriotism is also what put the Vice President in so much danger  on January 6 by the mob sent by our President. To the President and the  mob he incited, that duty to our Constitution was an all-out betrayal,  and the Vice President was the direct target of that rage.   At 12:53 p.m., Senators, Members of Congress, Vice President Pence  were in their respective Chambers. Outside, rioters, including some  linked to the Proud Boys, broke through the outer barricade surrounding  the lawn of the Capitol.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         (People chanting: ``USA.'')        Unidentified Speaker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.        Unidentified Speaker. Way to go.        Unidentified Speaker. Break it down.    Twelve minutes later, Vice President Pence began presiding over the  joint session of Congress to certify the results of the Presidential  election. You can see Vice President Pence gaveling in the joint  session here.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         The VICE PRESIDENT. Madam President, Members of Congress,       pursuant to the Constitution and the laws of the United       States, the Senate and House of Representatives are meeting       in joint session to verify the certificates and count the       votes of the electors of the several States for President and       Vice President of the United States.    While Vice President Pence presided over the joint session, Trump  supporters began their assault on our Capitol. Radio communications  from the Metropolitan Police Department highlight how, during and  following President Trump's speech, Trump supporters descended on the  Capitol and became increasingly violent.   What you are about to hear has not been made public before.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         The Officer. Multiple Capitol injuries. Multiple Capitol       injuries.

Intel 1, be advised you've got a group of       about 50 up the hill on the west front just north of the       stairs. They are approaching the wall now.        The Officer. They're starting to dismantle the reviewing       stand. They're throwing metal poles at us.        The Officer. Cruiser 50, give me DSO up here now. DSO.       Multiple law enforcement injuries. DSO, get up here.        The Officer. All right. We're 30 seconds out.        The Officer. We need some reinforcements up here now.       They're starting to pull the gates down. They're throwing       metal poles at us.        The Officer. Cruiser 50, DSO, get up here.        The Officer. OK. We're here.        The Officer. Twelve to 50, we're here.        The Officer. We just had an explosion go on up here. I       don't know if they're fireworks or what, but they're starting       to throw explosives, fireworks material.    After attempting to dismantle the outermost perimeter, the rioters  did everything in their power to storm past the police and into the  Capitol. They coordinated, moving metal barricades the police were  using to maintain distance. Listen to the yelling of ``pull them this  way'' as they grabbed the barriers and attacked officers trying to hold  the line.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Pull. Pull this way. Pull forward.        Unidentified Speaker. No, no, no, no, no. No. No. No. No.    At about 1:10 and 1:23 p.m., respectively, Capitol Police sent out  the first evacuation alerts of the day, telling people to evacuate the  Madison Building and the Cannon Building, respectively. Shortly after,  at 1:45 p.m.,  [[Page S634]]  Trump supporters surged past Capitol Police protecting the Capitol's  west steps, the side that is facing the White House.   In another radio communication between Metropolitan Police officers,  you can hear an officer declare that there is a riot at the Capitol at  1:49 p.m.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         The Officer. Cruiser 50, we're going to give riot warnings       as soon as the LRAD is here. We're going to give riot       warnings. We're going to try to get compliance, but this now       is effectively a riot.        The Dispatcher. 1349 hours. Declaring it a riot.    The next video, as well as several videos that follow, have a model  of the Capitol Complex. The video is from the west front of the Capitol  on the Senate side, the side facing the White House.   Watch the red dot, which moves up the lower steps of the Capitol,  indicating the approximate location of the rioters as they surge past  the police.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. This is our fucking house.        Unidentified Speaker. This is a revolution.        Unidentified Speaker. Let's go. Push.        Unidentified Speaker. Go. Fuck you. Fuck you.    While the mob that Donald Trump sent to stop the certification came  closer and closer to breaching the Capitol, just one floor below where  we are now, Vice President Pence continued to preside over the session  in the Senate Chamber above.   At about 2:12 p.m., Secret Service quickly and suddenly evacuated  Vice President Pence from the Senate floor. Here is the immediate  reaction to that evacuation.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. No audio. They just cut out. It looks       like they--and sometimes the Senate--        Unidentified Speaker. It seemed like they just ushered Mike       Pence out really quickly.        Unidentified Speaker. Yes, they did. That's exactly what       just happened there. They ushered Mike Pence out. They moved       him fast. They were--yeah, I saw the motions too.    While Vice President Pence was being evacuated from the Senate  Chamber, rioters were at that time breaking into the Capitol. This next  video shows their approach and the initial breach of the Capitol  Complex.   Remember to watch the red dot, which broke--has been tracking  throughout this incident.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Let us in.        Unidentified Speaker. Let's go.        Unidentified Speaker. Break the window, bro.    Now we are going to show you, through security footage that has not  been made public before, what that same breach looked like from the  inside. Now, because this is security footage, there is no sound.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Note, as the video begins, we are seeing the inside view as the mob  approaches from outside and beats the windows and doors. You can see  that the rioters first break the window with the wooden beam that you  saw previously, and a lone police officer inside responds and begins to  spray the first man who enters but is quickly overwhelmed.   I want you to pay attention to the first group of assailants as they  break into the building. The second man through the window is wearing  full tactical body armor and is carrying a baseball bat. Others are  carrying riot shields.   Among this group are members of the Proud Boys--some of whom, like  Dominic Pezzola, who was recently indicted on Federal conspiracy  charges--we will discuss later.   You can watch where they are coming on our model as well.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   When I first saw this model that was created for this, I thought back  to September 11. I know a lot of you Senators were here. Some of you  might have been Members on the House side. I was also here on September  11. I was a staffer at that time. My office was on the west front of  the Capitol. I worked in the Capitol, and I was on the House side.   This year is 20 years since the attacks of September 11, and almost  every day I remember that 44 Americans gave their lives to stop the  plane that was headed to this Capitol Building. I thank them every day  for saving my life and the life of so many others.   Those Americans sacrificed their lives for love of country, honor,  duty--all the things that America means. The Capitol stands because of  people like that--this Capitol that was conceived by our Founding  Fathers, that was built by slaves, that remains through the sacrifice  of service men and women around the world.   And when I think of that, I think of these insurgents, these images,  incited by our own President of the United States, attacking this  Capitol to stop the certification of a Presidential election, our  democracy, our Republic.   At the same time that that breach on this Capitol Building occurred,  at approximately 2:13 p.m., just one floor up, while Senator Lankford  was speaking on the Senate floor, Senator Grassley, who had taken over  for Vice President Pence, called an unscheduled immediate recess of the  Senate.   A Senate aide approached Senator Lankford and informed him that the  Capitol had been breached. Senator Grassley is immediately escorted out  of the Senate Chamber.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Protesters are in the building.     Mr. President, we will now have a recess for dinner, and  we will resume at 6:15.

Managers' Presentation--Continued    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Raskin.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, distinguished Members of the  Senate, Managers Cicilline and Castro will now remind us of what  President Trump was doing during the attack. They will show how he  continued to stoke the insurrection and refused to speak out against  the violence or do anything to stop it.  [[Page S639]]    Mr. Cicilline.   Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, you  just heard from my colleagues about the harrowing events that happened  here at the Capitol on January 6 and saw that very disturbing video,  and now I would like to turn your attention to what was happening on  the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House.   The truth is, the facts are that on January 6, Donald Trump did not  once condemn this attack. He did not once condemn the attackers. In  fact, on January 6, the only person he condemned was his own Vice  President, Mike Pence, who was hiding in this building with his family  in fear for his life.   In the first crucial hours of this violent attack, he did nothing to  stop it, nothing to help us.   By all accounts, from the people that were around him, he was  delighted. And here is the last thing Donald Trump said that day, and  you might remember this from my motions presentation earlier in the  week.   At 6 p.m. on January 6, after all the destruction that you just saw,  Capitol Police and the National Guard fighting to secure this building,  here is what Donald Trump tweeted:         These are the things and events that happen when a sacred       landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously       stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &       unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace.       Remember this day forever!    He got what he incited, and according to Donald Trump, we got what we  deserve. Donald Trump's incitement of this insurrection, including his  dereliction of his duty as Commander in Chief to defend the Capitol and  the people in it, his complete refusal to condemn the attack while it  was going on, and his continuing to incite the violence during the  attack require impeachment.   Now, let's turn to then-President Trump's conduct that day. I want to  start at the beginning, when he addressed his thousands of great  patriots, as he called them that morning. Around noon, Donald Trump  began speaking at his rally just down Pennsylvania Avenue. Even before  Donald Trump finished speaking, his supporters began to walk down  toward the Capitol, and they were already starting to chant ``stop the  steal'' and ``storm the Capitol'' and ``invade the Capitol'' and  ``fight for Trump.''   And by 12:53 p.m., they had violently forced their way through the  barricades here at the Capitol. Now, about 1 o'clock that day, with  this chaos just starting, Speaker Pelosi, as the Constitution requires,  formally commenced the process by which this Chamber certifies election  results.   Within 10 minutes, at 1:11 p.m., as if almost on cue, Donald Trump  concluded his speech with his final reminder to the thousands gathered  there: It was time to go to the Capitol.   Let's watch.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. We're going to the Capitol, and we're       going to try and give--and we're going to try and give our       Republicans--the weak ones because the strong ones don't need       any of our help--we're going to try and give them the kind of       pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.        So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.        I want to thank you all. God bless you, and God bless       America.        Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you       very much.        (People chanting: ``Fight for Trump.'')    Now, you have seen what happened when these supporters, following his  orders, arrived here at the Capitol. But we want to look at what  happened next. Now, you will recall, during the speech, President Trump  said, ``We're going to the Capitol,'' sort of suggesting he was going  to go with this crowd. Of course, that was not true. But let's hear  what he said.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. Now it is up to Congress to confront this       egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we're       going to walk down, and I'll be there with you. We're going       to walk down. We're going to walk down.        Any one you want, but I think right here. We're going to       walk down to the Capitol.    This, of course, was not true. He did not go with them to the  Capitol. He left and went back to the White House, and while he was en  route to the White House, violence began to grow here at the Capitol.   And within minutes of Donald Trump's speech ending, there were  significant reports of escalating violence that began to surface.  Buildings around the Capitol were starting to be evacuated, and by  1:15, an explosive device had been found at the DNC, and a pipe bomb  had been found at the RNC about 15 minutes earlier. The House Sergeant  at Arms had called for immediate assistance. At 1:34 p.m., the mayor of  Washington, DC, called for additional National Guard troops.   I won't go through all of the details of violence that unfolded here.  You just saw that. But as we walk through what our Commander in Chief  did that day, I want to be very clear about exactly what was happening  here at the same time.   For 40 minutes, while buildings were being cleared, pipe bombs were  being found, and his supporters were literally breaching the perimeter  of the Capitol and overwhelming law enforcement. You saw the violence  that was occurring. We heard nothing from the President of the United  States. We didn't hear anything from Donald Trump until 1:49 p.m.,  when, while all of this is unfolding, President Trump sent out a tweet.   This was the first thing he did when he learned the U.S. Capitol,  with all the Members of Congress and his own Vice President, was under  violent attack. What was that tweet? Nearly an hour after the rioters  breached the Capitol perimeter at 1:49, Donald Trump released a  propaganda reel of his ``Save America'' speech that he had given an  hour before.   I want to be clear. The events I just described--the rioters  breaching the Capitol, attacking law enforcement, the violence that is  being broadcast all over the television for the whole world to see,  including the President of the United States--I want to show you: This  is what is happening right before Donald Trump sends that video out  again and as he does it.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. Our country has had enough. We will not       take it anymore and that's what this is all about. And to use       a favorite term that all of you people really came up with:       We will stop the steal. Because you'll never take back our       countr with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have       to be strong.    Even if President Trump claims he didn't know the extent of the  violence that would follow his speech, it was now happening in plain  view, broadcast on television. His supporters were attacking law  enforcement. The mayor and the police chief were calling for help.  Members of Congress and the Vice President were inside scared for their  lives.   He doesn't send help, and he doesn't try to stop it. He doesn't even  acknowledge the attack. Instead, our Commander in Chief tweeted the  video of the speech that he had given before, that included language  like ``our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and  that's what this is all about. . . . You have to be strong.''   Those around Donald Trump--this was later reported--were disgusted.  His close aides, his advisers, those working for him, former officials,  and even his family were begging him to do something. Kellyanne Conway,  the President's close adviser, called to ``add her name'' to the chorus  of aides urging Donald Trump to take action. Ivanka Trump, the  President's own daughter, went to the Oval Office ``as soon as'' the  rioting escalated, and as was confirmed by Senator Graham, ``trying to  get [Trump] to speak out, to tell everyone to leave.''   Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called Jared Kushner, ``pleading with  him to persuade Trump to issue a statement'' or to do something. And  Kushner, too, went down to the White House after that call.   And it wasn't just the people at the White House. Members of Congress  from both parties, who were trapped here, were calling the White House  to ask for help. Some Members even appealed directly to Donald Trump.  These Members who had ``been loyal Trump supporters and were even  willing to vote against the electoral college results, were now scared  for their lives.''   Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy repeatedly even got into a screaming  match as the attack was under way,  [[Page S640]]  demanding that Mr. Trump do something, issue a statement denouncing the  mob.   I imagine many of you sitting here today picked up your phone and  tried to reach somebody at the White House to ask for help. This wasn't  partisan politics. These were Americans from all sides trying to force  our Commander in Chief to protect and defend our country. He was  required to do that.   Now, the extent of how many people tried to reach the President to  get him to act is not known. But what is clear, what we know without  any doubt, is that from the very beginning, the people around Donald  Trump lobbied him to take command. What is also clear is what Donald  Trump, our Commander in Chief, did in those initial hours to protect  us. Nothing. Not a thing. He knew it was happening. The attack was on  TV. We all know that President Trump had the power to stop these  attacks. He was our Commander in Chief. He had the power to assess the  security situation, send backup, and send help.   He also had incited these violent attacks. They were listening to  him. He could have commanded them to leave, but he didn't.   The first critical hour and a half of this bloody attack, Donald  Trump tweeted his rally speech and did nothing else. And we know why.  We know his state of mind that prompted his utter, complete refusal to  defend us. It was reported by those around him.   The President, as reported by sources at the time, was delighted. As  he watched the violence unfold on television, President Trump was  reportedly ``borderline enthusiastic because it meant the certification  was being derailed.''   Senator Ben Sasse relayed a conversation with senior White House  officials that President Trump was ``walking around the White House  confused about why other people on his team weren't as excited as he  was.''   Mr. Trump's reaction to this attack, reportedly, genuinely freaked  people out. I understand why. We just suffered a very serious attack,  an attack on our country. And we saw them--the people around him--do  it. But when Donald Trump saw it, he was delighted.   Now, what President Trump did next confirms why he was so delighted,  why he wanted this, because it shows that his singular focus that day-- the day we were attacked--was not protecting us, was not protecting  you, was not protecting the Capitol, but it was stopping the  certification of the election results.   The evidence is clear. Shortly after 2 p.m., as the siege was fully  under way, then-President Trump made a call. This is the first call  that we are aware he made to anyone inside the Capitol during the  attack. He didn't call the Vice President to ask how he could help  defend the Capitol. He didn't call the next two in line to succession  of the Presidency to check on their safety or well-being.   Instead, he attempted to call Senator Tuberville. He dialed Senator  Lee by accident.   (Text deleted.)   Let's be clear. At roughly 2 p.m., when Donald Trump was walking  around the White House watching the TV delighted and spent 5 to 10  minutes talking to Senator Tuberville, urging him to delay the election  results, this is what was happening in the Capitol.   (Video presentation.)   You saw Senator Lankford stop speaking and leave the floor quickly in  that clip because the insurgents had broken through the barricades and  entered the building. And as these armed insurrectionists banged on the  doors, Members of Congress were told to put on their gas masks, to put  bags over their heads for safety, and prepare to evacuate. And Donald  Trump was calling to ask the Senator to delay the certification  process. Let that sink in.    Donald Trump didn't get to finish that call. It was cut off because  the Senators had to move to another location, for your security. And  thank God they did because as the call was occurring, the rioters got  closer to the Senate Chamber, and as we all know now, but for the  heroism of Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman and other law  enforcement officers who took them in a different direction to the  police line, they very likely would have gotten here.   Think about that. Armed insurrectionists with guns, weapons, zip  ties, brass knuckles, they were coming for us. They were inside the  United States Capitol, trying to stop the certification process. The  police were outnumbered. And but for the grace of God, they would have  gotten us, all of us.   And our Commander in Chief makes a call about an hour after the siege  began, not to preserve, protect, and defend you and our country and the  Capitol but to join forces with the mob and pressure a Senator to stop  certification. We just can't get numb to this kind of behavior.   There can be no doubt as to the purpose of Donald Trump's call, that  he was not calling to assess the security threats or to check on the  well-being of you or anyone else. Indeed, later on that evening, while  all of the destruction and damage still continued, dozens of officers  were being treated for serious injuries. Deaths were confirmed. About 7  p.m., the President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, made a call, and  just in case you don't think there was some coordination, he also  called Senator Lee's phone trying to reach Senator Tuberville. We don't  have to guess as to what Rudy Giuliani said in that voicemail because  we have it recorded. So let's listen to what the President's personal  lawyer said on the night of this attack.   (Text of audio presentation.)          Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is----    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The yeas and nays have been requested.   Is there a sufficient second?    Point of clarification.   What is the question?   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum while we work this  out.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, we need order.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.    I withdraw the quorum call and call on the manager, Mr.  Raskin, for a brief statement.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. Schumer.   The impeachment manager, Mr. Cicilline, correctly and accurately  quoted a newspaper account, which the distinguished Senator has taken  objection to, so we are happy to withdraw it.    So the managers' issue stands. Mr. Lee has withdrawn his  request, and we may relitigate it tomorrow if we have to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the trial adjourn  until 12 noon tomorrow, Thursday, February 11, and that this order also  constitute the adjournment of the Senate.   There being no objection, at 7:40 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned until Thursday, February 11, 2021, at  12 noon.
