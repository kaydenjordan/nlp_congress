 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 22  led by our Energy and Commerce Committee chairwoman, Cathy McMorris  Rodgers.   Earlier this week it was reported that after President Biden drained  over 200 million barrels out of America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  his Department of Energy is now rejecting multiple bids to refill it,  saying that oil is too expensive.   Mr. Speaker, this is hard to believe.   This administration--who has put a stranglehold on domestic  production by canceling pipelines, reducing drilling, halting leases,  and proposing burdensome regulations--is now telling the American  taxpayer: Sorry, we depleted your national reserves, sold some of it to  China, and now we won't refill it because it is too expensive.   Aren't they the ones making oil more expensive?   It is as if President Biden thinks the SPR is his strategic political  reserve to be used as a Band-Aid for his failed energy policies.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a needed course correction in our  national energy strategy, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
