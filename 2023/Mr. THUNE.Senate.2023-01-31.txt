 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it only took 2 years--2 years--for the  President to acknowledge the crisis that has been raging along our  southern border almost since the day he took office. Over those 2  years, we have seen record numbers of migrants attempting to cross our  southern border. We have seen record numbers of migrants die--die-- attempting the dangerous crossing of our southern border. We have seen  the Border Patrol overwhelmed, border cities overwhelmed, and dangerous  drugs continue to flood across our border and reach communities around  our Nation.   Yet, for months and months, the President did essentially nothing. In  fact, he acted as if the crisis didn't even exist. I am glad that, at  long last, the President seems to be acknowledging this crisis, even if  his recent visit to the border was scripted and controlled.   But it is appalling to think of how much human misery could have been  avoided if the President had lived up to his national security  obligations and addressed the border disaster many months ago. I  suppose it is not a surprise that the President wasn't eager to  acknowledge just how bad things were because that might have drawn  extra scrutiny to the President's border policies, policies that played  a substantial role in creating this crisis in the first place.   From the moment he took office and even before, President Biden made  it clear that border security was at the bottom of his priority list.  On his very first day in office, President Biden rescinded the  declaration of a national emergency at our southern border. He halted  construction of the border wall. He revoked a Trump administration  order that called for the government to faithfully execute our  immigration laws. And his Department of Homeland Security issued  guidelines pausing deportations except under certain conditions. And  that was all on his first day in office.   Well, needless to say, the effect of all this was to declare to the  world that the U.S. borders were effectively open, and we have seen the  result: 2 years of soaring illegal immigration. Since President Biden  took office, there have been more than 4.5 million attempted illegal  border crossings. Now, to put that number in perspective, that is  roughly equal to the entire population of South Dakota, plus the entire  population of Delaware, Wyoming, Nebraska, and then some.   Last month, 251,487 migrants were apprehended attempting to cross our  southern border, the highest monthly number ever recorded. And, of  course, these numbers just refer to individuals Customs and Border  Protection managed to apprehend. There have been a staggering 1.2  million known ``got-aways'' since President Biden took office,  individuals that the Border Patrol saw but were unable to apprehend.   President Biden has talked about wanting a safe, orderly, and humane  immigration system. Well, up until now, he has failed on all fronts.  Encouraging illegal immigration as the President's policies have done  is the very opposite of compassionate and humane. There is nothing  compassionate about policies that encourage people to attempt the  dangerous trip across our southern border, to run the risk of  exploitation and disease and exposure and death; nor is it  compassionate to condemn border cities to dealing with a never-ending  flood of illegal immigration and other cross-border illegal activity.   On top of all that, the kind of unchecked illegal immigration we have  been seeing is an open invitation--an open invitation--to drug  traffickers, human smugglers, and other dangerous individuals.   Our Nation is currently in the midst of a serious fentanyl crisis. In  fact, right now, fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death of  U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45. And where is all this  fentanyl coming from? Well, most of it is being trafficked across our  southern border. And I would be very surprised if the chaos at our  southern border isn't facilitating that trafficking.   And--let's be clear--drug trafficking across our southern border  doesn't just affect border States; it affects communities around our  country. I have  [[Page S155]]  talked to sheriffs in South Dakota, almost as far from our southern  border as you can get, who are dealing with fentanyl that has been  trafficked across the border from Mexico. Last year, Minnehaha County  Sheriff Mike Milstead estimated that 90 percent--90 percent--of  fentanyl and methamphetamine in our State, the State of South Dakota,  comes through Mexico. Again, I would be very surprised if the chaos at  our southern border hasn't facilitated that trafficking.   Our country has been shaped by immigrants from around the world, and  I am a strong supporter of legal immigration. I have repeatedly  introduced legislation to open up opportunities for individuals to come  from abroad and to work here in the United States when employers can't  secure enough domestic labor. But immigration has to be legal. It has  to be legal for security reasons, for humanitarian reasons, and because  we have a responsibility to uphold the rule of law.   I am thankful that the President finally seems to be, at least  halfheartedly, acknowledging our border crisis and he has recognized  his error in rescinding a number of policies that successfully took  pressure off the border. Now let's see how he follows through.   There are definitely things Congress can do to strengthen our border  security, deter abuse of our asylum system, and provide resources to  those serving on the frontlines against trafficking and smuggling. We  can also find ways to address some of the economic factors that  influence illegal immigration by leveraging legal pathways to allow  immigrants to fill jobs that American employers are struggling to fill.   But the fact of the matter is, while there are things Congress can do  to help, the President of the United States doesn't need an act of  Congress to move forward on securing the border. The President just  needs to enforce the law. For the sake of our national security, our  overwhelmed border communities, and the individuals tempted to make the  dangerous journey across the border, let's hope he does so.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
