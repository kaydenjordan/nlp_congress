 Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague and one- time President pro tempore of this body, Senator Leahy.                          75th Anniversary of D-Day    Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to talk about D-Day, to  talk about how we would remember the 75th anniversary tomorrow of a  turning point in World War II: June 6, 1944, the invasion of Normandy.   Historian Douglas Brinkley has written that D-Day was both the single  most important in the 20th century and one of the bloodiest and most  tragic, too, in terms of loss of life.   On D-Day, our fleets set forth from the rocky shores of Britain to  reach the fog-shrouded beaches of Normandy. On board the thousands of  ships and planes were our fathers and grandfathers and great- grandfathers--some no older than 18 years old--who would bravely  venture ashore in a show of determination and duty. There were  [[Page S3241]]  160,000 soldiers who crossed the English Channel that day. On their  backs were rucksacks, some weighing over 80 pounds. But really on their  backs was the fate of our allies in Europe and, really, the fate of the  free world. Were our men to fail that day, Europe might well have  fallen to Hitler once and for all.   Many of our best and brightest young Americans did fall. We lost more  than 10,000 men that day.   The Nazis had spent 2 years fortifying the coast to prepare for this  moment. It was Hitler's so-called Atlantic Wall. The beautiful  coastline of northern France was covered in barbed wire, landmines, and  bunkers. Hell had come to Earth to greet our men as they landed, and  still they fought on gallantly.   At the end of the largest amphibious invasion in history, we stood  victorious, battered but unbroken. On we marched, through France,  through Belgium, and finally into Germany. The world would never be the  same.   Even today among the beautiful flowers and fields of Normandy, you  can feel the lingering presence of those who died that day in service  of liberating Europe, and you can see it, as I have, at the stark,  orderly U.S. military cemeteries, where row after row of white crosses  and Stars of David stand defiant, representing lives lost in a noble  cause. Though much has happened in the following 75 years, we can never  lose sight of the valor and sacrifice displayed by our Armed Forces on  that day.   On Memorial Day, I spoke at the National Veterans Memorial Museum in  Columbus, OH, and also at a cemetery in Grove City, OH. In both  ceremonies, there were World War II veterans present and up front. To  see the generations of veterans and family members there to honor the  fallen was to see the living embodiment of the stories we ought to  remember from a war that recedes further into the past with each  passing year.   Stories of valor like that displayed by Jim ``Pee Wee'' Martin, from  Dayton, OH. On that day, he and the rest of the 506th Parachute  Infantry Regiment parachuted through German lines in the dark of  predawn. Jim was wounded but fought bravely, earning the Purple Heart  and Bronze Star for his D-Day efforts.   Stories of sacrifice like that of the Napier Brothers of Warren  County in Southwest Ohio. All five served in the war. Two of the  brothers of the five landed at D-Day. One died there on the beaches,  never to come home to Ohio.   These are stories to be preserved for the generations to come. The  memory of D-Day and, indeed, all of World War II must never be lost.  That is why I was proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle earlier today to show through our resolution the gratitude and  appreciation of the Senate for the courage shown by our troops who  participated in the Normandy landings that day.   Since I have been a Member of the Senate, I have come to this floor  often on D-Day to recite a very special prayer given by President  Roosevelt on that fateful day. It was expected that Franklin Delano  Roosevelt would give a speech when the invasion took place, as he had  done many times before, called the fireside chats from the White House.  But on the morning of D-Day, FDR was moved to prayer instead. That  famous prayer has become known as the D-Day prayer. It is my  understanding that President Trump actually recited this prayer just  yesterday in the United Kingdom at an event that preceded the official  ceremonies tomorrow commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day.   The words are powerful and deserve to be remembered for generations  to come. In 2013, I introduced legislation, the World War II Memorial  Act, which directs the Secretary of the Interior to install a plaque to  be placed on or near the World War II Memorial on the National Mall in  Washington, DC, with the words of the D-Day prayer. I like that because  it adds more context and more interpretation to that beautiful World  War II Memorial. It was the Ohio Christian Alliance president, Chris  Long, who first came to me with this good idea of placing this plaque  on or near the memorial, given its history and importance.   Since that legislation was signed into law in 2014, we have worked  hard with the National Park Service, the Friends of the National World  War II Memorial, and the two Federal commissions that are required to  approve any permanent structure on the National Mall. It has been 5  years now--actually longer than America's involvement in World War II-- and although we do not yet have this plaque placed, we have made  progress.   The commissions have approved the location of the plaque to be just  north of the World War II Memorial at the Circle of Remembrance. If you  have been to the memorial, you come from the Washington Monument, and  you see the Circle of Remembrance on the right. The commissions have  also approved initial design concepts for the plaque, which must comply  with the Commemorative Works Act.   We are moving forward with this project, by the way, without any  Federal funding. We are relying on private fundraising, not taxpayer  dollars.   We had hoped to have the plaque in place, of course, for the 75th  anniversary tomorrow. I am disappointed we don't, but, instead, we will  preview tomorrow the placement of a temporary plaque with the words of  the prayer at the chosen location, the Circle of Remembrance, next to  the World War II Memorial. At our event tomorrow--which will include  the chairman of the Friends of the National World War II Memorial;  officials from the National Park Service; Chris Long, president of the  Ohio Christian Alliance; and a number of World War II veterans--we will  also lead a reading of the D-Day prayer. I am looking forward to that  tomorrow.   The temporary plaque, by the way, was generously donated to the  Friends of the National World War II Memorial by Mr. John Nau, a member  of the National Parks Foundation Board, who felt strongly about at  least having a temporary plaque in place.   We are hopeful that the permanent plaque will be placed at the Circle  very soon.   The fact that a prayer was offered that day, on D-Day, by the  Commander in Chief is historic in and of itself, but I think it is the  content of the prayer that makes it so worthy of remembrance. If I may,  I would now like to read the D-Day prayer.   FDR began:         My fellow Americans: Last night, when I spoke with you       about the fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that troops of       the United States and our allies were crossing the Channel in       another and greater operation. It has come to pass with       success thus far.        And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in       prayer:        Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have       set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our       Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free       a suffering humanity.        Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms,       stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.        They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and       hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces.       Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return       again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the       righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.        They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without       rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by       noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the       violences of war.        For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They       fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end       conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice       arise, and tolerance and good will among all Thy people. They       yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the       haven of home.        Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive       them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.        And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives,       sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas--whose thoughts       and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to       rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of       great sacrifice.        Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single       day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the       desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a       continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again       when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips,       invoking Thy help to our efforts.        Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to       redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the       material support of our armed forces.        And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail,       to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our       sons wheresoever they may be.        And, O Lord, give us Faith. Give us Faith in Thee; Faith in       our sons; Faith in each other; Faith in our united crusade.       Let not  [[Page S3242]]       the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not the       impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but       fleeting moment, let not these deter us in our unconquerable       purpose.        With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces       of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and       racial arrogancies. Lead us to the saving of our country, and       with our sister Nations into a world unity that will spell a       sure peace, a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy       men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom,       reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.        Thy will be done, Almighty God.        Amen.    I think you will agree with me that these profound words deserve to  be made a permanent part of our broader World War II Memorial for a  noble day that we must never forget.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments talking  about a trip I took overseas last week. After honoring our fallen  soldiers here at home in Central Ohio and in Southwest Ohio, I traveled  to Ukraine, where I had a meeting scheduled with Ukraine's new  President, Volodymyr Zelensky. On my way there, I stopped in London for  trade meetings and briefings by our Ambassador and our excellent U.S.  Embassy personnel there.   I was very eager to meet President Zelensky. First of all, along with  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have been a longtime  supporter of Ukraine's quest for self-determination, democracy, and  freedom from Russian aggression. As cochair and cofounder of the Senate  Ukraine Caucus, along with my colleague Dick Durbin of Illinois, I have  been proud to take the lead since the Revolution of Dignity in 2014 in  giving Ukrainians the lethal and nonlethal aid they need to defend  themselves from aggression in Crimea and the Donbass region.   Second, I share that enthusiasm for Ukraine that is held by so many  of my constituents, friends of mine, particularly in Cleveland and that  area, who are proud members of the Ukrainian diaspora.   Third, I was very impressed with President Zelensky's election  victory, in part because he received a remarkable 73 percent of the  vote. I also thought his focus on reform and change was important for  the country. I wanted to meet with him and learn more about how and why  his appeals for unity largely succeeded.   Fourth, I wanted to hear more about his plans to fight the aggression  from Russia on his eastern border, fight corruption at home, and put in  place the reforms that will make his country stronger.   Finally, I wanted to tell him we are with him. The United States  stands by Ukraine, and the ties between our two countries can deepen  even further. We want to help Ukraine succeed in this historic moment.   I can report to my colleagues that I came away impressed from the  meeting with President Zelensky. I was encouraged. We talked for about  an hour and covered a broad range of topics. He is smart, engaging, and  determined.   We had a good discussion about Russian aggression in Crimea and in  the Donbass region. President Zelensky has been out to the contact  line, which is where the fighting is occurring. I was there last year.  There is a real war going on, and 13,000 people have been killed on the  eastern border of Ukraine, on that contact line. He spoke frankly about  the bravery of his troops but also about their needs in terms of the  weapons systems and basic conditions. We talked about the Russian  propaganda along the eastern border and the efforts to jam Ukrainian TV  signals to sow the seeds for dissension for the people of the Donbass  region. We talked about some ideas that would help to counter that  propaganda, the jamming, and the disinformation, and I have already  been in touch with the State Department about those ideas.   We also talked about the 24 Ukrainian sailors who were captured by  the Russians last November 25 in the Kerch Strait in the Azov Sea. At  that time, President Trump rightly refused to meet with President Putin  until those sailors were free. President Zelensky and I talked about  how to keep the pressure on Moscow to do the right thing. I gave  President Zelensky my commitment to do everything in our power here in  the Senate to keep these 24 sailors front and center until the crisis  is resolved.   Recently, the United Nations issued a statement about these sailors,  by the way. It read that they should be sent back to Ukraine, that  their taking was wrong.   I told President Zelensky that he is now the face of reform in  Ukraine and, indeed, for those of us who are watching around the world.  He acknowledged that with a smile. He said that his commitment to  reform is real, but he also had no illusions about how hard reform will  be. Whether we are talking about fighting corruption, fighting for  transparency in government, or fighting for civilian control of the  military, I am very hopeful he will have the continued courage to see  it through. He understands it is the only path forward and, frankly, is  a linchpin of the U.S. partnership with Ukraine. As a matter of law, it  is also a condition on our future defense assistance.   Finally, we talked about the importance of the Ukrainian diaspora in  the United States--about 2 million people strong, thousands of whom  live in Ohio, my constituents--and about how they are putting great  hopes in his leadership and are willing to do all they can to help.   As I said, it was a very productive meeting, and I am grateful for  his time. Of all of the messages of that discussion, the one that was  the most important to me was when I asked him how he could win by 73  percent of the vote. He said:         It was not about me. It was about change and reform and the       betterment of the people of Ukraine.    It was a modest and appropriate response.   The messages of our discussion were reinforced in my meetings  afterward with Lieutenant General Ruslan Khomchak. He is the new chief  of the general staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine--a man with great  experience and knowledge. He was confident and well informed, and we  had an open and detailed talk about how the United States can be  helpful.   I have already begun to talk to my colleagues on the Armed Services  Committee and in the Trump administration about those specifics and  some requests that he had.   So, my colleagues, I return from this brief trip to Ukraine hopeful-- hopeful that Ukraine is ready to write the next chapter of its long  history and that it will be a chapter of freedom with a government and  society that benefits all of its citizens. The United States of America  must continue to be a good friend and ally in that quest. I am  certainly determined to do my part to make it so.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
