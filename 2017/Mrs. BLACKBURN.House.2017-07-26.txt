 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division D (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  Each amount appropriated or otherwise made       available by this Act that is not required to be appropriated       or otherwise made available by a provision of law is hereby       reduced by 1 percent.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman  from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to begin by  thanking the committee for their hard work on this appropriations bill.   Every year, I come to this floor through the appropriations process  to present amendments calling for 1 percent across-the-board cuts. So  many years I have come down here to talk about how the spending  continues to increase. Indeed, our budget does increase. But I have to  tell you, the chairman and his team have done an incredible job this  year.   The outlays that we see in this bill this year are $209 million-- think about that--less than the budget authority from last year. That  is significant, and it should be recognized and should be praised,  because that is the type of work that we need to see.   Now, I do continue to present the 1 percent across-the-board  amendment because we are facing a time in our Nation where 1 percent  makes a difference, just as we are seeing from the good work that they  have done.   Passing this amendment for the 1 percent across-the-board spending  reduction would save us an additional $376 million. It is important to  do because our Nation is facing $20 trillion in debt. Because of that,  we have to ask ourselves: Is it important to spend some of the money  that is being spent on programs that we see taking place in the  Department of Energy?   It causes us to look at these programs and talk about priorities,  where we should spend those precious dollars that are not Federal  dollars. They are taxpayer dollars that are coming out of the pockets  of hardworking men and women.   Indeed, we have, many times, quoted Admiral Mullins' comments from  July 6, 2010, that the greatest threat to our Nation's security is our  Nation's debt. Because of that, I recognize and applaud the good work  that has been done, but I encourage support for my amendment and the  continued honing and prioritizing of what takes the taxpayer money that  is spent by this body.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will tell you every comment that Mr.  Simpson made about the mandatory spending is something that I agree  with. Yes, we have to do that. But just as we in Congress have reduced  our Legislative Branch budget by about 20 percent over the last few  years, and just as our Appropriations Committee has done a wonderful  job of pulling back on the spending that is done to discretionary, we  need to give that same challenge to the bureaucracy, to those rank-and- file Federal employees and challenge them to go save a penny on a  dollar out of what they are appropriated. Find a way to yield savings  to the work that they do and help us with this process to rein in  spending.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage support of the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 63 Offered by Mr. Perry    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 63  printed in House Report 115-259.
