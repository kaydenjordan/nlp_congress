 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize July 10 as  Chronic Disease Day and to call attention to the unique healthcare  needs of patients from this diverse community. This date is significant  due to the fact that it represents the 7 out of 10 Americans who will  succumb to some form of chronic illness. Governors and State  legislatures across the country will be  [[Page S4766]]  working with local chronic disease patient advocates on July 10 to  highlight contemporary challenges and opportunities, and I encourage my  colleagues to join in this effort.   Chronic illness includes cancers, cardiovascular disease, and many  other conditions, some very rare. Some chronic illnesses can be  preventable, and Chronic Disease Day is an opportunity to feature  healthy lifestyles, the importance of regular health screenings, and  proper self-care. In this regard, awareness and education can go a long  way towards improving patient outcomes, preventing the progression of  disease, and lowering healthcare costs.   Many chronic illnesses are unavoidable though and have genetic  components or are simply idiopathic with an unknown origin. These  include rare and life-threatening conditions that require near constant  access to life-sustaining care or therapies. These patient occasionally  rely on voluntary charitable assistance programs to maintain this  access when they have no other options.   July 10 is a time to promote the importance of preventing chronic  disease while reflecting on opportunities to better serve individuals  and families facing serious chronic illness. I call on my colleagues to  please join me in recognizing Chronic Disease Day.                            ____________________
