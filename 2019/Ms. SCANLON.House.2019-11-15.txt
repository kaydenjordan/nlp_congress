 Madam Speaker, every day I hear from constituents who  are going broke trying to pay for their prescriptions, and more often  than not they are seniors--seniors like Cheryl, who often has to decide  whether to forgo one of her monthly medications or to pay a $600  pharmacy bill.   Stories like Cheryl's are becoming both all too common and  unacceptable.   We are committed to lowering the cost of prescription drugs so that  Americans can afford their lifesaving medications.   That is why I have introduced legislation to eliminate some of the  barriers that seniors and people with disabilities have to getting the  medications they need.   The Better Tools to Lower Costs Act, which has been included in H.R.  3, would eliminate the asset requirement for CMS's Extra Help program.   As a result, low-income Medicare recipients with modest retirement  savings or a small rainy-day fund would get help to pay for  deductibles, premiums, and copays.    Families should not have to drain their life savings or sell their  homes to afford lifesaving medication. Commonsense solutions like this  and others in H.R. 3 will address the prescription drug crisis, and I  look forward to voting for it.                            ____________________
