 Mr. Speaker, with his poll numbers tanking, President Biden  is trying to buy off voters with mass student loan forgiveness. While  this elitist handout may win over his radical progressive base, it is a  slap in the face to taxpayers, especially those who never went to  college or spent years paying off their own loans.   Make no mistake, blanket loan forgiveness is simply retroactive free  college.   Why should a farmer in Idaho or a construction worker in New Jersey  pay the tuition bills of an Ivy League lawyer or a wealthy doctor?   Taxpayers are already footing the bill for Biden's student loan  repayment moratorium at the cost of $5 billion every month. Now the  Biden administration wants to take hundreds of billions more for his  student loan forgiveness scam.   This is wrong and unfair.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan for  yielding.   I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation to allow nurse  practitioners and physician assistants to act as eligible providers  under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act program  [[Page H5246]]  within the scope of their practice under State law.   Under current law, nurse practitioners and physician assistants are  unable to treat Federal workers covered by FECA, even though most State  workers' compensation programs authorize them to provide this care for  private-sector employees.   To be clear, H.R. 6087 defers to State law and does not expand the  scope of practice. This legislation aligns FECA with other Federal  programs that already include care provided by nurse practitioners and  physician assistants, such as Medicare and the Veterans Health  Administration program.   H.R. 6087 would increase healthcare access and choice for Federal  employees when many areas of our country are grappling with provider  shortages, especially in rural areas.   According to the National Rural Health Association, nurse  practitioners and physician assistants account for a third of all  primary care clinicians treating Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, and  they are closer to half of the primary care clinicians in rural areas.   Improving healthcare access for FECA beneficiaries would allow  injured Federal employees to return to the workforce more quickly,  benefiting both employees and taxpayers.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan  improvement to our Federal workers' compensation program. I thank my  committee colleagues, Representatives Walberg and Courtney, and  Chairman Scott for advancing this important legislation.
