 Mr. President, today I would like  to take a moment to recognize and honor the life of Dr. Thomas Moss, a  great South Carolinian who touched the hearts and minds of countless  people across our State. While Dr. Moss passed away in 2004, his legacy  lives on today in many ways and deserves to be honored still.   Dr. Moss was an Orangeburg, S.C., native and attended Morris College  in Sumter before being drafted into the U.S. Army to serve in the  Korean war. He was a lifelong advocate for education and civil rights  and devoted his life to the betterment of his community and State. He  was truly a servant leader, and in every capacity he held, he worked  tirelessly to make life better for everyone around him.   At the age of 41, Dr. Moss became the first African-American staffer  in the South Carolina congressional delegation and one of the few in  Congress as a whole. He served as a field representative for U.S. Sen.  Strom Thurmond for 30 years, during which he was a strong voice for  education, civil right, and social justice.   Dr. Moss has been recognized through countless awards and honors,  including the NAACP Freedom Fighter Award, the United States Senate  Loyal Service Award, and the Order of the Palmetto. His legacy lives on  today through the Thomas Moss Civic Leadership Award, through the  portion of Highway 301 in Orangeburg that bears his name, and through  the hearts of every South Carolinian whose life he helped improve.   Dr. Moss's integrity, dedication, and commitment should serve to  inspire us all, even today. He will not soon be forgotten, and I am  certain our State will benefit from his labors and accomplishments for  years to come.  [[Page S5359]]                                ____________________
