 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Farm  Girl Gifts and Bake Shop of Corydon, KY, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Entrepreneurship is undoubtedly a unique career path. I guarantee if  you ask any small business owner about the genesis of their business,  you will find that each start-up story is distinct in its own way. For  Farm Girl Gifts and Bake Shop, baking had long been a hobby of founder  and owner, Marganna Stanley, who spent the past 30 years working as an  educator in the schools of Henderson County, the last 6 of which as  Henderson County school superintendent. Though she has always been  passionate about teaching, Marganna did not let her 2020 retirement  stop her from chasing her other dream, that of owning her own business.   In late 2020, undeterred by the COVID-19 pandemic, Marganna opened  Farm Girl Gifts and Bake Shop, a place where one could shop for gifts  of all kinds, including glassware, skincare and bath products,  children's books and toys, along with a host of local artisan products.  Even with the wide array of gifts for sale, there are plenty of other  attractions at Farm Girl, namely, the excellent home-cooking of  Marganna and her staff. As the business name would indicate, baked  goods are her specialty. The team at Farm Girl Gifts and Bake Shop work  tirelessly to ensure that every customer has more than enough options  to choose from. From cookies to layer cakes, muffins to pies, sourdough  loafs to her signature tall cupcakes, Marganna and her team stay busy  in the kitchen.   As the only restaurant in the town of Corydon, Marganna makes sure  Farm Girl always has some hearty Kentucky cooking on hand to satisfy  any appetite. Though sweets are Marganna's specialty, sub sandwiches,  soups, and sliders are common attractions at Farm Girl Gifts and Bake  Shop. Moreover, Marganna brings her experience as an educator and her  love for teaching to her new business venture. When stocking her  shelves with Christmas gifts for the holidays, she made sure to include  educational books and toys for young children. She keeps the Farm Girl  atmosphere fun by creating competitions for her devoted customers. In  the summer of 2021, she announced that the customer who bought Farm  Girl's 10,000th tall cupcake would receive a $100 prize. She ended  2021, her first full year in business, having sold 9,678 of these tall  cupcakes. Shortly thereafter Farm Girl hit that 10,000 milestone and  that $100 bill found itself in one lucky customer's pocket. Her effort  to bring a fun and engaging feeling to her business harkens back to  Marganna's tenured career as an educator. Needless to say, his beloved  presence in Henderson County is still brightening the faces of Corydon  residents, young and old.   Farm Girl Gifts and Bake Shop is a wonderful example of how old  passions can lead to new adventures. Always a great steward of her  community, Marganna did not let a pandemic delay or deter her from  pursuing her dream of serving Henderson County outside of the  classroom. Always with a friendly smile, she continues on as a  steadfast member of her community, and Henderson County parents and  alumni alike make sure to stop by Farm Girl Gifts and Bake Shop to see  her familiar face.   Congratulations to Marganna Stanley and the entire Farm Girl Gifts  and Bake Shop team. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to  watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
