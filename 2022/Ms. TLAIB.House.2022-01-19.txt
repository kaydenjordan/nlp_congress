 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the late Wanda  Young, former singer of the renowned Motown Marvelettes and resident of  the Inkster community in Michigan's 13th District Strong.   Ms. Young made her mark on Motown when she was asked to join the  local singing group comprised of many of the Inkster High School  students and alumni.   The group, now known as the Marvelettes, was quickly signed to the  Tamla record label, later known as Motown Records.   They earned Motown one of its biggest hits with ``Please, Mr.  Postman.''   Wanda Young sang lead on many of the recordings including the hit,  ``Don't Mess Around with Bill.''   Ms. Young was an integral part of the Motown music scene and defining  sound of the 1960s.   Ms. Young's example has inspired countless women and African American  performers across our country.   Please join me in recognizing Wanda Young's contributions to our  Nation and Michigan's 13th District Strong as we honor her legacy at  home and across the globe.                        Recognizing Michelle Martinez     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Michelle  Martinez, Detroit resident and environmental justice warrior from  Michigan's 13th District Strong as she departs as executive director  from the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition.   For many years, Michelle has been a pillar of our community,  advocating for clean air and water, and fighting against environmental  racism that hurts our neighbors' quality of life.   Michelle has worked tirelessly, and I firsthand saw this myself, for  various organizations over the last 15 years and has never wavered in  seeking justice for the people who live with the effects of pollution.   I worked closely with Michelle on a number of initiatives when I  served in the Michigan State legislature, and she has been an amazing  person to watch grow as an advocate and leader in our State.   Michelle has always taken a bold approach to making transformative  change for our communities that is meaningful and has never shied away  from a challenge.   So please join me in recognizing Michelle Martinez' outstanding  contributions to the communities of Michigan's 13th Congressional  District as we wish her well on her next venture.     Congress has a Clear Mandate to Protect, Restore, and Expand Voting                             Rights in America     Madam Speaker, I rise today to make clear that we, as  Representatives of the people, have a clear mandate to protect,  restore, and expand voting rights in our Nation.   In my hometown of Detroit, election workers and community members  were intimidated, shouted at, and disrespected for simply counting the  votes of our community, a majority Black community, in November of  2020.   People banged on the windows, Madam Speaker, on the counting room  just because they didn't want Black and Brown votes to be counted.   Our community was treated like we were unworthy of making our voices  heard at the ballot box.   This should not be so complicated.   If our colleagues in the Senate fail to pass the Freedom to Vote:  John R. Lewis Act, their inaction will send a clear message to folks  that voter suppression is okay. Voter suppression is not okay. It  simply is not. Intimidating our election workers is not okay. Inaction  is not an option, and we must deliver for the people.                            ____________________
