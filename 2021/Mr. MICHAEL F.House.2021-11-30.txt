 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the FUTURE Networks Act, which is a bill that I have introduced,  along with my friends, Representatives Lucy McBath and Bill Johnson.   Our Nation's wireless networks are constantly evolving, bringing more  innovative services and connectivity to our constituents. Over my time  in Congress, I have watched wireless networks transform from the first  iterations of digital technology to 3G, then 4G, and now 5G networks  with achievable speeds well over 1 gigabit.   While these innovations have been extraordinary, the benefits have  not flowed to all Americans equally, and we have seen related policy  issues that have necessitated congressional action and regulatory steps  from the FCC. To ensure that all Americans benefit from the next  generation of wireless technology, 6G, we need to be considering it  now.   The FUTURE Networks Act will require the Federal Communications  Commission to create a 6G task force with members appointed by the  chair and comprising representatives from trusted companies, public  interest groups, and government representatives at every level of  government, including Tribes. The mandate of the task force would be to  report on possible uses, strengths, and limitations of 6G, including  any supply chain, cybersecurity, or other limitations that would need  to be addressed as the wireless technology evolves.   This bill would lay the groundwork for the policy considerations that  will certainly arise, and it is good, forward-looking governance.   I want to thank the cosponsors for their efforts on the bill,  Representatives Lucy McBath and Bill Johnson, and my bipartisan  colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their input and  support to strengthen this measure throughout the process.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the FUTURE  Networks Act.
