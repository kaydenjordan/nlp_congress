 Madam Speaker, I recognize Robert Wilson on his  achievement of the rank of Eagle Scout.   Robert is with Troop 4 in Millville in southern New Jersey.   Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of  America. It is a prestigious honor bestowed upon only the most worthy  and the most qualified individuals. Only 4 percent of all Boy Scouts  ever achieve this prestigious recognition. Eagle Scouts are likely to  dedicate their lives to service, becoming future leaders in industry,  politics, the military.   My office was proud to be at Robert's ceremony to celebrate his  achievement earlier this week with his scout leader, Lou Charlesworth.   I am proud of your accomplishments, Robert, and I am looking forward  to big things in the future from you.   Some people look for heroes with celebrities, God help them. Some  look in Washington, God help them, too. My hero is Robert.   God bless you and your family, Robert.                            ____________________
