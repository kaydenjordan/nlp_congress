 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so  that the House can consider the Prosecutors Need to Prosecute Act.   Madam Speaker, it is no secret that crime is out of control in this  country. Annual homicide records have been broken in at least a dozen  major cities. Brazen smash-and-grab robberies in broad daylight are a  daily occurrence. Killing, severe beatings, armed robberies,  carjackings, sexual assaults, arson, and looting have become a common  feature on the evening news.   Yet, rogue prosecutors in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco,  Philadelphia, New York City, and Milwaukee continue to release  predators from custody almost as fast as the police can arrest them.   The use of no-cash bail policies, plea bargains, and a complete  refusal to put dangerous repeat offenders behind bars has demoralized  our police and endangered our communities, and America's most iconic  cities resemble a Third World country.   I will give you an example in my home State. In Milwaukee County, we  witnessed back at Christmas a massacre at the Waukesha County Christmas  Parade, 6 people dead, 60 injured. How? With a guy that had a rap sheet  that had felonies, misdemeanors, statutory rape, resisting arrest, and  strangulation, and he was out on $1,000 bail.   Here is the worst part, though: That district attorney, John Chisholm  in Milwaukee County, here is what he said years ago about his  philosophy. ``Is there going to be an individual I divert, or I put  into treatment program, who is going to go out and kill somebody? You  bet. Guaranteed. It is guaranteed to happen. It does not invalidate the  overall approach.''   That is what we have for district attorneys around the United States.   Americans are sick and tired of the lawlessness, and they are  demanding accountability.   Madam Speaker, each year, jurisdictions across the United States  benefit from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant  program, which provides funding to States, Tribes, and local  governments to support a range of justice-related programs.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule, calling for immediate consideration of the Prosecutors Need to  Prosecute Act. It would, among other things, mandate that district  attorneys report to Congress on how often they follow through, holding  criminals charged with violent  [[Page H5356]]  crimes, like murder, rape, arson, crimes involving illegal guns, and  motor vehicle theft accountable.   They would also be required to disclose how often they prosecute the  initial charges, how often they secure convictions, whether or not  those charged were already on probation or parole, and how many  offenders were released without bail.   Madam Speaker, the American people need to know if the people they  have entrusted to keep their neighborhoods safe are actually using  their tax dollars to finance this crime wave.    It is time to end the policy of underwriting progressive  policies that endanger the lives and livelihoods of decent, hardworking  Americans, and that starts with transparency.   I urge my colleagues to stand with us for safer communities and  oppose the previous question.    Madam Speaker, not one word from our colleagues when it  comes to the crime waves in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles,  Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New York, San Francisco, and Philadelphia.   To do so would be to criticize their own soft-on-crime policies. It  has been going on for a decade now. They hope Americans ignore the  inconvenient truth. Criminals don't get background checks, and they  don't fear laws because rogue prosecutors financed by progressive dark  money groups don't enforce our laws.                                time  1630    These criminal strongholds and Washington, D.C., have one thing in  common: They are run by Democrats who refuse to enforce our laws.   This administration, responsible for a 40-year inflation high,  erasing our border, and a shrinking economy, will say anything to  distract from their own failures. Jimmy Carter says thank you for  making the seventies look good.   Week after week, we hear about violent criminals revictimizing  communities without being held accountable. The people furthering these  policies and making our communities less safe are the same people who  are fervently arguing to disarm Americans and defund the police. They  are the same people weaponizing the FBI against their political  opponents and the same people who want to repeal the Second Amendment.  I wish they would just tell the American people the truth instead of  deploying Trojan horses.   Whether it is rifle bans, 9-mm bans, Federal red flag laws, one thing  is certain: They will not change the outcomes for the people in those  cities.   As some Members of this body have said in the last few weeks: This is  just the beginning. We will not stop.   They will continue to erode our rights because they believe in a  nanny-state government, not a government of the people.   What Americans need is the enforcement of our laws holding criminals  accountable and protecting our constitutional rights.
