 Madam Speaker, I think we should mark this  down, March 29, 2022, the day that the people who were elected and came  to represent our folks back home actually got together and did  something on the House floor that was good for everybody in America.   We are not firing bullets back and forth at each other. We are  saying: Do you know what? Isn't it great, when we work together, what  we can get done.   Mr. Kind and I were walking over together, and he said: Mike, I am  really happy this happened because there is a lot in there that we both  worked on, and it looks like it is going to put a little more gold in  our retirees' pockets when they hit their golden years.   But this is one thing the press will never cover. They will never  say: My God, these Republicans and Democrats got together for American  workers to make sure that they go into retirement and lay their heads  on pillows at night and sleep because they know they have enough to get  through the rest of their lives.   What a moment. What a moment.   I have to tell you, I am so proud to be a part of this. I thank Mr.  Brady and Mr. Neal.   For both sides of the aisle, why don't we use this as an example as  we move forward as to what the heck we are supposed to do for the  people who sent us here to represent them?    Madam Speaker, I thank Kara Getz, from  Chairman Neal's staff, and Payson Peabody, from Ranking Member Brady's  staff, for working together on this. They get so little credit for all  the midnight oil they burn to make sure that we can get legislation  done. I thank them so much, not just for me but for all the retirees  and future retirees we have in this country.
