 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak  on a commonsense bill I introduced to promote accountability for  America's opioid crisis. The opioid epidemic has taken almost as many  lives as the COVID-19 crisis.   The Sackler family has amassed billions of dollars, in large part,  through the sales of Purdue Pharma's OxyContin. Members of the Sackler  family have been directly involved in the company's efforts to flood  our communities with this dangerous painkiller and to mislead the  public on the danger it poses to their health. Purdue has declared  bankruptcy, and members of the Sackler family are seeking legal  releases from individual lawsuits brought against them by government  entities.   My bill, H.R. 2096, the SACKLER Act, ensures that individuals accused  of wrongdoing by government actors, like the Sacklers, are prevented  from evading responsibility through bankruptcy proceedings.   I ask my colleagues for their support in this crucial effort to  ensure accountability for the harm the Sacklers have inflicted on our  communities, and to promote justice for lives lost to the opioid  epidemic.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York: Committee on Oversight       and Reform.
