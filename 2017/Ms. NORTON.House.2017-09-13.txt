 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment prohibits the District of Columbia from spending its  local funds to carry out a local antidiscrimination law, the  Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act. Unlike the D.C.  Council which passed this law, no Member of this Congress was elected  to legislate on local D.C. matters, or is accountable to the voters of  the District of Columbia.   This amendment gives employers the license to discriminate against  employees, their spouses, and their dependents, based on their private,  constitutionally protected reproductive decisions.   This amendment permits employers to fire a woman for having an  abortion due to rape, or to decline to hire a woman for using in vitro  fertilization, or to fire a man for using condoms, or to reduce the  salary of a parent for buying birth control for his or her child.   Contrary to the sponsor's claim, the D.C. law does not require  employers to provide insurance coverage for reproductive health  decisions. Importantly, the law states expressly, here this language:  ``This section shall not be construed to require an employer to provide  insurance coverage related to a reproductive health decision.''   The D.C. law is valid under both the U.S. Constitution and the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Indeed, the law has been in effect  for more than 2 years. It is now law. And there appear to have been no  lawsuits challenging it.   Under the U.S. Constitution, laws may limit religious exercise if  they are neutral, generally applicable, and rationally related to a  legitimate governmental interest. Under the Religious Freedom  Restoration Act, laws may substantially burden religious exercise only  if they further a compelling governmental interest in the least  restrictive means.   The D.C. law meets all of these requirements. That is why it has  never been challenged. The D.C. law also protects religious liberty.  The Constitution's narrow ministerial exception allows religious  organizations to make employment decisions for ministers and  ministerial employees for any reason whatsoever.   D.C. law permits religious and political organizations to make  employment decisions based on religious and political views. Under the  D.C. law, employees must be willing to carry out an employer's missions  and directives.   I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this amendment in order to protect  employees' reproductive health decisions, workplace equality, and  D.C.'s own right to self-government.  [[Page H7343]]    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette), one of the leaders of the right to privacy in  this Congress.    How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Chair, I don't know what the District of Columbia can  do to satisfy the ideologically driven Members on the other side. We  protected religious liberty. There have been absolutely no challenges.  Republicans persist in ignoring the plain wording on abortion, and,  above all, they have ignored their own groundwork principle of local  control.   This is a majority that yells local control for everybody except the  residents of the District of Columbia. We have defeated this amendment  before. We will defeat this amendment again, if not in this House, in  the other Chamber, I assure you. It is law. It is going to remain law.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes the repeal of the District of  Columbia's Local Budget Autonomy Act, which allows the District of  Columbia to spend its local funds consisting solely of local taxes and  fees after a 30-day congressional review period; and this is now law.   It is astonishing that my Republican colleagues are so at odds with a  local jurisdiction spending its own local funds without the approval of  a Federal body, U.S. Congress, and that the House will be voting for a  third time since May 2016 to repeal this local law. The first two  attempts were not enacted into law, and I expect this third attempt to  fail, too.   In fact, I should not even have to offer this amendment. The bill's  repeal of the Local Budget Autonomy Act violates the House rule against  legislating on an appropriations bill. Of course, the special rule  governing consideration of the bill prohibits me from raising a point  of order against the repeal provision, which would be sustained by the  Chair.   The Local Budget Autonomy Act is in effect. It is now law, I repeat.  This year, the D.C. Council passed its second local budget under the  Local Budget Autonomy Act.   Smart lawyers differed about the validity of the Local Budget  Autonomy Act when D.C. enacted it. However, the Local Budget Autonomy  Act has been litigated. The only court ruling in effect upheld it, the  ruling was not appealed, and the court ordered D.C. officials to  implement it.   Some House Republicans disguised their opposition to the Local Budget  Autonomy Act with legalistic arguments until Speaker Ryan revealed last  year the real reason the House passed the stand-alone bill repealing  the Local Budget Autonomy Act. He said: ``There are real consequences.  The D.C. government wants to use revenues to fund abortions in the  District. House Republicans will not stand for that.''                                time  1500    The Speaker was wrong about the effect of the Local Budget Autonomy  Act. Congress loses nothing under our budget autonomy law. Congress  retains the authority to legislate on any D.C. matter, including its  local budget, at any time. That is unfortunate, but that, too, is the  law.   The Local Budget Autonomy Act is a modest attempt by the District to  be able to implement its local budget soon after it is passed, like  other jurisdictions, instead of having it caught up in congressional  delays.   Indeed, the riders in the bill prohibiting D.C. from spending its  local funds on marijuana commercialization and abortion services for  low-income women were changed from those in prior appropriations bills  to account for the Local Budget Autonomy Act. Still, that is not  enough.   Historically, D.C. riders applied only to funds included in  appropriations bills, because only appropriations bills authorized D.C.  spending. In this bill, as in fiscal year 2017, the riders apply to  D.C. local funds available under any authority, including those in the  local budget passed under the Local Budget Autonomy Act.   Local control over the dollars raised by local taxpayers is a  principle much cited by my Republican colleagues, and it is, indeed,  central to the American form of government. Beyond this core principle,  budget autonomy has practical benefits for D.C., including lowering  borrowing costs, more accurate revenue and expenditure forecasts,  improved agency operations, and the removal of the threat of D.C.  government shutdowns during Federal Government shutdowns. These are our  concerns.   D.C.'s budget is larger than the budgets of 14 States, Mr. Chairman.  The District raises $8 billion in local funds. While D.C. is in a  better financial position than most cities and States in this country,  with a rainy-day fund of over $2 billion on a total budget of $14  billion, budget autonomy makes the District even stronger, as it must  be, because it has no State fallback.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
