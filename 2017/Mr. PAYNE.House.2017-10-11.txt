 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jaheir Moore, a seventh  grade student from Jersey City, New Jersey, for his service to people  in need.   This young man from my district takes the time nearly every day to  crochet hats, scarves, blankets, and other items for people in homeless  shelters and newborn babies in intensive care units. Over the past  couple of years, he has donated dozens of bags full of his creations to  make life a little better for others.   Jaheir is a straight A student who wants to become a fashion  designer. In February, he was a guest on the ``Rachael Ray Show.'' A  week later, Jaheir had his first runway show in Jersey City. In April,  I presented him with a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition  for his charity work.   Mr. Speaker, Jaheir Moore's unselfish acts of kindness for people in  need shows that our country's future is a bright one.                            ____________________
