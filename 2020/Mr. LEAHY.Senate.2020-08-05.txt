 Mr. President, Putnam ``Put'' Blodgett's lifetime of  service to the Vermont forest industry deserves special recognition.  Put personified the essence, values, and traditions of what makes  Vermont special.   Put's family moved to a Bradford, VT, dairy farm during the height of  the Great Depression. He attended Dartmouth College and returned home  in 1953 to work on the family farm, which he eventually took over and  continued to steward with his wife and children. Put left the dairy  business for other endeavors but maintained his connection to the  family land, working tirelessly to restore and manage its 700-acre wood  lot. Always focused on long-term sustainable management, Put placed the  acreage in conservation with the Upper Valley Land Trust, preserving  the forest for all generations. Put's son now manages the forest,  continuing that legacy.   Put and his wife, Marilyn, ran the Challenge Wilderness Camp,  teaching children about nature and guiding them on wilderness pursuits.  Children would travel from cities to live in an Adirondack shelter,  cook over an open fire, learn to canoe, and explore the forest. Put's  goal was to assist young people on their journey to adulthood,  cultivating their connection with the natural world. Watching our own  children and grandchildren play in woods and fields of our farm in  Middlesex, VT, Marcelle and I know how crucial it is for children to  have the experience in nature that Put and Marilyn provided to so many.   A true leader in Vermont's conservation and forestry community, Put  was the longstanding president of Vermont Woodlands Association and  oversaw the Tree Farm Program. He was recognized twice as Vermont's  Outstanding Tree Farmer of the Year. Our farm in Middlesex has been  enrolled in the Tree Farm Program for about 30 years, and I am deeply  appreciative of the value the program has brought to my land and to  Vermont.   Forest management discussions can be a tense tug-of-war between  environmentalism and timber management, but Put didn't see it that way.  He understood conservation as a shared priority--a public and private  good alike--and he worked to unite divergent stakeholders around this  common interest. I looked to Put for advice when writing Vermont  wilderness legislation and Put was a founding member of the Vermont  Natural Resources Council's Forest Roundtable, an open forum for  Vermonters to exchange information and recommend conservation policy.  On many occasions, Put helped opposing sides find that elusive common  ground on forest management policy.   Putnam Blodgett, as any true forester, worked with a mission to be  accomplished on a timeframe much longer than his own life span or a  single generation. Put passed away earlier this year, and yet I take  comfort knowing that the Green Mountains of Vermont are better for his  work here. To the great benefit of my grandchildren and many  generations to come, Put's legacy lives in the Northern Forest.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as the coronavirus pandemic continues and  in some places worsens, every business and public institution faces  significant challenges. These entities must make hard choices, adapt  quickly, and ultimately find the balance between the safety of their  employees and those they serve and their ability to keep their doors  open. The leadership and staff of one Vermont nonprofit, ECHO, Leahy  Center for Lake Champlain, has been a model of perseverance,  creativity, and commitment to serving  [[Page S4937]]  the community during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding creative ways to  bring their important programing and resources to the public.   The center, located in Burlington, VT is dedicated to educating  people of all ages and abilities about science, the natural  environment, and the importance of protecting the Lake Champlain  watershed and others like it. Recognizing the importance of equitable  access to achieving this mission, the center utilizes several programs  that break down financial barriers to its facilities and ensures that  these educational opportunities are available to all. Most years see  more than 167,000 visitors to this award-winning, LEED-certified  facility on the Burlington shores of Lake Champlain. Visitors of all  ages come to experience over 100 interactive exhibits and 70 different  species of fish, amphibians, and reptiles that inhabit the ecosystem we  call home.   When COVID-19 began to spread throughout the northeast, the center,  like so many businesses and facilities, was forced to close its doors  to the public. But though they were unable to welcome visitors into the  physical location, the center's dedicated staff were undeterred. After  closing their doors on March 14, the staff drew on their considerable  skills to quickly adapt to the new remote environment, offering a range  of online learning tools, including educational videos, instructions  for at-home science experiments, and live video feeds of animal  exhibits in order to support local schools and families. They even  continued remote programming for adults. including legislative updates  on water quality work through the Clean Water Network and an LGBTQIA  panel discussion during Pride Week. Some staff took it upon themselves,  wearing masks of course, to stealthily clean out the shelves of the  gift shop and set up remote centers of commerce from their own homes.  Animal care staff reported to work without interruption, and the  turtles and fish and frogs that call ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake  Champlain home, thrived, all while missing their human visitors.   Having helped with our State's great success in curtailing the spread  of the virus, ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain reopened to members  on June 29 and to all guests on July 4, with extensive health and  sanitary guidelines in place. Just as they were reopening, the center  even hosted a wedding on just a few minutes notice, after staff spotted  a well-dressed couple looking for a spot on the Burlington waterfront  and invited them in for the ceremony.   Lake Champlain is one of Vermont's greatest natural treasures, and it  has always been a priority of mine to preserve its beauty and the  ecosystem it supports, which in turn provides an irreplaceable  foundation for our state's economy. I am proud that all Vermonters can  look to ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain for opportunities to  instill a passion for scientific discovery, preservation of natural  resources, and stewardship of the Lake Champlain basin in the hearts  and minds people young and old, even during a pandemic. I especially  thank the staff at the center for their resilience, adaptability,  innovation, and unwavering commitment to continuing this important  work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize  a storied Vermont business, King Arthur Flour of Norwich, VT, for their  accomplishments over the years and their commitment to serving the  community during the COVID-19 pandemic Almost as old as the United  States itself, this company was established in 1790, just 1 year into  George Washington's Presidency. It began in Boston, with Henry Wood  importing high-quality flour from England, and has evolved into a  nationally recognized resource for home bakers and a beloved Vermont  company. In 1984, King Arthur Flour moved to Norwich, where the  business grew rapidly. Today, the brand is ranked second in the Nation  for overall flour sales. But the rise to fame doesn't mean they  abandoned the Arthurian principles that their name was inspired by.   In 2004, the family business was officially sold to its employees.  Such an act demonstrates the high value the company places on their  community and their employees. They also continue to source entirely  from American farms, to ensure high-quality production and to support a  sustainable agricultural economy. As always, they guarantee quality and  purity by promising their customers products free of bleach, bromate,  or any artificial preservatives. Through their commitment to their  employees, the community, and to delivering high-quality, responsibly  sourced products, this company truly demonstrates the values and  character of a Vermont business.   King Arthur Flour further confirmed their commitment to serving and  engaging with the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March of  this year, Americans were ordered to stay home to slow the spread of  the virus. This led millions of Americans to begin baking at  unprecedented rates. It was not uncommon to visit a grocery store this  spring and see the empty shelves in the baking aisle. Like many other  essential services, King Arthur was tasked with the need to fulfill a  rising demand, while also keeping their employees safe. True to their  character, King Arthur stepped up and did just that. Not only did they  get their products to consumers, they continued to staff the Baker's  Hotline. For the last several decades, King Arthur has been about more  than just selling products; they also want to educate and connect with  people. Inundated with calls and social media engagement from home  bakers, the company's baking instructors, whose jobs were put on hold,  began answering the Baker's Hotline and managing the high quantity of  social media interactions.   When the country needed an at-home pastime, King Arthur Flour  answered the call. I have visited their flagship store in the past and  can attest to the quality of their products and services. I applaud  them for their commitment to serving the national community during such  uncertain times. King Arthur Flour truly exemplifies what it means to  be a Vermont business and deserves enormous praise. Marcelle and I  visit their plant often in Norwich, and I am so proud of all they have  accomplished. King Arthur's story during the pandemic was recently  covered by Melissa Pasanen of the Vermont newspaper Seven Days, and I  request that excerpts of this article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From Seven Days, June 23, 2020]      How the Pandemic Propelled King Arthur Flour Into the National                                 Spotlight                            (By Melissa Pasanen)         Laurie Furch, a former bakery owner, has answered calls for       the King Arthur Flour Baker's Hotline for almost six years.       Every shift, she handles dozens of questions from anxious       bakers. She's used to troubleshooting problems such as Why       are my cookies taking an hour to bake? Or, Can I substitute       all-purpose flour for bread flour?        But not even the holiday baking season and its deluge of       calls prepared Furch and her teammates for the tsunami of       home baking appeals that struck the weekend of March 14. That       Sunday, the hotline handled a 50 percent spike in calls.        As the coronavirus pandemic shut businesses and schools,       and shelter-in-place orders rolled out nationwide, homebound       Americans were baking at an unprecedented rate--and they       needed help.        Millions of those bakers turned to Norwich, Vt.-based King       Arthur for advice--and for flour to fuel the new national       pastime.        The crescendo of phone calls was something the company       could handle by redeploying staff from its temporarily       shuttered baking education center and retail operation.       Addressing a nationwide run on flour that left grocery store       shelves bare was a bigger challenge.        ``Not only were people all learning how to bake,'' Furch       said, ``then Americans decided they all needed flour at the       same time.''        King Arthur started as a regional New England brand and       eventually developed national distribution for its products.       In recent years, when customers from Florida or California       emailed to ask where to buy the flour, they could be referred       to a nearby supermarket.        The pandemic changed that--and shone a national spotlight       on a beloved Vermont company and how it does business.        It's a welcome story that demonstrates nice guys can finish       first.                            `The New Hot Category'         Normally, the flour business is pretty sleepy and doesn't       tend to grab headlines.  [[Page S4938]]       Plain wheat flour is a low-margin business that many       consumers consider an undifferentiated, basic commodity.        ``If you want to make money, you don't grow potatoes; you       sell potato chips. You don't sell flour; you sell breakfast       cereal,'' explained Jeffrey Hamelman, a certified master       baker and retired original director of King Arthur's Norwich       bakery.        But COVID-19 has affected almost everything, including the       flour world.        March is the slowest time of the year for flour sales,       although it leads up to Easter, which is the second busiest       baking season after the winter holidays.        So Bill Tine, King Arthur's vice president of marketing,       was surprised when, seemingly out of the blue, hotline call       volume took its giant leap in mid-March.        Tine said he recalls a late Sunday evening phone call to       check in with colleagues about the unusual numbers. But,       honestly, he said, that period of time is a blur. King       Arthur, like every essential business, was busy figuring out       how to keep going and keep its employees safe. Then,       unexpectedly, they were simultaneously faced with the sudden       spike in demand for flour and baking advice.        The week of March 16 was when grocery store orders started       to pick up in an unseasonal way. Over the next four weeks,       they leapt 600 percent over prior year sales, Tine said.       There were well-publicized shortages of toilet paper and hand       sanitizer, but, he said, ``It was a little bit of a shock       that all of a sudden flour became, like, the third thing that       started to go out of stock.''        In response to empty grocery shelves, more consumers       ordered direct from King Arthur than ever before, reaching       six times normal sales.        On April 19, the company tallied a new one-day website       traffic high of close to 1 million user sessions and 2.3       million page views. It blew past the previous record of       542,000 sessions on the day before Thanksgiving 2019.        And the orders looked different, Tine said. Direct sales       were traditionally a mix of harder-to-find specialty       products. But now consumers were ordering the core       supermarket item they could not find: King Arthur's signature       5-pound red-and-white paper bag of flour.        While management was scrambling to get those bags back on       grocery shelves nationwide, Furch, her hotline colleagues and       the team that handles social media interactions were on a       neverending hamster wheel.        As call volume snowballed, it started to feel ``like a       continual Christmas season,'' Furch recalled. All told, the       calls, emails, social media interactions and web traffic       across April and May saw a sixfold increase.        Management did what it could to deepen the bench. The four-      person digital engagement team grew to 17, thanks to bakers       and baking instructors whose regular jobs were on hold or       much reduced. The hotline similarly drew on six       reinforcements from within the company, bringing its ranks to       21.        At no time, according to Tine, did the company technically       run out of flour. What it ran out of was enough bagged flour       to feed the newly voracious appetite of Americans stuck at       home.        During the initial spike, Tine explained, King Arthur had       enough flour to fill orders because the pipeline was full in       preparation for Easter. In fact, throughout the whole flour       ``shortage,'' he said, there was never insufficient grain or       even milling time to turn the grain into flour. The       roadblocks were bagging capacity and speed of distribution.        Starting in mid-March, King Arthur was in constant       communication with its milling and distribution partners to       add shifts and speed up delivery, Tine said. The company paid       the extra cost of shipping flour from mills by truck instead       of the usual railcars. And King Arthur signed a contract with       a new distribution center to get grocery shelves restocked as       quickly as possible; it also negotiated a partnership with an       additional mill.        But no matter what company leaders did, it felt like they       were just plugging holes in a leaky bathtub. There simply       were not enough additional bagging lines at any of their       partners to fill the orders.        ``As soon as a truckload of flour came in, it was sold that       next day,'' Tine said. Unlike toilet paper hoarding, he       pointed out, people were using all the flour they bought and       heading back for more: ``People were actually baking.''        To the surprise even of those in the flour business, it       turned out that the quarantine was compelling people to bake,       whether because they couldn't get out to buy their daily       loaf, they craved comfort food or they simply had a lot of       time on their hands. Suddenly, social media feeds were filled       with photos of pies, cakes, cookies and crusty loaves of       sourdough tagged #quarantinebaking.                                 Speaking Up         King Arthur's management team is well aware that there is       always room to do better. Last November, senior leadership       started ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion training. The       program was to be rolled out to the entire company, until the       pandemic put it on pause.        ``We've got to be more proactive and more forward-looking       on how to make sure that we're actively getting all people to       our table,'' said Tine.        While women are well represented in management at King       Arthur, the company has very little racial diversity. ``We       live in a white state,'' said co-CEO Karen Colberg, quickly       adding, ``That doesn't absolve us from trying to talk about       [race], to raise awareness, to make change and to be in it.''        On June 1, King Arthur reacted to the protests sparked by       the police killing of George Floyd with a social media post       condemning ``the devastating racial injustices that continue       to plague our country'' and announcing a $200,000 fund to       support racial justice changemaking organizations.        This was a big step for a company whose potentially       controversial statements had previously been limited to ``Say       no to raw dough'' (due to the risk of E. coli in raw flour,       not salmonella in raw eggs).        Only a few hundred of the 39,0000-plus Facebook reactions       to the racial justice post were negative. The social media       team responded with a firm but empathic reiteration of the       company's position.        Social advocacy, Colberg acknowledged, ``is new for King       Arthur, and it's the right thing to do for us.'' The company       had been planning to launch a Pride Month campaign instead on       June 1 but decided to postpone it. Although some have accused       big consumer brands of jumping on the cause bandwagon, King       Arthur felt compelled to take a clear stand, she continued,       ``not because of some expected payoff--though I do believe       people value it.''        To those who say King Arthur should stick to baking,       Colberg responds, ``If we can't speak to what is unfair . . .       then we are not being responsible leaders to our organization       and our society as a whole. There are so many injustices out       there and we have to do better.''                                  New Normal         At about 9:30 a.m. on Friday, June 12, the bread bakers at       King Arthur's Norwich headquarters were wrapping up their       shift that had started at 3:30 a.m. Masked and well spaced,       two bakers lifted rounds of dough, folding and shaping them       deftly.        On the pastry side, the scent of cinnamon was so strong it       seeped through the glass viewing windows and visitors'       mandatory masks.        During Vermont's ``Stay Home, Stay Safe'' period, the King       Arthur bakery continued to bake at reduced volume for local       customers. The retail store had just reopened with strict       safety guidelines. Jeanne Seymour had driven 70 miles from       Guilford as soon as she heard the news. Her basket was soon       full of baking tools and ingredients.        ``I love that it's Vermont, that it's one of our       companies,'' she said, ``and that it's employee-owned.''        In a classroom, a pair of education center employees were       bagging loaves they'd baked for local community groups. The       tally had just reached 10,000 loaves donated during the       pandemic--15,000 including those baked at King Arthur's       Washington education center. Both locations are targeting       late July or early August to restart classes--albeit with       fewer students to ensure social distancing.        The Norwich complex fondly known as Camelot by King Arthur       employees is slowly moving back toward normal.        The question for King Arthur is what ``normal'' will look       like, at that facility and around the country. Baking usually       slows in the summertime, Tine said, but as of mid-June, sales       are up more than 50 percent compared to a year ago. ``I would       say that they're settling in, not settling down,'' he said.       ``We're settling in to a new normal.''        The company feels confident it has developed systems to       respond to any future spike in demand. The challenge, Colberg       explained, is to figure out how to nurture the new interest       in baking hatched by the pandemic. ``How do we engage people       that have shown some interest in baking and keep them       baking?'' she pondered.        The bigger question, perhaps, is whether baking during the       pandemic has taught Americans anything.        ``I think people like the tactile aspect of it: the       touching, the smelling, the feeling. We don't always engage       all of our senses in what we do,'' Furch of the Baker's       Hotline said. ``Baking also forces you to pay attention to       somebody else's rhythm, which is the rhythm of the dough. I       think people are learning patience.''                            ____________________
