 Mr. President, I appreciate the comments my colleague  from Colorado has made on energy. I have an energy speech here, also.  We have the same goals, maybe coming from different perspectives, but  both the Senator from Colorado and I are trying to achieve the same  thing.   I appreciate his hard work. He and I have worked well together over  the years on the Finance Committee, as he mentioned, with the  investment tax credits to make alternative energy viable products and  industries in both of our States and across this country, so I  appreciate his hard work.   Mr. President, I come to the floor of the U.S. Senate today to  discuss an issue that is extremely important to the State of Nevada,  and that is Yucca Mountain.   For over 30 years, those two words, ``Yucca Mountain,'' have incited  frustration and anger for Nevadans across my State. It is not just a  mountain 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas; it represents a decade-long  fight by some in Washington to ``wrong Nevada.''   In 1982, the Congress approved the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and  charged the Department of Energy with finding a long-term storage site  for the disposal of spent nuclear material. At the time, Yucca Mountain  was one of the many proposed geological sites to investigate.   Unfortunately, in 1987, the act was amended to concentrate only on  one place, Yucca Mountain. Nevada, a State without any nuclear  powerplants, was legally compelled to bear the sole burden of long-term  storage of all of the Nation's nuclear waste. This decision was made on  bad politics; it was not made on sound science. Ever since, the debate  on solutions to this problem has been one-sided, and the study of  alternative solutions has been curtailed.   Instead of honoring Nevada's persistent scientific and procedural  objections to the repository, the Federal Government has spent decades  of time and wasted billions of dollars to design and permit Yucca  Mountain, all without any notion that Nevada would consent to the  project.   I have spent the past decade in Congress successfully fighting off  efforts to force this project on Nevada, and I will continue this fight  for as long as I serve my State.   I want to be clear: Nuclear power is an important part of our  Nation's energy portfolio. I am one of the most outspoken Republicans  in Congress advocating to make our Nation's energy cleaner and more  affordable. Nuclear energy, which represents about 20 percent of our  Nation's power production, plays an important role in providing carbon  emission-free baseload energy in many States, but Nevada--again, a  State without a nuclear powerplant--should not have to shoulder the  Nation's entire waste burden.  [[Page S2075]]    We have pursued other strategies to meet Nevada's energy needs. I can  share a couple of those examples with you. More than two-thirds of  Nevada's energy is produced by natural gas-fired powerplants. Just 2  weeks ago, I was at a groundbreaking at the Moapa Southern Paiute Solar  Project, the first-ever utility scale powerplant to be built on Tribal  land. This project will produce 250 megawatts of clean energy capable  of generating enough clean energy to power an estimated 111,000 homes.   Last March, I joined with the Italian Prime Minister in celebrating  the world's first combined solar-geothermal plant near Fallon, NV. This  facility provides 26 megawatts of solar photovoltaic, 2 megawatts of  solar thermal, and 33 megawatts of geothermal energy to Nevada  customers.   Nearly half of the geothermal plants producing baseload clean energy  in this country are located in Nevada alone. So overall, more than  2,000 megawatts of utility-scale renewable energy in Nevada, enough to  power nearly 1 million homes, has been built to meet Nevada's needs.  That includes 19 geothermal energy plants, 12 solar projects, 6 hydro  facilities, 4 biomass or methane projects, 1 large wind farm, and 1  energy recovery station. These are just some of the examples we are  doing in Nevada. Yet they continue to try to ram Yucca Mountain down  our throats as if we are not doing enough.    As we examine viable solutions to the waste problem, it is important  to note that there are some promising technological developments that  could fundamentally change the Nation's waste storage needs. There are  new reactor technologies that could repurpose previously generated  spent fuel and produce carbon-free electricity with little or no waste.  International research and development on innovative storage solutions  and recycling processes could also be part of that solution.   Given the Yucca-centric strategy's previous failures, it would be  logical for the government to try something new--some of these  strategies that show promise--but, no, not here in Washington.  Washington is at it again. Apparently, nearly 30 years of wasted time  and billions of squandered taxpayer dollars is, simply, not enough.   The Department of Energy recently submitted what they call a skinny  budget, including $120 million, in part, to restart licensing  activities for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. That $120  million is a lot of money in itself, but let's be clear that it is just  a fraction of the true costs.   Nevada has made it clear that it will contest each and every one of  the 200-plus elements of any license application. State and Federal  officials have estimated that the licensing process for Yucca Mountain  will take 4 to 5 years and cost in excess of $1.6 billion.   In these difficult times, I ask my colleagues: Is it financially  prudent to invest over $1.6 billion in any program that has not yielded  results in over 30 years?   In case there is any confusion, I want to make sure everybody  understands that Nevada's position has not changed and that it is not  going to change on this issue. Our Governor, Brian Sandoval, continues  to strongly oppose the project. In fact, he shares my same sentiment,  and he shared it with me a few weeks ago when he stated:         I will vigorously fight the storage of high-level nuclear       waste in Nevada. Any attempt to resurrect this ill-conceived       project will be met with relentless opposition and maximum       resources.    Every serious presumed candidate for Governor in 2018--both  Republicans and Democrats--strongly opposes Yucca Mountain. Nevada's  attorney general, Adam Laxalt, recently requested $7.2 million of State  resources over the next 2 years to represent the State's interests in  the licensing process over Yucca Mountain, which he called ``a poster  child of federal overreach.'' Soon, our legislature will reaffirm the  State's opposition to the project with the passage of Assembly Joint  Resolution No. 10.   To sum it up, it will cost at least $1.6 billion just to get through  the application process. Think about that. It will take $1.6 billion  just to get through the process, to get the applications ready, let  alone to get the storage facility actually operational.   Make no mistake about it. I will continue to lead the Nevada  congressional delegation's effort to stymie any misguided effort to  spend one more Federal dollar on the Yucca Mountain repository. It is  fiscally irresponsible and, simply, will not solve this important  public policy issue that faces our Nation.   I implore my colleagues to work with me in a pragmatic way to solve  our Nation's spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level waste storage  problem that we have.   There is an old adage, and we have all heard it: The definition of  doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different  results is called insanity. Efforts by the executive branch and some  Members of Congress to direct billions more toward a repository that  will never be built is just that--insanity.   Our Nation cannot fully move forward with viable solutions until  Congress moves past Yucca Mountain. Last year, the Department of Energy  began a consent-based siting initiative to find alternative storage and  disposal facilities. Identifying communities that are willing to be  hosts for long-term repositories, rather than forcing them upon States  that have outright opposed such sites for decades, is the only  sustainable path forward.   I wholeheartedly support these efforts. In fact, I introduced  bipartisan legislation earlier this year, the Nuclear Waste Informed  Consent Act, to codify it into law. This strategy was wisely  recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future-- a 15-member, bipartisan group that is tasked by the Federal Government  to develop feasible solutions to nuclear waste disposal. This type of  open process ensures all Americans have a meaningful voice in the  process if their communities are being considered for a future nuclear  waste repository.   I am confident that the government can find safe sites through the  careful consideration of all alternatives that are based on credible  scientific information and not by politicians here in Washington, DC.  Let's stop the insanity. The administration and congressional Yucca  advocates should focus their efforts on practical solutions and not on  more of the same.   First, let's advance innovative energy technologies that repurpose  and reduce spent fuel.   Second, let's invest in the research and development of recycling and  alternative storage methods.   Third and most importantly, let's identify safe and viable  alternatives for the storage of nuclear waste that remains in areas  that are willing to house it.   These are worthwhile initiatives that actually, to use a football  analogy, ``move the ball down the field.'' For far too long, our Nation  has been going ``three and out'' because Washington keeps trying to run  the same, stale game plan.   I am working diligently on feasible solutions to this important  problem, and I urge my colleagues here today, on the floor of the U.S.  Senate, to join me in that fight. I stand here, ready to work for what  is best for my State and what is best for our Nation.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
