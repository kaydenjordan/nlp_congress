 Mr. Speaker, on rollcalls 291, 292, and 293, I am  not recorded. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 291, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 292, and ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 293.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION     Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman for  the time and rise in strong support of her bill, the Defense  appropriations  [[Page H5717]]  bill. I know I join Mrs. Lowey in congratulating Ms. Granger and Mr.  Visclosky for their excellent Defense appropriations bill and their  joint dedication to a very bipartisan product. They continue, I think,  a very proud tradition.   Let me also acknowledge and thank the men and women who helped  produce the bill who stand or sit behind us and who have been mentioned  by both the ranking member and chairman. I want to thank them for  making us look good and making sure that we have a very professional  product.   I do want to take the opportunity to thank the personal staff of the  members on the committee as well as Steve Wilson from my office who has  worked on my behalf for 15 years on defense issues.   The distinguished chair, Ms. Granger, and Mr. Visclosky have outlined  the specific recommendations and highlights of their bill. As we are  aware, the bill totals $675.6 billion for the Department of Defense.  This is consistent, as Ms. Granger has mentioned, with the bicameral,  bipartisan budget agreement hammered out last spring.   In addition to the increased funding in this bill, the balanced  budget agreement also has provided what we call critically important  stability and predictability to the Department of Defense, our Armed  Forces, and our defense industrial base. Enhancing their ability to  plan even in the short term is good news for national defense and that  of our partners.   For the future, I am deeply concerned that a return to the arbitrary  caps established under the Budget Control Act 8 years ago would again  force a return to the shortsighted, budget-driven thinking on national  security spending that took place in recent years.   Mr. Chairman, the rebuilding of our military continues today with  this legislation. This bill includes funding for more equipment, more  munitions, more troops, and more training. Restoring readiness is a key  objective of this proposal.   We routinely ask our men and women in uniform--all volunteers--to go  to great lengths to complete their missions, and they must be well- equipped, well-trained, and well-supported. That is why this bill  includes $246 billion for operation and maintenance--funding that will  provide for more battle training, more flight hours, more steaming  days, and more depot maintenance.   The bill also includes a total of $144 billion for military  personnel, increasing the size of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and  Marines. I would also note that the chairman has mentioned we provide a  2.6 percent pay increase for our troops--the largest such pay increase  in 9 years.   The bill also looks after our Armed Forces and their families by  providing funding for the Defense Health Program, continuing critical  research, and sustaining the well-being of our military's most valuable  resource--its people.   Beyond these important investments that will rebuild our military in  the near term, the bill prepares for the future by providing research  and development funding to modernize our military to meet current and  future threats: the continued menace of terrorist networks in the  Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa; ongoing threats by Iran and  North Korea; the belligerent re-emergence of China; and the military  expansionism of Russia and China.   Mr. Chairman, the legislation also acknowledges emerging dangers and  challenges at home and abroad posed by drones, cyber war, and  transnational crime, and makes investments in capabilities such as ISR  and artificial intelligence to prepare and protect against these  threats.   In short, this bill prepares our warfighters to meet any challenge  anywhere at any time.   Mr. Chairman, the Department of Defense appropriations bill before  the House today is the largest and arguably the most important bill of  our annual appropriations process. It deserves our support.                                time  1630    I congratulate the chairman, Ms. Granger, and Mr. Visclosky for  putting forward an excellent bill on behalf of our Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 20 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 27, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
