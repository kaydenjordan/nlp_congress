 Mr. Chairman, I want to start by saying thank you to  Congressman Sarbanes for his important work on leading this  legislation.   I am proud that we are bringing forward H.R. 1 to restore faith in  the legislative branch, because right now Congress is less popular than  head lice and colonoscopies. That is because every time my constituents  see a bill that is written behind closed doors, or see a government  shutdown, or see floor debate that looks like the Jerry Springer Show,  they need to see a restoration of faith in government.    This bill will protect voting rights, strengthen ethics rules, and  reduce the role of big money politics. It will refresh our democracy;  and that is why the new Democrat coalition has endorsed this bill.   Listen, we don't talk enough about it. This bill includes bipartisan  provisions in support of good government. It includes a bipartisan bill  that I am leading, the Restoring Integrity to America's Elections Act,  which would reform the Federal Election Commission, and enable it to  weed out campaign finance abuse, and hold those who skirt the rules  accountable.   It includes the Honest Ads Act, my bipartisan bill.    It includes the Honest Ads Act, my bipartisan bill that  would shine a light on the murky world of online political advertising  by requiring digital ads to meet the same disclosure requirements as  print or broadcast ads.   Americans deserve to know who is paying for political ads that they  see online. They deserve to know that the Nation's election watchdog is  back on the beat. They deserve to have their voices heard in Congress  again. That is why this bill is important. That is why I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
