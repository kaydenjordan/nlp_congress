 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment  to H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act.   I thank my colleague, Representative Fitzpatrick, for joining in this  bipartisan proposal. PFAS chemicals, as we have been hearing today, are  harmful, manmade forever chemicals that are persistent, bio- accumulative, and toxic.   These chemicals, which threaten more than 100 million Americans, pose  serious risks to human health, including cancer, immune disorders, and  reproductive system maladies.   The PFAS Action Act will take critical steps to protect all Americans  from PFAS chemicals by helping clean up contaminated sites under the  Superfund program, limiting the exposure of PFAS chemicals, and  establishing a health-protective drinking water standard that limits  the amount of PFAS in our water systems.   My amendment would strengthen the PFAS Action Act by expanding EPA's  ability to use the best-available science to address PFAS risks by  requiring manufacturers to provide reference standards for all PFAS  chemicals. This effort will help reduce PFAS pollution and keep our  families safe.   My amendment will provide the EPA with critical data about PFAS  chemicals and help the agency better identify these toxic substances in  our communities.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and the  underlying bill and vote in favor of this important legislation.
