 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the supplemental  appropriations bill.   I want to commend Chairman Frelinghuysen and the committee staff for  their quick and thorough work to put this supplemental package  together, and I thank the leadership for its swift action in scheduling  this for House consideration.   In fiscal year 2017, the Forest Service had a shortfall of nearly  $577 million in firefighting funds. To cover its immediate firefighting  costs, the Forest Service borrowed from its nonfire programs, as well  as the Department of the Interior.   The bill will replace and repay those borrowed funds and close the  books on fiscal year 2017. Specifically, it provides $526 million for  the Forest Service and $50 million for the Department of the Interior.   The cost of fighting fires on our national forests and other public  lands has increased dramatically over the last 15 years, yet these  fires and costs remain highly unpredictable.   Right now the West is on fire. In my home State of California,  firefighters are battling 22 large wildfires that have burned nearly  170,000 acres. The bill gives the government the tools it needs to  assist local officials to get those fires under control as soon as  possible.   We, the Congress, need to fix the way we budget for wildland fire so  that the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior can focus on  managing our Federal lands appropriately. We also need to give them the  necessary legal authorities and tools to improve the condition and  management of our national forests.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
