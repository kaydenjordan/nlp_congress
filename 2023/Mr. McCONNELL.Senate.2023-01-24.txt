 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Biden administration has spent 2  years turning its back on the proven tools and policies that  Republicans used to strengthen our southern border--2 years of a  functionally open borders policy from Washington Democrats and 2 years  of chaos and suffering as a result.   Last week, Customs and Border Protection announced that an already  recordbreaking year ended on a particularly catastrophic note. Illegal  immigration apprehensions clocked an alltime high of more than 2.7  million during the last fiscal year--by far the highest annual total  ever recorded. But then December set an astonishing  [[Page S63]]  record all by itself at over 250,000 apprehensions. Last month was  CBP's busiest month ever recorded.   The American people are outraged at this willful failure. They rate  immigration and the border as one of the single biggest problems facing  our country, second only to the economy.   Two-thirds--two-thirds--of the country disapprove of President  Biden's handling of immigration and the border. That is a 67-percent  supermajority of Americans who believe this administration is failing  on border security.   Our Democratic friends tie themselves in knots making excuses for why  they can't simply do their job, enforce Federal law, and secure our  border. Their far-left base makes them pretend that we can't enforce  the laws on the books unless--unless--we find new ways to be even more  generous to people who come here illegally. It is nonsensical.   Even local officials who belong to the Democratic Party are rapidly  losing patience with the Biden administration's border incompetence.             The Democratic mayor of New York, Eric Adams, has spent months  sounding the alarm on the catastrophic effects of this administration's  functionally open borders.   He said:         This is a national crisis.    He said:         There is no more room in New York.    Yet the far left attacks him, the mayor of New York, for pointing out  the problem.   The Democratic Governor of Colorado is taking a cue from Governor  Abbott and Governor DeSantis and arranging transportation for illegal  immigrants to various liberal jurisdictions that have self-identified  as so-called sanctuary cities.   There is a growing bipartisan chorus that is begging--begging-- President Biden to do his job and secure our Nation. It doesn't take  new laws. It doesn't take some new, grand bargain or amnesty. The  administration just needs to do its job: Secure the border, and let law  enforcement enforce our laws. The Biden administration has all the  tools and authorities it needs to tackle this crisis--if a solution  were actually what they were after.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, it has been a  full year since Putin escalated Russia's brutal war against Ukraine and  nearly 9 years since he began his military effort to take over the  sovereign country in early 2014. Putin's nonmilitary efforts to meddle  in Ukraine, undermine it, and control its population long predated even  2014. It has been 15 years since Putin invaded Georgia. A few years  before that, he said publicly the breakup of the Soviet Union was ``the  greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.''   The former KGB agent who has run the Kremlin for two decades has been  very, very consistent: repression at home, aggression abroad,  assassinations, invasions, poisonings, and political interference. And  whenever the rest of the world responded with accommodation rather than  with resolve, Putin drew the natural conclusion that he could do  whatever he wanted.   But for the past 11 months, the brave men and women in Ukraine have  defied the odds. They have endured tremendous hardship and stood their  ground. They have fought bravely for their families, their freedom, and  their country.   At every step of the way, investments from the United States and our  allies have equipped the Ukrainian people to exact a heavy price from  the Russian invaders. Western assistance has played a key role, but it  has come too slowly and haltingly.   Despite my urging the Biden administration to act sooner, aid did not  come early enough to help Ukraine deter Putin's escalation before it  actually happened, nor to slow down Russia's brutal and rapid advance  in the east and the south. It has not come quickly enough to help  Ukraine sustain counteroffensives or fully defend its cities against  missile and drone attacks.             The United States and our friends and our partners have done enough  to prevent Ukraine from losing--from losing--but we have not yet done  enough to help Ukraine actually win.   A protracted stalemate is neither in Ukraine's interest nor ours. The  solution that is both the most humane and the most advantageous to  America's interests is quite simple: Help Ukraine win this war.   We know what it will take to make this possible. As our colleague  Senator Wicker said, ``We can shift this war immediately in Ukraine's  favor by providing a range of advanced weapons, including tanks,  drones, and tactical missiles.'' And as Chairman McCaul from the House  said this past weekend, it is not the United States that will be  provocative if we send stronger assistance.         Mr. Putin is the provocative one. . . . He invaded a       sovereign territory, aggressively [and] unprovoked.    Yet some of freedom's most powerful friends remain hesitant. For many  months, Germany has not only resisted calls to send Leopard 2 tanks to  Ukraine but has actually also prevented other European nations from  transferring their own German-produced Leopards to Ukraine. Time is  short, and while Berlin agonizes over its own decision whether to  provide Leopards to Ukraine, it should proactively and explicitly make  clear that other allies are free to do so.   What about the Biden administration here at home? The  administration's latest deliveries failed to include--failed to  include--the longer range missiles and more sophisticated munitions  that Ukraine has been requesting literally for months--for months.   Ukraine's brave resistance deserves our continued praise, but more  importantly, it needs our concrete and consistent materiel support.  Ukraine's strengths cannot keep self-deterring ourselves and letting  the aggressors, the invaders, dictate the pace. So it is time--past  time--for the Biden administration and our allies to get serious about  helping Ukraine finish the job and retake their country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
