 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for  peace in the Middle East and between Israel and the Palestinians. That  is why I am for a two-state solution and the end to new Israeli  settlements.   However, the one-sided UN Security Council Resolution 2334 issued  last month would declare the Western Wall and some Jewish holy sites,  where many Jews live and pray, illegally occupied territory.   I am voting for H.Res. 11 today because the United States should veto  any UN resolution that would require Israel to give away the Western  Wall or the Jewish Quarters of Jerusalem. What the United States should  encourage is an end to new settlements, a two-state solution and direct  negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. That is the only  framework that can lead to a just and lasting peace.
