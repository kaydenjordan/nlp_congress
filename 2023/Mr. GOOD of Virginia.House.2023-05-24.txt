 Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to honor the brave  men and women who sacrificed their lives for our freedom this coming  Memorial Day, I rise to honor the life of Lynchburg, Virginia, native  Private First Class Desmond T. Doss.   Doss served the United States Army as a medic, becoming the first  conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor in 1945 after  fearlessly saving 75 wounded men under fire at the Battle of Okinawa in  World War II.   The popular movie ``Hacksaw Ridge'' was based on Doss' story and  accurately captures the valor and heroism he displayed during that  deadly battle. Desmond Doss demonstrated true sacrifice and conviction,  standing firm in his faith and for his love of country.   This week I plan to introduce legislation to rename the Lynchburg VA  clinic after Private First Class Desmond T. Doss, to memorialize his  outstanding legacy for generations to come.   We are forever grateful as a Nation for the sacrifices made by those  who fight and have fought to keep our country free.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Foxx for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be the sponsor of this resolution of  disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to hold President Biden  accountable for his reckless, unfair, unlawful, unconstitutional  student loan transfer scheme.   President Biden simply does not have the authority to ``forgive''  loans and thereby spend, unilaterally, more than $300 billion.   In fact, he even admitted that to CNN host Anderson Cooper in  February 2021, saying: ``I don't think I have the authority to do it by  signing with a pen.''   Democrats, in fact, knew he didn't have the power to do it and  advised him not to.    Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on July 28, 2021, said: ``People think  that the President of the United States has the power for debt  forgiveness. He does not. He can postpone. He can delay. But he does  not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress.''   My friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle piled on.   Representative Jared Golden of Maine said: ``This decision by the  President is out of touch with what the majority of the American people  want from the White House, which is leadership to address the most  immediate challenges the country is facing.''   Representative Chris Pappas of New Hampshire said: ``This  announcement by President Biden is no way to make policy and sidesteps  Congress and our oversight and fiscal responsibilities. Any plan to  address student debt should go through the legislative process, and it  should be more targeted and paid for so it doesn't add to the  deficit.''   Representative Sharice Davids of Kansas said: ``It is not how I would  have addressed this issue.''   Yet, the President decided yet again to act unconstitutionally. Like  the timing of the depletion of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, this  so-called student loan transfer scheme--interesting timing--was just  before the election.   Despite his better judgment, a barrage of legal challenges, and this  current effort by this Congress to nullify his actions, President Biden  has preemptively announced that he will veto my resolution. I invite  the President to reconsider his position.   Federal involvement in higher education, as a matter of fact, has  done nothing to bring down the cost of college. In fact, for every $1  increase in student loan subsidies, colleges have increased their  tuition by 60 cents. All across the country, more than 92 percent of  all student loan debt comes from Federal loans, totaling over $1.6  trillion.   This debt is held by just 13 percent of the population--in fact, the  most elite 13 percent. It is estimated that two-thirds of the student  loan transfer scheme would go to the top half of earners, not to  mention that 70 percent of the debt is owed by students who went to  graduate school.   Mr. Speaker, 60 percent of the constituents in my district don't even  have a college degree. Yet, the Biden administration wants them to have  to pay for the education of others who will have a significantly higher  lifetime earning potential.   Student loan cancellation doesn't make the debt actually go away. It  simply shifts the costs from the student loan borrower and transfers it  to hardworking American taxpayers.  [[Page H2564]]    It is also worth mentioning the key role this policy plays in the  fiscal health of our Nation as we address our debt ceiling. The  principle of this resolution, nullifying President Biden's student loan  transfer scheme, was one of the key provisions of the Limit, Save, Grow  Act. Saving $315 billion by simply asking Americans to honor their  commitment to pay back their own student loans will help us get our  country's spending under control.   Student loan borrowers are responsible for the debt they incurred,  and Congress is responsible for the $32 trillion that we have spent.   House Republicans take that seriously, which is why, a month ago, we  passed a plan to responsibly raise the debt limit while providing  historic savings for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I invite Representative Pelosi and my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to stand by their word and vote with me today  in favor of this resolution to nullify President Biden's student loan  transfer scheme. Congress must reclaim its power and act today to stop  the unilateral action of President Biden that is exacerbating the  higher education financial crisis.   Additionally, my resolution will do what should have been done a long  time ago: End the student loan repayment pause that has already cost  taxpayers $195 billion.   In short, this bill is needed to help steer our government spending  in a more responsible direction, and I urge all of my colleagues on  both sides to support this commonsense legislation and vote in favor of  this resolution.
