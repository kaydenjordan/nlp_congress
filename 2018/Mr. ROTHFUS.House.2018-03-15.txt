 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Financial Institutions  Examination Fairness and Reform Act.   As the vice chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer  Credit Subcommittee, and as a longtime advocate for examination and  review reforms, I commend my colleague, Representative Tipton, for his  hard work on this issue.   As we all know, our financial regulatory agencies are not without  their flaws. From time to time, examiners offer decisions that are  misguided, and these decisions deserve to be challenged. Managers of  financial institutions that believe that the decisions passed down by  their examiners are wrong deserve a chance to challenge those decisions  at an independent forum and, if necessary, in the courts. We are all  better served by a financial supervisory structure that subjects  decisions to the scrutiny of further review.   I know community bankers in western Pennsylvania who have struggled  with their examiners for years to get flawed determinations changed. In  many cases, these individuals were doing the right thing for their  companies and their communities. Without the benefit of a clear  timeline, this process has been allowed to drag on.   Without a truly independent review process and protection against  retaliation, these men and women working in  [[Page H1629]]  our community financial institutions understand that they are facing an  uphill battle. The current system is not independent and it is not  sufficiently transparent. This is unfair. It is bad for our community  financial institutions and it is detrimental to the integrity of our  regulatory system.   I again urge my colleagues to support Representative Tipton's work.    Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Johnstown's  Environmental Tank and Container Company, a division of JWF Industries,  for being named Manufacturer of the Year at the Sixth Annual 2018 Oil &  Gas Awards.   The Manufacturer of the Year Award recognizes the outstanding  contributions that a manufacturer has made to the industry in the  region, such as advances made in environmental stewardship, efficiency,  innovation, community leadership, and health and safety, and I am proud  of ETC's achievement.   Manufacturing is a key to a nation's prosperity and drives the  American economy. As America competes on a global scale, it is critical  that this industry continues to grow, creating a wealth of job  opportunities for all Americans. Over 500,000 people in Pennsylvania  rely on the strength of the manufacturing sector.   Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the United States had the highest  business tax rates in the industrialized world. Now this law is  removing this economic choke hold, putting American businesses at a  more favorable corporate tax rate than their foreign competitors, and  also allowing companies to write off the full cost of new equipment  when it is purchased.   America is gaining its competitive edge, and the manufacturing  industry is at the forefront of this success story.                            ____________________
