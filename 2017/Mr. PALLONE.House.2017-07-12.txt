 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization  Act, a bill that would allow the FDA to continue its critical mission  of reviewing and approving drugs and medical devices that save lives  and improve the quality of life for many Americans.   The legislation before us today is the product of compromise and  almost 2 years of work between FDA, Congress, industry, and other  stakeholders. The FDA Reauthorization Act reauthorizes FDA's medical  product user fee agreements, providing FDA with the resources the  agency needs to continue its critical public health work and hire the  necessary scientists and review staff, and improve the certainty and  efficiency of the drug review process.   The sixth reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will  maintain current review timelines, modernize the user fee structure,  and build on the work of 21st Century Cures Act by investing resources  in the development of biomarkers and innovative clinical trial designs.   The fourth reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments  includes some important new policies that will help to increase the  consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness of drug and medical device  reviews.   The bill advances the use of the patient perspective and the risk- benefit assessment of medical devices. It establishes a system  utilizing real world data for pre-market approval of new uses and post- market safety monitoring, and it improves presubmission communication  with manufacturers in an effort to expedite the review process.   This legislation also reauthorizes two of our newer user fee programs  for generics and biosimilars. Both of these programs strive to expedite  access to high-quality, lower-cost drugs for American families.   The FDARA will also allow the agency to undertake new initiatives to  create a category of over-the-counter hearing aids, advance the  development of pediatric cancer treatments, and provide greater  assistance and incentives to encourage additional competition for  generic drugs.   Since this is a bipartisan compromise--and I want to stress that--as  my colleague Mr. Walden said, it really is important and people should  take note that this is a major piece of legislation that is being done  on a bipartisan basis by our committee. But it does not address every  issue that I would have liked. It also includes troublesome language  prohibiting the FDA from making the investments the agency needs as  part of future user fee agreements. It is important that the FDA  maintain a work environment that allows the agency to recruit and  retain the world's best and brightest. I am concerned that this final  agreement preserves language advanced in the Senate bill that will make  it difficult in the future for the FDA to make the investments needed  to recruit personnel and meet performance goals set out in the user fee  reauthorizations.   This is a concern, again, that was put in by the Senate that I hope  we can address in the future. But I do want to stress, at the end of  the day, that this final product represents all of the significant  discussions and compromises that were made, and, of course, the  legislation that is going to be effective is the result of compromise.   I am pleased that we are considering this in a very timely fashion,  because, as I mentioned, we don't want the personnel who work at the  FDA to be affected; and if we do this in a timely fashion, they won't  have to worry about pink slips or their jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2430 so  that we can continue to give the FDA the tools and resources it needs  to continue doing the critical work of reviewing and improving  lifesaving drugs and medical devices.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gene Green), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2430,  the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017.   For many months, we have worked on a bipartisan basis to negotiate  and prepare for the four FDA user fee agreements for reauthorization,  across party lines, and you are seeing that. That is why I am proud to  be a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. We will fight when we  have to, but we also can work together on things that are really  important to our country.  [[Page H5479]]    These programs must be reauthorized in a timely manner to avoid a  meltdown of the medical product development pipeline. We have had great  collaboration and strong bipartisan working relationships throughout  the process, from the publication of the goals letters, to the  hearings, and the markups in the Health Subcommittee, all the way  through the unanimous vote out of the Energy and Commerce Committee  last month.   Since the first PDUFA was established in 1992, Congress has created  additional user fee programs for medical devices, generic drugs, and  biosimilars. In this cycle, we see shortened review timelines and have  given the FDA new tools to harness the latest science and streamline  the review process.   FDARA would build on previous success by reauthorizing the user fees  and make improvements in the review process like advancing the use of  biomarkers and patient experience data. The bill includes additional  provisions beyond the underlying agreements that are worthy of support.   To give some examples, it will promote generic drug development and  competition, establish a category of over-the-counter hearing aids,  crack down on counterfeit drugs, and foster innovation in medical  imaging.   FDA approval is the global gold standard and reauthorizing the user  fee programs will ensure the agency has the resources--particularly  capable, qualified staffers--to fulfill this mission.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to establish a user fee  program for over-the-counter products and reform the monograph systems  once we have reauthorized the existing user fee programs that will soon  expire.   I want to thank Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman Walden, and the  chair of the Health Subcommittee, Congressman Burgess, for their work  and commitment into timely user fee reauthorization.   I also want to thank the staff, Kim Trzeciak and John Stone, and my  own staff, Kristen O'Neill, for the countless hours of work they did to  get us to this place.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2430.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 12, 2017, on page H5479, the following appeared: 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Butterfield).      The online version has been corrected to read: 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Ms. DeGette).   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, at a time of hyperpartisanship when  traditions of consensus are seldom upheld, I am pleased to see Congress  continue its tradition of passing FDA user fee reauthorization with  broad bipartisan support.   It is absolutely critical that the FDA continue to promote medical  innovation and support public health. To do so, it must have consistent  funding, which this bill helps assure. I am also so proud that this  bill builds directly on the 21st Century Cures Act, which I coauthored  with Representative Fred Upton.   Consistent with Cures, the bill before us today ensures that both the  patient's voice and evidence from clinical practice can be considered  during drug development when it is appropriate. It also helps establish  a process for the FDA to qualify so-called biomarkers, which will  facilitate the development of future cutting-edge therapies.    By reinforcing these key provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, I  am fully confident that the bill will help deliver on our bipartisan  promise to jump-start treatments for families and for patients with  unmet needs.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Member  Pallone for incorporating provisions into the bill that will deepen our  understanding of the psychosocial impact of disease. These provisions  are based on the bipartisan Patient Experience in Research Act which  Representative Lance and I coauthored.   As more is learned about the social and emotional effects of disease,  we can deliver better outcomes for patients by improving medication  adherence, tailoring treatment regimens, and enhancing participation in  clinical trials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I said before, I am very proud of the fact that this  bill is bipartisan, continuing a tradition of dealing with these FDA  user fee and authorization bills on a bipartisan basis.   We worked long and hard to get this accomplished in a timely fashion,  in particular, so that the personnel at the FDA are not threatened in  any way. I am very hopeful that this will pass today, go over to the  Senate and also pass there quickly, and be signed by the President  soon.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
