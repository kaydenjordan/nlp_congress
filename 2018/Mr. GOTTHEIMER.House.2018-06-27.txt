 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand up for New Jersey  jobs and New Jersey workers who are the best in the world. In Fair  Lawn, New Jersey, the men and women at Mondelez bake top-quality  products like Oreos, Teddy Grahams, Ritz Crackers, Chips Ahoy, and  Barnum's Animal Crackers.   Mr. Speaker, Americans who enjoy Oreos or animal crackers would be  proud to know that these delicious cookies and crackers are produced  right here in America. However, I believe they would be shocked to hear  about some of the recent practices of the company that threaten these  employees' retirement and will outsource their U.S. production jobs to  Mexico, an issue that Democrats and Republicans alike are rightly  sounding the alarm about.   In the past month, Mondelez announced its intention to withdraw from  its employees' retirement plan that the company participated in for 60  years, setting the stage for a retirement catastrophe that could impact  more than 100,000 American workers.   The men and women I represent have worked hard and played by the  rules their whole lives, responsibly planning for their retirements,  taking care of their families, doing what they need to do. Mondelez  can't just change the rules mid-game as people prepare for their  retirements.    Mr. Speaker, America's seniors deserve security when they retire, and  our workers deserve nothing but the best. Destroying retirement income,  shipping jobs overseas to low-wage countries, and eroding the middle  class sets us on a dangerous and unsustainable path.   I stand with the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers & Grain  Millers Local 719 in Fair Lawn and America's jobs. And I hope that  Mondelez can sit down at the table and find a way to keep their  commitments to New Jersey workers while continuing to make a great  product in the United States of America and in New Jersey in the  district that I represent.                            ____________________
