 Mr. Speaker, rising prices are straining families'  budgets and robbing them of the full benefits of our strong economic  recovery.   Last year, we experienced the fastest rate of economic growth in four  decades and the single greatest year of job creation ever.   Thanks to this robust growth, workers are securing better jobs with  higher pay. Wages have risen more than 4 percent since President Biden  took office.   Yet, even as inflation has slowed, rising prices are eating into  families' paychecks. To help cut costs for families, the House recently  passed legislation to cap the price of insulin at $35. This week, the  House will consider new legislation to address pain at the pump.   The Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act would establish the  first-ever Federal law against price gouging by oil and gas companies.   Cutting costs and preventing profiteering, this is how we get our  prices under control and put money back in people's pockets.  [[Page H4975]]                                ____________________
