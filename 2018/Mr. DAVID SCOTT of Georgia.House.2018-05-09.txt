 Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentleman,  well, my friend, you got that right.   Zell Miller was my friend, my partner, and my mentor. I got into  politics quite a little bit early, just as I graduated from the Wharton  School of Finance, University of Pennsylvania, and landed in Atlanta.  Two years later, getting down there--you mentioned Andy, getting in his  campaign. And then 2 years later, there I am winding up in the Georgia  House of Representatives.   So my story intersects on so many different angles and ways with that  of Zell Miller, and I can truly stand here and tell each of you that I  truly loved this man, and I still do; and I would not be standing here  as a Member of Congress if it weren't for that friendship, that  partnership, and that mentorship with Zell Miller.   Let me, perhaps, I think, as I tell you about this, I am thinking of  a scripture that best sets the story for this great man; that evolves  everything, the history and the steps, the many positions, all that he  had done.   Before I get to that scripture, Zell Miller helped me. I mean, I got  there as a young person. I got over in the Senate. My two Senate  officemates, one was Paul Coverdell, the other Julian Bond. And with us  three, Zell Miller called us three his three horsemen.   It was then that he was laying the foundation for that vision, for  the HOPE Scholarship. Zell Miller appointed me to be chairman of the  Senate Higher Education Committee; first African American at that  position.   But more than that, he appointed me at that position at a time when  he was giving birth to one of the greatest public affairs programs in  Georgia history, the HOPE Scholarship. And for me to be there as the  chairman of the Senate Higher Education Committee, in that pivotal  position, and then to be able to go across Georgia in churches and  schools and help sell the HOPE Scholarship and what it meant, and then  that paved the way for me to later become Rules Chairman with Zell's  endorsement.   So there I was, as Rules Chairman; as you know, Buddy, nothing gets  on that calendar if it don't get through the Rules Committee. And I was  there to make sure none of those bills--because you know it was tough.  They had other bills coming to try to remove the HOPE Scholarship.   So let me just conclude by sharing with you what his life meant to me  and, I think, to the Nation and the world is best captured in God's  first psalm.         Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the       ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, or sitteth in       the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of       the Lord, and in the law of the Lord he does meditate day and       night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of       waters, bringing forth his fruit in his due season. And none       of his leaves will ever wither, and everything, everything,       whatsoever he does, shall prosper.    Such a man was Zell Miller. God bless you, Zell Miller, and I thank  God for sending Zell Miller our way.
