 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Louisiana for  yielding to me. I appreciate his time on the floor.   I was in the House Judiciary Committee. I will be spending some time  in  [[Page H6913]]  the 30-minute Special Order here in a second, dealing with a lot of the  issues that my friend was just talking about, in particular dealing  with energy. What I will be talking about is: They break it; you buy  it. That is the reality of what we are dealing with, with our  Democratic colleagues here in the majority and in the administration.   Energy is the perfect example of that. We are seeing that obviously  in Texas, where we are sitting on a sea of oil and gas that we could be  exploring further and producing for the world and driving down  CO2. Instead, we are not because of the leftist policies of  this administration. I will be beginning that in a minute.   I appreciate the gentleman and thank him for holding this Special  Order hour time on the floor for our colleagues.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time here on the floor.   I appreciate, as I said a minute ago, my friend from Louisiana,  Representative Johnson, for his steadfast defense of the Constitution  of the United States; his willingness to stand up for all the important  values, from life to marriage; but importantly being a voice for this  body, for the Republican Conference, and where we want to take this  country; what we know the American people want us to do; and to stand  athwart the absolutely absurd policies of a Democrat majority that  doesn't give a whit about the people that they are rolling over in a  quest to placate their radical leftist policies, whether it is energy  or open borders, and I appreciate the gentleman from Louisiana and his  efforts.   I am here to talk about my Democratic colleagues and the extent to  which the American people need to understand: They break it, you buy  it. And that is the reality of what is happening.   My Democratic colleagues are breaking--breaking this country,  breaking up your families, breaking up our secure border, breaking up  our military, breaking up our court system, the rule of law, breaking  up our police, our law enforcement community.   They are breaking up our economy, breaking the strength of the  American dollar. They are breaking our position in the world, and they  are breaking this body, the people's House. And it is high time it  stopped.   And we can only hope that in November we get a change so that we can  stop it. And then my message to my Republican colleagues will be: We  better stop it because what is happening in the so-called people's  House cannot be tolerated any longer.   They break it. This body, the leadership of this country, they break  it. You buy it.   In reverse, I would say, America is great. Washington is broken. They  are breaking it every day and, as a result, they are breaking this  great country that our forefathers fought so hard to give to us and to  our children and our grandchildren.   You cannot defend the policies of the Democratic majority. It is  impossible to do. And in fact, if you set out to harm the United States  of America, I would defy someone to demonstrate to me how you could do  better than my Democratic colleagues are doing on a daily basis,  ripping apart the Constitution, ripping apart the shreds of the flag,  ripping apart the people of this country.   Dividing us. Dividing us by race, dividing us by income, dividing us  by our adherence to the Constitution or devotion to the border and  devotion to the rule of law.   That is what is happening on a daily basis, and it is purposeful.  Let's be perfectly clear that it is purposeful.   The reason my Democratic colleagues focus so intently on January 6 is  they want to divide us. The reason they want to have race-based  policies throughout our government is they want to divide us.   The reason they want to make the border be supposedly about not  liking Brown people is because they want to divide us. Never mind that  south Texas is full of Brown people who are sick of wide-open borders  empowering cartels.   That is the reality of what is going on in this Chamber, and in the  Senate, and at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.   Just focus on the border for a minute: Broken, wide open, abused by  cartels, exploited by terrorists, exploited by gang members, criminals  coming into our country, killing American citizens. Fentanyl pouring  into our communities, 107,000 dead Americans. 850,000 known got-aways  pouring in between the ports of entry because our Border Patrol is  overwhelmed, with not only no support from this administration, but the  purposeful attack by the Secretary of Homeland Security lying about the  good men and women of Border Patrol, saying that they whipped people  that they didn't, and then hiding behind some report, while they give  them administrative punishment.   That is your leadership, ladies and gentlemen. They are breaking it  and you have to buy it.   They are leaving our border wide open, and American citizens are  dying. Let me repeat that. They are leaving our border wide open,  broken, and American people are dying, thousands upon thousands of  Americans dying from fentanyl pouring into our communities, pushed by  China, exploited by cartels, left to be able to come into our country  because Democrats do not care about securing the border.   And more importantly, my Democratic colleagues are perfectly fine  purposely leaving our border wide open. It is purposeful. It is  purposeful.   They are breaking it and you are going to have to buy it.  [[Page H6914]]    How about our defense?   Our Defense Department is being broken on a daily basis by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle and in the other Chamber, and  particularly, this administration, shoving into the Department of  Defense a radical, woke ideology, radical, woke programs, policies  focused on diversity, and equity, and inclusion, all of the things that  they cloak with critical race theory to destroy and break apart the  institution of our defense. It is purposeful.   Vaccine mandates, forcing 60,000 guardsmen to be on the chopping  block to lose their entire career. It is purposeful. They are breaking  it.   They are breaking that military you love. They are breaking that  Department of Defense that needs to be there on that wall defending us.  They are breaking it.   They are breaking it by tucking tail and running out of Afghanistan  with $85 billion of equipment there and 12 or 13 dead servicemembers  and no accountability. No accountability for the brass at the Pentagon  and no accountability so far at the White House for tucking tail and  running.    They are breaking our Defense Department.   You talk to the servicemembers who were in my office, coming in in  tears because they are about to lose their entire career because they  choose not to take a politicized vaccine.   Oh, by the way, by another broken governmental agency, or agencies,  our whole public health system being radicalized by my colleagues on  the other side of aisle to strike fear in the hearts of the American  people, to watch them push aside and brush under the rug gain-of- function research and all that we see unfolding in China in the Wuhan  Institute of Virology, all that we know about the funding, American  funding that was tied to that.   All that we know about the absurdity of locking down schools,  shutting down our schools so our kids are stuck in masks, stuck in the  corner and not able to go to school, the damage it has done to our  kids, the mental health issues, destroying the education of our young,  all chasing the teachers' unions.   We have seen the mandatory--or efforts at mandatory vaccines-- thankfully, partially struck aside, but many still in place, breaking  the back of the people's trust in their public health, breaking the  back of the people's ability to serve in the military and defend this  country, breaking the back of people being able to be Federal public  servants working for Border Patrol or other Federal agencies.   Why?   Because of fealty to Anthony Fauci, being the great wizard of public  health while he poses for magazine covers and throws out pitches at  baseball games.   Meanwhile, your defense is broken. Your public health is broken, and  you are going to have to buy it.   How about crime on the streets of the United States of America?   How about the 12 Democrat-run cities that have called for defunding  their police and have seen skyrocketing crime enveloping the cities?   The businessowner I spoke to today in Baltimore who says he is going  to have to shut down his franchise because of rampant crime in  Baltimore.   Austin, Texas, which cut its police by a third and has seen homicides  skyrocket from 59 to 89, has seen 911 calls unanswered, drug  trafficking increasing. Taking police off the streets in Austin, Texas.   We have seen 50 of the biggest urban areas see a 5 percent decrease  in their police budgets, while my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle say they are doing no such thing.   But my friend, Mr. Johnson, rattled off quote after quote after quote  in the House Judiciary Committee of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle calling for defunding of the police. Of course, it is an  attack on our police. They are breaking our Police Department, breaking  the backs of our men and women in blue and leaving our streets exposed  to lawlessness and danger, and it is purposeful.   How about energy?   Could you take a more ridiculous position than to take the strength  of national security, of having abundant oil and gas, the ability to  lead on nuclear, and, instead, chase unicorn energy policies of nothing  but solar and wind so that on a cloudless, windless day--or cloudy,  windless day, you sit back and watch your energy plummet and your grid  weaken.   What kind of a country's leadership does that to its people?   I would say the kind that want to break it. I would say the kind that  want to chase the fairy tales and the unicorn energy policies that this  administration wants to pursue.   We could have nuclear power. It doesn't create any carbon dioxide. Do  my colleagues on the other side of aisle want to do that?   No. Because this is about fear. This is about breaking American  energy. This is about breaking the back of it, so you can get on your  private plane and fly to Davos and fit in with the Western Europeans  and how great they are, while they are now burning wood to heat their  homes.   We have the greatest national security asset you could possibly  imagine, which was full and complete energy independence, and we are  completely flushing it down the toilet, to break it and to break it  purposely. And we don't have to do it.   We have abundant energy, abundant, clean-burning natural gas that we  could export to other countries, as we were doing, driving down carbon  dioxide.   We could be producing nuclear facilities all across this country with  zero CO2 production. But we are not.   Instead, we are chasing--literally, we are tilting at windmills,  dotting the landscape with windmills.   A couple of weeks ago in Texas, we had 8 percent of the wind capacity  available in our grid. Absolutely astounding what we are doing to the  energy of the United States of America.   Inflation. I mean, I can't even get all this in, the absurd policies  of Democrats.   I have already covered border, could go further.   Already talked about defense; could go further.   Didn't even get into Ukraine and the lack of briefings and the $56  billion we just dumped into Ukraine, with zero indication of a strategy  of what we are actually going to do, while we expand NATO, with zero  indication about how that is going to impact Article 5, and an 800-mile  border and whether NATO's going to upend its end of the bargain when we  fund the vast majority of NATO. I didn't even talk about that part of  defense.   I didn't talk about crime. I mean, I talked about crime, but I didn't  get into every aspect of it.   I didn't get into every aspect of energy.   Now I am talking about inflation. The wisdom of this administration  coming in and dumping $1.9 trillion--I don't even remember what the  name of that ridiculous bill was, but it was garbage. And it is now  driving up the cost of goods and services for you, the American people.   They are breaking it. They are breaking your jobs. They are breaking  your income. They are breaking your ability to buy goods and services  and you are, literally, going to have to buy it, and you are going to  have to pay a lot for it, because they are spending money we don't  have.    They are printing money, throwing it out in the economy, driving up  the prices of goods, while they are, simultaneously, restricting the  ability for us to develop energy, to have abundant energy that you can  afford.   You like $4.50 gasoline? Well, guess what? Your Democratic leadership  just defended that as being great. In a Rules Committee debate this  week, when I sat in that room debating the rules, literally, the  Democratic Rules Committee was talking about how great it is that the  price of oil has come down.   They were talking about the price of copper going down. Well, I have  spent a lot of money on copper to wire my home. It is expensive as  heck. It is now locked up in cages. But do you know what the price of  copper going down means? Heading into a recession. That is the reality  of what we are facing. That is the truth.   Our economy is getting ripped to shreds, the price of goods and  services are going up. And it is purposeful. Spending money we don't  have.   How can you justify spending $2 trillion, printing that money, and  dumping it out there to drive up the price of goods and services, while  cutting off the production of oil and gas, not developing nuclear,  increasing the price  [[Page H6915]]  of gasoline, increasing the price of energy in your homes?   It could only be purposeful. They are breaking it. They want to break  it so they can live in unicorn land.   But you are going to have to buy it, and it is going to be expensive.   How about the state of the rule of law?   How about the state of the family?   How about the state of marriage?   Just yesterday, on this floor--just yesterday, on this floor, we  passed a law to force recognition by one State of another State's  marriage, but by thereby doing that, for the first time, I think this  body, certainly Members on this side, supporting the redefinition of  marriage, which was manufactured by the 2015 Supreme Court decision,  manufactured and forced upon the States, a redefinition of marriage.   Now you see the wailing and gnashing of teeth because this court  dared to say that Roe v. Wade was bad law, and that we should defer to  the States in the protection of life and the recognition that that is  the appropriate law under the Constitution.                                time  1630    Lastly, I would point out when we are talking about breaking it, this  body is the best example of my Democratic colleagues not giving a whit  about you, the people, rolling over and destroying the people's House,  destroying this institution.   I have not been able to offer an amendment on the floor of this body.  Can't do it. Got to go to Rules. Beg for crumbs.   They drive through so-called suspension of the rules bills. We get  them often hours before, at most, a day or two before they are on the  floor being asked to be voice voted. If we don't have a group of us on  the floor monitoring those bills, they will go through without a vote.   They don't care because voting doesn't matter, as evidenced by proxy  voting, forcing a new rule that says you can turn your voting card that  you, the voters, gave to representatives and give that to another  member of Congress, upending the constitutional order which requires  presence, a quorum, physical presence, debate.   That is what the Constitution contemplates, and it is my Democratic  colleagues who, for the first time in history, upended our requirement  that we be present in the body of the House of Representatives to do  our job. Blowing apart--blowing apart--this people's House.   I will note, as I often do, that I am not saying that everybody on  this side of the aisle has clean hands on all of these points. A lot of  Republicans are taking advantage of the proxy voting that my Democratic  colleagues created for the first time in history. They should not.   I will say that to every member. I don't care if they are Freedom  Caucus leadership or anybody in between. I will not back away from  saying proxy voting is not only unconstitutional, it is wrong, and it  is destroying this body.   Forced magnetometers in this false name of security. Masks being  forced upon members of Congress on the floor of the House, which have  now been brushed aside because I guess Anthony Fauci or somebody  decreed that somehow, it is now safe to walk around without masks until  they say it is not safe.   I yield to my friend from Virginia here in one second. I just want to  say in conclusion to this part, and then I want to engage with my  friend.   My Democratic colleagues, unfortunately with a little bit of help  from a few of my Republican colleagues on occasion, are breaking this  country. They are breaking this body. They are breaking our  Constitution, and it is purposeful.   There are no other words to say what is happening at our border but  that it is purposeful. There are no other words to say about what is  happening on our streets with our law enforcement but that it is  purposeful.   There is no other thing you can say about our energy policies but  that it is purposeful. There is nothing you can say about the spending  and the inflation but that it is purposeful.   The attack on the institution of marriage, the breakdown of the  family, the targeting and the policies against life, that it is  purposeful.   The fact that we are destroying this body with proxy voting, that it  is purposeful. The fact that we are destroying the Defense Department  and the very core values of our men and women in the military with  their woke policies, with their vax mandates, irrespective of what that  does to defense, driving our recruiting down to unforeseen levels, but  that it is purposeful, and it is wrong.   I would just challenge my Republican colleagues that we better come  in, if the American people give us power in November, and do the right  thing to protect this country and to stop breaking it because the  American people are having to buy it.   I yield to my friend from Virginia (Mr. Good).    I ask of the Chair how much time we have remaining.    I would just add to my friend from Virginia a great quote  from Thomas Jefferson--because he knows I went to the University of  Virginia.         The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to       keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect       themselves against tyranny in government.    That is the purpose of the Second Amendment, and that is what we  know.   I would note that in this context, and I will yield another couple  minutes to the gentleman if he wants it, when we are talking about the  response from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they break  our border purposefully, and then they want us to fix it with amnesty  or with some policies to say that Texas has to just accept.   I hear that the mayor of New York is all aghast that people are being  dropped off in New York. He said, we need Federal Government help to  deal with it. I am, like, welcome to the party, pal. This is what life  is like in south Texas every single day.   They break it. They break the border, and then they want you, the  American people, to have to carry the water.   They break the Defense Department, drive recruiting down to 40  percent, and then they put in language to draft our daughters, all in  the name of so-called equity and equality.   They break our criminal justice system. They break the backs of our  law enforcement community. Then they say, we are going to take your  guns, your ability to defend yourself.   They break the energy system in our country. Then they say, just go  buy a Tesla. What is wrong with you?    What is wrong with you? Go buy a Tesla. You can plug in. You  can drive through west Texas, 300 miles. Don't worry about it. Stop off  in Eden, Texas, where, no doubt, they have a charging station and spend  $70,000 for the pleasure.   They break the back of the economy, drive up in inflation, and they  say, suck it up, buttercup. Go buy yourself some expensive chicken and  rice.   They break the back of this body, this institution, and they ignore  their colleagues when their colleagues are saying the chickens are  going to come home to roost.   That is the reality of what we are dealing with: A purposeful  breaking the back of this country and a tearing apart of the threads  that hold us together.   I am going to just say it here on the floor. If we don't start  respecting Federalism, the ability to agree to disagree, then this  country is doomed. It will break apart under its own weight, and it  will be my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that amassed the  weight that will break the bow.    That is where we are headed if we don't start respecting the ability  of individuals in this country to agree to disagree, allow Texans to be  Texans, allow Californians to be Californians.   Unite under the flag of the United States under our core principles  but stop shredding our ability to disagree. Stop breaking this country  and forcing the American people to buy it.   I yield the balance of the time to my friend Virginia (Mr. Good).    I thank the gentleman from Virginia. I think our time has  expired. I appreciate the speaker and the staff here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back.    Mr. Speaker, I have to head down to the House Judiciary  Committee to defend the Second Amendment from the attacks being levied  by my Democratic colleagues as we speak. We are in there debating.   I would add just one thing to what the gentleman just eloquently put  out, the understanding for the American people that when this Nation  was founded, we were dealing with debate about what the structure of  government should look like. Those who were suspicious of consolidating  power, the anti-Federalists, were raising questions.   James Madison, a Virginian, was making points through the Federalist  Papers. He said in response to some of the critiques: ``All the other  checks and balances will always prevent tyranny, but should tyranny  ever triumph, the U.S. Constitution provides a mechanism to restore  constitutional order,'' he says. ``Besides the advantage of being  armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every  other nation,'' Madison wrote, ``the existence of subordinate  governments, the State government to which the people are attached,''  their State and local governments, ``and by which the militia officers  are appointed,'' because that well-regulated militia meant a well- ordered militia, not regulated the way we talk about it, a well-ordered  militia. ``And it forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition  more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can  admit of.''   The final point is, the Second Amendment does not create a right of  revolution against tyranny. That inherent right is universal. The  Second Amendment provides the tools and the power for the people to  stand and thwart tyranny.
