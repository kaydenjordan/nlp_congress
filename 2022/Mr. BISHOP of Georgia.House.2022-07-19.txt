 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 8294. As  chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am pleased to  highlight the national priorities funded in our division.   The impact of the agriculture division is far-reaching and it touches  the lives of every single American. We all eat the food, rely on the  medicine and the medical devices, and wear products made from fibers,  such as cotton, that are made possible by this bill.   Our fiscal year 2023 allocation is $27.2 billion, which is $2 billion  over the fiscal year 2022 bill. The bill provides $4.2 billion for  Rural Development initiatives, including more than $560 million for  broadband expansion to provide economic development opportunities and  improved education and healthcare services. The bill continues  important funding for the Community Facilities Program that supports  everything from libraries and fire stations to childcare centers and  nursing homes.   Our bill fully funds the SNAP, WIC, and Child Nutrition programs. It  continues to enhance fruit and vegetable benefits for women and  children and provides additional protections for SNAP recipients. We  have record-high funding for the Food for Peace program, $1.8 billion,  and $265 million for the McGovern-Dole program, critically needed in  light of the global food crisis that has worsened following the Russian  invasion of Ukraine.   The bill provides $3.8 billion for agriculture research, which helps  the United States produce the most abundant and affordable food in the  world, and provides $3.1 billion in farm and conservation programs,  which includes funding to address the impacts of climate change.   The Food and Drug Administration is funded at $3.6 billion in  discretionary funding. There are important increases to help combat the  opioid crisis, support unannounced inspections of foreign drug  manufacturing facilities, and ensure the safety of infant formula.   Finally, the bill provides funding for 134 Community Project Funding  requests for members, totaling over $191 million.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the  ranking member, Dr. Harris, and his staff for helping produce this  bill. I thank my personal staff and the subcommittee staff for their  extraordinary work on the bill. Of course, I thank Chairwoman DeLauro  and Ranking Member Granger, as well as the majority and minority staffs  of the full committee.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the en  bloc. Mr. Hern's amendment in this en bloc would cut discretionary  programs in the agriculture bill by 22 percent. Mr. Norman's would cut  them by 5 percent. Either level will have devastating and  counterproductive consequences across numerous programs.   This would mean cutting rural development initiatives. The 22 percent  cut would reduce much-needed investments in rural broadband,  electricity, water and waste systems, and housing at a time when we  really, really want to lift our rural communities.   It would mean cutting our investment in farm and conservation  programs, agriculture research, Food for Peace grants, and the  McGovern-Dole program.                                time  1500    The Food and Drug Administration budget would be cut by over $800  million under Mr. Hern's proposal, lessening our ability to address the  opioid crisis, medical supply chain issues, infant formula, and food  safety.   I ask my colleagues to join me in opposition to these amendments.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this  bipartisan en bloc. These amendments addressing the Agriculture  division of the package were made in order by the rule, and they have  been agreed to by both sides.   This was a truly collaborative process between both sides of the  aisle, and I believe this bipartisan effort will definitely improve the  bill.   I thank the sponsors for their efforts and highlight a few of the  issues that are covered by these amendments: encouraging innovation in  USDA research programs, protecting victims of trafficking, and  increasing funding for the farm-to-school program and the Circuit Rider  Program.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment and urge its adoption. It improves  the bill.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   These amendments en bloc address the Agriculture division of this  package that were made in order by the rule. I believe they will  improve the bill also.   In particular, the amendments will increase the funding for the  school breakfast expansion program and further advance the needs of  Puerto Rico and the other territories, all of which participate in the  Micro-Grants for  [[Page H6844]]  Food Security Program. Representative Velazquez' amendment draws  attention to Puerto Rico's nutrition needs, where about 1.5 million  residents receive nutrition assistance.   The amendments highlight other important issues, such as rural energy  efficiency and the need to build our infant formula manufacturing base  in this country.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I urge its adoption.
