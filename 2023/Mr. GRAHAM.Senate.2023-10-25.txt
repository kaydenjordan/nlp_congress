 Madam President, I think Senator Hoeven is absolutely  right. If we don't secure our border, it would be a big mistake.   I just returned from Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt with a 10- person--5 and 5--Senate delegation. So the Senate is working. I am glad  we have a Speaker of the House. But we had five Republicans and five  Democrats, and here is the takeaway.   This is happening in Israel now because Iran fears reconciliation  between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Building on the Abraham Accords that  President Trump was able to achieve, President Biden has been working  to try to get Saudi Arabia and Israel to have diplomatic ties and to  recognize each other to end the Arab-Israeli conflict. That is a  nightmare for Iran. For the region to come together, look forward; go  to the light, not the darkness.   Here is what we have to decide as a country. Let's not let Iran win  here.   To our Arab allies, to our friends in Turkey, this barbaric attack on  Israel by Hamas is beyond what happened in the Holocaust. I have seen  the photos. It is so vicious. It is so lacking any humanity.   Does it have a purpose? Yes. They filmed it so Israel had to go in.   The Ayatollah wants Israel to have to take action, hoping the world  will turn on Israel, call for a cease-fire, and let time pass so that  the moment to reconcile between Saudi Arabia and Israel passes. It is  putting pressure on our allies in Jordan, in Egypt, and in Turkey by  saying some pretty provocative things to our Arab allies, to our  Turkish friends.   This attack by Hamas against Israel has to be dealt with by the  destruction of Hamas. If you are in the region and you are expecting  Israel not to go on the ground, that is not going to happen. You cannot  destroy Hamas from the air. They are going in on the ground, and they  are going to destroy Hamas to the best they can.   The goal then is to have a Palestinian plan that would give hope to  the Palestinians who lost all hope and to continue the reconciliation  process. As long as Hamas exists, there is no hope for peace.   It was mentioned in Turkey that Hamas is a liberator group. Hamas  could care less about the Palestinian people. They want to destroy the  Jewish people. If you don't believe me, listen to what they say. They  are not trying to achieve a better life for the Palestinian people.  They are trying to kill all the Jews. That is their charter, their  religious nonsense.   To expect Israel not to go in is unrealistic. They are going to go  in, and they are going to have our full support. The goal is to destroy  Hamas without destroying the chance for peace.   I see an opportunity here, once Hamas has been dismantled, to bring  the region together to get the Palestinian people a better life. The  Iranian Ayatollah is the great Satan--not Israel, not the United  States. He is a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam in his own  image. He wants to destroy the Jewish State and come after us. It is a  religious theocracy that can't be compromised with.   Here is what I would say we need to do today. Let the Iranians know  if there is a second front opened by Hezbollah against Israel--which  could be devastating--that we will be going to Iran to fix the problem.  If one American soldier is killed by Shiite militia attacks against our  forces in Syria and Iraq, we are going to blame the Ayatollah.   I appreciate moving the military force forward--two carrier battle  groups--and moving assets into the region. I do not want a war, but I  am tired of living this way.   The Ayatollah needs to know that a second front means three fronts-- that we are coming after you. We are going to destroy your ability to  fund terrorism.   Ninety-three percent of all the money Hamas receives comes from Iran.  All of their money comes from their oil industry. They are incredibly  exposed to being knocked out of business.   To the Members of the Senate here, we need to tell Iran clearly what  happens: If you escalate against America, you escalate against Israel,  you will be in the crosshairs of American military response. It is your  choice to make.   If you want a war with America, you will lose it. If you continue to  try to  [[Page S5168]]  throw gasoline on a fire, you are going to regret it. Anything short of  a military response being real to the Ayatollah will lead to more  bloodshed. So if you want a smaller war, well, let Iran know: You are  going to be in a bigger war if you attack Israel or kill an American.   If we don't do that, we are making a huge mistake. I am trying to  stand behind the Biden administration. I want to help them reconcile  Saudi Arabia and Israel. I appreciate what they have done with the  military force posture moving forward, but it needs to be clear to the  Iranians: Escalation means an attack on you. And if they believe that,  I think we can stop this thing from getting bigger. If they don't  believe it, we are going to wake up with a real big war on our hands  beyond what we have today.   I have never been more worried about the situation of the world than  I am right now. But here is what I am confident of: The Israelis will  fight. They may get killed, but they are going down fighting. There  will not be a second Holocaust. The Israeli people, through their IDF,  will fight anybody who tries to destroy the Jewish people. That is  Hamas. They want to kill all the Jews. I can't believe this is being  said in 2023. To the world: To get to our friends in Israel, you have  to come through us. If you want to destroy all the Jews, you have to  come through America. And good luck with that.   I want peace between the Arabs and the Israelis. I want a better life  for the Iranian people. I want a better life for the Palestinian  people. But you cannot have a better life when the forces of darkness  are in control.   Destroy Hamas once and for all. Create a better life for the  Palestinian people. Reconcile the Arab-Israeli conflict, and move  forward.   God bless our friends in Israel.                   Amendment No. 1237 to Amendment No. 1092    Madam President, I call up Senator Rubio's amendment and ask that it  be reported by number.    Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague Tim  Scott of South Carolina, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the  National Wild Turkey Federation and to recognize the organization's  significant contributions to research, habitat conservation, as well as  its promotion and protection of the long-honored outdoor traditions of  the United States.   The National Wild Turkey Federation was incorporated on March 28,  1973, with the aim of bringing together State, Federal, and  nongovernmental partners to promote the conservation of wild turkeys.  Edgefield, SC, is proud to house the organization's national  headquarters, and both the State and Nation continue to benefit from  their stewardship.   Since 1985, the National Wild Turkey Federation, its members, and  chapters have invested more than $500,000,000 to conserve or enhance  more than 22,000,000 acres of critical wildlife habitat, forests, and  grasslands, as well as more than $8,500,000 in research to ensure a  healthy wild turkey population. In addition, the organization is a  long-standing Stewardship partner with the U.S. Forest Service and is  heavily engaged in the development and implementation of the Department  of Agriculture's Wildfire Crisis Strategy. These efforts have played a  significant role in one of the greatest conservation success stories in  the United States: the return of the wild turkey from the brink of  extinction.   I ask that you and our colleagues join me in celebrating the 50th  anniversary of the National Wild Turkey Federation and wish the  organization and its members continued success in fulfilling their  mission.                            ____________________
