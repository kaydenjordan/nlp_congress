 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2521) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  establish a pilot program to furnish doula services to veterans, as  amended.  [[Page H8601]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2521         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Delivering Optimally Urgent       Labor Access for Veterans Affairs Act of 2022'' or the       ``DOULA for VA Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. FEASIBILITY AND ADVISABILITY STUDY ON DOULA SUPPORT                     FOR VETERANS.         (a) Study.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall carry       out a study on the feasibility and advisability of furnishing       doula services to covered vetearns. Such study shall include       an analysis of--        (1) measures taken by other Federal, State, and local       entities to ensure the appropriate certification of doulas;       and        (2) the extent to which such measures, or similar measures,       may be adequate for purposes of such furnishment.        (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the       Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate a report on the findings of       the study under subsection (a) that shall include a       determination by the Secretary as to whether furnishing doula       services to covered veterans is feasible and advisable.        (c) Covered Veteran Defined.--In this section, the term       ``covered veteran'' means a pregnant veteran or a formerly       pregnant veteran (with respect to doula services to be       furnished post-partum) who is enrolled in the patient       enrollment system of the Department of Veterans Affairs under       section 1705 of title 38, United States Code.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 2521, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2521, as amended, the DOULA  for VA Act of 2022. This bill, authored and long championed by  Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, would bring VA closer to providing the  full scope of reproductive healthcare that our veterans and their  newborns deserve. This bill would require VA conduct a feasibility and  advisability study to determine whether to provide pregnant veterans  access to doula support services.   The United States has a maternal mortality crisis, and our veterans  are not protected from it. In fact, they are disproportionately more  likely to experience severe maternal mental health outcomes than their  civilian counterparts.   There is a growing body of research that shows that doula care is an  effective tool in mitigating pre and postpartum mental health crises  and can be a factor in reducing childbirth complications. The VA must  investigate the ability to provide such holistic and effective care.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill. I encourage all my  colleagues to join me in supporting Mrs. Lawrence's critical and  commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), the author of H.R. 2521 and my good friend,  who serves on the Appropriations Committee and the Oversight and Reform  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I again ask my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 2521, as amended. With a heavy heart, I take this moment  to pay tribute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence). She  has joined us on Veterans Affairs' codels and done factfinding on  behalf of the committee for the betterment of our veterans. I thank her  for that, and I wish her the best of the new opportunities that she  will encounter after she leaves this body.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4601) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to award grants to States to improve  outreach to veterans, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4601         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Commitment to Veteran       Support and Outreach Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORITY FOR SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO AWARD                     GRANTS TO STATES AND INDIAN TRIBES TO IMPROVE                     OUTREACH TO VETERANS.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 4601, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4601, the Commitment to  Veteran Support and Outreach Act, as amended. This bill authorizes VA  to provide grants to States, counties, and Tribes to implement programs  that improve outreach and assistance to veterans and their families to  ensure that such individuals are fully informed about veterans'  benefits and programs.   Specifically, VA may provide grants to States, counties, and Tribal  entities to implement or enhance outreach activities or activities to  assist in the development and submittal of claims for veterans or  increase the number of county or Tribal veteran service officers in the  State.   Additionally, VA would be required to prioritize awarding grants in  areas with a critical shortage of county or Tribal veterans service  officers, areas with high rates of suicide among veterans, and areas  with high rates of referrals to the veterans crisis line.   With high-profile, sweeping veterans' legislation like the PACT Act  recently signed into law, the support and outreach offered by H.R. 4601  would greatly assist in implementing such new programs as smoothly as  possible.   With enhanced communication outreach focused on explaining new  benefits and services to a broader range of veterans and their  families, the more opportunities we will have to connect with potential  beneficiaries interacting with VA for the very first time.   With more accredited claims representatives available to assist with  the preparation and submission of claim applications, the better  positioned VA will be to decide these claims in a more timely and  accurate manner.   With funds to recruit and train more county and Tribal veterans  service officers, helpful skills and information related to life- changing benefits and other VA services will reach farther into our  veteran communities that are so often and undeservedly overlooked.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill. I thank  Representative Levin for crafting this important legislation. I urge my  colleagues to vote for its passage, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 4601, as amended. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4772) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  application and review process of the Department of Veterans Affairs  for clothing allowance claims submitted by veterans, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4772         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mark O'Brien VA Clothing       Allowance Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. IMPROVEMENTS TO PROCESS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS FOR CLOTHING ALLOWANCE CLAIMS.         (a) Process for Clothing Allowance Claims.--Section 1162 of       title 38, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``The Secretary under'' and inserting:        ``(a) Eligibility Requirements.--The Secretary, under'';        (2) in paragraph (2)--        (A) by striking ``which (A) a physician'' and inserting:       ``which--''        ``(A) a physician''; and        (B) by striking ``, and (B) the Secretary'' and inserting       ``; and''        ``(B) the Secretary''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new subsections:        ``(b) Continuous Nature of Payments.--Payments made to a       veteran under subsection (a) shall continue on an       automatically recurring annual basis until the earlier of the       following:        ``(1) The date on which the veteran elects to no longer       receive such payments.        ``(2) The date on which the Secretary determines the       veteran no longer eligible pursuant to subsection (d).        ``(c) Reviews of Claim.--(1) Except as provided in       paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary shall conduct reviews of the       claim on which the clothing allowance is based to determine       the continued eligibility of the veteran as follows:        ``(A) Beginning not earlier than five years after the date       on which a veteran initially receives a clothing allowance       under this section and on a periodic basis thereafter.        ``(B) Whenever the Secretary receives notice that the       veteran no longer meets the requirements specified in       subsection (a).        ``(2)(A) The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations       standards for determining whether a claim for clothing       allowance is based on a circumstance that is not subject to       change.        ``(B) If the Secretary determines, pursuant to such       standards, that a claim for clothing allowance is based on a       circumstance that is not subject to change, paragraph (1)(A)       shall not apply with respect to the claim.        ``(d) Determination Regarding Continued Eligibility.--If       the Secretary determines, as the result of a review of a       claim conducted under subsection (c)(1), that the veteran who       submitted such claim no longer meets the requirements       specified in subsection (a), the Secretary shall--        ``(1) provide to the veteran notice of such determination       that includes a description of applicable actions that may be       taken following the determination, including the actions       specified in section 5104C of this title; and        ``(2) discontinue the clothing allowance based on such       claim.''.        (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to--        (1) claims for clothing allowance submitted on or after the       date of the enactment of this Act; and        (2) claims for clothing allowance submitted prior to the       date of the enactment of this Act, if the veteran who       submitted such claim is in receipt of the clothing allowance       as of the date of the enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. ADJUSTMENTS OF CERTAIN LOAN FEES.         The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``January 14,       2031'' each place it appears and inserting ``January 15,       2031''.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory  [[Page H8605]]       Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be determined by reference       to the latest statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO       Legislation'' for this Act, submitted for printing in the       Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget       Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted       prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4772, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4772, as amended, the Mark  O'Brien VA Clothing Allowance Improvement Act.   As it stands today, under 38 U.S.C. 1162, the Secretary may pay an  annual clothing allowance payment to a veteran with a service-connected  disability that requires the use of a prosthetic or orthopedic  appliance, including a wheelchair, which the Secretary determines tends  to wear out or tear the clothing of the veteran, or medication which,  A, a physician has prescribed for a skin condition, or, B, the  Secretary determines causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer  garments.   Veterans who are entitled to a VA clothing allowance must reapply  each year to receive the annual payment. This places the onus on  veterans with what are, in most instances, permanent conditions to  remember to reapply each year to receive the benefit they have already  shown they are entitled to. Veterans must also remember to apply before  August 1 or risk denial due to untimely application.   Mr. Levin's bill would change all of that. It would amend 38 U.S.C.  1162 to allow for the VA clothing allowance to be an automatic annual  payment, subject to periodic review by VA to determine continued  entitlement.   It would no longer force veterans to reapply each year and, instead,  requires VA to complete periodic reviews to determine continued  entitlement on its own initiation. This would require notice to the  veteran if entitlement were no longer shown.   Approximately 40,000 veterans were approved for the clothing  allowance benefit in fiscal year 2020 alone. This bill would ensure  these veterans no longer have to reapply every year to maintain their  benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill. I urge all of my  colleagues to join me in supporting Mr. Levin's beneficial and  commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 4772, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5943) to designate the outpatient clinic of the Department  of Veterans Affairs in Greenville, South Carolina, as the ``Lance  Corporal Dana Cornell Darnell Outpatient Clinic,'' as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5943         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF LANCE CORPORAL DANA CORNELL DARNELL                     VA CLINIC.         (a) Designation.--The outpatient clinic of the Department       of Veterans Affairs in Greenville, South Carolina, shall       after the date of the enactment of this Act be known and       designated as the ``Lance Corporal Dana Cornell Darnell VA       Clinic''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Lance Corporal Dana Cornell Darnell VA       Clinic''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5943, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 5943, as amended,  which will appropriately honor the memory of Lance Corporal Dana C.  Darnell as one of the more than 58,000 names etched on the Vietnam  Veterans Memorial just down the street on The National Mall.   Like so many of those who served our great Nation, Lance Corporal  Darnell's life was tragically cut short. In April 1967, his Marine  platoon was ambushed by enemy forces in the Quang Tri Province in  north-central Vietnam.   Lance Corporal Darnell, at just 19 years old, displayed remarkable  bravery and selflessness in the face of adversity. When his platoon's  mortar gunner was knocked unconscious, Lance Corporal Darnell quickly  retrieved the weapon and began firing it into the enemy's position.   After exhausting his ammunition, he moved from man to man, collecting  additional mortar rounds to help silence the attack. In doing so, Lance  Corporal Darnell undoubtedly saved the lives of others in his platoon.   Even after being temporarily blinded by enemy fire, Lance Corporal  Darnell refused to be evacuated. Instead, he quickly began caring for  his wounded comrades. Two days later, Lance Corporal Darnell was killed  in action.   For his extraordinary heroism, Lance Corporal Darnell was  posthumously awarded the Navy Cross by President Johnson. The  Greenville, South Carolina, native also received a Purple Heart and  National Defense, Vietnam Service, and Vietnam Campaign Medals for his  meritorious service.   I thank my colleague, Representative Timmons, for introducing this  bill, which will designate the Department of Veterans Affairs  outpatient clinic in Greenville, South Carolina, the Lance Corporal  Dana Cornell Darnell Outpatient Clinic.   This bill has letters of support from The American Legion, the  Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans. Mr. Speaker,  I include these letters in the Record.

By his outstanding courage,       exceptional fortitude, and valiant fighting spirit he served       to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest       traditions of the United States Marine Corps and the United       States Naval Service; and        Whereas, It has pleased almighty God, the Great Commander       to summon his immortal and beloved comrade at arms Lance       Corporal Dana Cornell while paying the ultimate sacrifice of       his life at age 19 so that others could be free April 26,       1967; and be it finally        Resolved, That South Carolinas Largest Veterans       organization the American Legion, Department of South       Carolina Executive Committee at a specially called meeting       assembled on this day in November 10, 2022 that it supports       designating the outpatient clinic of the Department of       Veterans Affairs in Greenville, South Carolina, as the       ``Lance Corporal Dana Cornell Darnell Outpatient Clinic''.

Hon. Mark Takano,      Veterans Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.        Chairman Takano: On behalf of the Veterans of Foreign Wars       Department of South Carolina, it is my honor and privilege to       pledge our support for HR 5943 naming the Department of       Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient clinic in Greenville, SC       after Lance Corporal Dana Cornell Darnell.        Lance Corporal Darnell's service and sacrifice for our       nation is truly worthy of this honor. The heroic deeds of       this South Carolina native during action in Vietnam reflects       great credit upon this organization, and all of America's       combat veterans . . . past, present, and future.        This measure would bring about a fitting tribute to Lance       Corporal Darnell in his native Greenville. We stand in       solidarity with South Carolina's veterans' community and our       elected representatives in support of this bill.            Yours in Comradeship,                                               Ed Stefanak, Jr.,                                                    State Commander,                                  VFW Department of South Carolina.

Subject: Support for Bill, Naming Greenville CBOC       Congressman William Timmons (SC-04),      Attn: Jessica Ridley.        The DAV Department of South Carolina, fully support       Congressman William Timmons' Bill that would name the VA       Greenville Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) for a       Vietnam Marine who was killed in 1967 at Khe Sanh during an       action for which he received the Navy Cross.        We are honored to write this letter of recommendation for       LCpl Dana Cornell Darnell, United States Marine Corps.        LCpl Darnell was born in Greenville, South Carolina on       February 5, 1948. He joined the U.S. Marines on his 18th       birthday, arriving at Parris Island, South Carolina on March       8, 1966. He received further training at Camp Pendleton,       California before his assignment in Vietnam on August 20,       1966. On April 24, 1967, North Vietnam Army Forces ambushed       his platoon and wounded this young Marine. He died April 26,       1967, at 19 years of age.        The Navy Cross was awarded, posthumously, to LCpl Darnell       for his extraordinary heroism and for exhibiting sound       judgement and calmness in the face of intense enemy fire.        The personal sacrifice and brave actions of LCpl Dana       Darnell help preserve our nation's freedom for which we are       profoundly grateful. We wholeheartedly support the       recommendation that the VA Greenville CBOC be named in his       honor.            Respectfully,                                                        Larry Long,                            Commander, DAV Dept. of South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 5943, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 5943, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7158) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter into contracts and  agreements for the payment of care in non-Department of Veterans  Affairs medical foster homes for certain veterans who are unable to  live independently, and for other purposes, as amended.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Long-Term Care Veterans       Choice Act''.       SEC. 2.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of  [[Page H8608]]       the House Budget Committee, provided that such statement has       been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7158, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7158, as amended, the Long- Term Care Veterans Choice Act.   This bill, authored and long championed by Congressman Higgins and  Chairwoman Brownley, would enable VA to better provide long-term  services and support for our aging and disabled veterans.                                time  1445    The VA's medical foster homes are one of its most creative and  effective initiatives. Veterans who have access to these care settings  thrive and are able to remain a part of their community, even if their  conditions do not allow them to remain independently in their homes.   Veterans who are not yet ready for institutional care but need the  help and assistance of professional caregivers are able to live in a  home setting among other veterans in their communities. Satisfaction  with the program is very high, but veterans have to pay for the care  themselves, which is a barrier for many veterans. Yet, VA is currently  prohibited from paying a veteran's room and board. This legislation  would change that.   Community-based programs like these are what veterans want and  deserve. They also prevent veterans from being forced into much more  expensive institutional care settings.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I encourage all  of my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the ranking member's desire to  engage in talks regarding the toxic exposure fund. It is an important  issue, which is the long-term implications of the Cost of War Toxic  Exposures Fund, otherwise known as TEV, and it was created by the  Honoring our PACT Act.   This fund is absolutely crucial to ensuring VA has the resources  necessary to fully support our veterans and to deliver the new benefits  available to them without having to sacrifice existing programs.   As I have said repeatedly, any potential change to this fund and how  it operates must be considered very carefully and requires the input of  other committees that have a stake in this issue, to include  appropriations and budget in the House and Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his  hard work. I feel his sincere words. I take them to heart, and I  sincerely hope that we get this through the Senate so that we can see  this signed into law before the end of this year.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as I have said before on the floor of this  House, serving our veterans is not about red or blue. It is about red,  white, and blue. I know that the ranking member stands with me in  service of our veterans, and he stands with me right now in the  optimism that Team USA is going to prevail today at the World Cup. They  are ahead 1-0. I know the ranking member and I, and the gentleman from  Louisiana, are all standing united with the hope of an American victory  there.   Mr. Speaker, again, I ask all my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 7158,  [[Page H8609]]  as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
