 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the students  of South Glens Falls.   They recently marked their 46th annual marathon dance, a student- driven event to raise money for local families and organizations. This  year, they raised more than $630,000, adding to a staggering total of  more than $10.5 million raised since the event's inception.   The success of this marathon dance is proof of the remarkable things  our students and young people can achieve.   I had the honor of joining them last weekend and seeing firsthand  their enthusiasm and their heart. United by  [[Page H1254]]  music, dance, and a resounding spirit of giving, these students  demonstrate the power that lies in a love of community and desire to do  good. It fills me with inspiration and hope for both their future and  ours.   They are movers and shakers in every sense. They are the leaders of  today.   Congratulations to the students of Glens Falls on their incredible,  remarkable achievement.   Go Bulldogs.                            ____________________
