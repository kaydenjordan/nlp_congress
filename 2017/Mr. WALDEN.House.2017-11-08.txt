 Mr. Chairman, I want to draw attention, first of all, to  page 17, line 23, of the bill because we have heard from those who  oppose it that somehow this could adversely undermine the Federal Water  Pollution Control Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the  Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, et cetera.   Line 23 makes it very clear, ``No effect on other laws. Nothing in  this section shall be construed to affect any requirement of'' these  underlying and very important laws that protect our environment.   So I just want to make sure that is in the Record. This is the  current text of the bill we are voting on today.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy  Modernization Act.   Hydropower plays an enormously important role in electricity  generation across the country, and especially in my home State of  Oregon. Hydropower generates 43 percent of electricity in my State. It  is dependable base load, it is carbon-free, it is renewable, and it is  very important to our region.   Nationally, hydropower is one of the largest sources of renewable  electricity generation. A recent Department of Energy report said that  U.S. hydropower could grow by almost 50 percent by the year 2050.   Thankfully, my good friend from Washington, Cathy McMorris Rodgers,  introduced this legislation because, as these entities go to relicense,  sometimes it costs tens of millions of dollars just to get a renewal of  a government permit to continue to do what you have been doing, and it  can take 7 to 10 years to work through the process. By the way, all  those costs generally--guess who pays for them? The ratepayers. People  paying their electricity bill end up paying for all this incredible,  out-of-control review and regulation.   As the committee worked on this legislation under the able hand of  the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy, Mr. Upton, we solicited  feedback from all stakeholders as we crafted this. We made a number of  changes to address the concerns. We had hearings, and we had lots of  other individual discussions and roundtables. We added new provisions  to ensure that States and Tribes are consulted early in the licensing  process to identify and resolve issues of concern.   We also made sure that State and local governments could recoup the  cost of reviewing applications and conducting studies. We even added a  strong savings clause that clarifies our intent that nothing in the  bill shall be construed to effect any requirement of the Clean Water  Act, the Endangered Species Act, and other environment laws.   As a result, we find ourselves here today with bipartisan support for  this legislation and the support of the American Council on Renewable  Energy, the American Public Power Association, the Business Council for  Sustainable Energy, Edison Electric Institute, the International  Brotherhood of Boilermakers and Electrical Workers, the International  Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, the Large Public  Power Council, Laborers' International Union of North America, the  National Electrical Contractors Association, the National Hydropower  Association, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, North  America Building Trades Council, and the United Brotherhood of  Carpenters and Joiners of America--those most intricately involved in  making sure we have reliable and clean base load hydropower.   Support this modernization legislation. Mr. Chairman, it is  bipartisan, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 3043, the  Hydropower Policy Modernization Act, sponsored by fellow Energy and  Commerce committee member and our Conference Chair, Cathy McMorris  Rodgers.   Hydropower plays an integral role in generating electricity across  the nation, especially back in my home state of Oregon. Hydropower  generates nearly 43 percent of electricity in Oregon and this  dependable baseload power has helped drive the development of  everything from value-added agriculture processing to data centers,  creating jobs along the Columbia River and throughout Oregon.   Nationally, hydropower is the largest source of renewable electricity  generation and a recent Department of Energy report found that  [[Page H8627]]  U.S. hydropower could grow by almost 50 percent by the year 2050.  However, as my colleagues from the Pacific Northwest and across the  country know, we are not taking full advantage of this valuable  resource. Unfortunately, the duration, complexity, and uncertainty of  the licensing process has raised significant challenges, preventing  investments that would create jobs and benefit consumers.   Thankfully, my good friend from Washington introduced this  legislation to alleviate these problems and streamline the federal  hydropower licensing process. The bill before us today didn't just  emerge from thin air. It is the culmination of five committee hearings  and markups, along with several bipartisan staff meetings with the  hydropower industry and tribes that have a stake in the licensing  proceedings.   We solicited feedback from all stakeholders as we crafted this  legislation and made a number of changes to address the concerns  raised. We added new provisions to ensure that states and tribes are  consulted early in the licensing process to identify and resolve issues  of concern. We also made sure that state and local governments could  recoup the costs of reviewing applications and conducting studies. We  even added a strong savings clause that clarifies our intent that  nothing in this bill shall be construed to affect any requirement of  the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and other environmental  laws.   In recognition of the regular order committee process, H.R. 3043  sailed out of committee unanimously by voice vote. The supporters of  this bill, especially labor and industry organizations, recognize the  vital role it will play in supporting job growth, local economic  development, and providing much-needed reforms to the licensing  process.   H.R. 3043 seeks to modernize the permitting process by improving  administrative efficiency, accountability, and transparency; requiring  timely decision making; and by designating Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission as the lead agency is approving permits. You may be asking  yourself, `why is this process in need of reform?' The answer is  simple. As my colleague from Washington likes to point out, it can take  up to 10 years or longer to license a new hydropower project of  relicense an existing facility. Further underscoring the need for this  legislation is the fact that by 2030, over 400 existing projects with  over 18,700 megawatts of capacity will begin the relicensing process.   Mr. Chair, this emissions-free energy resource should not be bogged  down in bureaucratic red tape any longer. It's past time we modernize  this grossly outdated licensing process, so we can get projects to  market faster and streamline those projects in need of relicensing. At  the end of the day, this important legislation promotes hydropower  development, creates jobs, and provides consumers across the country  with continued access to clean, affordable, and reliable baseload power  generation.   I include in the Record the Supporters of H.R. 3043:         The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE); (American       Public Power Association (APPA); Business Council for       Sustainable Energy (BCSE); Edison Electric Institute (EEI),       International Brotherhood of Boilermakers (Boilermakers);       International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW);       International Federation of Professional and Technical       Engineers (IFPTE); Large Public Power Council (LPPC);       Laborers' International Union of North America (LiUNA);       National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA); National       Hydropower Association (NHA); National Rural Electric       Cooperative Association (NRECA); North America Building       Trades Council (NABTU); United Brotherhood of Carpenters and       Joiners of America (Carpenters).
