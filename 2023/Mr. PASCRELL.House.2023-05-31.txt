 Mr. Speaker, the only problem is our tax system is  broken, and you don't want to talk about it. We made strides to fix  this problem with a historic IRS investment.   The IRS is coming after you. I saw those commercials. You are better  than that, guys and gals. You are better than that. No one's putting an  army together, but we want to make sure everybody pays their fair  share.   What in God's name is wrong with that?   That is what we are talking about. If you look at the IRS estimates  of those people who are getting away with murder, that is what the  average American knows about, thinks about, but does little talking  about because he figures he can't do anything about it. You can.    So, Article I is ignored many times by both parties,  both sides of the aisle. It is the Congress that has the power to put a  budget together. It is pretty simple.   All Americans must understand what is happening here. President Biden  put forward a budget to boost opportunity for working Americans,  increase access to healthcare, and improve tax fairness.  [[Page H2699]]    Mr. Speaker, in the greatest country in the world, if we don't fix  our tax system, we have not done our job as Congress, folks.
