 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy,  as I appreciate her tireless leadership on this issue. Her committee  has performed admirably. I am excited about the wide range of areas  that you have enacted to be able to help the recovery that we have seen  around the country, one of the reasons that we have had the largest  increase in employment this last year in American history. I think what  we have today is another chapter in that story.   Over 2 years ago, I received countless late-night texts and phone  calls from the independent restaurants in my community. Portland,  Oregon is known for its restaurant scene. We set to work listening to  them to come up with an approach that would meet their needs. The so- called Paycheck Protection Program was not adequate. They didn't even  know if they were going to be in business, let alone paying back a  loan.   We developed this grant program after consulting with independent  restaurants all across the country. The neighborhood bars and  restaurants were the hardest hit since the beginning of the pandemic.  They were the first to shut down in March of 2020, and they accounted  for a quarter of the job losses; 5\1/2\ million workers in April 2020  alone. And they have been the slowest to reopen.   Yes, they can pivot and adapt, but frankly, the unemployment in the  industry remains stubbornly slow to recover. Approximately 90,000  restaurants have already closed permanently since the start of the  pandemic, and there are a number of others that are just hanging on by  their fingertips, encouraged, in part, by the hope of the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund being replenished.                                time  0945    Restaurants are the cornerstone of a livable community. They have  employed nearly 60 percent of Americans at some point in their career,  myself included, and I know a number of people in this Chamber identify  with that.   They are a major source of employment for people of color. And they  support a trillion-dollar supply chain all across America.   The Federal Government has provided some help to them through the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund, based on my RESTAURANTS Act that I  first introduced in June of 2020.   But the program fell short. It did not have enough money to meet all  the applicants. There were 100,000 grants that were life-changing for a  number of them, but 177,000 hanging in the balance.   The Relief for Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act  finishes the job and completes the promise.   This legislation is simple: It funds restaurants that did not receive  awards that they were otherwise entitled to; it helps other battered  industries, like live events, travel, hospitality, and fitness; and  supports shuttered venues. And it will be paid for with the fraudulent  pandemic relief funds yet to be recovered.   Now, while the COVID case numbers are low and the American public is  ready to move beyond the pandemic, our small, independent restaurants  and other businesses have not fully recovered. This is why the  legislation is critical.   It is a response to very real challenges, thinking about what they  faced in terms of that brittle supply chain; what they faced in terms  of changing regulations; the public being deeply concerned in terms of  health. It is time for us to finish the job that we started.    It is time to finish the job that we started. We  don't want any ruthless, free-market ideology getting in the way of  these hardworking, innovative people who have put their lives and  careers on the line investing everything, hoping that they could have  the promise of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund fulfilled. This  legislation does that, and I strongly urge its adoption.
