 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in  morning business for 1 minute.    Mr. President, I have been working for decades to  establish a memorial on the National Mall to those Black Revolutionary  War patriots who fought for the founding of our country. We are close  to achieving that goal, which is needed now more than ever.   The rationale for the memorial was summarized in congressional  testimony in 1985 by its founder, Maurice Barboza:         The Patriots Memorial would serve an educational purpose in       that it would remind Americans of the rich and meaningful       contributions of Blacks to the birth of America. It would       illuminate the past so that the present generation would       better understand the Nation's history. In that sense, it       would serve a retrospective purpose.        The Patriots Memorial would serve a prospective purpose by       helping future generations of Americans understand what it is       that binds us . . . as a [nation].    He then quoted then-Representative Nancy L. Johnson, the memorial's  chief proponent in the House of Representatives. I quote her and will  end with this quote:         An American cannot be identified by simple physical,       ethnic, racial, or religious characteristics. Even our       cultural heritage is best defined by its rich diversity. What       ties us together as a nation is our commitment to individual       freedom and maintaining the rights and privileges guaranteed       by the Constitution to assure the perpetuation of our       freedom.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Last week Senator Johnson and I released our report  [[Page S5887]]  about our investigation into potential conflicts of interest with  respect to Ukraine policy during the Obama administration. My  Democratic colleagues have attacked this investigation with unsupported  and inaccurate allegations that this investigation is rooted in a  foreign-sourced influence campaign. They have asserted that our  oversight activities relating to the Obama administration are advancing  a Russian disinformation campaign and have implied that we are  ``wielding that disinformation as a political cudgel.'' Nothing could  be further from the truth, so I want to explain.   My Democratic colleagues have publicly insinuated that I received the  records from a Ukrainian national, Andriy Derkach, a Russian agent who  has taken action to influence and interfere in the 2020 election.   Now, get this: I have praised the Treasury Department for sanctioning  Derkach. I have neither received nor solicited information from  Derkach. This is probably the third time I have come to the floor of  the Senate to say this. Yet you still keep getting these accusations  from my friends on the other side of the aisle. Now, the Democrats know  that we have not received this information. Yet they refuse to stop  repeating their false insinuations, and those false insinuations have  resulted in Russian-based media repeating the Democratic  disinformation, which is Exhibit A why the Democrats should have never  created that false narrative in the first place. In fact, during the  course of this investigation, the minority--not the majority--of the  committee introduced Derkach's disinformation into the committee  record.   Foreign election interference should have no quarter in this country,  and we must do everything to stop that interference. If only the  Democrats felt the same about the Steele dossier, which is the very  definition of Russian disinformation and election interference.   Our investigation is based upon Obama administration government  records and records from a Democratic lobby shop, Blue Star Strategies.  They aren't based on any information that we received from a fellow by  the name of Derkach. So if my Democratic colleagues think that those  records amount to Russian disinformation, then that says more about the  previous Obama administration than it does about the Johnson-Grassley  inquiry.   Do you think my Democratic colleagues would have attacked an  investigation involving Donald Trump, Jr.? Remember, I interviewed the  President's son years ago as part of my Russia investigation. I didn't  hear any complaints about my investigative work at that time. Funny how  this has played out, right?   My Democratic colleagues have jammed up document production from  government agencies and engaged in questionable political media  efforts. We would have been done with this investigation a long time  ago if all that opposition hadn't occurred, but here we are, and now  the American people can see our work and judge our work for themselves.   I would like to remind my Democratic colleagues that the first step  in this investigation was a letter that I wrote on August 14, 2019.  That letter was about an Obama-era Committee on Foreign Investment in  the United States transaction. That transaction gave control over an  American company that made anti-vibration technologies with military  applications to a Chinese Government-owned aviation company and a  Chinese-based investment firm with established ties to the Communist  Chinese Government. Reports indicated that a firm formed by Hunter  Biden and Chris Heinz, the stepson of John Kerry, later partnered with  a Chinese-based firm to purchase the American company.   Also at that time, Joe Biden was Vice President and John Kerry was  Secretary of State. The State Department is an approval agency on the  Committee on Foreign Investment.    Clearly, this transaction presented conflicts of interest, and that  is exactly why I wrote the letter of August 2019 to the Treasury  Department.   My Democratic colleagues like to say that we started this  investigation as a result of the Trump impeachment. Well, the last time  I checked, August 14, 2019, was well before the impeachment  investigation began. That letter was also sent before Congress was  notified of the Ukrainian-related whistleblower complaint and before it  was made public.   No matter how hard the Democrats try to say otherwise, this  investigation is rooted in nothing but simply good government  oversight. That is exactly the type of investigation I have run my  entire Senate career.   After the August 2019 letter, news reporting picked up the pace about  Hunter Biden's association with Burisma, the corrupt Ukrainian company,  and the fact that his father was in charge of the Obama  administration's anti-corruption policy for Ukraine.   Now, just think about that for a second. Vice President Biden was  responsible for carrying an anti-corruption message to Ukraine on  behalf of the U.S. Government. At the same time, his son was making  millions of dollars working on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian  company.   To any reasonable observer, that is a very questionable fact pattern  that deserves attention, and it got a lot of attention besides from  Grassley and Johnson. Documents made public as a result of the Freedom  of Information Act and investigative reporting brought very fresh  public attention and scrutiny to this fact pattern.   Reporting showed additional potential conflicts of interest with  respect to Hunter Biden's business dealings all over the world, not  just Ukraine. Those financial dealings also exposed how Hunter Biden  and his business associates sought to benefit financially from their  relationship with Vice President Biden.   As our report shows, Hunter Biden and his business associates had  extensive connections to Russian or Ukrainian nationals. Their business  association also extended to Russian nationals.   The report also shows that Hunter Biden, his family members, and  business associates had extensive connections to Chinese nationals. The  records acquired by the committee show that Hunter Biden and his  associates and family members were connected to Chinese nationals  associated with the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army.  Those connections formed business links, which resulted in millions of  dollars passing through company after company.   Some of those companies were associated with Hunter Biden, his  business partner Devon Archer, and James Biden. The records show deep  and complex financial relationships with Chinese nationals and how  financially fruitful those relationships became.   As one example, records show that Hunter Biden opened a bank account  with a Chinese national linked to the Communist regime and funded with  approximately $100,000. Then he, James Biden, and Sarah Biden went on  an extravagant global spending spree. Records show that Hunter Biden,  via his law firm, also sent over a million dollars to James Biden's  consulting firm, the Lion Hall Group. When the bank contacted Sarah  Biden, who was associated with the firm's bank account, she refused to  answer the questions and provide any additional information and  documentation. According to records we have on file, the bank submitted  the account for closure.   Now, what is very clear is that Hunter Biden leveraged his name and  his father's position for financial gain, and his work with Burisma is  just the tip of the iceberg.   These associations and the millions of dollars that passed between  and among Hunter Biden, Archer, James Biden, and others create criminal  financial concerns. Moreover, they create counterintelligence and  extortion concerns.   The investigation also uncovered that the Obama administration was  well aware of the problems that Hunter Biden's board position caused.  State Department officials testified that his board membership created  the perception of a conflict of interest and was very awkward for all  U.S. officials pushing an anti-corruption agenda in Ukraine.   Secretary of State Kerry publicly denied knowing of Hunter Biden's  role on the Burisma board. Now, we have acquired evidence that he did,  in fact, know about that role.   The owner of Burisma was viewed as an ``odious oligarch'' by State  Department officials. However, in December  [[Page S5888]]  of 2015, instead of following U.S. objectives of confronting oligarchs,  Vice President Biden's staff advised him to avoid commenting on the  odious oligarch and instead say ``I am not going to get into naming  names or accusing individuals.''   Well, if you are running an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine and you  pull your punches when it comes to Burisma while your son is on the  board, that goes to judgment--and here it looks like very bad judgment  and weak leadership.   Based on witness testimony, Burisma's owner allegedly paid a $7  million bribe to officials serving under Ukraine's prosecutor general  to shut the case against him. When he allegedly placed the bribe in  December 2014, Hunter Biden was on the board and--can you believe  this--he had been hired to be on the board to assist with what they  call ``corporate governance and responsibility.'' Obviously, he wasn't  doing his corporate job--due diligence.   The facts show that the Obama administration was well aware of the  problems that Hunter Biden being on the Burisma board caused. The facts  show that the Obama administration turned a blind eye to it. Everyone  knew about the problems it caused, but nobody wanted to do anything  about it. So much for leadership.   At its core, the investigation is a good government oversight  investigation. These are exactly the kinds of shady, backroom deals  that the American people should know about. So now the facts are out  there. The American people can judge this information for themselves.  They don't need the people on the other side of the aisle of this  institution telling them what went on when they were using  disinformation from Russia and spreading that disinformation around and  trying to say it was attributed to something that we got.   As for the next step, Senator Johnson and I will continue to review  the records that we possess and further records that we hope we are  able to acquire.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask to speak for 1 minute as in  morning business.    Mr. President, last night, former Vice President Biden  said that President Trump ``hasn't lowered drug prices for anybody.''  This is false, and I hope that the news media will call out Mr. Biden  for the lie.   Among several other actions, President Trump launched an initiative  to lower the out-of-pocket costs of insulin for seniors through the  Part D Medicaid-Medicare Program. Also, President Trump recently signed  an Executive order that will launch several programs to lower drug  costs and help seniors afford their medicines.   More disingenuous than this claim from Mr. Biden is that it was  actually the Vice President's former Democratic colleagues here in the  Senate who walked away from the negotiating table and killed any hope  of passing legislation to lower prescription drug costs before the  election. This was an effort by Minority Leader Schumer and his  Democratic colleagues to hurt President Trump and Senate Republicans.  Mr. Biden seems content to capitalize on his own party's obstructions.   Now, I have come to expect election-year partisan politics such as I  have just described it, but during a pandemic that has left hundreds of  thousands dead and millions unemployed, it is particularly egregious  that Democrats have decided it is more important to hurt Republicans  than help Americans. I am sorry to say this is the truth of the matter.   It will be up to Democrats to make it right. I am not holding my  breath, but I do hope voters hold accountable a party that failed in  its basic duty to put people ahead of politics.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Mr. President, last night former Vice President Biden  refused to rule out packing the Court if the President and the Senate  proceed to fulfilling their constitutional duties and filling the High  Court vacancy.   I understand there are differences of opinion on the direction of the  Court, but threatening to expand the Court and pack it with favorable  Justices just because the other side won fair and square and simply  followed the Constitution does not meet the commonsense test.   This is dangerous territory and leads to an erosion of public faith  in the judiciary. Where would such a path lead us? Thirteen Justices?  Maybe 21 Justices? At what point does it stop?   I thought we settled this under FDR, way back in 1937-1938. It is  telling that Democrats are not trying to justify their discussion of  Court packing by saying there is some practical reason why it is  needed.   In fact, the Supreme Court is hearing fewer cases than ever. Any  Democratic Court-packing plan would be nothing more than a naked power  grab, an effort by Democrats to subvert the will of the people when  they couldn't get the results they wanted at the ballot box that would  have let their party pick and confirm judges.   Let's try to remain focused on the political independence of the  judiciary and leave politicking to this branch of government--the  legislative branch.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is typical during an election season  to hear Democrats try to scare people into believing that Republicans  want to destroy programs that Americans rely on for their health and  security. We have recently heard this on Medicare and Social Security.  Now there is a new subject to add: health insurance. The programs are  different, but the scenarios are the same.   The Democrats concoct a story, attribute it to the President and to  Republican Members of Congress, and then turn to their allies to  amplify this false narrative. What really stands out this election  season is how those all-too-familiar scare tactics directly contradict  the message coming from the Presidential nominee of the Democratic  Party.   Vice President Biden says he is for hope, not fear. His actions and  those of his party show just the opposite. So let's start with the  Democrats' efforts to pin Medicare's financial struggles on  Republicans. The facts tell a much different story.   Republicans have fought for decades, often in the face of Democratic  resistance, to keep Medicare strong not only for current enrollees but  for their children and grandchildren. For instance, in 1995, President  Clinton vetoed Republican efforts to keep Medicare on sound financial  footing.   Faced with the prospect that the Medicare hospital insurance trust  fund was going broke in just a few years, back then, Republicans still  pressed on. It was the work of a Republican House of Representatives  and a Republican Senate that ultimately convinced President Clinton to  sign the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That act of 1997 extended the  life of the health insurance trust fund, but it was not a silver bullet  to solve the Medicare Program's long-term financial challenges.   For many years, spanning both Democratic and Republican  administrations, the Medicare trustees have cautioned that the  program's financial shortfalls require further legislative action. The  trustees reported repeatedly--advised Congress to enact such  legislation sooner rather than later to minimize the impact on  beneficiaries, healthcare providers, and taxpayers.   Republicans know how important Medicare is to the over 60 million  Americans who rely on the program for their healthcare, but we also  realize that Medicare is on an unsustainable course. I have already  said that we need to work in a bipartisan way to protect Medicare,  particularly here in the U.S. Senate, where it takes 60 votes to get  anything done. That work requires an honest assessment and a very  serious discussion.   Sadly, it seems that Democrats are only willing to take their heads  out of the sand long enough to point fingers. So let's set the record  straight. Earlier this year, the trustees of Medicare projected that  that program would be bankrupt in 2026. Then, of course, we have this  unprecedented public health emergency to deal with, the pandemic, as we  always call it, which dealt a crippling blow to our Nation. The  sacrifices and efforts made to stop the spread of the coronavirus  effectively shut down the U.S. economy and altered life as we all know  it.   Congress stepped in to provide Federal relief. The COVID response  bills were passed on an overwhelming bipartisan majority, specifically  the CARES Act--better known as the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic  Security Act--passed the House by a vote of 419 to 6, and the U.S.  Senate, 96 to 0.   CARES gives extra Medicare funding to hospitals and other healthcare  providers to keep them in business in the face of an unexpected drop in  demand for medical services. Additionally, because of Medicare Part A,  as financed by payroll taxes that are split between employers and  employees, unemployment caused by the pandemic has resulted in less  money coming into the trust fund. So it, then, is not surprising that  the Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this month that the  Medicare trust fund could run out of money in 2024, 2 years earlier  than the Medicare trustees had projected, without taking into account  the impact of COVID because they didn't know about it and couldn't take  that into consideration.   It is important to note that during the Trump Presidency and prior to  the pandemic, the projected insolvency date of the Medicare health  insurance trust fund remained pretty steady. No one could have  anticipated this current crisis.   Instead of taking it as a reminder of the need to shore up Medicare  for the long haul, Democrats have opted to create a false narrative  that the current administration is the problem. Every recent President,  Republican and Democratic, has offered Medicare reform ideas in budget  requests submitted to the Congress. Many of those budgets contained  identical policy ideas, whether from a Republican President or a  Democratic President.   Putting aside that Congress, and not the President, makes laws, the  notion that proposals aimed at making Medicare more efficient is  equivalent to sabotaging the program is absurd. Yet, whenever a  Republican occupies the White House, we repeatedly hear from Democrats  that proposals for program integrity represent cuts or efforts to  weaken or destroy Medicare, even when some of those same proposals were  put forward by Democratic administrations.   Because Medicare is on a path to bankruptcy, the greatest threat,  then, is what often happens around here--inaction. Over the past  decade, Democrats not only stood firmly in the way of meaningful  Medicare reform, but they actually made the problem worse.  [[Page S5906]]  Rather than confront the looming crisis in 2009, President Obama, Vice  President Biden, and Washington Democrats raided more than $700 billion  from the Medicare Program. They didn't do it to save Medicare; they cut  money from a financially strapped Medicare Program and then spent that  money on a brandnew entitlement program called ObamaCare. It was the  Democrats who pushed ObamaCare through Congress without a single  Republican vote.   And what do Democrats want to do if they find their way back into  power? They want to enact something called Medicare for All. Moving the  180 million Americans with private, employer-based insurance to the  Medicare rolls would cause Federal spending to balloon to unthinkable  levels.   An analysis conducted by the Mercatus Center in 2018 found that  Medicare for All would increase Federal spending by $32 trillion over  the next 10-year period. This Democratic plan would also give the  Federal Government more control over healthcare, impose massive tax  increases on the middle class, and disrupt access to services. That is  why Democrats would rather mischaracterize the unavoidable impact of  COVID and demonize Medicare budget proposals that are often bipartisan  in nature.   Democrats used the very same dirty tricks related to Social Security,  as I just talked about with Medicare. Some across the aisle recently  concocted a hypothetical proposal that eliminates the funding source  for Social Security and asked the program's Chief Actuary to assess its  impact.   This was an obvious attempt to alarm seniors and disabled Americans  with the ultimate intent of smearing Republicans and feeding false  talking points to a Democratic candidate for President. Even when their  schemes and false talking points earned four Pinocchios from even the  Washington Post, Democrats still proceed full speed ahead with their  misinformation campaign. And even though Ways and Means Committee  Ranking Member Brady and I got the Social Security Actuary to affirm  the Democrat's recent scheme was just a bunch of malarkey, the  Democrats and Candidate Biden continue with this misinformation.   Again, Democrats use scare tactics in the runup to an election. While  they accuse Republicans of wanting to destroy Social Security, Senate  Democrats do little or nothing to work in a bipartisan way to help this  program. Remember, in 2015, when the disability insurance trust fund  was going to run dry, Senate Democrats demanded that the only thing  that you could possibly do was to take from the retirement trust fund  and then just simply kick the can down the road.   Senate Democrats had no interest in working with us to at least try  to make the disability insurance program better for beneficiaries.  Instead, Senate Republicans worked with the House and Obama  administration to prevent disability security trust fund exhaustion and  even to improve the program.   There was no privatization of anything, and the only thing that could  be construed as a benefit cut came directly from President Obama.   You will not hear anything about that from these Senate Democrats.  Instead, they just bring out their stale talking points and, of course,  scare tactics about Republicans trying to destroy the program. Now they  are applying the same wornout, baseless scare tactics to this Supreme  Court confirmation process.   Democrats want to make the President's nomination to fill the vacancy  all about ObamaCare and the case the Court will consider this fall.   Going to the minority leader's own words when it comes to Judge  Barrett's confirmation hearing, he said: ``We must focus like a laser  on health care.'' The left is misrepresenting an article by then- Professor Barrett in hopes of finding something--almost anything--to  gum up this confirmation process. It seems to me they are just  frustrated this nominee had the audacity to suggest judges interpret  law as written.   There is an old saying in the legal profession: If the law isn't on  your side, pound the facts. If the facts aren't on your side, pound the  law. If neither fact or law is on your side, just pound the table.   That is what we see yet again from our Democratic colleagues. It is  ludicrous to pick one pending case and predict how every member of the  Court, including one just starting the confirmation process, would vote  on that case, especially when entirely different legal issues are at  stake. Frankly, it is a disservice to the American people.   The Democrats know this, but that will not stop them. It will not  stop them from trying to mislead hard-working Americans into believing  that their healthcare coverage could disappear tomorrow.   It is also just the latest example of how many Democrats in Congress  view the Supreme Court--just somehow another policy end that they can't  accomplish through this branch of government, where we are now. That is  not the role of the Court. I am sure Judge Barrett will reiterate that  point before the Judiciary Committee.   The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case mid-November,  and there are countless scenarios on a potential outcome. So is it is  useless, then, to speculate. But that will not stop the Democrats from  speculating during this process of Judge Barrett's nomination.   The bottom line is, no matter the decision, no one will lose  healthcare coverage on the day the Supreme Court issues its ruling.   In the meantime, Republicans will continue to protect individuals  with preexisting conditions and fight to give Americans more affordable  healthcare options.   The President reaffirmed that very thing in his commitment in an  Executive order that he signed last week. That Executive order states  that it has been, and will continue to be, the policy of the United  States to assure that Americans with preexisting conditions can obtain  insurance of their choice at an affordable price.   The Democrats don't want to stop at ObamaCare. What they really want  to do is impose their government-run Medicare for All Program and take  away people's private insurance plans that they like--because 160  million people have it.   As I mentioned earlier, this one-size-fits-all approach would take  away people's private insurance, result in worse care, and bankrupt the  country.   Republicans want to strengthen Medicare, preserve Social Security,  and ensure affordable private coverage options now as well as in the  future. Democrats want to mislead now in hopes of future political  gains.   Americans deserve better. We can do better.   Vice President Biden and his party should stop their shameful  election-year scare tactics. They should end the malarkey.   It is time to have the courage to engage in an honest, civil  conversation about bipartisan ideas to improve these health and  security programs for millions of people who depend on them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 2:15 p.m.
