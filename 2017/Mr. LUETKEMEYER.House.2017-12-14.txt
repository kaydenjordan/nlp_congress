 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for  his diligent work on this issue. I also thank Chairman Hensarling from  Texas for all of the leadership that he has given us throughout the  year on this particular issue as well.   Several years ago, the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) and I  introduced bipartisan legislation to require depository institutions to  provide privacy information to their customers only if they had changed  any policy or practice related to that customer's privacy. That bill  was ultimately signed into law by President Obama. It has eliminated  millions of confusing and often-ignored mailings that cost millions of  dollars to produce each year.   While our legislation provided relief to banks and credit unions, it  did not extend relief to other financial companies regulated under the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; namely, captive finance companies that operate  in a manner largely similar to depository institutions.   The safeguards featured in the bill from the 114th Congress and  codified into law are included in Mr. Trott's bill. This relief will  not be granted to a financial company that has changed its policies or  practices with regard to disclosure of nonpublic personal information;  only if it kept it the same.   There is also a requirement that the privacy notice must be made  available to consumers in a variety of ways. Consumers will continue to  have access to privacy notices through online resources and billing  statements.   Requirements for financial institutions to release annual privacy  notices to customers, even when no changes have been made, are both  redundant and a waste of resources. With the passage of this bill,  information included in these mailings would likely be more significant  to the consumer because they would only come after a change in privacy  policy.   Mr. Speaker, this is about accountability for the institution to  their customer for holding that information. It is about access for the  customer to their own information, with regards to privacy of it. A  good example, as pointed out by the ranking member, was Equifax. But  let's stop and talk about Equifax for a second.                                time  0945    What happened? They had, I believe, the largest breach in history,  150 million people.   Mr. Speaker, there is probably you and I and everybody in this room  and probably the 12 people watching right  [[Page H9910]]  now who are affected by this, but I guarantee you that you and I and  all in this room and the 12 people watching, nobody kept their privacy  notices that were sent out last year, did we? They are all in file 13  somewhere, long forgotten, and all of the information in those privacy  notices is forgotten about and not even probably read to begin with.   So it is important. The gentleman's bill here has in here that the  privacy notice can be accessed online. And in the Equifax breach,  anybody who was concerned could then go online and check for the  privacy policies of Equifax and see what the policies were and whether  they were adhered to by the company itself in notifying them, in taking  care of their concerns, in reimbursing them. Whatever was in the notice  was in that online notice as well. So it provided that access, which  the consumer is not going to have in a piece of paper. That is probably  going to get in file 13.   I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, when I was home last weekend, I got one  of those things. You know what, I looked at it, opened the envelope,  and said: ``I don't want to read this.'' I threw it away. This is  nonsense. This is a waste of time and resources.   And, in this situation with the Equifax breach, I think this bill  points out the great things that can happen if you enact this  legislation from the standpoint of allowing consumers to have access,  24/7, to the notifications and the privacy policies.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the gentleman from Michigan for  picking up the mantle on this issue, and I ask my colleagues to join me  in supporting H.R. 2396. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  bringing the bill before us today.
