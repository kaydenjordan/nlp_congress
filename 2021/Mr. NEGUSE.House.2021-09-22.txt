 Mr. Speaker, 6 months ago today, we experienced a tragedy  in my community of Boulder, Colorado.   On a Monday afternoon in March, 10 lives were lost at our local King  Soopers as a gunman opened fire on customers and employees.   Ten lives were taken far too soon--daughters, sons, neighbors,  spouses, coworkers, community members, each of whom left a profound  impact on our community.   While the national news may have moved on, for our community, for the  families, friends, and neighbors, we are still grieving and still  healing.   May we continue to remember them. May we lift up their families and  friends in our prayers and in our thoughts.   In the words of Thomas Campbell: ``To live in hearts we leave behind  is not to die.''   Our community remains strong in the face of this senseless act of  violence. In strength, in kindness, and in compassion, may we move  forward.                            ____________________
