 Mr. President, Rhode Island has lost a  tireless champion in the fight against breast cancer, Marlene McCarthy.  Marlene's dedication to this cause was well known throughout Rhode  Island and across Capitol Hill.   Marlene cofounded the Rhode Island Breast Cancer Coalition in 1992  and represented Rhode Island on the National Breast Cancer Coalition's  board of directors and executive committee. Under her leadership, the  Rhode Island Breast Cancer Coalition established a helpline for breast  cancer patients and a Breast Cancer Resource Center and provided  countless support services to Rhode Islanders facing this terrible  disease.   Her advocacy was not limited to Rhode Island. Marlene regularly  visited me in Washington, DC, advocating for stronger Federal funding  for breast cancer research and broader access to the best possible  breast cancer care. At Marlene's urging, I introduced the Accelerating  the End of Breast Cancer Act, legislation to set a goal of eradicating  breast cancer by 2020.   The driving force behind Marlene's hard work and boundless  persistence was her dream of a future free from the scourge of breast  cancer for her granddaughters. It is in Marlene's memory that I pledge  to continue to fight for policies that will make her dream a reality.   I offer my condolences to Marlene's family and to the breast cancer  community. Marlene's legacy will live on through the family and loved  ones she has left behind, the continuing work of the Rhode Island  Breast Cancer Coalition, and the countless people she inspired through  her advocacy and compassion. She will be missed.                            ____________________
