 Mr. President, last weekend, we gathered in the Capitol  Visitor Center to celebrate the 283rd birthday of King Kamehameha I,  who, to the best of our knowledge, was born in Kohala, HI, in 1735.   Since 1871, generations of Hawaiians have formally celebrated King  Kamehameha's birthday through annual celebrations--including floral  parades and lei-draping ceremonies. Kamehameha Day is celebrated across  the State and is an acknowledged State holiday.   These events recognize the many accomplishments of Hawaii's first  King and his importance in unifying the Hawaiian Islands.   This year was no different, as this past weekend tens of thousands of  individuals gathered in Washington, DC, and Hawaii to remember his  legacy and celebrate his accomplishments.   However, this year's ceremonies came at another important time of  reflection.   On February 17, 2018, Gov. David Ige proclaimed 2018 to be the ``Year  of the Hawaiian, Ke Au Hawaii'' in Hawaii. The Governor's proclamation  came after the Hawaii State Legislature made a similar proclamation for  the year.   So as we gathered to remember King Kamehameha, we also reflected more  broadly on the achievements and contributions of Hawaii's indigenous,  Native Hawaiian community in the areas of politics and government,  education and the arts, music, writing and literature, sports,  business, medicine, law, and social work.   We reflected on the restoration and revitalization of Native Hawaiian  language and traditions and the importance of promoting Native Hawaiian  cultural practices.   We remembered great statesmen like Daniel Kahikina Akaka, U.S.  Senator of Native Hawaiian ancestry, who served in Congress over the  course of five decades and recently passed away.   We remembered philanthropists like Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop.   It has been 30 years since the last Year of the Hawaiian was  celebrated in 1988, and important advancements by and for the Native  Hawaiian community have been made since that time.   We have seen the creation and expansion of Native Hawaiian immersion  schools and Hawaiian-focused charter schools. We have seen the  establishment of a College of Hawaiian Language at the University of  Hawaii. We have seen the continued revitalization of Native Hawaiian  navigation practices, including through the Malama Honua Worldwide  Voyage, which visited more than 150 ports and 23 countries and  territories.   We have seen more than 14,000 Native Hawaiians serve in the U.S.  military. We have seen the return of land and repatriation of Native  Hawaiian cultural artifacts. We have seen the protection of Native  Hawaiian burial sites. We have seen the expansion of Native Hawaiian  healthcare services. We have seen the expansion of opportunities for  Native Hawaiian businesses.   We have also seen the Federal Government reiterate its special  political and legal relationship with the Hawaiian people based on  their unique status  [[Page S3759]]  as an indigenous people of this country.   These advancements, while important in themselves, represent a  continued commitment to making sure the Federal Government upholds its  responsibilities to the Hawaiian people.   So as we continue through the Year of the Hawaiian and celebrate  these achievements, let us also renew our commitment to the Hawaiian  people and make sure we continue to fight for future generations.   Mahalo nui loa.                            ____________________
