 Mr. Speaker, last week, as I traveled  the communities of my congressional district, I witnessed and saw  firsthand the evidence of the great American comeback: the amount of  jobs, the job growth that was available, the increase in wages,  individuals who have left one job for what we call a new job, a better  job, higher wages. The economic growth was absolutely incredible and  inspiring, the great American comeback.   Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed last December, the results  in our economy have been historic. The unemployment rate is at 3.9  percent, the lowest it has been in decades. Job openings are at a  record high. 213,000 jobs were added in June alone in this great  Nation. In June, there were 6.7 million job openings--most recently  reported, we are at 6.9 million job openings--marking the first time  since 2000 that there have been more job openings than those who are  unemployed.   Over the past 12 months, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has added  more than 65,000 new jobs. I witnessed a lot of those in my visits to  manufacturers, refineries, and small businesses. It is just incredible,  this great American comeback.   Mr. Speaker, after years of struggling to get ahead, the American  people are seeing more jobs, opportunity, and optimism come back.  Small-business owners are reporting increased employment and higher  wages at record levels. Main Streets across America are thriving.  People have more money in their paychecks, and the tax cuts are working  for the middle class.   Today and Friday, this House will vote on three bills and make the  tax cuts permanent, make the great American comeback permanent. We need  to double down on the success and pass tax reform 2.0.   Through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have doubled the standard  deduction and lowered tax rates, which means that 90 percent of  Americans are seeing more money in their paychecks this year. Plus,  more than 4 million Americans at 642 companies see better wages,  bonuses, and expanded retirement options.   In fact, more than half of small businesses have plans to expand and  boost hiring or increase employee benefits. This is tremendous news for  American families. Too many Americans have been living paycheck to  paycheck and have been doing so for way too long. Stagnant wages,  growing debt, and the inability to save have plagued so many.   Tax reform 2.0 will create and expand additional programs to help  Americans save. For example, it creates a new savings account to offer  a fully flexible savings tool that families can use at any time. It  expands the 529 education savings accounts. It creates a new baby  savings program to help with the birth of a child or an adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I fundamentally believe that Americans should keep more  of their hard-earned money. They deserve that. Thanks to the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, Congress paved the way to create a tax system that is  fairer, simpler, and one that establishes an environment where our  country can thrive.   We worked hard to do that. On Friday, we will vote to make those tax  cuts permanent.   If you support higher wages, if you support lower unemployment, if  you support more jobs, if you support bigger paychecks, if you support  the American people, then you will support tax reform 2.0.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud  the passage of H.R. 302, the Federal Aviation Administration  Reauthorization Act of 2018.   This bipartisan legislation includes a 5-year reauthorization of FAA  programs that promote safety and American leadership in aviation. It  also strengthens consumer voices and invests in our airport  infrastructure.   Importantly, the Essential Air Service program was reauthorized for  an additional 5 years through fiscal year 2023.   This program is vital for rural America. It ensures taxpayers in  small, rural communities are connected to the national transportation  system. This program provides links to hub airports at more than 170  locations in 36 States and territories, including three in my  congressional district, which would otherwise lack commercial air  service.   Reliable transportation plays a key role in growing jobs all over the  country, and rural America should be no exception.    Additionally, this bill includes important reforms to the Federal  Contract Tower Program, which has a proven record of enhancing aviation  safety and provides significant cost savings to the taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the House approved this bill to keep all  Americans connected to reliable and safe air transportation.                            ____________________
