 Madam Speaker, our economy thrives on competition and  freedom. No employer should be able to block their workers from taking  a better job, but that is what noncompete contracts do. They strip  Americans' freedom to work at the job that is best for them.   As a result, workers are losing out on nearly $300 billion in wages  every year. Companies stop incentivizing workers to stay because they  don't need to. They are stuck.   Noncompetes also drag down the entire economy, hurting even those of  us who aren't covered by them. Everyone is harmed when wages are  suppressed, innovation is stifled, and competition is prevented.   I am thrilled that the Federal Trade Commission is ending this toxic  practice. Banning noncompetes will promote the ideals our country was  founded on--open markets, economic mobility, and the right to control  one's own life.   Madam Speaker, I commend this effort to make our capitalist economy  more fair, free, and prosperous.           Standing Up for Rental Market Fairness and Affordability     Madam Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm on the  housing crisis crushing millions of Americans.   Skyrocketing rents across the country are pummeling families and  squeezing them out of their homes. Let's face it, the rental market is  broken and riddled with unfair practices.   Unreasonable background checks, crooked screening algorithms, and  anticompetitive information sharing are just some of the many obstacles  locking renters out from obtaining safe and affordable housing.   I am grateful that the Biden administration announced new actions to  increase fairness in the rental market, protect tenants, and make  housing more affordable. Rooting out predatory tactics and developing  strong guardrails will help prevent future egregious increases in rent.   As California's watchdog during the last foreclosure crisis, I know  it takes fight to keep families in their homes. I urge leaders across  government to stand up for renters.                        Keeping AAPI Communities Safe     Madam Speaker, I rise to address how our government can  address the issues facing our AAPI communities.   Supporting Asian and Pacific Islander Americans requires recognizing  the diversity within those communities. Inadequate data limit our  ability to serve all Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.   Federal data on AAPI people fail to capture differences across ethnic  backgrounds. Grouping all AAPI people into one supercategory erases  important distinctions in cultural traditions and lived experiences.   Blunt data instruments cannot produce targeted policy solutions to  [[Page H922]]  the dangers AAPI communities face, like hate crimes.   In California, anti-AAPI hate crimes are up 177 percent, but some  communities experience these threats more acutely. For example, a  recent survey found that Vietnamese communities are 38 percent more  likely to worry about hate crimes than other AAPI communities.   I am leading efforts to fund community-based solutions to anti-AAPI  hate crimes, but making these tools even more effective requires data  that identify at-risk groups. Official data must guide our efforts to  keep our AAPI neighbors safe.                            ____________________
