 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the late Second  Lieutenant Travis B. Wilkie, a veteran and San Diego native who lost  his life while training at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma. Lieutenant  Wilkie was a model citizen who exuded the values of service and  sacrifice to his country.   A San Diego native, Lieutenant Wilkie worked diligently as both a  student and as a member of his community, and his accomplishments  earned him a spot at the prestigious Air Force Academy in Colorado  Springs.   On November 21 of this year, Lieutenant Wilkie was training with a  fellow pilot, Lieutenant Colonel John Kinkade, when Travis' plane  crashed during a landing formation. Both Lieutenant Wilkie and Colonel  Kinkade tragically lost their lives that day.   Lieutenant Wilkie's loss is felt in our community in San Diego, by  his colleagues at the Air Force Academy, by his fellow servicemembers  at Vance Air Force Base, and by his family. In a text to me yesterday,  his mom, Carlene, said: `` `Devastated' is not a strong enough word.  Travis was a brilliant, hardworking 23-year-old who just married the  love of his life on October 14. I don't believe any young pilot should  die in a training mission. Unbearable.''   Please join me in remembering and honoring Second Lieutenant Wilkie  and Lieutenant Colonel Kinkade, their families, and the communities  they touched during their lives and their service.                        In Honor of Albert J. Hickman     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the San Diego  hero, the late Ensign Albert J. Hickman, a decorated veteran who gave  his life to save many others.   Ensign Hickman was 21 years old when the F3H Demon, the jet he was  piloting, malfunctioned. He was on a routine training mission over San  Diego, California, when he lost control of the aircraft and began  plummeting toward the ground.   At the time of the engine malfunction, Hickman's jet was directly  over a neighborhood and an elementary school playground crowded with  children on their noontime recess. Instead of simply ejecting from the  jet, he stayed with the aircraft and steered it into a remote canyon in  order to avoid the playground.   Ensign Hickman sacrificed his life to save the lives of 750 children.  He was posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the  highest noncombat medal awarded for heroism. Hickman Elementary School  in Mira Mesa was also named in his honor, as was Hickman Field in  Kearny Mesa.   At a ceremony at the school, 11-year-old Hawthorne student body  president Kay Schade gave a speech that was quoted in the San Diego  Union Tribune: ``Ensign Hickman not only saved our lives but left us an  ideal by which to live. Let us strive to be as brave and courageous  ourselves as he was.''   December 4 marked the 60th anniversary of his death. In September,  his heroism was remembered at Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial.   Please join me in honoring Ensign Albert Hickman for his dedication  and sacrifice as we seek to continue his legacy of heroism.             In Honor of Senior Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Senior Chief Petty  Officer Kenton Stacy, a decorated veteran who sustained injuries in the  line of duty while on tour in Syria.   Senior Chief Stacy was on his final tour in Syria after having  already completed one tour in Iraq and two in Afghanistan. He  specialized in explosive ordnance disposal, meaning that every  assignment he undertook was a matter of life and death for himself and  members of his team.    In 2017, Senior Chief Stacy and his unit were clearing a hospital in  an area that had been recently occupied by ISIS. During their mission,  an explosive device detonated, leaving Senior Chief Stacy badly  wounded. While Senior Chief Stacy survived, the explosion ultimately  left him paralyzed and unable to speak.   Senior Chief Stacy was honored this past Veterans Day with a plaque  at the Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial in San Diego, the only memorial  in the United States that honors veterans, both living and deceased,  from the Revolutionary War until now. This will help ensure that his  sacrifice is never forgotten.   Please join me in honoring Senior Chief Petty Officer Kent Stacy and  his family and thanking them for all their courage and service to our  country.                            ____________________
