 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding rule XXII, all postcloture time on Executive Calendar  No. 1, the Montenegro treaty, be expired; that all pending amendments  be withdrawn, the resolution of ratification be reported, and the  Senate vote on the resolution of ratification with no intervening  action or debate; and that if the resolution of ratification is agreed  to, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
