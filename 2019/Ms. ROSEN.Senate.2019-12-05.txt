 Mr. President, today it is my honor to pay tribute to  Edward Hall, an incredible 96-year-old Nevadan, whose story began when  he answered the call to defend his country. Eighty years ago, in 1939,  at the age of 16, Ed lied about his age to enlist in the Army Air Corps  and began his military service to our great Nation. On December 7,  1941, at just 18 years old, he found himself stationed at Hickam Field,  Hawaii, working in the mess hall cleaning up and preparing for the day  when he and his fellow troops heard an explosion. This was the  beginning of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and Ed, like many of  the men on Hickam Field, stopped what he was doing to respond to this  attack on the American Base. Without hesitation, Ed put his life on the  line, joining in to rescue his fellow servicemembers injured in the  ongoing attack. Along with an Army officer, Ed commandeered a truck and  began driving around the flight line picking up the injured to move  them to the base hospital in spite of coming into direct fire from  Japanese aircraft. Upon returning from his third round of picking up  the injured, Ed's truck was strafed by a Japanese Zero fighter and  taken out of action, but Ed kept at it, as he knew helping the injured  was his priority. As the bodies of the dead and injured continued to  mount, Ed grabbed a .45-caliber pistol off one of his fallen comrades  in order to have the means to defend himself from the attack as enemy  planes buzzed the skies above him. He would go on to keep that pistol  for the remainder of the war.   As the attack on Pearl Harbor ended, the recovery of the base began  as Ed and other survivors began dealing with the aftermath of the  attack and preparing for our formal entry into World War II in the  Pacific theater. Ed kept going, as many of the members of that  ``greatest generation'' did throughout World War II, embodying the  American spirit of tenacity when faced with the greatest adversity, the  spirit that eventually led to our success in defeating tyranny and  enabling freedom across the world at the end of the Great War in 1945.   Mr. President, to Edward Hall, I join citizens across Nevada and the  Nation in sending our sincere gratitude to him for his service to the  United States. It is heroes like Ed whose service has kept our  communities, States, Nation, and world safe. His service during World  War II, and the life he has led since are an incredible testament to  resilience, and we are forever grateful.                            ____________________
