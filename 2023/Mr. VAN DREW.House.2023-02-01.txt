 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for doing this  today, and I thank him for leading the fight.   Yesterday, I stood on this floor fighting to protect Americans' First  Amendment rights. Today, I am standing here fighting to protect  Americans' Second Amendment rights. God help our Constitution.   Congress has afforded far too much deference to unelected D.C.  bureaucrats in Federal agencies, and it is time, with our majority, to  rein in that extreme power.   The left has talked about taking your gas stoves away, has censored  your speech, and now the ATF, under the guidance of this  administration, is coming to take away millions of pistols from law- abiding gun owners, individuals who own pistol braces, which were  originally approved by the ATF themselves.   What has changed? What is different? What is new? I will tell you  what has changed. What has changed is now we have an administration  that is desperate to erode our Second Amendment rights in more and more  pervasive ways as every year passes. It has continually chipped away at  Americans' constitutional rights because of the lack of understanding  of what the actual roots of gun violence are.   The administration is abusing the powers delegated to the ATF to  illegally track gun owners, perform unauthorized compliance checks at  people's homes, and now banning popular modifications that, I will say  it again, they approved in the first place.   It has to stop. We are tired of it. Americans are tired of it. This  has to end. That is why I am proud to join these efforts to protect gun  owners across this great United States of America.   As their duly elected Representatives, we must fight back. We must  stand tall. We must be tough and stand against this abuse of power on  their behalf.   Let me say this: As a duly elected official and a gun owner myself,  all I have left to say to the ATF is enough is enough. Our right to  keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
