 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution  because, in America, we hold power to account. In America, we do not  succumb to violent insurrections incited by a head of state. In  America, we do not turn a blind eye to high crimes and misdemeanors.  No. That is not who we are.   So, today, as a sworn defender of this Nation's Constitution, I will  vote in favor of impeaching Donald J. Trump.
