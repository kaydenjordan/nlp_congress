 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the bills offered  by Representatives Lee and Khanna to reassert Congress's constitutional  role in authorizing the use of military force.   It was an honor to serve my country in Iraq and Afghanistan, but I  also witnessed the consequences of sending Americans into harm's way  without defined goals and a clear exit strategy.   For the past 17 years, that authorization has sent hundreds of  thousands of American men and women to war in Iraq. We are now faced  with the prospect of another confrontation in the Middle East, this  time with Iran, that risks repeating some of the mistakes of the past.   The most solemn responsibility of Congress is the decision to send  our men and women into harm's way. Authorizations granted by Congress  should be revoked once the original purpose has ended. But Congress has  allowed authorizations to live far past their intended life and  abdicated its Constitutional authority in matters of war and diplomacy.  Until now.   The bills offered by my colleagues reclaim Congress's constitutional  role in determining when we send our sons, daughters, mothers, and  fathers to fight on our behalf. They ensure that the American people  have a voice in making such significant decisions. Through the  leadership of my colleagues, this chamber is ensuring that any future  use of military force must be subject to the rigorous debate the  American people expect.   I applaud the leadership of Representatives Lee and Khanna on this  important issue and I urge my colleagues to join me in reasserting  Congress's role in deciding when to use military force by voting yes on  these bills.
