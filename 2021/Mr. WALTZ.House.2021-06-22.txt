 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about our local allies  in Afghanistan, those that are trying to come to the United States  through the Special Immigrant Visa program.   Beside me here is one of the brave Afghan interpreters who stood  alongside my Special Forces unit, my fellow Green Berets, in  Afghanistan during one of my tours. He volunteered for that duty. He  stood with us in combat. He faced extremism head-on.   And when these brave Afghans stand up, Mr. Speaker, to stand with us,  to stand with our soldiers, as a critical asset that enables us to deal  with the populous and communicate with the populous that we are trying  to protect, but also fight alongside our Afghan security forces  partners, we could not do what we have done in the last 20 years in  Afghanistan and around the world in places like Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and  in places like Africa, without these brave individuals who not only put  their lives on the line but put their families' lives on the line to  stand with us against extremism.   We called him Spartacus. We didn't use his real name, because if the  Taliban found out that he was with us, they would not only track him  down, they would track his entire family down.   Well, unfortunately, after our redeployment, Mr. Speaker, the very  thing that he needed to get a visa to the United States, the  identification paperwork that he had fought with the United States,  that he had fought with America, was found on him in a Taliban  checkpoint. He was taken back to his home village and beheaded, along  with his brothers and cousins in his family.   This story of Spartacus is happening right now, as we speak. The  Taliban, as they slowly and methodically take over Afghanistan, are  hunting these brave individuals down who stood with us against  extremism.   We need to ask ourselves, as Americans, what message are we sending  in terms of keeping our promises, not only with the Afghans, but again,  around the world? The bottom line is, we need to get them out. We have  a moral obligation to get them out.   This is not just a moral obligation, but it is a national security  obligation. The State Department has a 14-step process that takes over  a year to do the appropriate vetting and to assign these visas. We  don't have time for that anymore with U.S. forces withdrawing within  weeks.   The Defense Department is ready to do an evacuation right now. The  Governor of Guam has said he is ready to accept these people, as they  have done with our partners in South Vietnam, as they did with the  South Koreans, as they have done with Cubans. We can process them in a  safe third country and then bring those individuals home.   The Defense Department says they are ready; Guam says they are ready.  Everyone is waiting on the green light from the White House.   Where is that green light, Mr. Speaker? Where is it? Will President  Biden stand up and stand with those and do the right thing for those  that fought with us?   And I have to be candid, he hasn't always done so. He didn't support  the evacuation of our South Vietnamese allies when he was a Senator. I  pray and hope he will correct that past sin and stand with those who  stood with us against extremism.   I mentioned this is a national security issue as well. The Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs, Mr. Speaker, just testified that he believes there  is a decent likelihood, a medium probability, that al-Qaida will come  roaring back in the wake of our withdrawal. So we must also ask  ourselves, when our soldiers have to go back into Afghanistan, who are  they going to have to fight alongside? Will they have anyone left that  will not have been hunted down like Spartacus was?                                time  1215    Finally, this isn't just an interpreter issue. Twenty-five percent of  the Afghan Parliament is set aside for women. These women are also  being hunted, abused, forced to stay home, not go into their elected  office. Some have had acid thrown on their face. Some are even executed  themselves.   Civil society leaders, journalists, all those who have spoken out  against the atrocities that we have seen, that we have fought against  are also being targeted.   We have an obligation, as an American people, as a military, to  support those who have stood with us.   Mr. Speaker, should we not, time is running out. The world is  watching, and when that last American soldier  [[Page H2937]]  goes wheels up, these people will have a death sentence, and there will  be blood on this administration's hands.                            ____________________
