 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, Mr. Thornberry, and  the committee for their diligent work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this NDAA conference report.  I applaud this bill's goal to improve the readiness level of our  military which has been depleted of critical resources after many years  of defending this country.   Not only does this legislation begin to rebuild our forces, it  includes a long overdue pay raise for our troops.   I applaud the bill's reforms to improve the military healthcare  system and make sure taxpayer resources are used appropriately.   I especially want to highlight the current situation in Afghanistan,  which needs drastic improvement. Shoring up Afghani security forces is  only part of a short-term solution. We need a long-term strategy that  brings stability to Afghanistan as well as the entire region. The NDAA  directs Secretary Mattis to develop such a 5-year strategy. This is a  good step, and I urge the military to continue thinking long term.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this report.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the 21st Century  Flood Reform Act.   I commend my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee for their  hard work on this important bill, and I urge all Members to support its  passage.   As we all know, this hurricane season brought flooding and  devastation to many parts of the country. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria added even more debt to the National Flood Insurance Program,  leading to a taxpayer bailout of $16 billion. That is $16 billion taken  from the pockets of hardworking Americans. Unless Congress passes the  21st Century Flood Reform Act, we will, once again, have to bail out  this program.   The NFIP, as it currently operates, is structurally unsound. This  bill will help to prevent future bailouts by authorizing the NFIP to  build up its reserves. It will also prioritize mitigation efforts and  encourage the NFIP to engage in actuarially sound practices.   Of course, this effort is not solely focused on taxpayer protection.  Homeowners, too, will benefit from the 21st Century Flood Reform Act.   This bill crucially fosters the development of a private market for  flood insurance. This will provide consumers with better options and  more competitive prices.   My own State's former insurance commissioner testified in front of  our committee last year in support of this idea after seeing benefits  of private sector involvement. Commissioner Miller said:   ``In Pennsylvania, competition is proving to be good for consumers. .  . .''   ``We are finding in many cases that private carriers are willing to  offer comparable coverage at substantially lower cost than the NFIP.''   Mr. Speaker, this is good for the people of western Pennsylvania and  it is the right policy for homeowners across the country.   I also want to thank Chairman Duffy for incorporating my amendment  concerning Amish communities into the final bill. The Amish and similar  religious communities have a tradition, informed by their religious  obligations, of paying for community losses through mutual aid  societies. My amendment to this bill accommodates those communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott), a senior member of the  Financial Services Committee.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Waters for yielding.   First, it is very important for us to understand that flooding, Mr.  Speaker, is no longer just a coastal lawmaker's problem. Flooding is  now running rampant in every part of our country.   So I think that every Member on the floor today and every Member of  Congress needs to ask themselves a question, and that is: Are you  really willing to put your name on this bill? Are you really willing to  vote for this bill that will drastically raise premiums on your  constituents without putting the necessary guardrails in place so those  who can't afford the high costs can still buy flood insurance?   Now, one example I am talking about is this, Mr. Speaker--and I want  to make this clear. I hope that there are listeners on C-SPAN who will  tune in. Call your neighbors, call somebody. So you listen to this:  This bill, H.R. 2874, will require policyholders to pay for any  assistance they get when their States create affordability programs.   Here is an example: Mr. Duffy's bill allows for the creation of a  voluntary State-run affordability program. But here is the catch, Mr.  Speaker: there isn't one dime of funding provided in this bill to set  up and implement this program.   Instead, Mr. Duffy's bill says the cost of any discount given to  policyholders will have to be offset by fee increases on other  policyholders within the same State.   Now, Mr. Speaker, this is the Achilles' heel in this flood insurance  business. I can guarantee you that this would have a gravely negative  impact on all of us who are low to middle income.   Mr. Speaker, I made it clear to Mr. Jeb Hensarling, our distinguished  chairman; and to Mr. Duffy that we are willing to walk across party  lines.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentleman.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. But we offered this, as the ranking  member said, as an excellent opportunity. This summer, we spent week  after week on this bill so that we could move this bill forward in a  way that would address affordability, which was a major concern of  mine, of the ranking member's, and those of us on our side of the  aisle.                                time  1545    There is no affordability in here. It is very important for us to  point out that this plan will put an overburden on the States, and then  they have to pass it on in fees to the others.   Unfortunately, it is a terrible bill. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
