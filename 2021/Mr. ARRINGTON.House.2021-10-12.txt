 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, to answer my friend's question about would we do this  again on tax cuts, the answer is absolutely.   We grew the economy. We created jobs. We lifted 6 million people out  of poverty. And guess what--2 years in a row, we have record revenues  in the Treasury coffers to bring down our deficits and our national  debt, which by the way, is the greatest threat to this country and the  prospects of our children inheriting the blessings of liberty and  prosperity.   Mr. Speaker, but instead of putting that as the central issue of  debate today, we are here--we flew from all over the country--to vote  to raise the debt ceiling, but it is buried in a bill that has family  violence, nursing mothers, protecting old job applicants. I don't know  what costume party I have arrived at here in Washington, but Halloween  has come early here because nothing on this rule bill says, ``debt  limit.''   It has nursing mothers--I know that my Democrat colleagues want to be  involved in every facet and phase of the lives of the American people,  including nursing mothers, but the reality is, we are broke. Our budget  process is completely dysfunctional. We ought to be talking about  spending caps, no budget, no recess, debt targets; things that we could  work together on to actually get on a sustainable path to fiscal  sanity.   But instead, we bury a debt ceiling vote--which is what this is--in a  rule bill about family violence, older Americans, and nursing mothers.  I mean, that is the most Washington shuck-and-jive thing I have seen in  a long time. What deception. What swampiness.   Mr. Speaker, that is why the American people can't stand this  institution, and they certainly can't trust this institution to do the  people's business.
