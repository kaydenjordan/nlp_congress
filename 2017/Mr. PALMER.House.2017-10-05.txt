 Mr. Chairman, Article I, section 9 of the Constitution  grants Congress the power of the purse. This assigns to Congress the  role of final arbiter of the use of public funds.   Despite this clear declaration of power, the Office of Management and  Budget estimates that agencies collected over $513 billion in fines,  fees, penalties, and other offsetting collections and receipts in  fiscal year 2017. Allowing agencies to have slush funds outside of the  normal appropriations process is a recipe for bad acting.   The RSC budget calls for implementing the Agency Accountability Act,  which directs that all fines, fees, and settlements go to the Treasury,  making them subject to the normal appropriations process. This would  end the agencies' ability to operate independently and outside of the  oversight of Congress. More importantly, it would allow Congress to  fully account for how much money the government actually collects and  where that money is coming from.   I am also pleased that the RSC budget does what is increasingly  becoming an impossible task: it balances the budget, all while  prioritizing defense spending to keep this country secure. This budget  sets forth the bold ideas necessary to put the country back on a path  of fiscal responsibility.   The Congressional Budget Office reports that if we stay on the  current irresponsible fiscal path we are on, by 2047, in 30 years, our  debt to GDP will be 150 percent. Stated more simply, our debt will be  50 percent greater than our entire gross domestic product.   We must put our Nation back on a path of fiscal responsibility, and  the RSC budget does exactly that. As former chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullin warned, our national debt is the  greatest threat to our national security. By putting our Nation on a  sensible fiscal path of balancing the budget, we reduce the extremely  heavy burden that a bloated Federal Government places on America's  working families, allowing them to prosper and making the government  less intrusive in their lives.   I would also like to add extemporaneously in regard to what we are  doing on SNAP benefits. What we are doing is imposing work requirements  on able-bodied adults with no children. I want to repeat: able-bodied  adults with no children. I think most Americans would agree that if  they are getting payments from the Federal Government, they ought to at  least do some work.     Madam Chairman, I appreciate the hard work the Budget  Committee has put forth to produce a budget that prioritizes our  national defense and sets forth bold policy reforms that will get this  country back on track to fiscal responsibility.   Specifically, I am pleased to see that this budget commits to  reducing the substantial amount of improper payments throughout the  Federal Government. The Government Accountability Office estimates that  there were $144 billion--I want to emphasize $144 billion--in improper  payments in 2016 alone, and that is not even a complete estimate. In  fact, 18 Federal programs did not report their improper payments, so  the total is undoubtedly higher.   To make matters worse, since 2013, the amount we have been  incorrectly sending out has been trending upwards. Instead of reducing  our fraudulent payments, the rate at which we pay them out has been  increasing. Since 2003, there has been a total of $1.2 trillion in  improper payments. Let me repeat, that is $1.2 trillion plus interest.                                time  1115    Because we have been running deficits over that timeframe, we have  literally had to borrow that money to send it to fraudsters and others  who  [[Page H7880]]  would not have received it. This is unacceptable.   As you can see from this chart, this represents improper payments for  2016 alone. It is money borrowed that we pay interest on to send to  people who are not supposed to get it. We are borrowing money and  adding to our debt through improper payments.   This budget, for the first time, sets forth a bold strategy for  cutting these payments in half over the budget window, saving us $700  billion over our 10-year window.   While I hope, in the near future, we can zero these payments out, I  am thrilled to see that we are beginning to tackle a problem that is  putting an additional strain on this country's fiscal problems.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this budget.
