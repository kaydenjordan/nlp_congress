 Madam President, I thank my colleague, the Senator  from Rhode Island, and I join him in strong opposition to the  nomination of Mr. Steven Bradbury to be the general counsel of the U.S.  Department of Transportation.  [[Page S7198]]    Mr. Bradbury is a deeply flawed nominee for many reasons, including  his unwillingness to recuse himself from issues involving his former  clients and dodging commitments to forgo accepting waivers for  recusals. However, my opposition to his nomination is rooted in his  troubling record while serving at the Department of Justice during the  Bush administration.   As we know, Mr. Bradbury was Acting Attorney General at the  Department of Justice from 2005 to 2007 and led the Office of Legal  Counsel there from 2005 to 2009. When he was nominated by President  George W. Bush to be Assistant Attorney General in 2004, his nomination  was so unacceptable that the majority leader at the time offered to  confirm 84 stalled nominees in exchange for the withdrawal of his  nomination.   Let me repeat that. The Senate majority leader at the time was  willing to accept 84 other nominees in exchange for President Bush  withdrawing Mr. Bradbury's nomination.   What Senators objected to then--and the reason I am so strongly  opposed to Mr. Bradbury's nomination now--is that Mr. Bradbury is the  chief architect of the legal justification that authorized  waterboarding and other forms of enhanced interrogation techniques we  used to hear a lot about during the last Bush Presidency. For those who  might not be familiar with the term ``enhanced interrogation,'' there  is another term for it that most Americans probably are familiar with.  It is called ``torture.''   The ``torture memos,'' as they are commonly referred to today,  represent a dark period in our Nation's recent history that we must  never repeat. In my opinion, his connection to these memos alone should  disqualify Mr. Bradbury from government service. I understand he is  nominated to serve at the Department of Transportation and not the  Department of Justice, but his very willingness in the past to aid and  abet torture demonstrates a failure of moral character that makes him  dangerous to the American people and to our troops regardless of which  agency he is nominated to serve in. Those torture memos displayed a  disturbing disregard for the intent of Congress and flouted both  international and U.S. law.   If confirmed, Mr. Bradbury will swear a solemn oath to serve the  interests of the American public by providing honest and objective  legal analysis to the Department and the administration. I doubt he can  carry out that oath.   The American Government would, once again, rely on his counsel to  make sure Department of Transportation employees do not subvert the  law, the intent of Congress, or the U.S. Constitution. Unfortunately,  he has let both the government and the American people down before, and  I have no confidence that he is capable of carrying out this critically  important role. Public servants are supposed to serve the public  interests, not the political whims of any President, Democratic or  Republican.   The public should be alarmed by Mr. Bradbury's history of  demonstrating complete deference to a President's policy goals, and we  in the Senate should do everything we can to prevent the likelihood of  that history continuing in the Trump administration.   For my colleagues who may not be familiar with the programs Mr.  Bradbury justified in his legal opinion, let me clarify. Detainees, in  his opinion, could be sleep-deprived for up to 180 hours--approximately  7\1/2\ days--forced into stress positions. Sometimes they were shackled  to the ceiling, subjected to rectal rehydration and feeding, confined  in boxes the size of small dog crates. It was also Mr. Bradbury's legal  opinion that led CIA personnel to conduct mock executions. His legal  opinion led to one man being waterboarded to the point that he became  ``completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full  mouth.'' His legal opinion also led to another man being frozen to  death. Some of these abuses were authorized; others were not, but  brutality, once sanctioned, is not easily contained.   In 2005, this body voted 90 to 9 to enact the Detainee Treatment Act  to prohibit ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.''  That law was enacted after the Supreme Court decided that terrorism  detainees in U.S. custody were protected by the Geneva Conventions.  However, Mr. Bradbury still found legal loopholes to allow torture to  continue.   Even the Department of Justice's own Office of Professional  Responsibility criticized him for ``uncritical acceptance'' of the  CIA's representations about the torture program. This is stunning, and  it cannot simply be dismissed.   In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, Mr.  Bradbury defended the President's questionable interpretation of the  Hamdan case, a case where the Supreme Court ruled that President Bush  did not have the authority to set up military tribunals at Guantanamo  Bay, by famously suggesting the ``President is always right.''   This rubberstamp mentality is extremely dangerous, especially in the  Trump administration. What will Mr. Bradbury do if President Trump asks  him to come up with a legal justification to abolish laws mandating  seat belt use or to come up with ways to negate drunk driving laws?   Let me be clear. Mr. Bradbury didn't make America safer, and he  certainly didn't make our men and women in uniform safer either--quite  the opposite. The actions Mr. Bradbury helped to justify put our troops  and diplomats deployed overseas in greater danger.   This is personal to me because perhaps most disturbingly Mr.  Bradbury's efforts to enable torture compromised our Nation's values.  Our Nation's military men and women are taught the laws of armed  conflict, the proper way to care for detainees, the importance of  acting in accordance with American values. Mr. Bradbury's actions at  the Department of Justice undermined those values. This type of twisted  legal wrangling done at a desk far from the field of battle puts larger  targets on the backs of our troops. If captured, are they now at  greater risk of being tortured themselves? How we treat prisoners under  our control affects how our troops are treated.   Let me read to you Warrant Officer Michael Durant's account of what  happened to him when he was shot down and captured in Mogadishu,  Somalia. This is from his book.         DURANT'S fear of being executed or tortured eased after       several days in captivity. After being at the center of that       enraged mob on the day he crashed, he mostly feared being       discovered by the Somalian public. It was a fear shared by       Firimbi--    Who was one of the people guarding him--         The ``propaganda minister'' had clearly grown fond of him.       It was something Durant worked at, part of his survival       training. The two men were together day and night for a week.       Firimbi spoke Italian and Durant spoke some Spanish,       languages similar enough for them to minimally communicate.        Firimbi considered Durant a prisoner of war. He believed       that by treating the pilot humanely, he would improve the       image of Somalis in America upon his release.    Mr. Durant talked at length about how he was treated when he was  captured in Somalia. He talked about going for days without his wounds  being cared for, being dragged out of his downed Black Hawk by a mob.  He talked about being beaten. He talked about someone sticking a rifle  into his room and firing and shooting him, where he had to pull the  round out of his own shoulder. He talked about being shackled.   All of that is still better than the treatment that Mr. Bradbury's  justifications allow to happen now. It makes our troops' jobs harder  and more dangerous, and their job is already pretty dangerous. Take it  from me, our troops will do any job we ask of them, but we shouldn't be  trying to make those jobs more difficult or dangerous than they already  are.   I can tell you from firsthand experience, as someone who has bled  behind enemy lines, legal gymnastics are a luxury not afforded our men  and women in the field. They are at battle and, more importantly, these  justifications do not protect our troops who are sitting on the floor  of a POW cell. When you are stuck bleeding in a helicopter behind enemy  lines, you hope and pray that if the enemy finds you first, they treat  you humanely.   When I was in flight school, I began the first of several periods  when I was trained in the art of survival, escape, evasion, and rescue.  All pilots received this training. Then, when we were deployed to Iraq,  we also, as members of  [[Page S7199]]  the U.S. troops overseas who were identified as most likely at risk of  being captured among U.S. troops deployed there, received additional  training. This is what the Army told me I could expect upon being  captured: I could expect to be raped. I could expect to be beaten. I  could expect to be starved.   As I sat in my helicopter thanking God that there was another  aircraft there to pull me out, even as the enemy were jumping into  their pickup trucks, speeding toward us to try to capture us, the very  realities of what Mr. Bradbury was justifying happened to me. It is not  something that you can look at from the safety and security of a desk  in Washington. Our troops face this every single day. This is why this  nomination is so incredibly, incredibly troubling.   If the warlords in Somalia recognized the Geneva Conventions and  treated Chief Warrant Officer Durant's capture more humanely, what does  that say about Mr. Bradbury and his willingness to allow far greater  forms of torture than what the Somali warlords were willing to do?   Mr. Bradbury lacked the moral conviction in the Bush White House that  Somali warlords possessed in Mogadishu, and I don't think he can be  trusted to stand up for the values I fought to defend, especially not  in the current administration.   You don't just need to take my word for it. Mr. Bradbury's record  speaks for itself, but in case this point isn't clear enough, here is  what retired Marine Corps General Charles Krulak wrote to the Commerce,  Science, and Transportation Committee about this nominee just this year  on June 26 of 2017:         In his role as acting head of the Department of Justice's       Office of Legal Counsel . . . Mr. Bradbury displayed a       disregard for both U.S. and international law when       authorizing the use of so-called ``enhanced interrogation       techniques'' to interrogate terrorism suspects.    The general goes on further to say:         These interrogation techniques, which Mr. Bradbury       repeatedly approved, included methods that the United States       has acknowledged and even prosecuted as torture and cruel,       inhuman, and degrading treatment.        The use of these techniques not only violated well-      established law and military doctrine, but also endangered       U.S. troops and personnel, hindered the war effort, and       betrayed the country's values, damaging the United States'       stature around the world as a beacon for human rights and the       rule of law. We know that the United States is strongest when       it remains faithful to its core values. The use of torture       and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment undermines those       values, and Mr. Bradbury continually represented their use as       legal and advisable during his time serving in the Bush       Administration.    The general goes on to say further:         In recommending these techniques, Mr. Bradbury also       displayed a discomforting deference to the executive branch's       wishes, tailoring his legal recommendations to fit the White       House's preferred outcome, and even testified in a Senate       Judiciary Committee hearing that ``the President is always       right.'' Mr. Bradbury's recommendations also contradicted the       intent of Congress. In 2005, Congress passed the Detainee       Treatment Act with a vote of 90-9. The law prohibited abuse       of detainees by the U.S. military and agencies, but Mr.       Bradbury authored a legal memo specifically designed to       undermine the will of Congress and to provide the Bush       Administration with authorization to continue using       interrogation methods that constitute torture and cruel,       inhuman, and degrading treatment.        I believe that this is more important than political       affiliation. Mr. Bradbury has time and again shown his       willingness to contravene established law and the intent of       Congress in service to the will of the executive branch.       Though the position to which he is nominated likely will not       involve decisions on national security issues, I believe that       based on his past governmental service, Mr. Bradbury is not       fit for this political office. I ask you respectfully to       oppose his nomination.    That letter is signed:       Semper Fidelis,                                              Charles C. Krulak,                                                General, USMC (Ret.)                               31st Commandant of the Marine Corps.    Also opposing Mr. Bradbury's nomination are 14 former national  security law enforcement, intelligence, and interrogation professionals  whose experience include service in the U.S. military, the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Drug  Enforcement Administration, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Army  Criminal Investigation Command, and the Naval Criminal Investigative  Service.   They wrote:         We write today to express our opposition to the nomination       of Mr. Steven Bradbury to serve once again in a position of       significant responsibility within the U.S. government as       general counsel of the Department of Transportation.        Our opposition stems from the necessary judgment and       personal courage this office requires to provide candid and       objective legal advice to policymakers that may be seeking       politically expedient policy solutions.        We dedicated our professional lives to keeping our nation       safe. That work demanded using every resource at our       disposal, including and especially our moral authority. Our       enemies act without conscience. We must not.        Mr. Bradbury spent many years serving in the Department of       Justice--including as acting head of the Office of Legal       Counsel--during the George W. Bush Administration.        In this position, he prepared official memoranda that       provided legal cover for other agencies in the U.S.       Government to employ a program of interrogation tactics that       amounted to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading       treatment.        These brutal methods--which included waterboarding--      fundamentally violated domestic and international law       governing detainee treatment and caused untold strategic and       operational harm to our national security.        As former interrogators, intelligence, and law enforcement       professionals with extensive firsthand experience in the       field of interrogation, we were shocked by Mr. Bradbury's       attempt to defend the use of the waterboard and other torture       tactics based on the incorrect assertions that their use       would not cause severe physical pain or suffering and would       produce valuable intelligence.        In our professional judgment, torture and other forms of       detainee abuse are not only immoral and unlawful, they are       ineffective and counterproductive in gathering reliable       intelligence. They also tarnish America's global standing,       undermine critical alliances, and bolster our enemies'       propaganda efforts.        If the Senate confirms Mr. Bradbury, it would send a clear       message to the American public that authorizing the use of       torture is not only acceptable, but is not a barrier to       advancement into the upper ranks of our government.        We understand that Mr. Bradbury did not act alone in       authorizing torture, but as his nomination is before you, we       ask you to take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment       to the ideals we strive to uphold by rejecting his       nomination.        Torture is not a partisan issue. Our respect for human       dignity is timeless, and we must never risk our national       honor to prevail in any war. Your vote to reject this       nomination would reflect the morally sound leadership that       this country needs and would not forget.    In another letter dated July 27, 2017, to the Commerce Committee,  retired U.S. Air Force Col. Steven Kleinman wrote:         I write to express my deep concerns about confirming Mr.       Bradbury to serve once again in a position of significant       trust and responsibility within the U.S. Government.        I do not for a moment question his legal credentials;       rather, my apprehension centers around the equally important       elements of judgment and personal courage necessary to       provide legal advice that might run counter to the positions       advocated by his superiors.        History records that we have been down this road once       before with Mr. Bradbury and he was found sadly wanting.        As I trust you are aware, Mr. Bradbury served in senior       positions within the Department of Justice--including as       acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel--during the George       W. Bush Administration.        In that capacity, he prepared official memoranda that       provided legal cover for other agencies of the U.S.       Government to implement a program of severely coercive       interrogation practices.        These practices included an array of tactics--to include       waterboarding--that fundamentally violated domestic and       international law prohibiting cruel, inhuman, and degrading       treatment.        As an officer with extensive experience in both strategic       interrogation and in training members of the U.S. Armed       Forces to resist hostile interrogation, I was taken aback by       Mr. Bradbury's attempt to defend the use of the waterboard       based on wholly unfounded conjecture that it would not cause       severe physical pain or suffering.        If the committee were to favorably report this nomination       to the full Senate, it would be sending a clear and       undeniable message to the world, and, more importantly, to       the American public: Definitive action to support the       institutional use of torture is acceptable.        Clearly, Mr. Bradbury acted in concert with an untold       number of others within our government, and I am not asking       that he be singled out for his actions.        At the same time, his nomination is the one before you . .       . and with it an opportunity for the committee members to act       on behalf of all Americans in taking a vital step toward       reclaiming the moral high ground.        From the perspective of this American, the debate over       torture is not one that can be subject to partisan debate.       Instead, torture is something that is so inherently wrong and  [[Page S7200]]       so contrary to this nation's traditional values that it can       be one issue around which the entire country--and the U.S.       Senate--can rally.        Your vote to unfavorably report this nomination to your       colleagues would be a much-needed demonstration of ethical       leadership that would not soon be forgotten.    It is signed ``Very Respectfully, Steven M. Kleinman, Colonel, U.S.  Air Force, Retired.''   Former Navy general counsel Alberto Mora wrote:         While acting as the head of the Office of Legal Counsel,       Steven Bradbury proved himself to be an advocate for the       brutal treatment of detainees, and then, when the Congress       enacted the McCain amendment to strengthen the legal       prohibitions against cruelty, he counseled the administration       on legal strategies on how to circumvent the law and the       Congress's will.        In exercising its advice and consent duty with respect to       the nominations of senior counsel to serve in this, or any,       administration, the Senate should take care to confirm only       those individuals with a clear record of respect for the law       and for the power of Congress as a coordinate and equal       branch of government. Steven Bradbury's record,       unfortunately, demonstrates a disrespect for both.    In a June 22, 2017, letter to the Commerce Committee, 14 human rights  organizations highlighted their opposition to Mr. Bradbury's  nomination:         We write to express our serious concerns regarding the       nomination of Steven G. Bradbury for general counsel of the       Department of Transportation (DOT).        Mr. Bradbury's role in justifying torture and cruel,       inhuman, or degrading treatment of individuals held in U.S.       custody marked him as an architect of the torture program.        Not only should the Senate be concerned about confirming a       nominee who had a central role in the criminal violation of       human rights, but his work during that period calls into       question his ability to provide the kind of rigorous,       independent legal analysis that is required of any top       government lawyer.        Mr. Bradbury was acting head of the Department of Justice's       (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) from 2005 to 2009. During       that time, Mr. Bradbury wrote several legal memoranda that       authorized waterboarding and other forms of torture and       cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. As such, he is most       prominently--and correctly--known as one of the authors of       the ``torture memos.''        His analysis directly contradicted relevant domestic and       international law regarding the treatment of prisoners and       helped establish an official policy of torture and detainee       abuse that has caused incalculable damage to both the United       States and the prisoners it has held.        Mr. Bradbury's role in the torture program, even then, was       notorious--so much so that the Senate refused to confirm him       as assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel       during the Bush Administration.        The Senate now knows even more about Mr. Bradbury's record,       and the harm caused by his opinions, based on oversight by       the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and its report on       the Central Intelligence Agency's use of torture and abuse.        In Mr. Bradbury's time as acting head of the OLC, he       demonstrated an unwavering willingness to defer to the       authority and wishes of the president and his team instead of       providing objective and independent counsel.        During congressional testimony in 2007, Mr. Bradbury       responded to questions about the president's interpretation       of the law of war by declaring, ``The President is always       right''--a statement that is as outrageous as it is       inaccurate.        The DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility reviewed Mr.       Bradbury's ``torture memos'' and determined they raised       questions about the objectivity and reasonableness of Mr.       Bradbury's analyses; that Mr. Bradbury relied on uncritical       acceptance of executive branch assertions; and that in some       cases Mr. Bradbury's legal conclusions were inconsistent with       the plain meaning and commonly held understandings of the       law.        Senior government officials from the Bush Administration       who worked with Mr. Bradbury have said that they had ``grave       reservations'' about conclusions drawn in the Bradbury       torture memos and have described Mr. Bradbury's analysis as       flawed, saying the memos could be ``considered a work of an       advocacy to achieve a desired outcome.''        Moreover, Mr. Bradbury's 2007 torture memo was written with       the purpose of evading congressional intent and duly enacted       Federal law.        The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, legislation that passed       the Senate with a vote 90-9, stated, ``No individual in the       custody or under the physical control of the United States       Government, regardless of nationality or physical location,       shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.''       However, Mr. Bradbury's memo explicitly allowed the       continuation of many of the abusive interrogation techniques       that Congress intended to prohibit in the DTA.        Perhaps most concerning from a congressional oversight       perspective, Mr. Bradbury affirmatively misrepresented the       views of members of Congress to support his legal       conclusions.        Specifically, in his 2007 memo, he relied on a false claim       that when the CIA briefed ``the full memberships of the House       and Senate Intelligence Committees and Senator McCain . . .       none of the Members expressed the view that the CIA detention       and interrogation program should be stopped, or that the       techniques at issue were inappropriate.''        In fact, Senator McCain had characterized the CIA's       practice of sleep deprivation as torture both publicly and       privately, and at least four other Senators raised objections       to the program.        As a senior government lawyer, Mr. Bradbury authorized       torture and cruel treatment of detainees in violation of U.S.       and international law.        Mr. Bradbury demonstrated either an inability or an       unwillingness to display objectivity and reasonableness in       evaluating the president's policy proposals.        We ask that in reviewing Mr. Bradbury's nomination for       general counsel of the Department of Transportation, another       profoundly important position of public trust, you take these       serious and disturbing factors into consideration.    That letter was signed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Appeal  for Justice, Center for Constitutional Rights, Center for Victims of  Torture, the Constitution Project, the Council on American-Islamic  Relations, Defending Rights and Dissent, Human Rights First, Human  Rights Watch, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the  National Religious Campaign Against Torture, Open Society Policy  Center, Physicians for Human Rights, and Win Without War.   Earlier this year, a group of 176 of the most respected retired  generals and admirals wrote to then President-Elect Trump urging him to  reject the very kinds of torture and cruel treatment Mr. Bradbury  authorized. They wrote:         We have over six thousand years of combined experience in       commanding and leading American men and women in war and in       peace, and believe strongly in the values and ideals that our       country holds dear. We know from experience that U.S.       national security policies are most effective when they       uphold these ideals.        For these reasons, we are concerned about statements made       during the campaign about the use of torture or cruel,       inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees in U.S. custody.       The use of waterboarding or any so-called ``enhanced       interrogation techniques'' is unlawful under domestic and       international law.        Opposition to torture has been strong and bipartisan since       the founding of our republic, through the administration of       President Ronald Reagan to this very day. This was reinforced       last year when the Congress passed the McCain-Feinstein anti-      torture law on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis.        Torture is unnecessary. Based on our experience--and that       of our Nation's top interrogators, backed by the latest       science--we know that lawful, rapport-based interrogation       techniques are the most effective way to elicit actionable       intelligence.        Torture is also counterproductive because it undermines our       national security. It increases the risk to our troops,       hinders cooperations with allies, alienates populations whose       support the United States needs in the struggle against       terrorism, and provides a propaganda tool for extremists who       wish to do us harm.        Most importantly, torture violates our core values as a       nation. Our greatest strength is our commitment to the rule       of law and to the principles embedded in our Constitution.       Our servicemen and women need to know that our leaders do not       condone torture or detainee abuse of any kind.    I know some people might not understand why these enhanced  interrogation techniques are a problem so let me just take a few  moments to explain what they are.   Waterboarding. Waterboarding is a well-known torture tactic.  Waterboarding creates the sensation of asphyxiation or drowning. The  detainee is immobilized on his back and water is poured over a cloth  covering his face. Far from the ``dunk in the water'' Dick Cheney has  referred to, internal CIA reports describe instances of waterboarding  as ``near drownings.''   Detainees were often waterboarded repeatedly. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  was waterboarded at least 183 times. Another detainee, Abu Zubaydah,  was waterboarded so often that it led him at least once to become  completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his mouth. This  torture tactic may also lead to bleeding from the ears, severe lung and  brain damage, and lasting psychological damage.   If we waterboard our prisoners, they will waterboard our men and  women when they become prisoners.   Walling. Walling is a torture technique that involves encircling the  detainee's neck with a collar or a towel and slamming him against the  wall. Despite a requirement to use a false wall to avoid injury, Abu  Zubaydah  [[Page S7201]]  was slammed against a concrete wall. Even in the event of using a false  wall, detainees suffered extreme injury. Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi suffered  from an edema, or swelling on his head, as a consequence of walling  with the use of a false wall.   If we use this technique on our prisoners, they will use this  technique on our men and women in uniform if they were to capture them.   Sleep deprivation. The detainees were kept awake by being shackled,  forced to stand, or kept in stressed positions in an attempt to destroy  their capacity for psychological resistance. This was routinely  combined with nudity and/or round-the-clock interrogation. Although not  overtly violent, extended periods of sleep deprivation can have painful  and damaging mental and physical effects. After being forced to stand  for 54 hours, Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi required blood thinners to treat the  swelling in his legs. Following 56 hours without sleep, Arsala Khan  suffered from violent hallucinations of dogs mauling and killing his  family.   If we--the United States of America--use this technique on our  prisoners, our enemies will use this technique on our men and women in  uniform should they be captured.   Standing on broken feet. As an extreme form of sleep deprivation, two  detainees--Abu Hazim and Abd al-Karim--were forced to stand for hours  with broken feet. Despite recommendations that he avoid weight bearing  for 3 months, Abu Hazim underwent 52 hours of standing sleep  deprivation on his broken foot barely a month after his diagnosis.  While injured, these detainees were also subject to walling.   Again, when we do this to our prisoners, our enemies would do this to  our troops.   Solitary confinement. Detainees were regularly confined with no  opportunity for social interaction. This is often combined with nudity,  sensory deprivation, total darkness, or constant light, and shackling.  Abu Zubaydah was isolated naked in a cell with bright lights and white  noise or loud noise playing. At one point, he was kept for 47 days in  total isolation.   The dangers of solitary confinement were recognized by the U.S.  Supreme Court as early as 1890 in In re Medley, where the Court  described prisoners becoming violently insane, committing suicide, and  the partial loss of their mental activity.   If we do this to our prisoners, they would do it to our troops.   Stress positions. These positions are designed to cause pain and  discomfort for extended periods of time and were often used in  combination with sleep deprivation. Detainees were shackled with their  arms over their heads, forced to stay standing, or were placed in  cramped confinement, such as coffin-sized boxes.   Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was subjected to improvised stress positions  that not only caused cuts and bruises but led to the intervention of a  medical officer who was concerned that his shoulders would be  dislocated. Abu Zubaydah was confined to a coffin-shaped box for a  total of over 11 days.   If we do this to our prisoners--and Mr. Bradbury justified this--they  would do it to our troops.   Rectal feeding and rectal exams. Rectal feeding was used for  prisoners who refused food and entails insertion of a tube containing  pureed food into the detainee's anal passage. This was used for  behavioral control, without medical necessity, despite risks of damage  to the colon and rectum or of food rotting inside the digestive tract.  One detainee, Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi, suffered a rectal prolapse  likely caused by overly harsh rectal exams.   If we do this to our prisoners--and Mr. Bradbury's memo made it so we  could--they would do this to our troops should our troops be captured  by the enemy.   Nudity. This form of sexual humiliation relies on cultural and  religious taboos and required detainees to be fully or partially naked  during interrogations or when shackled. Nudity was also regularly  combined with cold temperatures and cold showers. One detainee, Gul  Rahman, died of suspected hypothermia following 48 hours of sleep  deprivation, half naked, in an extremely cold room.   Again, if we do this to our prisoners--and Mr. Bradbury wrote the  legal justification allowing this to happen--they will do this to our  troops. We do not want this man in the U.S. Government making more  decisions about what is right and what is wrong and how to protect the  American public. If he was willing to do this and allow this to happen,  what can we trust him to have good judgment on?   In a September 6, 2006, article by Sean Alfano at CBS/AP entitled  ``U.S. Army Bans Torture Of Prisoners,'' he wrote:         A new U.S. Army manual bans torture and degrading treatment       of prisoners, for the first time specifically mentioning       forced nakedness, hooding and other procedures that have       become infamous since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.       Delayed more than a year amid criticism of the Defense       Department's treatment of prisoners, the new Army Field       Manual was released Wednesday, revising [a previous] one from       1992.        It also explicitly bans beating prisoners, sexually       humiliating them, threatening them with dogs, depriving them       of food or water, performing mock executions, shocking them       with electricity, burning them, causing other pain and a       technique called ``water boarding'' that simulates drowning,       said Lt. Gen. John Kimmons, Army Deputy Chief of Staff for       Intelligence.        Officials said the revisions are based on lessons learned       since the U.S. began taking prisoners in response to the       Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.        Release of the manual came amid a flurry of announcements       about the U.S. handling of prisoners, which has drawn       criticism from Bush administration critics as well as       domestic and international allies.        The Pentagon also announced an overall policy statement on       prisoner operations. And President George W. Bush       acknowledged the existence of previously secret CIA prisons       around the world where terror suspects have been held and       interrogated, saying 14 such al Qaeda leaders had been       transferred to the military prison at Guantanamo Bay and will       be brought to trial.        An international outcry about prisoner rights began shortly       afterward. Human rights groups and some nations have urged       the Bush administration to close the prisons at the U.S.       naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, since not long after it       opened in 2002 with prisoners from the campaign against al       Qaeda in Afghanistan. Scrutiny of U.S. treatment of prisoners       shot to a new level in 2004 with a release of photos showing       U.S. troops beating, intimidating and sexually abusing       prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq--and then again with news of       secret facilities.        Though defense officials earlier this year debated writing       a classified section of the manual to keep some interrogation       procedures a secret from potential enemies, Kimmons said       Wednesday that there is no secret section to the new manual.        Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has said from the       start of the counter-terror war that prisoners were treated       humanely and in a manner ``consistent with Geneva       Conventions.''        But President George W. Bush decided shortly after the       Sept. 11 attacks that since it was not a conventional war,       ``unlawful enemy combatants'' captured in the fight against       al Qaeda would not be considered prisoners of war and thus       would not be afforded the protections of the convention.    The new manual, called ``Human Intelligence Collector Operations,''  applies to all the armed services, not just the Army. It does not cover  the Central Intelligence Agency, which also has come under  investigation for mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan and  for allegedly keeping suspects in secret prisons elsewhere around the  world since the Sept. 11 attacks.         Sixteen of the manual's 19 interrogation techniques were       covered in the old manual and three new ones were added on       the basis of lessons learned from the counter-terror war,       Kimmons said.        The additions are that interrogators may use the good-cop/      bad-cop tact with prisoners, they may portray themselves as       someone other than an American interrogator, and they may use       ``separation,'' basically keeping prisoners apart from each       other so enemy combatants can't coordinate their answers with       each other.        The last will be used only on unlawful combatants, not       POWs, only as an exception and only with permission of a       high-level commander, Kimmons said.        The Pentagon also on Wednesday released a new policy       directive on detention operations that says the handling of       prisoners must--at a minimum--abide by the standards of the       Geneva Conventions and lays out the responsibilities of       senior civilian and military officials who oversee detention       operations.        ``The revisions . . . took time,'' Deputy Assistant       Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs Cully Stimson said       at the briefing. ``It took time because it was important to       get it right, and we did get it right.''    It is interesting that the Department of Defense took the time and  the effort to rewrite their manuals as a result of the abuses that came  about following Mr. Bradbury's legal justification for the use of  torture.   Here is what the Army Field Manual 2-22.3 says. This is the Human  Intelligence Collector Operations manual,  [[Page S7202]]  dated September 6, 2006. This is what the Army now teaches our  soldiers:         All captured or detained personnel, regardless of status,       shall be treated humanely and in accordance with the Detainee       Treatment Act of 2005 and DOD Directive 2310.1E, ``Department       of Defense Detainee Program,'' and no person in the custody       or under the control of DOD, regardless of the nationality or       physical location, shall be subject to torture or cruel,       inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, in accordance       with and as defined in US law.        All intelligence interrogations, debriefings, and tactical       questionings to gain intelligence from captured or detained       personnel shall be conducted in accordance with applicable       law and policy.        Applicable law and policy include US law; the law of war;       relevant international law, relevant directives, including       DOD Directive 3115.09, ``DOD Intelligence Interrogations,       Detainee Debriefings, and Tactical Questioning''; DOD       Directive 2310-1E, ``The Department of Defense Detainee       Program''; DOD instructions; and military execute orders       including FRAGOs. Use of torture is not only illegal but also       it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results, may       damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the       source to say what he thinks the HUMINT collector wants to       hear. Use of torture can also have many possible negative       consequences at national and international levels.    All prisoners and detainees, regardless of status, will be treated  humanely.   Cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is prohibited. The Detainee  Treatment Act of 2005 defines ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment''  as the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment provided by  the Fifth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.   This definition refers to an extensive body of law developed by the  courts of the United States to determine when, under various  circumstances, treatment of individuals would be inconsistent with  American constitutional standards related to concepts of dignity,  civilization, humanity, decency, and fundamental fairness.   All DOD procedures for treatment of prisoners and detainees have been  reviewed and are consistent with these standards as well as our  obligation under international law as interpreted by the United States.   Questions about applications not resolved in the field by reference  to the DOD publications must be forwarded to higher headquarters for  legal review and specific approval by the appropriate authority.   Isn't it amazing that it took the Army to contradict and to come up  with the procedures to counter the very actions Mr. Bradbury was  willing to condone? And we want this man back in government? He doesn't  belong back in government. This is a man who has, as his first  priority, not America's values, not the morality of this Nation, not  humanity--his first value is: What is it that my boss wants me to say,  and I will find a way to do it. He said just as much in testimony. That  is not who we want as a top lawyer over in the Department of  Transportation. It is simply not acceptable.   In that same Army Field Manual, there is a section that talks about  how interrogation should be conducted and the prohibited actions  included, which are not limited to forcing the detainee to be naked, to  perform sexual acts, or pose in a sexual manner, placing hoods or sacks  over the head of a detainee, using duct tape over the eyes, applying  beatings, electric shock, burns, or other forms of physical pain,  waterboarding, using military working dogs, inducing hypothermia or  heat injury, conducting mock executions, depriving the detainee of  necessary food, water, or medical care.   The field manual goes on to say:         While using legitimate interrogation techniques, certain       applications of approaches and techniques may approach the       line between permissible actions and prohibited actions. It       may often be difficult to determine where permissible actions       end and prohibited actions begin. In attempting to determine       if a contemplated approach or technique should be considered       prohibited, and therefore should not be included in an       interrogation plan, consider these two tests before       submitting the plan for approval:        If the proposed approach technique were used by the enemy       against one of your fellow soldiers, would you believe the       soldier had been abused?        Could your conduct in carrying out the proposed technique       violate a law or regulation? Keep in mind that even if you       personally would not consider your actions to constitute       abuse, the law may be more restrictive.    I wish those questions had been made available to Mr. Bradbury when  he was writing his memo, because the actions he condoned in his memo  certainly would have failed this very simple two-question test.   The manual says:         If you answer yes to either of these tests, the       contemplated action should not be conducted. If the HUMINT       collector has any doubt that an interrogation approach       contained in an approved interrogation plan is consistent       with applicable law, or if he believes that he is being told       to use an illegal technique, the HUMINT collector should seek       immediate guidance from the chain of command and consult with       the SJA to obtain a legal review of the proposed approach or       technique. . . . If the HUMINT collector believes that an       interrogation approach or technique is unlawful during the       interrogation of a detainee, the HUMINT collector must stop       interrogation immediately and contact the chain of command       for additional guidance.    This is not something that Steven Bradbury did or has even now stated  that he wished he had done, because his memo, which allowed all the  torture techniques I have already detailed, would truly have failed  these two tests, and he would have failed in moving forward with his  memo to do the basic thing, which is to stop an illegal activity from  occurring.   At this point, the Army Field Manual provides some caution:         Although no single comprehensive source defines       impermissible coercion, certain acts are clearly prohibited.       Certain prohibited physical coercion may be obvious, such as       physically abusing the subject of the screening       interrogation. Other forms of impermissible coercion may be       more subtle, and may include:        Threats to turn the individual over to others to be abused;       subjecting the individual to impermissible humiliating or       degrading treatment; implying harm to the individual or his       property. Other prohibited actions include implying a       deprivation of applicable protections guaranteed by law       because of a failure to cooperate; threatening to separate       parents from their children; or forcing a protected person to       guide US forces in a dangerous area. Where there is doubt,       you should consult your supervisor or servicing judge       advocate.    This is the problem. Mr. Bradbury, in writing this memo, showed  absolutely no attempt or even desire to figure out whether what he was  trying to justify was truly legal, in keeping with American values, or  was the right thing to do for the United States. He simply moved  forward with drafting this memo because the President of the United  States wanted it to happen. That is not the democracy we live in. We  don't live in a dictatorship. We are the greatest democracy on the face  of the Earth because we are individuals who have the right to exercise  a moral authority and to speak up. Mr. Bradbury showed none of that.   Even in testimony, he has expressed no regrets in the legal  wranglings that he went through in order to justify torture. He showed  no introspection, no thought as to whether it was the right thing to  do. As far as he was concerned, his superiors wanted him to do this, so  he did it.   What is he going to do at the Department of Transportation? What is  he going to do when someone there tells him: The airbag manufacturers  have decided it is just too expensive, so we need you to come up with  justification for us to stop using airbags?   What he is going to do when people come to him and say: We really  want to increase alcohol sales, so I think we should get rid of drunk  driving laws? What he is going to do?   He has shown that he is willing to do whatever his superiors have  asked him to do and that he is just the right guy for the job if they  want a lawyer who is going to execute legal gymnastics to find a way to  make something happen. Do we really want that person at the very top of  the legal department of the Department of Transportation--not to  mention the fact that once he is Senate-confirmed and in the Department  of Transportation, it is that much easier to move him to another  Senate-confirmed position, and there is no guarantee that he will not  make his way back over to the Department of Justice to create more  harm.   I ask my colleagues, if you care about this country, if you care  about our troops who are in harm's way right now, please understand  what it means to our troops who are downrange right now in all corners  of the globe--facing the enemy, facing potentially being captured in  the execution of their duties, protecting and defending our  [[Page S7203]]  great United States--to know that the enemy believes that America  tortures and to know that they are at that much greater risk, if they  were to be captured, to be tortured themselves.   I can't oppose Mr. Bradbury's nomination strongly enough. His most  prominent, consequential work was to justify unlawful torture and  detainee abuse. His comments in testimony during his confirmation  hearings did not alleviate any of my concerns.   I know many of my colleagues are considering voting yes on this man  because they think: Well, he is going to be over in the Department of  Transportation. That was years ago; he will not have to write legal  justification for the use of torture again, and we have passed laws  about it since then. But he has shown that despite existing laws, he  was able to find a way to get around them to justify torture. How do we  know he will not do the same thing again at the Department of  Transportation when it comes to public safety? What about our kids who  ride school buses to school? They deserve protections.   The American public deserves protections. What they don't deserve is  a man who has no moral compass when it comes to what is right and what  is wrong but only a compass that asks: What do my bosses want me to do?  That is not what the American people need. That is certainly not  something we should be voting for.   If, in conversations with Mr. Bradbury, he promised you that he would  be independent, I just ask you to look at his record. He has never been  independent. In fact, when asked if he would recuse himself from  various cases, he, in committee, avoided answering those questions, did  not answer them straightforwardly, and showed he is simply not willing  to commit to doing what is right.   I don't know how anyone can vote for him. I don't know what he has  said in private conversations--what he says he thinks he would do at  the Department of Transportation. All I can ask is for my colleagues to  please look at the evidence, and the evidence is overwhelming. This is  a man who cannot be trusted with the values of this country. He cannot  be trusted to do what is right on behalf of the American people. He is  not someone who will speak truth to power. If anything, this is a time  in this country that we need more people who will speak truth to power,  not someone who will kowtow to power, and that is exactly the kind of  person Mr. Bradbury is. He is an unprincipled lawyer who will be paired  with an unprincipled executive, and that is a dangerous combination  regardless of what agency he serves.   Again, I ask my colleagues to please vote no on Mr. Bradbury. I  cannot oppose his nomination strongly enough. If you have any  questions, please come talk to those of us who have worn the uniform of  this great Nation, who know what it is like to be in jeopardy of being  captured by the enemy, who know what it is like to hope and pray that  the nations around the world--which view America's conduct as the  bellwether for how we treat others--know that they themselves will be  treated in the same manner that we treat our prisoners.   Those troops in harm's way right now know that because of Mr.  Bradbury, they are less safe and they are less able to do their jobs.  When our troops go into harm's way, they should focus only on getting  the job done, not on what might happen should they get captured. Thanks  to Mr. Bradbury, that is a real threat for them now.   Again, I ask my colleagues to please say no.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
