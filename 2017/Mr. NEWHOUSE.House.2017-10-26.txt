 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as  Breast Cancer Awareness Month, as well as all of the men, women, and  families that have been affected by this devastating disease.   Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women.  Research, early diagnosis, and modern treatments are raising survival  rates, but it remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality for  women.   During the month of October, we reflect on the lives lost and the  families affected by this cancer, including my own family and my own  beautiful wife, Carol, who we just lost this last spring, but we also  bring light to the actions that we can take to fight against it.   I encourage all women to talk to your doctor about breast cancer  screenings for early detection.   I admire the unmatched courage of the survivors and those currently  suffering from this disease.                            ____________________
