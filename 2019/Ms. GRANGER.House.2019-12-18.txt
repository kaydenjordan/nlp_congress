 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  politically driven Articles of Impeachment that have been brought  before the House of Representatives today.   For the past 3 years, Democrats have been unable to accept the  voters' choice to elect President Trump. They have used any and all  undemocratic and unfair means necessary to try and remove him from  office.   My vote today is not only against illegitimate impeachment of our  President, which began not with facts but with a foregone conclusion;  it is against House Democrats making a mockery of due process and the  rule of law.   This will not go anywhere in the Senate, so all that Democrats have  accomplished is postponing the important work the American people sent  their elected officials to Washington to do.   This endless crusade of Democrats to remove the duly elected  President of the United States has put partisan politics above the  issues that Americans face today. It is time Democrats stop playing  partisan games that hurt hardworking taxpayers. It is time for the  American people to be Congress' priority again.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no.''
