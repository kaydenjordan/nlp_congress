 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 2018 National  Defense Authorization Act and commend Chairman Thornberry for his  exemplary leadership in our national defense.   I join my House colleagues in sending a strong, bipartisan message to  the American people that national security must be and will be a  national priority for this Congress.   As a member of the Armed Services Committee and a conferee, I am  proud of the strong, bipartisan consensus we have forged in both  Chambers to reversing our dangerous decline in military readiness. Yet  we must temper any pride we feel with the sober reality of the state we  are in today: defense spending as a percent of GDP is at historic lows,  operational tempo is at historic highs, and threats are growing more  stark.   There have been 31 CRs in 10 years, which is a disgrace: a decade of  deferred maintenance and modernization, aircraft that don't fly, ships  that don't sail, and vehicles that can't move, shoot, or communicate on  the modern battlefield. Mishap rates are rising, fatalities are rising,  and training is at an all-time low. We have got to fix this.   Despite the lessons of history, we are simply unprepared to fight a  modern war in space, cyberspace, in the air, on land, and at sea.   I served in uniform under the past five Presidents and witnessed this  erosion of battle readiness firsthand. For me, this is personal.   This NDAA repairs the damage. The additional funding authorized in  this bill makes a credible down payment in preserving the common  defense and sends a message to both our adversaries and our military of  peace through strength.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this conference report.
