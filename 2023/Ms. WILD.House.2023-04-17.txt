 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1149, the Countering  Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad Act. I first thank my colleague  from the other side of the aisle, Representative Radewagen, for co- leading this legislation.   This bill is proof and evidence that when it comes to national and  economic security challenges, we can find common ground.   The purpose of the bill is simple: To investigate and respond to  vulnerabilities caused by Chinese telecommunications companies in  United States embassies overseas and among our close allies.   For far too long, the world has stood by as Chinese telecoms giants  have operated as vehicles for the Chinese Communist Party to commit  horrific human rights violations against the Uyghur people, to conduct  mass surveillance and espionage, and to supply  [[Page H1735]]  technology to other repressive regimes around the world.   This bill takes critical steps to ensure that our telecommunications  infrastructure requires the State Department to report on the United  States collective defense allies that use untrusted telecommunication  equipment or services in their 5G networks. Further, it mandates a  report on telecommunication vulnerabilities in United States embassies  overseas. Finally, it directs the Secretary of State to identify key  telecommunications infrastructure projects designed to promote United  States national security.   Securing these networks is imperative when it comes to national  security and human rights, as well as for our economic security.   This legislation will help us ensure that the telecoms infrastructure  of our country and our allies is secure and effective.   The Countering Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad Act enjoyed  overwhelming bipartisan support in the 117th Congress and passed the  House by a resounding margin last September.   I urge my colleagues to reaffirm our commitment to securing our  telecommunications network by again voting ``yes'' on H.R. 1149.
