 I would like to thank the Speaker, and I thank the  gentleman from Texas for yielding.   One of my favorite quotes is from Teddy Roosevelt. He says: ``Far  better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even  though checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits  who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray  twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.''   The gentleman from Texas and I had a great 31 hours--I guess, 36  hours, 31 of it being in a vehicle. It was fun, and it was like going  on a road trip with my buddy having a good time, but it was more  impactful for that.   Actually, I think I am going through separation anxiety. I want to  know what Sarah is doing right now, or Carol. They were with us late  last night in those last 3 hours of our trip when we were tired and  hungry and ready to go to sleep. But these are folks that we didn't  know--and I didn't even know what part of the country they were in-- that kept us going, and it was because of their excitement about what  we were doing that kept us going.                                time  2100    We talked many times about how this was an opportunity. In the press,  in the media, we focus on the things that divide us, not the things  that unite us; and it was a great opportunity to show that there is a  lot between Republicans and Democrats that brings us together. It was  great. We didn't always agree, and we show that we could disagree  without being disagreeable.   My heart was warmed. At the beginning of the trip, some of the  responses to our trip were mean-spirited. By the end of it, I think  people understood and recognized what we were trying to do, and they  valued that.   I hope that this trip--and the response that the American people  across these great States--showed, as an example to our colleagues,  that bipartisanship is a real thing; that people care and want to see  folks working together and to stop retreating to their tired corners  and instead try to talk about what we need to do to do the work of the  American people.   I got to learn a lot about the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke), a  person I would like to be able to call my friend, a battle buddy now,  having spent so much time in a Chevy Impala with him. I still question  why he positions himself so close to the steering wheel when he drives,  but I think that is one of the things that another trip may have to  help figure out.   Really, to all of those who watched, listened, shared, enjoyed, and  made comments, thank you. Thank you because this was a truly wonderful  experience and it made the entire trip worth it.   We made it on time. We actually got here early, which we weren't  expecting, and that is because of my good friend from the great State  of Texas' (Mr. O'Rourke) discipline and tenacity going from point A to  point B. We were able to do our job today, and we just want to say  thank you to those who helped us do that.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke) and I  have spent the last 2 years working on a number of projects together.  We have worked on the bilateral relationship between the United States  and Mexico. We have worked on border security together. We have worked  on trade. We have worked on support to veterans and those in our  military. In the last 36 hours, I learned that there is a broader set  of issues that we can work together.   He got me to a point where I recognize that something like a hiring  freeze may not be the most efficient way. I think one of the folks that  were watching the live feeds over the last 36 hours said: Let's use a  scalpel rather than a sledgehammer. I think that is pretty good advice.   He recognized that having the ability to get someone out of the  government who is not performing to the level that we need them to  perform needs to be done in an efficient and quick manner. This is one  example of how, in our positions, we realized we agreed on more than we  probably thought from the outset.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke) prides himself and has been  really a champion of veterans in the great State of Texas as well as  the rest of the country. The only time I saw him get a more passionate  look or a bigger smile on his face was when he was talking about  doughnuts or his wife, actually. Seeing him talk to his lovely wife and  his children and see his face light up was really amazing and  heartwarming.   So I hope that our colleagues learn that what we found out in the  last 36 hours is that working together is not a dirty phrase.  Bipartisanship is not a dirty word; that people are going to actually  reward you for thinking and reaching beyond your perceived limits. That  is one of my takeaways from the last 36 hours.   So if you all live in the State of New York, instead of taking a  plane back, rent a car--Dollar Rent A Car has some pretty good Chevy  Impalas--and drive back to New York City together and talk about these  conversations. If you take a train, sit next to each other and have  that conversation. Include the folks that are sitting in the chairs  around you, if you feel so inclined. These are the first steps we can  do in order to take on these big issues and these big challenges.   When the 435 people in the House of Representatives raised their hand  and got sworn in and the 100 Members of the Senate raised their hands  and got sworn in, they took on this task of coming to this august body  in order to do big things to help this country. I don't doubt that the  535 people who make up this Congress believe that this is truly the  greatest Nation in the world, and they want to do everything they can  to advance its cause.   So we have to, if we are going to solve these big problems, we have  to do it together, plain and simple. The American people want us to do  it together. And I think we got a taste of that over the last 36 hours,  and it is something that will stick with me, and it is something that I  am looking forward to working with the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  O'Rourke) from the great city of El Paso in the next days and weeks.   One of the things that I learned from the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  O'Rourke) was he is very good at thanking people. He is very good at  thanking his team. He is very good at thanking people that have helped  us, and I want to thank our teams.   The folks that make up the gentleman's staff and my team, they stayed  up longer than we did. They had to deal probably with more pressures  than we did. Rachel Holland in my office, Nancy Pack, Stoney Burke,  Matthew Haskins, these are some members of my team. Callie Strock, I  know, in her new position, worked really hard to get things done. Chris  Malen is one of the new members of my team. Austin Agrella did so much.  They were excited to be a part of this. Eliezer Flores is someone who  was so excited, and I think the first person who we saw when we got  back. These were the people who enabled us to take away these lessons  over the last 36 hours.   To those who watched, shared, asked a question, who responded or  answered a question for us because the feed was going too fast, thank  you. Thank you for an amazing experience. I am looking forward to the  next trip. Hopefully there is one before the Congress Cannonball Run of  2018.   I think that it is incumbent upon the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  O'Rourke) and I to be a team again and see if there are others who can  beat us in a race from San Antonio, Texas, to Washington, D.C.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to hold this Special  Order session. This is my first time participating in a Special Order  session, but I think it was justified for such a special occasion that  means so much to me.   I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke) for his  firm grasp on the steering wheel, his willingness to go and do things  that hadn't been done before, and for his friendship.    Mr. Speaker, I want to just thank a couple more people. I  would like to thank my girlfriend, Lynlie Wallace, for being supportive  of many of my shenanigans. She supports me in these efforts, and I am  grateful for that.   I would like to thank Tyler Lowe, Jon Arnold, and my district staff.  If it wasn't for them, we never would have kicked off at 0700 from Mi  Tierra Restaurant. They got us on the right path. So it truly has been  a good time.   I think the gentleman from Texas and I are ready for some shuteye. I  do not know how many times a Special Order has been done between a  Republican and a Democrat. We will have to ask the Parliamentarian  after this, but hopefully this is the first of many.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 21 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, March 16, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
