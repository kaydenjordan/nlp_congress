 Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of Senator Wyden and myself,  I send a question to the desk for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senators Brown and Wyden ask the following question to the House  managers:         During yesterday's proceedings, the President's counsel       failed to give an adequate response to a question related to       whether acceptance of information provided by a foreign       country to a political campaign or candidate would constitute       a violation of the law and whether offers of such information       should be reported to the FBI. FBI Director Christopher Wray,       who was appointed by President Trump, has said ``if any       public official or member of any campaign is contacted by any       nation-state about influencing or interfering with our       election, then that [is] something that the FBI would want to       know about,'' and ``we'd like to make sure people tell us       information promptly so that we can take appropriate steps to       protect the American people.'' If President Trump remains in       office, what signal does that send to other countries intent       on interfering in our elections in the future, and what might       we expect from those countries and the President?    Mr. Counsel JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, thank you for that question.   I will take the last part first. It would send a terrible message to  autocrats and dictators and enemies of democracy and the free world for  the President and his team to essentially put out there for all to  consume that it is acceptable in the United States to solicit foreign  interference in our free and fair elections or accept political dirt  simply to try to cheat in the next election.   I was certainly shocked by the comments from the President's Deputy  White House Counsel yesterday, right here on the floor, when he said:  ``I think that the idea that any information that happens to come from  overseas is necessarily campaign interference is a mistake.''   No. It is wrong. It is wrong in the United States of America.   He also added ``Information that is credible, that potentially shows  wrongdoing by someone that happens to be running for office, if it's  credible information, is relevant information for the voters to know .  . . to be able to decide on who is the best candidate. . . . ''   This is not a banana republic. It is the democratic Republic of the  United States of America. It is wrong.   The single most important lesson that we learned from 2016 was that  nobody should seek or welcome foreign interference in our elections.  But now we have this President and his counsel essentially saying it is  OK.   It is not OK. It strikes at the very heart of what the Framers of the  Constitution were concerned about--abuse of power, betrayal by the  President of his oath of office, corrupting the integrity of our  democracy and our free and fair elections by entangling oneself with  foreign powers. That is at the heart of what the Framers of the  Constitution were concerned about.   Don't just trust me. We have several folks who have made this  observation. The FBI Director--the Trump FBI Director--said that the  FBI would want to know about any attempt at foreign election  interference.   The Chair of the Federal Elections Commission also issued a statement  reiterating the view of U.S. law enforcement. She said in part:         Let me make something 100 percent clear to the American       public and anyone running for [public] office: It is illegal       for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of       value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S.       election.    This is not a novel concept. Election intervention from foreign  governments  [[Page S699]]  has been considered unacceptable since the beginning of our Nation. It  is wrong, it is corrupt, it is lawless, it is an abuse of power, it is  impeachable, and it should lead to the removal of President Donald John  Trump.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Missouri.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of Senators Casey, Klobuchar, Warren, and Wyden for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question for the House managers from Senator Brown and the other  Senators is as follows:         Yesterday, you referenced how President Trump's       perpetuating and propagating Russian conspiracy theories       undercut our national security objectives. If acquitted in       the Senate, what would prevent the President from continuing       to side with Putin and other adversaries, instead of our       intelligence community and career diplomats, and what are the       implications on our national security agenda if such behavior       continues, unchecked?    Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   You know, I have talked a lot tonight and throughout the last week  about what is at stake here, because, you know, it is getting late into  the night, and we have been having this debate for several days now.  There is a lot of discussion in the legal aspects of this. So I don't  want to get into, again, you know, the issues of our troops in Europe,  the hot war that continues to happen right now as we are speaking in  Ukraine, but I will reiterate the precedent that we set with regard to  Russia and foreign adversaries--you know, this idea that it is OK to  continue to pedal in Russian propaganda and debunked conspiracy  theories--because counsel for the President would have you believe  that, you know, this is a policy discussion, that, you know, we have  not resolved this, that there is a lot of debate about this issue. And  if that is indeed the case, if we concede that, then, there are some  witnesses that we can call on, including Ambassador Bolton, that could  shed additional light on it.   But the fact pattern that we are sitting at right now--what we are  talking about right now--is 17 witnesses that were called in the House,  none of whom had any indicia or had any data to provide that any of  these theories were accurate.   We have the entire intelligence and law enforcement community of the  United States unanimously saying that there is no indication that  Ukraine was involved in the 2016 election, that it was Russia.   And don't buy the red herring, by the way, that counsel for the  President has brought forth--this idea that, oh, it can only be Russia.  You know, they said earlier that we are claiming that it can only be  Russia. That is not what we are saying. Nobody on this team has ever  said it can only be Russia, because, indeed, we know, as many of these  people in the Chamber know well, that there are a lot of mal actors out  there, that there are a lot of countries out there that have the  capability and the will and that regularly try to attack us in a  variety of ways.   What we are saying is, with respect to this issue that is before the  body right now, that, unanimously, the law enforcement agencies of the  United States and the intelligence communities of the United States  have said that it was Russia that interfered in the 2016 elections and  that there is no data to suggest Ukraine was involved. That is the  issue.    So the precedent--bringing it all around to the beginning of the  question, the precedent is that all of our adversaries, including  Vladimir Putin, will understand that they can play to the whims of one  person, whether that be President Trump or some future President,  Democrat or Republican. They can play to the whims and the interests  and the personal political ambitions of one person and get that  individual to propagate their propaganda, get them to undermine our own  intelligence and law enforcement communities. That is a precedent that  I don't think anybody here is willing and interested in sending, and  that is truly what is at stake.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from North Dakota.
