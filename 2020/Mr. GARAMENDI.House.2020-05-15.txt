 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.   Much talk, some facts. In California, $54 billion deficit by the  State government. The counties I represent are reeling in their  deficit. We need this bill; otherwise, we are going to see hospitals,  we are going to see first responders, police, and firemen laid off.   Many say this bill is dead on arrival. If we do not move this bill,  the death will be in our districts.
