 Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi and the House Democrats  rushed through the weakest impeachment in American history. Devoid of  any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump, Speaker Pelosi and her  Caucus allowed their hatred of President Trump to triumph at all costs.   Now House Democrats are demanding the Senate hold a trial dictated by  their terms, including witness testimony they failed to obtain  themselves.   Since House Democrats want more witnesses, I will gladly offer some  names for the Senate to consider.   How about Joe and Hunter Biden? Together, they peddled the influence  of the Vice President's office for Hunter Biden's personal financial  gain. It is plainly on video.   How about Adam Schiff? He spent 2 years severely misleading the  American people about Russian collusion, held secret hearings at the  Capitol basement, and was caught redhanded coordinating with the  alleged whistleblower.   Ah, yes, why don't we hear from the alleged whistleblower? Reports  indicate he worked for Joe Biden, coordinated with Adam Schiff, and has  deep anti-Trump views. President Trump deserves to face his secret  Democratic accuser.   How did we end up in this impeachment mess? The simple truth is the  abuse of the FISA court to spy on the Trump campaign.   Yes, you heard it: the weaponization of the Federal Government  against the people. This is the insidious inbreeding of the swamp,  corruption, plain and simple. The President and others are victims of a  crime.   It is said that those who don't learn from history are doomed to  repeat it, and look what is happening with the FISA court now. Just  this week, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court appointed David  Kris, an Obama-era DOJ lawyer, to review the abuse of the FISA court, a  person who is already engaged in FISA denialism.   Yes, let me be clear, perfectly clear: A FISA abuse denier is now in  charge of tackling the FISA abuse. I guess, America, only in the  Washington, D.C., swamp.
