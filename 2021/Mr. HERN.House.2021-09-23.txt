 Mr. Speaker, in what is, no doubt, a knee-jerk reaction to  the recent legislative victory to protect unborn life in the State of  Texas, Democrats have introduced the Women's Health Protection Act.  However, we know what this piece of legislation really should be  called, the abortion on demand act.   H.R. 3755 completely strips State legislatures of their autonomy to  write the laws of their own State and will, in effect, make all 50  States late-term abortion States.   Not only is this a gross overreach of the Federal authority, a direct  violation of States' rights to decide their own laws, it is just plain  wrong.   Provisions in H.R. 3755 include the elimination of laws requiring  parental involvement in a minor's decision to abort a baby, laws  preventing abortions based on a baby's sex or diagnosis with a mental  disability, as well as laws preventing dismemberment abortions.   It is clear that this bill has nothing to do with protecting women's  health; rather, it is the result of Democrats bending the knee to the  unethical abortion industry.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the abortion on demand act.                            ____________________
