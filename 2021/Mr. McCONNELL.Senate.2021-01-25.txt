 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, our Nation has spent nearly a year  locked in this terrible battle with COVID-19. This virus that spread  from China around the world has taken more than 400,000 American lives.  It has effectively cost many children an entire school year. It made us  slam the brakes on one of the best job markets in modern history and  threw millions of families into financial chaos.   But thanks to a lot of hard work in 2020, the dawn of 2021 has  brought a turning point. The genius of science and the support of  Operation Warp Speed produced vaccines in record time. And in December,  after months of delay, Democrats finally let Congress move ahead with  another major rescue package. The light at the end of the tunnel is  getting closer, and both Republicans and Democrats are going to  continue working together to accelerate victory.   Curiously, the President's candidate to run the Department of Health  and Human Services is the famously partisan attorney general of  California. His recent experience in health policies seems largely  limited to promoting abortion-on-demand and suing groups like the  Little Sisters of the Poor, which dare to live out their religious  convictions.   In an interview just yesterday, Mr. Becerra compared the current  state of vaccinations inherited by the Biden administration to an  airplane in a nosedive--a disaster. He contrasted the status quo with  the new administration's stated goal of 1 million vaccinations per day,  which he called ``ambitious.''   There is a problem here. Even the press has repeatedly pointed it  out, which said our Nation is already meeting that very pace--already  meeting that very pace. That is not a big new goal. It is exactly what  they inherited from the Trump administration in Operation Warp Speed.   Inauguration Day, Thursday, and Friday, each topped 1 million  vaccinations. As of today, we are averaging 1.16 million shots per day  over the last  [[Page S115]]  week. They are claiming the exact same number can either be a total  catastrophe or a smashing success. I guess it depends on whether  Democrats are in power. So much for science without politics.   Here is how the Washington Post put it:         The accelerating speed of the [vaccine] program undercuts       assertions by some Biden advisers that they were left no plan       by the Trump administration, and suggests they need only to       keep their feet on the pedal to clear the bar they set for       themselves.    Yesterday, Mr. Becerra was asked about increasing vaccinations in the  months ahead. Here is what he said: ``I first have to be sworn in to  give you a timeline.'' Perhaps that is like the time the Speaker of the  House famously said she had to pass a bill before the public could  learn what was in it.   The new administration campaigned heavily on having a new master plan  to fight the pandemic. Well, now they are in office, President Biden  has said: ``[T]here's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the  pandemic in the next several months,'' and his administration is  apparently content to maintain the same vaccine pace they actually  inherited.   Let's talk about Congress's role in the pandemic relief. Our  Democratic colleagues spent last summer and fall using the legislative  filibuster to delay the next rescue package until after the election.  Now, that would be the same tool that some Senate Democrats now  suddenly say they oppose, as if they hadn't leaned on it liberally over  the last 6 years.   But, finally, last month, they let us act. We passed another package  totaling nearly $900 billion in urgent relief. We provided more than  $80 billion to help K-12 schools, $280 billion for the Paycheck  Protection Program, billions more for Federal unemployment insurance  supplements, nutrition and rental assistance, and direct cash aid and  massive new investments in purchasing and distributing vaccines. Some  of that money has already gone out the door. Other portions are still  unspent--a massive, historic, almost trillion-dollar package that was  passed into law just 5 weeks ago.   Since last March, Washington, DC, has spent a historic amount of  money standing up one of the most enormous policy responses by any  government to any emergency that the world has ever seen. Nobody thinks  the support has been perfect--far from it--but it has been historic and  strong.   For example, a nonpartisan study in November showed that because of  the historic emergency legislation passed through Congress, American  personal income was actually--listen to this--higher in September than  it had been before the pandemic.   Last month, Larry Summers, President Clinton's Treasury Secretary and  President Obama's NEC Director, confirmed that relative to our  underlying economy, our multiple rescue packages have brought American  household income all the way back to a level that equals or even  exceeds what he would expect if we weren't in a crisis.   So, to be clear, nobody thinks our bipartisan work fighting this  pandemic is completely finished. Nobody is arguing that. And we all  understand that overall national statistics do not explain away the  terrible struggles facing many families. But experts and economists  from the left to the right agree: Any further action should be smart  and targeted, not just an imprecise deluge of borrowed money that would  direct huge sums toward those who don't need it.   That is why the new administration's first draft of their sprawling  proposal misses the mark, and press reports make clear this is not just  a Republican view. Multiple Democratic Senators agree that it is not  the right path forward.   So as the $900 billion package from 5 weeks ago continues to come  online and as the remaining needs continue to come into focus,  Republicans will be ready and eager to continue bipartisan discussions  about smart steps forward for the American people. Bipartisan action  helped our Nation endure the last year. Bipartisan action helped us  turn the corner, and it will be smart, bipartisan actions that help us  finish the fight                            ____________________     Madam President, now on a related matter, this  afternoon, the Senate will confirm Dr. Janet Yellen, the former Chair  of the Federal Reserve, to serve as President Biden's Secretary of the  Treasury. Her speedy confirmation will contrast sharply with the way  the Senate Democratic minority handled many of the last President's key  Cabinet nominations 4 years ago.   Secretary Mnuchin had to sit through a stunt where Senate Democrats  literally boycotted his committee hearing. He was not confirmed until  mid-February.   Dr. Yellen came out of committee on a unanimous vote and will begin  to work 5 days after the inauguration. That is even faster than  Secretary Geithner's nomination in 2009 in the teeth of a financial  crisis.   This certainly isn't because Dr. Yellen's or President Biden's  economic policy views have unanimous support here in the Senate. I  expect we will have no shortage of spirited policy discussions with Dr.  Yellen in the months ahead, especially if some Democrats keep trying to  use this historic emergency as a pretext--a pretext to push through  permanent far-left policy changes.   The 50 Senators on our side have great confidence in our pro-job,  pro-worker vision that helped build the greatest job market in living  memory. But the simple fact is that, when the American people elect a  President and when the President selects qualified and mainstream  people for key posts, the whole Nation deserves for them to be able to  assemble their team.   I will be voting to confirm Dr. Yellen today. I look forward to  working together on pro-growth policies that will help rebuild the  thriving economy for American workers that was in place just 1 year  ago.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
