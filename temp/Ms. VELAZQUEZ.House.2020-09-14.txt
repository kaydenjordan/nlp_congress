 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6133) to reauthorize the State Trade Expansion Program of  the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6133         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6133, the STEP  Improvement Act of 2020.   Before I begin, I thank Ranking Member Chabot for his dedication to  small businesses and for his continued effort to ensure the Committee  on Small Business works in a bipartisan manner. Staying true to the  tradition of our committee, the bills we are debating today are all  bipartisan and passed through committee by unanimous consent, thanks to  the cooperation of Members on both sides of the aisle. I commend and  thank all of the committee members for their work on those bills and  their passion to put forth policies that make a difference in the lives  of entrepreneurs.   Mr. Speaker, today's bill is one of those passion projects. After  many hearings about the challenges and benefits of exporting and trade  for America's business owners, this bill addresses many of the concerns  raised. It reauthorizes the SBA State Trade Expansion Program-- otherwise known as STEP--a proven and effective program that gives  small businesses the tools they need to enter and thrive in the global  marketplace.   STEP has helped small firms export and access new markets, supporting  $974 million in export sales in fiscal year 2019 alone. With the COVID- 19 pandemic continuing to decimate local economies and disrupting  supply chains, the STEP program will be needed now more than ever. It  will help small businesses navigate the complexities of an  international marketplace, particularly as the country and world reopen  for business. The STEP Improvement Act of 2020 funds STEP through  fiscal year 2024 while making important improvements to modernize the  program.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that this legislation has the  support of the State International Development Organizations. I thank  its cosponsors, Representative Finkenauer, who is also the chair of the  Subcommittee on Rural Development, Agriculture, Trade, and  Entrepreneurship; and Representative Spano, the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations, for their  continued bipartisan work to improve STEP.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to support  H.R. 6133 today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms. Finkenauer), the sponsor of the bill  and chair of the Subcommittee on Rural Development, Agriculture, Trade,  and Entrepreneurship.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses are truly the bedrock of the American  economy. Unsurprisingly, foreign markets are essential to their growth.  While more and more of our local businesses are making inroads abroad,  they are not without challenges.   International trade has always been a complex undertaking, dependent  on global macroeconomic trends as well as country-specific trade  policies and resources.   Regardless, it is critical entrepreneurs can compete in this  marketplace. Doing so gives them access to more customers, which in  turn fuels growth and generates jobs here at home.   H.R. 6133, the STEP Improvement Act of 2020, will go a long way to  ensuring the recovery and success of our Nation's small businesses. By  reauthorizing and modernizing STEP, this legislation guarantees that  States and their entrepreneurs will face fewer obstacles to  participation and greater opportunities to expand their businesses  through exporting.   This bill is needed now more than ever as the world seeks to recover  from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic fallout.   Once again, I applaud my esteemed colleagues, Representative  Finkenauer and Representative Spano, for their hard work on this  legislation.   I commend the ranking member and his staff for their commitment to  advancing this legislation in a bipartisan manner through our  committee.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6079) to amend the Small Business Act to optimize the  operations of the microloan program, lower costs for small business  concerns and intermediary participants in the program, and for other  purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and included extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  6079, the Microloan Improvement Act of 2020, a bill that makes  important improvements to the SBA's microloan program.  [[Page H4345]]    Many entrepreneurs lack the experience as business owners, which is  needed to demonstrate their creditworthiness to conventional lenders.  We have heard time and again the heart-wrenching stories from  entrepreneurs about the challenges they face, not just securing  capital, but also operating their businesses.   While the SBA has numerous programs designed to meet each of these  challenges, the microloan program is unique in that it provides  entrepreneurs with both the affordable capital needed to start up and  the technical assistance needed to boost their ability to succeed and  repay.   This program is a key resource for startup, newly established, and  growing small businesses. It has provided millions of dollars in  financing and technical assistance to small businesses and  entrepreneurs since its inception.   By providing loans to nonprofit intermediaries, which in turn lend  funds to the smallest of small businesses, the program helps borrowers  streamline their operations, grow to profitability, and create new  jobs.   The microloan program was a critical piece of the puzzle to grow the  Nation's entrepreneurs before the pandemic. It is now more important  than ever to strengthen and modernize the program as we face a  sustained economic recession in the middle of a global pandemic.   Earlier this Congress, the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and  Capital Access, under the leadership of Mr.   Andy Kim, held a hearing  on the microloan program where we heard from a panel of intermediaries  who reported that some of the program's rules, largely unchanged since  1991, are outdated and restricting them from meeting today's demand for  startup financing and providing more technical assistance.   In response, Mr. Kim worked hard with Mr. Burchett to craft the  Microloan Improvement Act of 2020, a series of reasonable proposals  designed to update the program's rules and ultimately help microloan  intermediaries extend more affordable capital to first-time  entrepreneurs.   Just a few of the central changes in the bill include eliminating an  outdated and onerous rule that has restricted the ability of high- volume intermediaries to meet demand in their respective States,  lowering interest rates for eligible intermediaries, and extending  repayment terms in a tiered manner to provide greater flexibility to  businesses.   These changes are long overdue, and I am pleased that we are taking a  vote on them today.   Finally, I want to thank Mr. Kim and Mr. Burchett for their hard work  and applaud their efforts to make bipartisan improvements to this  valuable program.   I recommend a ``yes'' to all my colleagues in the House, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in its nearly 30 years, the SBA microloan  program has enjoyed a track record of success in delivering affordable  startup capital, particularly for women and minority-owned  entrepreneurs. The SBA microloan program has helped to launch many  successful businesses.   As the chair of the Small Business Committee, I have had the  privilege to hear about countless success stories, and I have fought  tirelessly over the years to ensure all American entrepreneurs have  access to the SBA resources they need to launch and grow their  businesses.   In my time on this committee, I have been proud to watch the  microloan program grow from a small pilot program to a robust lending  program with strong stakeholder and congressional support. In many  ways, the growth and success of the program mirror that of the many  small businesses that got their start with an SBA microloan.   Despite this success, and like any other Federal program, it must be  periodically reviewed and modernized. This bill does just that and  ensures the microloan program will remain flexible for intermediaries  and borrowers, helping to ease access to the program for even more  aspiring entrepreneurs.   I want to applaud the work by the gentleman from New Jersey and the  gentleman from Tennessee for their bipartisan work on the microloan  program.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6021) to amend the Small Business Act to ensure that the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is eligible for certain  Small Business Administration programs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6021         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Mariana Islands       Small Business Development Act''.       SEC. 2. ELIGIBILITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE NORTHERN                     MARIANA ISLANDS FOR CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESS                     ADMINISTRATION PROGRAMS.         The Small Business Act is amended--        (1) in section 21(a) (15 U.S.C. 648(a))--  [[Page H4346]]         (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting before ``The       Administration shall require'' the following new sentence:       ``The previous sentence shall not apply to an applicant that       has its principal office located in the Commonwealth of the       Northern Mariana Islands.''; and        (B) in paragraph (4)(C)(ix), by striking ``and American       Samoa'' and inserting ``American Samoa, and the Commonwealth       of the Northern Mariana Islands''; and        (2) in section 34(a)(9) (15 U.S.C. 657d(a)(9)), by striking       ``and American Samoa'' and inserting ``American Samoa, and       the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6021, the Northern  Mariana Islands Small Business Development Act.   There are 1,700 small businesses with 18,000 employees in the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, yet these businesses are  the only ones in the United States that are ineligible for the SBA's  Small Business Development Center, or SBDC, and Federal and State  Technology, or FAST, partnership programs.   The SBDC program provides free or low-cost counseling and training  services to thousands of entrepreneurs and small business owners each  year, and the FAST partnership program provides funding to increase the  number of Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business  Technical Transfer applications and better prepare applicants for  success.   The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which rely heavily  on tourism, has not been immune from the economic devastation resulting  from COVID-19. Moreover, it has been trying to rebuild from two  catastrophic typhoons that wreaked havoc on the country in October  2018.   By extending SBA's SBDC and FAST programs to the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands, Congress will extend valuable opportunities  for small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs to receive support  from qualified counselors on how to launch and grow their small  businesses as well as recover from the economic catastrophes.   In March, H.R. 6021 was unanimously approved by the House Small  Business Committee, and I commend the sponsors of the legislation, Mr.  Sablan and Mrs. Radewagen, for raising this inequity to the committee.   The dedication they have shown to creating greater parity to the  entrepreneurs in all territories shows exactly how small business  issues are neither Democratic nor Republican issues; they are American  issues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the  small business owners and entrepreneurs of the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands by voting in favor of H.R. 6021.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just urge support of this bill. It corrects an  inequity, and I am so proud that, under my leadership and the ranking  member, we are providing access to all the programs under the Small  Business Administration for the small businesses in the Northern  Mariana Islands.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6078) to amend the Small Business Act to increase  transparency and to enhance the use of microloans in rural areas, and  for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  6078, the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act, which makes it  easier for rural-serving microloan intermediaries to provide technical  and management assistance to entrepreneurs.   One of the key components of the microloan program, and what I  believe makes it so successful, is that intermediaries offer  technology, management, and marketing assistance to business owners in  conjunction with affordable financing. However, when our Committee held  hearings on the program, we heard about the challenges that  intermediaries in rural areas face in providing technical assistance.   These nonprofit, mission-based lenders must sometimes drive 2 or 3  hours, or even more, to a borrower's place of business to conduct  training. These expenses all come out of the intermediary's bottom  line.   The measure Mr. Burchett and Mr. Kim have put forward to make  intermediaries with at least 25 percent of their loans in a rural area  eligible for a bonus technical assistance grant is a necessary one that  I support and would encourage all of my colleagues to support.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud our bipartisanship and, more importantly, our  commitment to America's small businesses. I urge all of my colleagues  to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Oftentimes, the biggest barrier to entrepreneurship is accessing  affordable capital. But for many entrepreneurs, access to expert advice  can give them an added boost and the skills needed to grow a  sustainable business.   To that end, the microloan program leverages the network of nonprofit  intermediary lenders, many of them CDFIs, who have deep roots in the  local community, are committed to economic development, and offer  technical business and marketing assistance for these small businesses.   This bill will go a long way in helping these microlenders reach more  small businesses in rural areas, which, in turn, will stimulate the  local economies. It also mandates reporting on the program's  effectiveness so our committee can continue to oversee the program and  make necessary modifications to further improve the program.   Again, thank you to Representative Burchett and Representative Kim  for collaborating on the bill before us today. I also thank the ranking  member, Mr. Chabot, and his staff for working with us in a bipartisan  manner, not just on this piece of legislation, but on all the bills we  have brought to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.
