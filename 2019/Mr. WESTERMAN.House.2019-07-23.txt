 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate our Nation's  parks.   This July marks the 34th annual Park and Recreation Month, a  celebration highlighting the incredible opportunities and benefits that  park and recreation agencies provide to their communities.   I, like many Arkansans, grew up enjoying everything that the Natural  State has to offer. From hiking and hunting in its forests, to  swimming, fishing, and boating on its crystal-clear lakes and rivers,  outdoor recreation is an essential part of life for the families of my  State. Some of my favorite memories of life were made outside in the  beautiful outdoors of Arkansas, and I am blessed to still be making  similar memories today.   Our park and recreation agencies are an important part of our history  and offer much to the quality of our future. Theodore Roosevelt once  said: ``It is an incalculable added pleasure to anyone's sum of  happiness if he or she grows to know, even slightly and imperfectly,  how to read and enjoy the wonder-book of nature.''   As a forester and lifelong lover of nature, the wonder-book of nature  has always been fascinating to me, and I hope to motivate people to get  out and enjoy the natural beauty around them.   In the words of the fictional sitcom character Leslie Knope,  ``America is awesome.'' I encourage everyone to go outside with friends  and family to enjoy all the awesomeness our parks have to offer.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend from  South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I want us to take a moment to reflect tonight, reflect  where our country has been and where our country is going. I think  about my grandparents who grew up in a home that didn't even have  electricity, didn't have running water. Even my parents were young when  they got electricity in their home.   Madam Speaker, it was just 150 years ago when the main source of  energy in this country was wood fuel. We have come a long way in this  country. We have seen a better way of life. We have seen nicer things  because of the technology and innovation that we have had in this  country.   Our energy policy should be the same energy policy that got us to  where we are today because we have a bright future ahead. That energy  policy is simply to provide the cleanest energy possible for the lowest  cost possible.   We shouldn't discriminate against energy sources. Energy is energy.  It is carbon atoms. It is hydrogen. It is the energy that we have that  we convert to things like electrical energy. Just because one energy is  viewed as dirtier than another energy doesn't mean that, someday, that  energy can't be clean energy.   If we look at recent developments, it wasn't long ago that natural  gas was an expensive form of energy. It wasn't in abundant supply.  Through technology, we have been able to release vast amounts of  natural gas across our country.   As a matter of fact, we are seeing a lot of coal plants converted to  natural gas, not because of regulatory requirements but because of the  economic benefits of burning natural gas, clean natural gas. We know  the control technologies to get very high combustion rates and also the  ability to capture the NOX, or nitrous oxides, that are  released from burning natural gas.   It wasn't that long ago that we didn't think we had enough natural  gas. Because of great technology, we can experience an environment here  in the United States where our carbon emissions are actually dropping.   We shouldn't punish one energy source over another energy source. We  should strive to use technology to make energy as low-cost and as clean  as possible.   We can do this, whether it is renewables, solar, wind, biomass. All  of those are valid sources of energy that we can, hopefully, learn how  to capture, to distribute in a manner that people can enjoy all across  the country in a way that gives consumers reliable supplies at a low  cost.   With this, we will see our economy continue to grow. We will see our  quality of life improve. It is really not something that should be  partisan or that we should argue about, simply to provide energy at a  low cost.  [[Page H7230]]    Let's look at transportation fuel. Some are in favor of doing away  with all fossil fuels in transportation. What would that do to our  environment?   If we look at global emissions across the world, the United States is  responsible for 15 percent of carbon emissions throughout the world. If  we look at that a little bit closer and break it down on transportation  fuels, transportation fuels account for 27 percent of carbon emissions  in the United States. Twenty-seven percent of 15 percent is only about  4 percent.   If we did away with all gasoline, all diesel fuels, got rid of all  combustion engines, if we did away with jet fuel, with ships, if we  took fossil fuels out of every form of transportation in the United  States, it would wreak havoc on our economy. It would wreak havoc on  our way of life. But it would reduce global carbon emissions only by  around 4 percent.    There is a better, smarter way to do that. Let's take the abundant  energy that we have. Let's apply our wonderful research facilities, the  great minds and innovators that we have in America. We can figure out  how to use all of our energy sources in a low-cost, clean way. We can  all continue to experience a brighter future ahead.   I thank my colleague for hosting this time tonight where we can,  hopefully, get some of the facts and common sense about energy out on  the table.   Just remember, as low-cost and as clean as possible, that is a  winning formula for American energy.
