 Mr. Chairman, I am very proud to stand with Chairman  Hensarling today and offer my support for H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE  Act of 2017.   This bill offers a responsible approach to financial regulation that  will protect consumers and allow the American economy to flourish. The  Financial CHOICE Act makes meaningful reforms that ensure transparency,  restore a rule of law, and help consumers and small businesses gain  access to the credit they need to move forward towards financial  independence, be the entrepreneurs they are, and be able to realize  their dreams.   Mr. Chairman, we lose one community bank or credit union a day, as  the chairman just mentioned, every day. These are the institutions that  lend to families and small businesses across America. These  institutions are the backbone of each of our communities and something  that must be done to reverse this dangerous trend of consolidation and  closure.   There has been a considerable amount of discussion on both sides of  the aisle on the need to help community financial institutions. The  legislation we will consider today provides every Member of Congress  the opportunity to cast a vote in favor of responsible regulatory  relief for credit unions and community banks across the Nation.   The Financial CHOICE Act will increase access to credit for consumers  by easing rules and regulations that never should have been applied to  smaller financial institutions in the first place.    H.R. 10 also makes important reforms to the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, an unaccountable agency that embodies the  Washington-knows-best mentality that the Nation is so tired of seeing  and, instead, creates a more responsible framework that actually  protects consumers instead of special interests.   The Financial CHOICE Act offers a new model for financial opportunity  and responsible regulation. It is time to take steps to remove the boot  from the neck of our Nation's lenders and their customers.   Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said about the bill that it  would have a tremendous stimulative effect on our economy. The  Financial CHOICE Act is the right choice to help our communities grow  their economies and our citizens realize their dreams.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his unwavering  leadership and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 10.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  for yielding to me and I associate myself with his remarks.   The Durbin amendment has not helped consumers and, in fact, has hurt  them. It has hurt small banks and credit unions. The only entities that  have benefited are the retailers, who, despite their promises to  Congress, have not lowered cost, and some studies even show that they  have increased cost.   Congress should not be in the business of price fixing. Price  controls will never work and will always have negative consequences. I  am committed to returning to free market principles that deliver real  results for consumers.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, it is not my intent today to oppose the amendment;  however, I do want to express my reservations over the amendment from  the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I think it is important that we set  the record straight on a few points.   The credit reporting agencies are not required to adhere to any sort  of thorough data security standard. Unlike many other industries, the  financial services industry has had Federal security requirements in  place for nearly 20 years.                                time  1515    The amendment sponsor's press release last week said credit reporting  agencies do not have any Federal requirements for cybersecurity  practices. That is news to the House Banking Services Committee, which  has authored some of those requirements. So it simply isn't the case.   Credit reporting agencies are required to adhere to numerous data and  consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, along with several Federal rules and standards  on data security.   I have some concerns that Congress should not be in the business of  dictating specific security methodologies. The multifactor  authentication procedures specified in the gentleman's amendment could  be right sometimes, even many times, but circumstances, innovation, and  the passage of time may indicate otherwise.   As chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial  Institutions, we want to spend some time on trying to look at this  issue and hope that the gentleman works with our committee.
