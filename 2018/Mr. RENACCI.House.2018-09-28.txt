 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation which  includes my bipartisan bill, the Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent  Opioid Abuse Act.   The opioid epidemic has hit my home State of Ohio particularly hard,  with thousands of Ohioans dying from drug overdoses every year.   This bill will make it easier for Medicare Advantage Part D drug  plans, and HHS to combat fraud, waste, and abuse and prevent the  overprescribing of opioids to vulnerable seniors.   I would like to thank members of this conference committee as well as  their staff for including my bill in this package and for their hard  work to pass legislation to address the opioid epidemic.
