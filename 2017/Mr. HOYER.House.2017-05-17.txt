 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hurd for his leadership on this  issue. I am pleased to work with him on it.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   It will not be a controversial bill. It will not make the front page  of the paper tomorrow. People will not be seized of this bill passing.  But this bill may well have a very great consequence to it and to the  efficiency and effectiveness of our Federal Government.   Last July, I outlined a series of reforms to renew America's faith in  their government, which included modernizing government technology. Not  long after, I introduced the Information Technology Modernization Act  to achieve that goal; and, of course, Mr. Connolly was a cosponsor with  me on that bill.   I am glad that this bill on the floor today includes my legislation.  It would be a major step toward ensuring that our government is using  the latest technology systems, is well protected from cyber threats,  and can serve the American people more effectively.                                time  1500    Mr. Hurd came over to me on the floor and we talked about our two  ideas. As the gentleman from Virginia has said, they were  complementary, and I am pleased that we could work together to put  these bills together and that we now have agreement with the Senate. We  passed a bill through the House.   Last week's major global cyber attack was yet another reminder of how  critical it is that our government's technology systems are upgraded to  the latest and most secure technology. If any lesson was needed, we got  it.   Americans count on government agencies to protect their personal  data, and our security agencies rely on our government systems to  safeguard classified and sensitive information. Unfortunately, our  government technology systems are now far behind the latest technology  and are in desperate need of upgrades.   I congratulate the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) for her work  on this effort.   What this legislation does is authorize the creation of a technology  modernization fund to finance rapid upgrades of government technology  systems similar to funds that are available in the private sector so  they can move quickly and seize the best and latest technology  available. It would prioritize the systems that are the most  vulnerable, and it would implement best practices from the private  sector. In other words, those that are working least well will be the  first addressed.   Once upgrades are completed, agencies will pay back into the fund  from the savings achieved through greater efficiency, i.e., a revolving  fund, making it possible then to finance additional projects in a way  that is self-sustaining after the initial investment. All of this would  be done in a way that is transparent and accountable.   Once this bill is enacted, we must take the next step and provide, of  course, that initial funding.   I have been proud to work across the aisle with Majority Leader  McCarthy, Chairman Chaffetz, Mr. Hurd, and, of course, my dear, dear  friend from Virginia, my colleague in the Washington metropolitan area,  Representative Connolly on our side.   Representative Kelly, whom I just mentioned, and Congressman Ted Lieu  have also been champions of this effort, and I thank them for their  input and their strong support as we worked to bring it to the floor in  a bipartisan fashion.   Again, I want to say how pleased I am to work on these issues with  all of my colleagues, but particularly with the majority leader, Mr.  McCarthy, my friend from California, and thank him for his leadership.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Modernizing  Government Technology Act, and I hope the Trump administration will  include investment to capitalize this new fund in their fiscal 2018  budget.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from New  York, the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee for yielding.  I thank Mr. Kinzinger for his leadership as well as his statement.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation, which  will impose tough sanctions on entities aiding the Assad regime in  Syria.   Bashar al-Assad is brutal murderer. Very frankly, there are too many  countries facilitating and complicit in the murders that he  perpetrates. He has gassed his own people and waged a civil war that  has displaced millions from their homes and their country.   Recently, Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of meeting some of the White  Helmet civil defense workers who are risking their lives daily to  rescue civilians caught in the crossfire and targeted by government  forces; facilitated, I might say, by Mr. Putin's troops in Syria.   The Assad regime is being propped up by Iran and Russia in a  dangerous and destabilizing geopolitical game. There are reports that  the Assad government is now cremating victims of mass murder in an  attempt to hide the evidence of its numerous crimes. While this is  taking place, Americans watched in disbelief; frankly, as President  Trump met in the Oval Office with those who are protecting, aiding and  abetting Bashar al-Assad and those committing atrocities by his command  and in his name.   Not only does that show how little this President understands about  the conflict in Syria and its broader complexities, it also reminds us  that he has articulated no clear strategy on how to end that conflict  and to defeat ISIS.   Having said that, let me congratulate the President for taking the  actions against the airfield after the chemical attack. But, frankly,  that was a significant, but small, step.   The continuation of the war that the Assad government is waging  against its own people only makes it harder to defeat the terrorists  who threaten America, the region, and the world. Today's legislation  will help address this problem.   I see on the floor, my friend, Chairman Royce, who is a great leader  on issues relating to our foreign policy and to human rights. I  congratulate him for his leadership. Working with his partner, Mr.  Engel, we have taken significant steps to raise both the moral and the  foreign policy issues that need to be raised. The efforts are  bipartisan and reflect hard work on the part of the ranking member, the  chairman, as well as members of the Foreign Affairs Committee.   I thank them for their efforts, and I urge my colleagues to join in  strong and, hopefully, unanimous support of this important resolution.
