 Mr. President, I commend the Senators who are the  authors of this amendment. The Senator from Kansas, Mr. Moran, has  discussed this issue with me many times, as have the Senators from New  Mexico who feel very strongly about it as well. I know the Senators  from Colorado are also cosponsors.   As chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the funding  for Amtrak, I support this amendment. Amtrak's national network is  vital for the hundreds of communities across the country it serves,  particularly in the more rural areas of our country.   At a hearing I chaired this past May with the ranking member, Senator  Reed, Amtrak committed to not making service changes in advance of new  authorizing legislation. It also committed to consulting with the  communities it serves before making changes that would affect the  residents of those communities. We fully expect Amtrak to stand by the  commitments that were made at our May hearing.   This amendment conveys our longstanding support for long-distance  passenger rail service, and I encourage my colleagues to adopt it.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, we are continuing to make progress on  this package of appropriations bills. Speaking for the managers on this  side of the aisle--the Republican chairman of the subcommittee--I  request that our colleagues file amendments at the desk by 1 p.m.  tomorrow.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up and reported by number: Senator  Manchin's amendment No. 3553, Senator Paul's amendment No. 3543. I  further ask consent that at 5:45 p.m. today, the Senate vote in  relation to the Manchin and Paul amendments in the order listed and  that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the amendments  prior to the votes. Finally, I ask that there be 10 minutes, equally  divided in the usual form, between the two votes.    Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose  the amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky.   Make no mistake about what this amendment would do. It is an 11.4- percent, across-the-board, indiscriminate, meat-ax cut in important  programs, and as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee has  pointed out, it would violate the bipartisan agreement we just reached  earlier this year.   In addition, let me give you just one example of what the impact of  Senator Paul's amendment would be. If you look at the section 8 housing  program, which helps some of our most vulnerable citizens, this  amendment's passage would mean that 275,000 low-income seniors,  disabled individuals, homeless veterans, and families with small  children would lose their housing assistance and become at risk of  homelessness. I don't think that is what we want.   Thank you.    Mr. President, in 1959, a new summer playhouse opened in  Brunswick, ME, with a performance of the popular operetta ``Song of  Norway.'' In 2018, the Maine State Music Theater presents its 60th  season with professional productions that range from ``Singin' in the  Rain'' to ``Saturday Night Fever.''   It is a pleasure to congratulate Maine State Music Theater on this  landmark anniversary and to thank the casts, crews, supporters, and  volunteers who, for six decades, have delighted audiences and enriched  the cultural life of our State.   The oldest professional musical theater in Maine, Maine State Music  Theater was founded by Victoria Crandall, a truly remarkable  entrepreneur and artist. Born in Cleveland, she studied piano at the  prestigious Eastman School of Music, toured with the USO during World  War II, and was an accompanist for such show business legends as Ethel  Merman and Jimmy Durante.   After working in theatrical productions on Broadway, Ms. Crandall  struck out on her own in 1959 to pursue her dream of establishing her  own theater company and chose the Bowdoin College campus in Brunswick  as the place to make her dream come true. Rejecting the prepackaged  shows often used in summer theaters, she presented originally designed  productions--as many as nine per season--that earned rave reviews from  audiences and critics alike.   Ms. Crandall passed away in 1990 at the age of 81 while in New York  City casting roles for that year's season. At the time of her death,  she had staged 186 productions in Brunswick that were seen by more than  1.5 million people.   Ms. Crandall's legacy is carried on by accomplished performers and  technical personnel, many of whom have gone on to achieve success on  Broadway and in Hollywood. With dedicated management and strong  community support, Maine State Music Theater has expanded its offerings  to children's programs, outdoor concerts, film and lecture series, and  an educational fellowship program for those developing careers in the  theater. The 2017 season set a new record for attendance, with more  than 95 percent of the house sold for the four main productions.   Maine State Music Theater is a true gem of the Maine arts scene and a  highlight of the State's glorious summers. I offer the company all the  best on this 60th anniversary and wish them great success for many  years to come.  [[Page S5357]]                                ____________________
