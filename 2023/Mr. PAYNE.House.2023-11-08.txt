 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to question the Republicans'  commitment to the American people.   We are 9 days away from the end of government funding for critical  programs nationwide. Republicans should be working with Democrats to  continue funding in the best interests of the American people. Instead,  they are holding the government funding hostage to demand cuts to  programs Americans need every day.   They want to cut Social Security and Medicare and deny food and  medicine to seniors and lower income American families. They want to  cut funding to efforts to provide clean air and water nationwide and  allow polluters to threaten the lives of Americans, especially American  children.   They want to cut IRS funding that will force the wealthy, tax- cheating Americans and corporations to pay their fair share and rob our  country of $3 trillion in new revenue.   These are not the actions of a party dedicated to the best interests  of Americans.                            ____________________
