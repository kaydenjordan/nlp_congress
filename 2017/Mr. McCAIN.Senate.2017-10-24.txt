 Mr. President, it is very hard for me to add to the  eloquence of my dear friend from Arizona, but I do want to say it has  been one of the great honors of my life to have the opportunity to  serve with a man of integrity, of honor, decency, and commitment to not  only Arizona but the United States of America.   I have seen Jeff Flake stand up for what he believes in, knowing full  well that there would be a political price to pay. I have seen him  stand up for his family. I have seen him stand up for his forbearers  who were the early settlers of the State of Arizona. In fact, there is  a place called Snowflake, AZ, and obviously the ``Flake'' part comes  from his direct predecessor.   It is the Flake family and families like them who came and worked and  slaved and raised families and made Arizona what it is, and it has  never had a more deserving son than Jeff Flake and his beautiful wife  Cheryl and children.   So I would just like to say, Jeff, I have known you now for a number  of years. I know you have served Arizona and the country, and there is  one thing I am absolutely sure of, and that is you will continue that  service, which is part of your family. It is part of your view of  America. It is part of your willingness and desire to serve Arizona.  One of the great privileges of my life has been to have the opportunity  to know you and serve with you.   As we look, all of us, at some point at our time that we have spent  here--whether it be short or whether it be long--we look back and we  think about what we could have done, what we should have done, what we  might have done, the mistakes we made, and the things we are proud of.  Well, when the Flake service to this country in this Senate is  reviewed, it will be one of honor, of brilliance and patriotism and  love of country.  [[Page S6737]]    I thank you. God bless you and your family.   I yield the floor.
