 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2,  the Moving Forward Act. This infrastructure bill invests in our roads,  bridges, transit systems, schools, housing, clean water systems, and so  much more.   Importantly, it will create good-paying jobs, repair critical  infrastructure, address the climate crisis, and create healthier and  safer communities. I am proud that this bill includes key provisions  that I championed in Congress, including repairing our natural gas  pipelines to prevent methane leaks, investing in our public buildings  to make them more energy efficient, and incentivizing our Nation's  ports to reduce harmful emissions. These investments are a down payment  on our Nation's future, and they will, indeed, help us move America  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  passage of H.R. 2.                            ____________________
