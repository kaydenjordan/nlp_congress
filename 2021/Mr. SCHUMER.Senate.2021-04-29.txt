 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last night, before a joint session of  Congress, President Biden laid out a comprehensive, thoughtful vision  for the country.   First, he spoke about what we have accomplished so far, and on that  front, there was plenty to talk about.   The Democratic majority in Congress passed the most sweeping Federal  recovery effort in a new generation, the American Rescue Plan,  accelerating the pace of vaccinations and our economic rebound. As a  result, the United States administered more than 200 million shots in  less than 100 days. More than half of American adults have gotten at  least one shot, and two-thirds of American seniors are vaccinated.  Eighty-five percent of all Americans have received a stimulus check of  $1,400 through the American Rescue Plan. More than 160 million relief  checks have been delivered.   Our economic recovery continues apace. The United States created more  than a million jobs over the past 3 months--the most new jobs in a  President's first hundred days in American history. And just this  morning, we learned that jobless claims hit a new pandemic low for the  third straight week. Today's numbers are an indication that our economy  is back on track and should be going full throttle. America is turning  the corner. America is turning the corner.   Over the first quarter, the American economy grew by 6.4 percent--6.4  percent. Under President Biden and Democratic majorities in Congress,  America is turning the corner--6.4 percent growth, wow. That shows you  that America is back, and that shows you that the kind of strong,  active proposals that we Democrats have made are the right direction  for the country and have the support throughout the country of  Democrats, Independents, Republicans because it is the right thing to  do--the right thing to do.   The story of the first hundred days is a story about shots going into  arms, checks going into pockets, life getting back to normal, and the  economy picking up a lot of steam. After one of the most difficult  years in history, we have made extraordinary progress.   President Biden spoke last night about how and where we can build on  that strong foundation. We can't rest. We have a lot more to do. We  want to keep this country going at a strong rate of growth, creating  new jobs, making America healthier. We want to continue to do that. We  are not just going to stop with the ARP. We can't.   President Biden proposed commonsense investments and policies that  will provide a pathway to success for working people and for America as  a  [[Page S2312]]  whole. In particular, the President's focus on jobs, middle-class  incomes, and helping families and workers succeed in a 21st-century  economy was very much welcomed.   America is breathing a sigh of relief to see Joe Biden in that chair  and not the previous President, who just all too often, even in those  speeches where he was supposed to rise to the occasion, appealed to the  worst instincts of people.   The President's plan--President Biden's plan--will help restore that  once innate American optimism that has really been shaken for the last  4 years. Now the Congress must act. And, as majority leader, I intend  for the Senate to take up legislation to make President Biden's vision  a reality.   Truthfully, a lot of what President Biden proposed last night should  be bipartisan. Just because a Democratic President proposed a jobs and  infrastructure plan doesn't mean jobs and infrastructure are Democratic  issues. Just because a Democratic President proposed a comprehensive  plan to address childcare and education and workforce training doesn't  mean those are just Democratic issues. My Republican colleagues, in one  way or another, have joined Democrats on legislation in those subject  areas for years.   President Biden spoke at length about the need to outcompete China.  That is something our two parties have long agreed on and a topic the  Senate will address in the next work period.   Even on the very difficult subjects like police reform, gun safety,  immigration, bipartisan compromise--strong bipartisan compromise,  strong legislation coming out of bipartisan compromise--is never out of  reach.   Senator Murphy continues to discuss bipartisan safety measures with  Senator Cornyn and others. Senators Booker and Durbin continue to  discuss bipartisan policing reform with Senator Scott, Karen Bass,  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and many others.   Just this morning, I met with George Floyd's brother, Eric Garner's  mother, and Mr. Ben Crump, the lawyer for the family of George Floyd,  and I told them that we are committed to getting meaningful, strong  reform done--hopefully, in a bipartisan way, if we can.   Here on the Senate floor, we are proving that our two parties can  work together on legislation, including on some of the issues that  President Biden mentioned. Today's vote offers a great example. This  afternoon, the Senate is going to vote on a bipartisan water  infrastructure bill. We have agreed with the Republican minority to  consider several amendments first, including three Republican  amendments. I promised my caucus and the country that we would try to  do things in a more open way, where amendments would be debated on the  floor. We did that last week on the anti-Asian hate crimes legislation.  We are doing it today on the water bill, and we hope to do it on the  comprehensive America COMPETES Act when we come back next week.   So the bottom line is very simple: We are moving forward wherever we  can in a bipartisan way.   I expect the Senate will pass the water infrastructure bill with a  resounding bipartisan vote after the amendments are debated. So let it  be a signal to our Republican colleagues that Senate Democrats want to  work together on infrastructure when and where we can.   Certainly, the water bill is not the only example of bipartisan  legislation this Congress. As I mentioned, a few weeks ago, nearly the  entire Senate stood together to pass legislation to combat the recent  surge in hate crimes, particularly against Americans of Asian descent,  94 to 1--94 to 1.   And just yesterday, the Senate passed, with bipartisan support, a  measure to reinstate critical rules to reduce the emissions of methane  into our atmosphere. It was the first significant action the Senate has  taken to combat climate change in at least a decade, probably much  more.   Even though our two parties have been divided in the past on the  subject of climate change, we can no longer afford to have those  differences foil our progress. The methane CRA must be the first--the  first of many steps we take to tackle climate change.   So these past few months have provided a great example of what the  Senate can do. The American people deserve a Congress that works and  produces the kinds of change that Americans are demanding. President  Biden pointed the way. He pointed the way forward on a number of issues  last night. Now it is up to us, here in the Senate and in the Congress,  to make progress, the progress for the American people, a reality.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 69.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 65.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  the mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, April  29, be waived.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.  [[Page S2313]]     I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    First, Mr. President, it was good when I walked in--it  felt really good when I walked in a few hours ago as we were voting,  and I saw Mr. Carper, Senator Carper, the chairman of the EPW  Committee, sitting here and Senator Capito, the ranking member, sitting  there, working together to make sure that this bill passed and working  together to defeat some amendments that might have hurt the whole  bill's chance of passing. That is how it used to be around here all the  time, and it is good to see it. And I thank both the chair and the  ranking member for doing that as well as the whole Senate as well,  including Leader McConnell. We are trying to work in a bipartisan way  whenever we can, and this bill is a classic example.   First, its importance, of course, is paramount--and I will get to  that in a minute--but, second, the fact that we can come together on an  important bill that is a part of the Build Back Better plan is  something that I think Members on both sides of the aisle can be very  happy about, and Americans should be happy about as well.   It doesn't mean that we will be able to do the whole thing  bipartisan, but we will do as much as we can--as much as we can.   And this bill is an important one. Clean water is vital to the  American people and to their health, and for too long we have tolerated  lead in the water of too many. When lead gets into the water of young  people, it can certainly cause health problems in later years. All too  often, it occurs in poorer communities and communities of color.   This bill, in a bipartisan way, says we are going to come together  and get the lead out--get the lead out of our pipes, get the lead out  of our faucets, get the lead out of our water. That is an important  part of this bill.   And the second part of the bill is, you know, water is very, very  important to bringing businesses. Upstate New York, we are trying to  attract businesses. One of the first things a business will ask is: Do  you have some land available that has water and sewer? When you can say  yes, you have a much better chance of attracting businesses to those  communities that definitely need new jobs.   And, finally, of course, we all depend on water in our daily lives,  and many of the systems are old. They are a century old. Many of our  local governments no longer have the dollars to do this on their own.  So having a bill that is robust, that helps them, is very, very  important.   I would finally note that the bill that we are voting on today is  very much--is very similar to the proposal made by some of the  Republican leaders when they put together a proposal to President  Biden.   So, again, closing on the note I opened with, the happy  bipartisanship that marks this bill is a very good thing, and I hope it  can continue.   I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall vote  begin now.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Let me take a moment at the end to make a few points.  First, the issue of China's predatory actions against American  intellectual property is one that we must address as part of the  competition bill. Second, my friends from Ohio and Delaware, Senators  Portman and Carper, are to be commended for their work on this issue in  the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Third, I have committed  to work with Chairman Peters, Ranking Member Portman, and other  relevant committee chairs and ranking members to reach an agreement on  the text of the Safeguarding American Innovation Act so that it can be  included in the Endless Frontier legislation.                            ____________________
