 Madam Speaker, almost 20 years ago our country began  sending brave servicemembers on deployment after deployment during the  global war on terror. Around the world, they faced dangers not just  from the enemy, but also from the circumstances of their service.   Too many of those who served in areas of toxic exposure now bear  life-long illness in exchange for the security they provided to all of  us.   And too many of those who faced the traumas of combat or sexual  assault, now bear unseen and often debilitating burdens on their mental  health.   This is why I introduced two amendments to this bill. The first  directs $1 million to Burn Pits Centers of Excellence, one of which is  located in East Orange, New Jersey, for critical research.   The second directs $10 million to expand vet center counseling  services to additional locations, including in my district where a new  vet center is badly needed.   Our veterans deserve the best treatment available, whether their  injuries are physical or mental. We owe it to them to support this  funding.
