 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join several of my colleagues  tonight to recognize our former colleague, Mr. Paul Mitchell.   Paul was recently diagnosed with cancer, and so many of us wanted to  send our well-wishes that we decided the best way we could do it was  from the well of the House, a place that Paul Mitchell loved and spent  so much of his time.   Paul represented Michigan's 10th District in our State's thumb from  2017 until his retirement just this year. In that time, he proved  himself to be the kind of principled, practical leader that Michigan is  known for.   Paul knew that the path to good government runs through reaching  across the aisle. The proof is in his record. Paul was intentional  about ensuring key legislation be introduced in a bipartisan fashion,  and the folks he drew to his legislation ran the gamut of the political  spectrum.   Paul was an advocate for students, for investing in innovation, and  for  [[Page H3068]]  economic development. Whether you were on the left or the right, Paul  worked with you to get things done.   These days, some might call that behavior an independent, being a  maverick. But to us, that was just Paul.   When he announced his retirement in July 2019 in order to spend more  time with his family, we, of course, wished him all the best. But I  also felt a twinge of sadness in losing a funny, charming, and humble  servant leader.   He charted his own course in Congress as both a legislator and a  friend. His presence is deeply missed in this Chamber.   Earlier this month, we received the news that Paul had been diagnosed  with renal cancer. Weeks before, he had had emergency surgery to remove  a mass and a blood clot that had moved to his heart. His doctors at  Henry Ford Macomb Hospital estimated a 10 percent chance of survival,  but true to form, Paul pulled through.   I am happy to announce that last night Paul went home to his family  in Dryden. He has a long road of recovery ahead of him, one that will  require things like physical therapy and immunotherapy, but Paul is  approaching his recovery with a typical can-do approach.   We want to send him all of our love and all of our strength for  recovery, those of us who spent so much time with him. Here assembled,  we have members of the Michigan delegation and members of the Problem  Solvers Caucus, two groups that spent a ton of time with Paul Mitchell.   Mr. Speaker, it is, therefore, my privilege to turn the floor over to  some of those friends to recognize him in the place that we know he  loved so much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia  (Ms. Spanberger).    Mr. Speaker, in honor of Mr. Mitchell, we will now start  going Democrat-Republican, Democrat-Republican to demonstrate our  bipartisanship.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Upton).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Reed).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Reed for those heartfelt words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips),  another member of the Problem Solvers Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Phillips for his heartfelt  words.   In conclusion, Paul, as you can imagine, we, of course, had our  schedule changed 12 different times today. There are many, many more of  our colleagues who are submitting official notes for the Record, and  who are stuck in various places and will reach out directly.   But to you and your family, for the legacy that you left in this  place, please know that we see you, we recognize you, we believe in  your will to fight, and we are behind you 100 percent.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining on both sides of the  aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Walberg for those kind words.   Paul, I hope you know the strength that we are sending you, all of us  on both sides of the aisle. We feel it, we have been talking about you  and Sherry and the kids constantly. And we hope that from our convening  on you, you feel that strength and the power to fight back and beat  this thing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, and I yield back the balance of  my time.                            ____________________
