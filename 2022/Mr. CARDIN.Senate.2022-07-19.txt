 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the bipartisan  Global Learning Loss Assessment Act, S. 552, which I introduced along  with Senator Boozman last year. This bill requires the U.S. Agency for  International Development, or USAID, to submit a report to Congress  that assesses learning loss, identifies gaps in access to education,  and outlines the response that is needed to help students recover from  COVID-19 and reach their full potential. I applaud the advancement of  this bill, which was voted on favorably in the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee earlier today and will now move to the Senate floor for  consideration. I should note that the House companion bill passed the  House in June 2021. So it is time for the Senate to act.   The COVID-19 pandemic has forced schools around the world to suspend  in-person learning as a measure to contain the spread of the virus and  safeguard public health. Even before the pandemic began, UNESCO  reported that 258 million children were out of school globally,  including 130 million girls. Now, the pandemic has disrupted the  education of an estimated 90 percent of the world's student  population--over 1.6 billion children and youth--who saw their schools  close at some point due to COVID-19.   We already know that school closures lead to interrupted learning,  poor nutrition, gaps in childcare, increased dropout rates, exposure to  violence, and social isolation. What is more, students already at a  disadvantage before COVID-19 will experience greater learning loss,  thereby worsening inequity and inequality in education.   School closures are especially burdensome for girls, who are  frequently expected to shoulder more household responsibilities and are  more vulnerable to gender-based violence--GBV. For example, according  to a study by the United Nations Development Program, school closures  in Sierra Leone necessitated by the Ebola pandemic led to increased  instances of sexual- and gender-based violence, teenage pregnancy,  school dropout, and child labor for girls.   Restrictions associated with COVID-19 have also made girls more  vulnerable to child and early forced marriage. The United Nations  Population Fund--UNFPA--estimates that 13,000,000 more child marriages  could take place by 2030 than would have without the pandemic, and when  a girl gets married, her education almost always stops.   When school closures occur, a significant percentage of distance  learning alternatives rely exclusively on online platforms. However,  according to UNICEF, two-thirds of the world's school-aged children do  not have an internet connection in their homes, with that number rising  to about 90 percent of students in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore,  schools and local learning centers frequently have inadequate internet  connectivity.   The Global Learning Loss Assessment Act will help improve the quality  and reach of international education assistance by giving Congress the  information we need to assess the status of education worldwide. The  critical information included in the report produced by USAID will be  used to inform future policy, oversight, and programmatic decisions by  Congress and USAID, and will help ensure that our partner countries are  better prepared to respond to future crises that could disrupt the  education system.   Specifically, the USAID report shall include: an assessment of  learning loss globally and of the impact on U.S. basic education  programs; an overview of distance learning in low resource contexts; a  description of the barriers to education or distance learning for  marginalized children; data on USAID programs that have been supporting  learning during the pandemic; an overview of how USAID has,  independently and in coordination with partners, adapted basic  education programming during the COVID-19 pandemic to support continued  learning; and a description of the authorities and resources USAID  needs to continue to support education programs during and after the  pandemic to mitigate learning loss and help students get back on track.   The Global Learning Loss Assessment Act has been endorsed by several  important NGOs, including the Basic Education Coalition, Cambridge  Education, Catholic Relief Services, Chemonics International, Childhood  Education International, Food for the Hungry, Global Campaign for  Education-US, Jesuit Refugee Service/USA, Luminos Fund, RESULTS, RISE  Institute, RTI International, Save the Children, Unbounded Associates,  UNICEF USA, World Education, and World Learning.   I look forward to the opportunity for this important bill supporting  education worldwide to be adopted by the Senate.                            ____________________
