 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 229 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 229         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1430) to       prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from proposing,       finalizing, or disseminating regulations or assessments based       upon science that is not transparent or reproducible. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology; and (2) one       motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my friend from Colorado (Mr. Polis), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand House Resolution 229. You  heard the Clerk read it moments ago. Page 1 and page 2. Folks can find  it on rules.house.gov if they haven't had a chance to see it already.  It provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 1430, Honest and  Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017.   If you work through that title, Mr. Speaker, the Honest and Open New  EPA Science Treatment Act, you will find that ``honest'' is what those  letters spell out. It is the HONEST Act.   In the past, the Rules Committee has reported structured rules for  consideration of this very bill. In this case, Mr. Speaker, there were  no amendments offered in committee. There were no amendments presented  in the Rules Committee last night. We have reported a closed rule for  consideration of this bill.  [[Page H2472]]    Science is, Mr. Speaker, in the EPA's own words, the backbone of  EPA's decisionmaking. President Obama, in 2011, issued an executive  order about how agencies should go about making the regulatory process  more effective. He said, and I quote: ``Each agency shall ensure the  objectivity of any scientific and technological information and  processes used to support the agency's regulatory actions.''   We talk so much about what divides us in this institution, in this  town, sometimes even in this country, Mr. Speaker, I think that point  is worth dwelling on.   Again, quoting from former President Barack Obama: ``Each agency  shall ensure the objectivity of any scientific and technological  information and processes used to support the agency's regulatory  actions.''   It is what the HONEST Act aims to do, Mr. Speaker. It aims to provide  the American public with the data that the EPA uses in each of its  regulatory actions.   It would come as a surprise to many Americans, Mr. Speaker, to learn  that there are Agency actions that take place based entirely on  undisclosed data sets, that the regulatory arm of government can be at  work based on secret data that will never be released to the American  public to verify, to confirm in this what is often, in scientific  communities, referred to as peer-reviewed literature.   We believe that, if we are making the rules, we should be able to  expose the data on which those rules are based to scrutiny and, in  fact, to challenge, Mr. Speaker.   One thing I have learned in this job is sometimes I am not as smart  as I think I am. I don't know if that has ever happened to you, Mr.  Speaker. I am sure it has never happened to my friend from Colorado.  But sometimes we are not as smart as we think we are. Sometimes being  challenged makes us better.   The HONEST Act, Mr. Speaker, aims to provide the opportunity simply  by looking at the data for any American citizen to understand the  regulatory actions being taken at the EPA, and, yes, if necessary, to  challenge those actions if they believe they are not based on sound  science.   Mr. Speaker, I know what you are thinking. You are thinking: Is this  bill necessary? The EPA's mission is to protect the environment and  public health, so, of course, it is going to use the best science.   The answer should be yes. The answer should be yes that in every set  of circumstances we are always using the very best data. But as you  know, time and time again, you can bring an expert into your office. A  scientist on one side of the issue will tell you one thing; a scientist  on the other will bring an equally compelling compendium of information  to tell you the next. It is left to us, to the American people, to  decide who is right and who is wrong.   This is nothing to be feared. This is something to be embraced. It  has certainly been a characteristic of our great country for over 200  years.   But in these days of information pouring out of the administration at  the speed of the internet, it is more critical than ever that we make  that information available to the public. With the ability today to  understand that information, to process that information, to compile  that information, to inspect that information in details never before  imagined, it is incumbent upon us to make sure that America has that  opportunity.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to support  this rule to bring the bill to the floor and then to support the  underlying legislation so that we can pass the HONEST Act, bringing  clarity and transparency to the EPA rulemaking process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you know that I consider the gentleman from Colorado to  be a good friend of mine. I find myself, after that presentation,  though, wondering if that was a cloud of smog over Denver or if it was  another cloud of smoke over Denver in these days.   That is just not true. It is just not true. I will start with what I  am proud about because I think we do focus too often on divisions.   Mr. Speaker, you know that we wanted to hold the Obama administration  accountable for sound science. And now that there is a Republican in  the White House, we want to hold a Republican administration  accountable for sound science.                                time  1245    So often in this town, we see one set of rules when you agree with  the person in office and another set of rules when you disagree with  the person in office. I don't think that is the right way to govern a  country. I am proud that we are not falling into that trap. If it is  good for the Obama administration, it is good for the Trump  administration.   Number two, there is no smoke-filled backroom deal here. Number one,  there is no smoke-filled room anywhere on Capitol Hill. Speaker Boehner  is gone, and smoking is banned from all of our spaces. This bill went  through a full committee hearing, the full committee process. So often,  Mr. Speaker, you know at the beginning of a year like this one, we are  trying to move legislation to the floor quickly. Some things that we  have already had hearings and debate on, like this bill, from last  Congress, we bring to the floor outside of regular order, and we skip  the committee hearing process. Not so with this bill. It went through  the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for a full hearing.   Mr. Speaker, we talk about transparency as if it exists at the EPA. I  will remind my friend from Colorado, Mr. Speaker, we have to issue  subpoenas from the United States Congress to get the EPA to share its  data with us, notwithstanding to get them to share it with the  University of Georgia or Georgia Tech or Caltech, or wherever the best  scientific minds of the day are. We have to issue subpoenas to get them  to share that information. Clearly, transparency is not the norm, it is  the exception.   We talk about costs. My friend references $1 billion in costs from  some study, apparently, not a peer-review study. I have not seen the  data backing up this study. But the good news is I don't actually need  the study. I have the bill itself, Mr. Speaker, and I will turn to the  relevant part here. Paragraph 5, clarify that the administrator shall  implement this section in a matter that does not exceed $1 million per  year from the amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated. Now, you  don't have to spend the entire million dollars, Mr. Speaker, but in the  name of transparency, to make sure that folks have access to the data,  we have said it is worth investing resources but not to exceed $1  million.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we talk about the burden of red tape. I don't  know if you have had to deal with the EPA or the DOT or the DOD or the  DOE--insert DO acronym here--red tape is abundant in this Federal  Government, and asking the Federal Government to be transparent is the  antithesis of red tape. Since when did it become a burden on the  institutions of government to be transparent with the American people?  Since when, when you are making rules and regulations that affect the  lives of every single American, did it become a burden to share the  data on which those regulations are based?   I will say to you, Mr. Speaker, we get wrapped around the axle so  often here that we end up getting further and further from our goals.  Sharing data, getting peer-reviewed comments on that data, and having  folks come out in support of the conclusions reached on that data are  going to make us stronger as a nation not weaker. If you are proud of  your underlying data, you should be proud to share that data. If you  are embarrassed of your underlying data, I understand why you might  want to keep it a secret.   We have an opportunity not to hide from science but to embrace  science, we have an opportunity not to reach political conclusions but  scientific conclusions, and we have an opportunity to restore the  American people's trust in the institutions of government that are  issuing these regulations. This is a small step in the right direction  with the HONEST Act, Mr. Speaker, but it is an important step in the  right direction. I hope my colleagues will support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    I would say to the gentleman, as he may know, the  language is different in this section.   When the CBO scored the bill last year, they presumed that the EPA  would have the obligation of compiling all the data and making it all  public themselves. In this bill, it presumes the EPA will only make use  of publicly available data. I would refer the gentleman to the  committee report.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I often wonder what it is like to be in your position  there, a distinguished career as a judge, and you come down here to  talk about the EPA and whether or not the rules and regulations should  be based on sound science or not, and you end up with a discussion over  the Russians. There is no objection that can be lodged here for going  outside of the scope of the bill.   I can always tell, when I come down for Rules Committee debate,  whether or not we are really talking about something that divides us or  whether we are just talking. If we are talking about something that  divides us, we spend every moment of the hours that we have debating  the nitty-gritty of the issue before us--talking about how quickly  should that data be disclosed; how many folks should have access to it.  Are there going to be episodes where the data needs to be kept super  secret and folks can't be trusted with it? What should we do about new  and emerging business practices, propriety technologies? How do we deal  with those questions?   I enjoy those rules, Mr. Speaker, because we are doing exactly what  we came here to do, and that is to delve into the details and get it  right for the American people.   What I am led to believe on a day like today is that we are pretty  close to getting it right for the American people because we are not  talking about the nitty-gritty of the legislation. We are talking about  the Clean Power Plan that the past administration put forward. We are  not talking about the details of the legislation; we are talking about  the Russians today. I think that is because there aren't many things  much more common sense than sharing with the American people that data  on which the laws of the land are made.    Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the EPA is involved in a  complicated line of work, a critically important line of work.   I can't find a single constituent in the great State of Georgia that  doesn't believe in clean water and clean air. I can find a whole lot of  them who think that they believe more in clean water and clean air than  does any institution in Washington, D.C. I promise you, no one cares  more about the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area than those  of us who live along the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area.   Nobody cares more about protecting the Earth in the great State of  Georgia than those farmers who are creating the largest export we have  in the great State of Georgia, which are our agriculture products.   We are in this together, which is why, when this bill came before the  House last Congress, it passed with a bipartisan vote. These are  commonsense ideas that bring us together more than they divide us.   Mr. Speaker, I think the real surprise is that folks believe the EPA  to be transparent, and learn that it is not. Folks would not believe  that this Congress has to subpoena information in order to get its  hands on it.   What this bill would say is not only should Congress be able to  access the information, but any reputable scientist should be able to  access the information.   What my friend says about privacy concerns, they are a shared concern  in this institution. There is absolutely nothing in this underlying  legislation that threatens those privacy concerns. In fact, it requires  that all private information be redacted before the information be  utilized.  [[Page H2478]]    Concerns over cost, again, are absolutely important, but I will read  from the committee report: ``This bill does not contain any new budget  authority, spending authority, credit authority, or an increase or  decrease in revenues or tax expenditures.''   That it is a pretty simple bill and a pretty simple rule. It asks  that we lift the curtain of secrecy around the regulations that protect  our health and safety. It asks that we make health and safety issues  not things that divide us around process, but things that unite us  around results.   Candidly, I came to this institution to achieve those results, Mr.  Speaker, and I am proud to be carrying this rule to the floor today. I  encourage all of my colleagues to please support this bill, and with  its passage we can get to the underlying legislation, end the shroud of  secrecy, and restore public confidence in the laws that protect all of  our health and safety.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 229 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign       Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
