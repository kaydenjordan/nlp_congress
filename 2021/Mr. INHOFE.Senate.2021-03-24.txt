 Thank you, Mr. President.   It is obvious to just about everyone outside of Washington that the  situation on our southern border is a crisis. I can't believe that  anyone wouldn't believe that it is a crisis, but there are some who  would answer that it isn't a crisis.   President Biden and the DHS Secretary refused to call it a crisis. It  is not just a challenge. They called it a challenge. This isn't a  challenge. This is a crisis. Ask anyone you see on the street if it is  a crisis--people lined up, coming in illegally.   You don't have to take my word for it. Look at the facts. We have had  a 173-percent increase in border apprehensions compared with 1 year  ago--173-percent increase. This past February, apprehensions were at  the highest total for February in 14 years.   DHS admits that we are on track for the most illegal migrants in more  than 20 years. This is on the border. This is today. This is what is  happening.   Last week, mainstream media news reports found that the  administration is restricting information Border Patrol agents are  allowed to share with the media about the crisis. The border agents  claim that they are under an unofficial gag order. These are the border  agents. These are the ones who do this for a living. They are down  there. They are protecting our laws, stopping illegals from coming in.  That is what their job description is, and yet they are under a gag  order.   They don't want the media to find out. And they are being told to  deny media requests for ride-alongs at the border. Now, that is so the  media can tell the people of America what is going on down there, and  they are being denied that opportunity.   The DHS Secretary claims that he is committed to openness and  transparency, but this is not openness and transparency. This is hiding  from the people what is going on.   Maybe this administration is doing this and refusing to call it a  crisis because their policies have invited this surge. This surge is  coming as a result.   President Biden has frozen funds from Congress directed for the  building of the wall. He ended the ``Remain in Mexico'' asylum policy  that was put there by the previous administration. It is a crisis.   Illegal aliens know Biden is opening our borders up, and they intend  to take advantage of that. And the illegals are wearing the Biden T- shirts. Do you see this photograph over here? There they are. Biden, we  are coming in.   I know a lot about the southern border because I have been there  countless times, seeing firsthand the problems on both the Mexican side  and the American side of the border. I was a builder and developer for  30 years down there. I know that border. I was there for 30 years, all  the way from Brownsville to McAllen, TX, on both sides. I know the  individuals that are down there who are the career people protecting  our borders.   I am disappointed that the administration is reversing the progress  we have made over the past 4 years and shocked that they simply won't  acknowledge it is a crisis.   The border security should not be a partisan issue, and I am glad  there are a few Senate Democrats who share my concern about this  crisis. I applaud them for speaking out. It took guts to do it.   Well, I have got a resolution, and I am going to introduce this  resolution. I introduced it, actually, already. I think every Senator  will agree with it. It is a simple resolution.   We haven't checked this out yet, but I think this might be the  shortest resolution in the history of the U.S. Senate. I am going to  read it to you.   It simply states:         It is the sense of the Senate that the current influx of       migrants at the Southern land border of the United States       constitutes a crisis.    That is it. Nothing more.   So, with that, Mr. President, as in legislative session--this is a  unanimous consent request, Mr. President. I am making it right now.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 132, submitted earlier today. I  further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate.    I object.    Mr. President, I hope everyone heard this. I haven't met  the Senator from California real well yet. I look forward to it. I look  forward to serving with him, but I hope that everyone heard what is  going on now: Just open the borders.   You know, people in other countries--I won't mention some of them  because I don't want them to be put in an awkward position--they say:  Why in the world don't we have stronger borders in the United States of  America? And we don't.   Our previous President, I talked to him this morning. I talked to  former President Trump this morning, and I talked about what is going  on down there at the border. And the reason I am familiar with this-- much more familiar than the Senator from California or anyone else--is  that I worked down there for 30 years on that border, all the way from  Brownsville, TX, to McAllen. I know the border people down there. I  know the agents down there. And for them to tell me that they have been  told not to talk to the media about what is going on--I hope everyone  knows what is going on right now, today. This is going on.   You know, President Trump is all for people coming into America the  legal way. He has made that very clear over and over again. He has  spent time down on the border, both borders, making sure that we can  have a legal--one of the most gratifying things in my job as a U.S.  Senator, and I have been in these Chambers now since 1994--one of the  most enjoyable things is to go to naturalization ceremonies. And you  talk to these people who have come and worked to come across legally to  our country. I defy you to find any one of these individuals who  ha come here legally and gone through this naturalization process--they  know more about the history of this country than people on the street,  than people who were born here and people who are serving here in the  U.S. Senate. They know the language. They learn the language. They did  it the hard way. How do you tell them: You have gone through all this  in the process of becoming legal, but you didn't have to do that. You  just march right in. They are inviting you in. They want you in.    Put it back up. Yes, that is what is going on right now. That is what  is going on at the border. So I want everyone to know what is happening  now.   We can be sympathetic to a lot of people, but the idea of saying that  we had a President who was putting kids in cages, come on. Let's get  real. We don't want to do that. We don't have to do that. We just want  to make it very clear to the American people that we have borders, and  we ought to be protecting these borders.   A lot of the people who come in, they aren't necessarily from Central  America or from Mexico. These are--a lot of them are terrorists coming  over. They are coming from the Middle East, coming from all over the  world, coming into our porous borders.   Now, is that what people want? No, it is not. Overwhelmingly, they  have rejected the idea of open borders, letting everyone come in.   Well, we are to going stay with this, and I am going to resubmit this  very simple resolution, as follows:         It is the sense of the Senate that the current influx of       migrants at the southern land border of the United States       constitutes a crisis.    It is a crisis.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
