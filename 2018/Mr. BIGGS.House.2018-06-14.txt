 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, I commend Chairman Hensarling and the gentleman from  Kentucky for their thoughtful efforts on this bill to put together a  pilot program that is designed to help people who suffer this opioid  addiction. I am grateful to them for their thoughtful efforts.   My amendment simply narrows the reporting requirements that are  imposed on the Secretary. This does not proscribe or necessarily limit  the parameters of the report, but it prevents unnecessary  prognostication on the part of the Secretary, which I believe will  allow for an accurate and valuable assessment at the conclusion of the  pilot program's testing period.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my Arizona  colleagues, to honor the life and sacrifice of U.S. Army Staff Sergeant  Alexander W. Conrad from Chandler, Arizona, who was recently killed by  indirect enemy fire while in support of Operation Octave Shield in  Somalia.   Sergeant Conrad served as a human intelligence, noncommissioned  officer and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces  Group.   Sergeant Conrad's decorated service included two tours in Afghanistan  in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He was posthumously awarded  the Purple Heart and Meritorious Service Medal.   Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Conrad was one of Arizona's finest. He fought  to free the oppressed and to ensure that all Americans live out their  days in liberty.   Please keep his family, friends, and comrades in your prayers.   Mr. Speaker, I now ask that Members please join me and my Arizona  colleagues for a moment of silence to remember U.S. Army Staff Sergeant  Alexander W. Conrad.                            ____________________
