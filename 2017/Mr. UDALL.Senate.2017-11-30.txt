 I thank the Presiding Officer for the recognition.   Mr. President, the Republicans' tax bill is a disaster for the  American people. It would give the ultrawealthy a tax cut and make  middle-class families pay for it. I can't tell you how strongly I am  opposed to it.   We have heard a lot from the President and the Republicans about how  their tax cuts will be a rising tide to lift all boats, but this claim  just doesn't hold water. Look carefully. On top of $1.5 trillion in new  deficits, they are hiding where more than $5 trillion of cuts over the  next 10 years will come from and just who will actually benefit. The  Republican budget would force steep cuts in healthcare, education, and  other programs that working and middle-class families rely on.   It is a terrible plan for my home State of New Mexico, where a lot of  families already have a hard time getting by. Plain and simple, the  Republicans' plan is a massive redistribution of wealth. Listen to who  it is taking money from and where they are giving it to. It would take  money from working families, seniors, children, the sick and disabled,  rural families, and the poor, and give it to the very top 1 percent.  They propose it at a time when the gap between the very rich and  everyone else is already growing. We now have greater income inequality  in the United States than at the height of the Gilded Age over 100  years ago.   I want to highlight for my colleagues across the aisle another big  problem with the Republicans' bill. It has not been talked about  enough, but it is important to my home State of New Mexico and to many  Western States. The Republicans' deficit-creating tax cuts are going to  cause automatic sequestration, and this will cut several mandatory  programs under the Pay-as-You-Go Act. Some of those are the mineral  royalties from oil and gas drilling and coal mining on public lands  that the Federal Government shares with States. New Mexico's royalty  share is projected to be $437 million next year. Other States count on  these payments for millions of dollars in their budgets too. Colorado  received over $80 million in 2016. All of that will be at risk. Wyoming  received over $660 million last year. Its State budget cannot afford to  lose that kind of money. Utah, Montana, and North Dakota received tens  of millions in mineral payments last year as well. These are royalties  that New Mexico and the States are entitled to.   In New Mexico we mainly use this money for public schools. Other  States use it for vital government programs like healthcare, roads, and  police.   Our State legislature has struggled the last couple of years to  balance the budget. The chair and vice chair of the New Mexico  Legislative Finance Committee wrote just this week to our entire  delegation. They warn that losing so much revenue ``would have a  devastating impact on the State's budget and would wipe out the  reserves our State has struggled to rebuild.''   New Mexico school kids just can't afford to take a $437 million hit.  I know it is possible for Congress to pass legislation sometime in the  future to take mineral royalties out of sequestration, but there is no  guarantee at all of that ever happening, and I am not willing to take  chances with the education of New Mexico's school children.   The Republicans' tax cuts will also hit Medicare hard. That is also  another  [[Page S7522]]  concern for New Mexico families. Tax cuts for the superwealthy and big  corporations will mean New Mexico could lose out on about $178 million  of Federal Medicare payments every year. I am opposed to trading off  seniors' health just so the rich can get richer, but the Republicans  seem bound and determined to take away America's healthcare, even  though the American people have spoken loud and clear. They want their  current healthcare rights fully protected. Republicans want to do away  with the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act. But we also  know that will mean millions of Americans will lose coverage, and we  know that premiums will go up because the insurance companies will be  covering a sicker population. I am opposed to trading off the American  people's health just so the rich can get richer.   The majority's bill is a bad idea for basically everyone in New  Mexico and across the country, except for the very wealthy individuals,  multinational corporations, private equity and hedge funds. These are  the folks who are being helped--the very wealthy, multinational  corporations, private equity and hedge funds.   Let's instead get down to the business of governing on behalf of the  American people, not just the top 1 percent   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
