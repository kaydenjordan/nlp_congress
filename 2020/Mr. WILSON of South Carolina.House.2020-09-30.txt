 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the insightful  columnist Star Parker provided an extraordinary analysis, ``Supreme  Court Fight is about Life and Death,'' in the Aiken Standard.   ``Chuck Schumer, Senate minority leader, says, `Our number one goal  must be to communicate the stakes of this Supreme Court fight to the  American people' . . . `nothing is off the table.'   ``Nothing? Not even violence?''   `` . . . Senator Schumer is right that the American people must know  what's at stake.   ``Will we have a culture of life and civility, or a culture of death,  violence, and chaos. . . . ''   ``Fortunately, President Donald Trump understands what is at stake.''   Because of ``the diligence of this President and the Republican  Senate, we will soon see an outstanding conservative woman--one who  respects both the sanctity of life and the sanctity of our Nation's  institutions--fill this Court vacancy.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Godspeed, Amy Barrett and Carol Davis.                            ____________________
