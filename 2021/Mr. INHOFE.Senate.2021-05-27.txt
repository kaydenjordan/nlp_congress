 Mr. President, I have been down here a lot talking about  why we need to increase the defense budget: We face more threats than  ever before. China and Russia are investing more in modernizing their  militaries than ever before. We need to strengthen our alliances to  discourage our adversaries from acting, and the best way to back up our  friends is with a strong military.   These are all good reasons, but we have 2.2 million other reasons we  need to increase our defense budget: all the brave men and women who  serve our country in uniform.   May is Military Appreciation Month, and I could talk all day about  all the ways our servicemembers are the best in the world and how much  I appreciate them. But we shouldn't just talk about it; we need to show  these brave men and women just what they mean to us.   When I travel, I always eat in the mess halls with our troops--not  the officers, the enlisted men and women. When I do that, I get a real  sense of what our troops need to do their jobs and defend this country.  So I have a pretty good idea of what will show them our appreciation.  We should show them by providing adequate, consistent and stable  funding on time.   When budgets are delayed and defense spending is cut, you know who  feels it the most? Our troops. It hurts their morale. It hurts their  readiness. It hurts their families. It affects everything.   We should show them with more and better training that focuses on  their safety. We should show them by giving them modem weapons and  equipment that work and work well. We should show them by taking care  of their families, making sure their spouses have good employment  opportunities, their kids have access to high-quality childcare and  education, and they all have the best healthcare. We should show them  by giving them high-quality housing.   Over the last 2 years, this was my priority, and it will be this year  too. Senator Reed also understands this sacred duty we have.   The last two years, we have given our troops a pay raise of 3 percent  or more--some of the largest annual pay raises ever. We increased  hazardous duty pay by 10 percent last year; that is what we give our  troops in the most dangerous jobs. We have made changes to fix the  broken housing system because no servicemember should ever be living in  bad housing. We are continuing to keep an eye on this until all the  necessary fixes are in place, including the Housing Bill of Rights we  are waiting for. We have helped make sure military spouses have good  jobs, even when they move. We have focused on building a modern  healthcare system that works for our servicemembers and their families,  and we have prioritized mental healthcare for those who serve. I am  proud we have been able to do all this.   But here is the thing: Taking care of our troops--that is at least a  third of our defense budget right there. That is the right thing to do.  Our servicemembers are the backbone of our national security. It's also  the necessary thing to do for our All-Volunteer Force. No one is forced  to enlist anymore. The military needs to compete for our country's best  and brightest, and that takes money.   The troops lay everything on the line to defend our Nation. They  sacrifice time with their families and friends. As we remember each  year on Memorial Day, many make the ultimate sacrifice. There aren't  enough words to express our gratitude. That is why we have to show  them.   But the math of President Biden's budget doesn't add up when it comes  to taking care of our troops. Not when we have to do all these other  things--defend against more than one serious threat, support our allies  and partners, and take on new domains. We can do things to make things  more cost-effective for the taxpayer, but we can't go back on our  promises to those who agreed to serve. They are all volunteers, after  all.   So it concerns me when people talk about us spending more than China,  Russia, and other countries--it is just not true.   One of the reasons our defense budget is large is because we take  care of our people. China and Russia--they don't do that. They give  them a gun and tell them to fight. No one else takes care of their  people the way we do. That is why they don't have the caliber of people  we do. Our military personnel are the best in the world.   So yes, a strong military budget is about sending a message to our  enemies. It is about sending a message to our allies and partners. But  it is also about sending a message to our troops: that we are going to  take care of you and your families while you serve. We are going to  make sure you have what you need to defend this country--the equipment,  the training, the personnel, the weapons, the support.   President Biden's budget equals a cut to national defense. While we  are going to prioritize taking care of our troops they are going to  feel that cut somehow, someway, no matter what we do. We are asking  them to do more with less, and we have been asking them for decades  now.   There are things President Biden and I agree we need to do when it  comes to our national defense--keep the Indo-Pacific open and free,  enhance our cyber defense, innovate and modernize, and beyond. But  President Biden's got more on his list of things he wants to ask our  military to do--stuff that really falls outside the core mission of the  Department of Defense--and he is not even giving them more budget to do  it with. This is not a message we should send our troops. It is not  what they deserve.   One month for military appreciation--it is really not enough. But we  can show our troops our appreciation year-round by giving them the  budget they need, a budget with real growth to match the strategy they  are carrying out.                            ____________________
