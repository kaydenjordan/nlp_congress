 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.  Simpson).   Madam Chair, this amendment also makes a mockery of our laws that  govern the permitting process for mining operations and is a complete  violation of basic fairness.   Specifically, this amendment supersedes the Democrats' supposed  flagship environmental regulatory law, NEPA--unbelievable.   Currently, the Army Corps of Engineers is doing exactly what Congress  intended it to do under NEPA with regard to the proposed Pebble Mine  project. It is analyzing the environmental and socioeconomic  consequences of the proposed mine.   A wonderful adage is good process builds good policy, builds good  politics. We ought to embrace that. And if we really want to put our  nose in other places, maybe what we ought to do, as I challenge my good  friend from California, is, instead of focusing on this project, to  look at his State in his own district. Maybe he ought to be focusing on  the illegal marijuana farms in his district that are using pesticides  and polluting local waters and damaging national forests and our  plants.   This is something that is pertinent to Alaska, to the Member from  Alaska. The Tribes have been consulted. It is just that the one Tribe  that he is talking about, no process followed. But the people closest  to this that are most involved have been for this mine. They want good  process, and I oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
