 Thank you, Mr. President.   I say a special thanks to Senator Capito and all she has done, not  only in this area but in so many things that affect rural America,  certainly, being the cochair of the Rural Broadband Caucus. The list  goes on and on. We do appreciate her leadership.   Our Nation's opioid epidemic is, unfortunately, a subject we have  spoken about all too often here and in so many other places. It does  feel, however, that the tone and tenor of our remarks reflect a much  more hopeful outlook than many of our previous discussions have had.  That is because we are making progress in the fight.   Around this time last year, we came together to overwhelmingly pass a  comprehensive legislative package that was signed into law by President  Trump, Democrats and Republicans working together.   There has been a noticeable difference as a result of this  comprehensive reform. Law enforcement is now better equipped to stop  illegal opioids from reaching our communities, and efforts are being  stepped up at the border to cut off the influx of fentanyl from China.  More first responders have been trained to administer naloxone, which  has prevented opioid overdoses from claiming more lives in our  communities.   Most importantly, we have saved lives by increasing access to mental  health and addiction treatment services for those struggling to  overcome opioid dependence.   The treatment and recovery aspect of our strategy is the key. Federal  resources are being deployed nationwide to break the cycle of  addiction.   These grants are invaluable for the facilities that give those  struggling with addiction and their families new hope in the fight  against opioid abuse. From what I have seen firsthand at treatment  facilities in Arkansas, these efforts are indeed making a difference.  They are helping tremendously.   The impact of this national epidemic has been felt acutely in the  Natural State. According to the CDC, Arkansas had the second-highest  prescribing rate over recent years, enough for each Arkansan to have  one opioid prescription in his or her name.   It has taken a conscious effort by the State's medical community to  drive those numbers down by 12 percent over a 4-year period. Limiting  the amount of dangerous pain pills in circulation is a very positive  and much needed step, but what about all the expired, unused, and  unnecessary medications already in circulation?   That is where Arkansas Take Back comes in. Arkansas Prescription Drug  Take Back Day events happen twice a year at locations across the State.  These events are an opportunity for Arkansans to safely dispose of  unused or expired medications with no questions asked. They also serve  as an opportunity to further educate the public on the opioid epidemic  and the importance of proper disposal of medications.    The 18th Arkansas Take Back this past weekend was another in a long  line of successful events. According to Arkansas drug director Kirk  Lane, over 27,000 pounds of pills were collected at the nearly 200  event day locations and the 200-plus permanent drop boxes across the  State.   These events are a heavy lift on the part of many Arkansans. We  greatly appreciate the efforts of law enforcement agencies across the  State, as well as their partners--Rotary clubs, prevention resource  centers, Arkansas Department of Health, and so many others that carry  out Take Back Day events.   The hard work to organize these opportunities to properly dispose of  prescription medications is certainly worthwhile. Research has found  that the majority of opioid abusers get their drugs from friends and  family, often lifting pills from a familiar medicine cabinet. When you  tally the results from the previous events in the State, Arkansas ranks  third nationally in pounds collected per capita through Take Back. That  means there are fewer homes in Arkansas where unsecured medications can  get in the wrong hands.   I thank my colleagues for sharing similar success stories from events  in their States. It is important that we highlight these programs.  Anything we can do to get these dangerous drugs out of circulation  certainly can help save lives. It is also a valuable reminder that we  will all have a role to play in the fight to end the opioid crisis.  Prescription Drug Take Back Day is an easy way each one of us can  certainly do our part.   I yield the floor to my good friend Senator Hoeven, whose leadership  is also very important.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  Arkansas Black Hall of Fame Class 2019 and the contributions made by  the inductees to the African-American community and the State of  Arkansas.        The 2019 inductees are former legislators, business       leaders, entertainers, artists, and mentors. Their       accomplishments and accolades demonstrate how much of an       impact each has made in their fields, as well as on our       culture. Their historical significance is widely acknowledged       and bears out how deserving each honoree is of this       recognition.        Irma Hunter Brown served in the Arkansas House of       Representatives for 22 years and also went on to serve as a       State senator. She was the first African-American woman to       serve in either body of the Arkansas General Assembly.        Brown is also the president of the Friends of Haven of Rest       Cemetery, Inc., an organization dedicated to improving the       condition and appearances of the burial ground which serves       as a final resting place for several notable Black Arkansans,       including Daisy Gatson Bates, and contains a site       commemorating the 21 boys perished in the 1959 fire at the       Arkansas Negro Boys Industrial School in Wrightsville. In       2008, Brown and a group of Haven of Rest supporters started a       project to clean up and restore the cemetery as it is a       significant part of Arkansas history. The group is now the       Friends of Haven of Rest Cemetery, Inc., which is continuing       the fundraising and care for the cemetery grounds.        Wallace ``Wali'' Caradine was born in 1949 and grew up in       West Memphis. He was the first African American ever to       graduate from the Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design       at the University of Arkansas in 1974. Four years later, with       his partner Sam Young, he established his first business,       Design and Construction Associates. The business venture       eventually became one of Arkansas' largest minority-owned       contracting firms.        Architecture and design weren't only his profession; they       were his passion. In the mid-1990s, Caradine and Ron Bene       Woods formed Woods Caradine Architects. In 2007, he       established Caradine & Company, where he worked until his       retirement in early 2017. As an architect, Caradine left his       footprints in many places across Arkansas, designing several       notable facilities still in use today.        Wali Caradine was also dedicated to his community. He was a       mentor to many minority building contractors in central       Arkansas. In 1986, he founded the Arkansas Chapter of the       National Association of Minority Contractors. Between 2009       and 2013, Caradine was a member of central Arkansas advisory       committee for the University of Arkansas.        John Donley was born in Gould, AR, but has left his mark on       our country's entertainment industry. He is a producer,       executive, and an award-winning television writer.        Donley wrote for many of the most beloved comedies of the       1970s and `80s, including ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' ``Good       Times,'' and ``The Jeffersons.'' He won an NAACP Image Award       for his writing in an episode of ``Diff'rent Strokes.'' In       addition to writing for hit shows, Donley has also worked       with Hollywood stars such as Sinbad and Curtis Mayfield and       found a home at the big-name networks ABC and CBS. While he       clearly has the ability to make people laugh, John Donley       also uses his talent to unite audiences all over the country.        Ed Johnson has coached 27 players who went on to play in       the National Football League; however, his impact on the       Little Rock community and the United States goes beyond the       field. Coach Johnson is a Vietnam war veteran whose service       is marked by two Purple Heart Awards, a Bronze Star Award,       and Presidential Citations.        Upon returning home in 1971, Coach Johnson helped organize       the Sunset Youth Sports Program in Little Rock and by the       next year had formed the Sunset Tigers Football Team. While       he is passionate about his role as a football coach, Johnson       uses this position to change kids' lives off of the field.       Coach Ed Johnson has served the Little Rock community for 48       years and is believed to be the longest serving active       community youth football coach in Arkansas.        Kristin Lewis is a native of Little Rock and a globally       recognized lyrico-spinto soprano. She graduated from the       University of Central Arkansas in 1999 with a bachelor's       degree in vocal performance and also received a master's       degree from the University of Knoxville in 2002. Since then,       she has performed in many prestigious venues, including the       Vienna State Opera, the Berlin State Opera, and the Teatro       San Carlo in Naples.        She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in       January 2019. Lewis has been widely praised for her       performances. Her talents have also been recognized with       several awards, including the Orazio Tosi Prize from Parma       Lirica in 2012, Savonlinna Opera Festival's Artist of the       Year in 2010, and the Ferrucio Tagliavini International       Singing Competition in 2005.        Lewis's first musical environment was within her family.       Having this insight into the role of environment to enhance       and develop one's talents, she established the Kristin Lewis       Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit corporation that fosters the       development of young singers through competition and       scholarships. Foundation activities, including fundraising       events and vocal competitions, are hosted in central       Arkansas. Lewis is also very active in humanitarian work  [[Page S6297]]       outside of the U.S., being an ambassador for the Red Cross in       Austria and supporter of Animal Care Austria.        Roscoe Robinson is an acclaimed artist across both the       gospel and R&B genres. He has performed with popular gospel       groups such as the Highway Q.C.'s, the Fairfield Four, Five       Blind Boys of Mississippi, the Blind Boys of Alabama, and the       Five Trumpets. Though he was successful in the gospel       community, his talents did not stop there.        Through the 1980s, Roscoe also recorded a number of popular       rhythm and blues songs. Roscoe is originally from Dermott,       AR, but his talents have touched the souls of fans across       Arkansas and America.        Each of these inductees has earned a place of honor as a       result of the lives they have lived and the work they have       done over many years. The Arkansas Black Hall of Fame Class       of 2019 is clearly an exemplary group, and I congratulate       each member and their loved ones, who have also been on their       journeys, on this tremendous recognition.                            ____________________
