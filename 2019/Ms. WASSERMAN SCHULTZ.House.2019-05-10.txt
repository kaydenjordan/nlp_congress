 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise in support the underlying legislation.   Madam Chair, H.R. 2157 totals $17.3 billion in emergency disaster  appropriations to provide relief and recovery assistance for Americans  affected by recent hurricanes.   The MilCon/VA portion of the bill provides $860.4 million for  Department of Defense military construction needs and the Department of  Veterans Affairs.   Specifically, the bill includes $115 million for the Marine Corps to  begin planning for construction projects related to the devastation  from Hurricanes Florence and Michael on Marine Corps facilities in  North Carolina (New River, Cherry Point, and Lejeune).   The Marine Corps is planning facility consolidation efforts resulting  from the hurricanes' damage, and this funding represents the first step  in that rebuilding process.   Madam Chair, the bill also includes $700 million to begin rebuilding  Tyndall Air Force Base in my home State of Florida. This funding will  support the relocation of the F-22 mission, the beddown of F-35s, and  the planning for construction of new facilities. This funding is a  vital first step to begin the rebuild of Tyndall.   Madam Chair, I also want to point out that this funding for Tyndall  in North Carolina is a downpayment because Congress is going to need to  provide much more than this to get these locations back up on their  feet.  [[Page H3690]]    Madam Chair, these events happened 6 months ago, and yet the first  supplemental request to be submitted by the administration is not to  address natural disasters; it was for border needs.   I am astounded that the administration continues to ignore these real  emergencies which clearly should have been addressed months ago, and I  am proud that the Democratic majority is doing just that today.   I urge all Members of this body to cast a ``yes'' vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, I toured Tyndall Air Force Base a  couple of months ago with Congressman Dunn. I commend the gentleman for  offering this amendment, and I have enjoyed working with him on making  sure that we can prioritize this vital funding. I appreciate the  ranking member and Chairwoman Lowey's support.   Congressman Lawson also joined us in February to survey the  devastating damage Tyndall sustained because of Hurricane Michael. It  was very clear to me, back in February, that Tyndall urgently needs  supplemental funds to rebuild.    Tyndall Air Force Base, which is in my home State as well,  encompasses 29,000 acres in southeastern Dade County. Within the base,  facilities amount to a total replacement value of $3.48 billion.   Tyndall accounts for 37 percent of Dade County's economy. The base  serves a population of 3,393 Active military personnel, as well as  9,383 retirees from all service branches.   The supplemental before us contains $700 million for ``Military  Construction, Air Force'' for planning and design and construction as  requested by the Air Force to support relocation of F-22s, F-35  beddown, and facilities necessary to begin the rebuilding of the  installation. That number is now outdated and must be increased to meet  the Air Force's needs.   The Dunn amendment, plus what is currently included in the  supplemental, is a good first step to helping Tyndall rebuild and get  back on its feet.   I am also pleased the gentleman from Florida included funds for the  Marine Corps. As all of us know, North Carolina was hit by Hurricane  Florence, which devastated all of the Marine Corps facilities in North  Carolina.   The Marine Corps community continues to face daily challenges  following Hurricane Florence. Although the storm made landfall on  December 14, 2018, marines at Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air Station  New River, and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point are still  recovering.   Camp Lejeune, New River, and Cherry Point heavily contribute to  Marine Corps readiness, and Camp Lejeune is home to the Second Marine  Expeditionary Force, which oversees and maintains a third of the Marine  Corps' combat operating power. Several headquarters buildings, training  facilities, and aircraft hangars were affected by Hurricane Florence.   While II MEF is now able to meet operational commitments, its  training environments remain degraded. Currently, marines are working  in compromised facilities and temporary trailers. Furthermore, marines  headed to Camp Lejeune are being told to look for housing off base due  to a lack of availability of on-base housing and substantial damage  caused by the storm.   Like the Air Force number, the Marine Corps number is also now  outdated. I support the $385 million increase to this account, as well.   The Trump administration, unfortunately, still has not submitted an  emergency supplemental for these and other disasters. Frankly, these  facilities need relief, and they need it now.                                time  1015    It has been over 200 days since Hurricane Michael and Florence  devastated North Carolina and Florida. It should not be taking this  long to provide the necessary and vital funding to these locations.   Stunningly, I want to repeat, the President has not even proposed  emergency supplemental funding for these disasters, and this morning,  actually had the gall to urge Republicans to vote against this vital  legislation.   Madam Chair, I urge all Members to support the Dunn amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am a strong supporter of our  armed forces. I fully support the rebuilding of Tyndall Air Force Base  and the North Carolina Marine Corps Bases and urge Members to support  the Dunn amendment. I commend the gentleman for his advocacy for his  community and for our home State, as well as the underlying legislation  so we can make sure that we can finally help these military communities  rebuild.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
