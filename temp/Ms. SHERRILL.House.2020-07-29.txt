 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman DeLauro for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today not just as a representative of New  Jersey's 11th District, but also as a working mom with four children--a  mom who knows how important childcare is for our families, our  businesses, and our communities.   I have long said it is critical to have women serving in Congress to  legislate on these important issues, and it has been my own  experience--as I try to ensure that my children are doing their  schoolwork while I am attending Zoom meetings, conference calls, and  working to serve the families throughout the 11th District--that has  led me to call experts to discuss the challenges to providing safe  childcare during the pandemic.   It is my experience now, as I try to piece together childcare between  my husband and my two sisters and myself, and trying to come down to  Washington to vote, that informs my understanding of what is going on  across the Nation.   Before the pandemic, 5 million children and their families relied on  childcare. How we address this childcare crisis will have deep  reverberations throughout our economy and on the health and safety of  our families and our workers. Without the proper support for childcare  to open safely and effectively, there will be no real reopening for  much of the workforce.   Without proper childcare options, that means childcare facilities  that have the money to implement health and safety precautions  necessary to protect children and workers, women will be forced to  choose between staying home or going back to work. If childcare is  scarce or feels unsafe, moms will be staying home in the vast majority  of cases.   In fact, an economist at Northwestern University who studies the  gendered impact of the pandemic, noted that 19 million children live in  single-parent households, 70 percent of which are led by single moms.  If women have to leave the workforce or cut back hours, these decisions  will have long-lasting impacts on the future of their careers, salary,  promotions, equitable pay, and the economic security of their families.   I have heard from leaders in research institutions who have said that  while men are submitting research papers at a faster clip than ever,  their female counterparts have not. They attribute this to the burden  of childcare that rests on women without access to childcare services.                                time  1130
