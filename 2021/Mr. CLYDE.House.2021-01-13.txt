 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the effort to  impeach President Trump. This course of action will only increase  dissent and disunity across our country, and it flies in the face of  all efforts to heal our Nation.   Quite simply, it is a shameful final act of political retribution,  retribution this President has weathered since day one.   I have no doubt that those who breached the Capitol will have due  process and their day in court. However, there will be no investigation  in the people's House into whether the allegation against the President  meets the criteria for a crime worthy of impeachment. No evidence was  presented. No witness testified. No cross-examination was conducted. No  due process was afforded. That sets an extremely dangerous precedent  for the future.   If my Democratic colleagues were serious in their efforts to get to  the truth, they would convene the House Judiciary Committee and  investigate, but they are not.   And so I am proud to stand before you today to defend our President  from the injustices my Democratic colleagues are so giddy to pursue. I  oppose this effort to impeach the President and ask all Members of the  House to do the same.
