 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and the  legacy of Mr. Gary Fletcher.   Gary Fletcher embodied everything it means to be a west Texan: hard  work, God-fearing, and service oriented. He lived a life of service  before self, with a steadfast commitment to his family, his country,  and his community.   He was an Amarillo-born hero who joined the U.S. Army in 1968. He  served his country in the worst of times, during the Vietnam conflict,  providing lifesaving medical care to countless young men who would have  never returned home otherwise.   He was decorated for his service with the National Defense Service  Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign  Medal.   Mr. Fletcher later returned home to the Texas Panhandle and built a  successful career as a banker and rancher and was a well-respected  citizen in his community.   He was also an active member of the Washington Avenue Christian  Church and a longtime volunteer for organizations like the United Way  and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.   He left behind an incredible legacy that will be carried on by his  loving family, and now he will be forever memorialized through today's  congressional action.  [[Page H8489]]    I humbly ask my colleagues to vote in favor of my bill to officially  name the U.S. Post Office in Canyon, Texas, the Gary James Fletcher  Post Office Building.
