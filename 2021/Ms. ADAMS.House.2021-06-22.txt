 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his extraordinary work in this area. And I am a proud cosponsor of the  Equality Act.   Madam Speaker, I am Alma Adams, and my pronouns are she, her, and  hers. Tonight, I rise during Pride Month to honor some of the many  LGBTQ elected officials who are working to make North Carolina a more  equal and inclusive State.   Last week was Charlotte Black Pride Week, so I am happy to say that  North Carolina's 12th Congressional District, which I represent, is  home to LaWana Mayfield, who made history in 2011 as Charlotte's first  openly gay elected official. Since then, Al Austin and Billy Maddalon  joined her as LGBT members of the Charlotte City Council.   In Davidson, Jane Campbell, a retired captain in the United States  Navy, serves on the Davidson Town Commission. And Charlotte's John  Arrowood made history as the first openly LGBT judge on North  Carolina's Court of Appeals.   All of these individuals put themselves forward for public service  because they know that we can't sleep on fairness and equal rights. And  I am working hard as an ally in Congress, alongside members of my  congressional office, supporting the LGBTQ community, and I promise to  continue to fight for their rights.   I wish everyone across our country happy Pride. Now go forth and  continue to fight because we can't wait for equality; we have to win  it.
