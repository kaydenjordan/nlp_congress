 Mr. Speaker, I ran to the floor when I heard that our  Members on the Republican side of the aisle are trying to use as an  excuse we have not had a hearing. Oh, yes. You have had a hearing. You  have had a hearing from the American people who are shocked that the  President and DeJoy are out there dismantling and destroying our Postal  Service.  [[Page H4279]]    For 3 years I warned the American people and my colleagues that this  President was a threat to our democracy. Yet, here we are today voting  on a measure to save the Postal Service because it is being sabotaged  by a desperate President in order to cheat in the 2020 elections.   Since our country's founding, the people have relied on the Postal  Service for everything from delivery of letters to our seniors wanting  their medicines delivered on time. Veterans want their disability  checks on time. Social Security recipients want and need their money.   So I want to say to the Members on the opposite side of the aisle:  You had better get some courage. If you are afraid of the President,  you had better step up to the plate on this. We will not allow the  United States Postal Service to be destroyed by you.   And another message to the President: Stop removing our blue  mailboxes from our neighborhoods.
