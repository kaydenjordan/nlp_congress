 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in direct support  of our most critical ally, Israel.   Rarely in history has the strategic alliance between two nations been  more meaningful and necessary to the pursuit of worldwide stability  than the modern partnership between the United States and Israel.   I believe the recipe for a lasting relationship between our two  nations and achieving stability in the region in pursuit of peace, is  comprised of the following key tenets.   Number one, maximum foreign military funds from the U.S. to Israel  with a focus on providing Israel a qualitative military edge.   Number two, an undivided Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.   Number three, the Golan Heights must remain under the control of  Israel.   Number four, the worldwide elimination of boycott divestment and  sanctions against Israel and Jewish communities here in the U.S. Such  practices are blatantly anti-Semitic.   Number five, prosecution of and defense against mutual threats to  Israel in the United States. Any threats to Israel should be treated as  a threat to the United States.   Number six, we cannot allow a nuclear-capable Iran, and we should not  reenter the JCPOA nuclear deal.   Mr. Speaker, I have seen war firsthand. War is an ugly thing, but  failing to unequivocally support an ally as critical as Israel in  pursuit of worldwide stability is the ugliest of things, especially at  a time like this when stability worldwide is eroding in front of us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress and this administration to fully support  Israel.
