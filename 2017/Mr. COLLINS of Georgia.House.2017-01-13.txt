 Mr. Speaker, today, we come and find this one  truism: ObamaCare showed that a Federal Government takeover of health  care is not in the best interest of addressing our healthcare system.   Today, we are going to be taking a closer look at the top three  ObamaCare failures: premiums have gone up, not down; instead of lowered  costs, healthcare prices have gone up; and people have less choice than  ever before.   Before we examine these, let's remember how we got here. There seems  to be some selective amnesia on this floor. It was after months of  backroom deals, in the middle of the night, last-minute deals, and  without giving the American people enough time to even read the bill.  That is not what is going to happen this time. Republicans are going to  do what we said we would do: listen to the American people.   We are going to do this right, with input from our neighbors, the  folks we go to church with, and our families and our communities. We  are not going to pull the rug out from under anyone.   We have listened to our constituents, and what we are hearing over  and over again are the same three failures: premiums have gone up, not  down; instead of lowered costs, healthcare prices went up; and people  have less choice than ever before, which, in many cases, is no choice  at all. This is a failure, Mr. Speaker, and it is time to end.                            ____________________
