 Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Blackburn and  myself, a Vanderbilt alumnus, we would like to congratulate the  Vanderbilt University bowling team on winning the National Collegiate  Athletic Association--NCAA--championship, the third national  championship for the women's bowling program and the sixth national  championship in Commodore athletic history.   The Commodores were a dominating force during the 2022-2023 season,  compiling a 98-29 record and winning four tournament championships  including a regional NCAA crown. Five team members earned All-America  honors with Mabel Cummins, a neuroscience senior, being named the  national player of the year. The team earned an outstanding 3.559 GPA  and placed seven members on the Dean's List.   This achievement would not have been possible without the hard work,  talent, and teamwork of the following outstanding student athletes:  Alyssa Ballard, Kailee Channell, Mabel Cummins, Kaylee Hitt, Amelia  Kiefer, Jennifer Loredo, Amanda Naujokas, Paige Peters, Caroline  Thesier, and Victoria Varano.   John Williamson, the head coach of the Vanderbilt bowling team, was  named the national coach of the year for the fourth time and has led  the program since its inception in 2004. Over the past 19 years, Coach  Williamson has transformed Commodore bowling into one of the Nation's  finest, winning both on the lanes and in the classroom. Coach  Williamson should also be commended for combining athletic excellence  with academics as well as international service experiences.   These student athletes were coached and mentored by a dedicated team  of coaches and athletic department staff, including: head coach John  Williamson, associate head coach Josie Barnes, deputy athletic director  Dr. Kristene Kelly, associate athletic trainer Alda Burston, associate  director of strength and conditioning Darren Edginton, assistant  director of event management Renee Mackin, assistant director of  student services Max Martin, sports dietitian Jasmine Gilbert, and head  of athletic communications Rod Williamson.   We would also like to acknowledge the outstanding leadership of  Vanderbilt University athletic director Candice Storey Lee, an alumna  and former Vanderbilt women's basketball player.   Congratulations, Commodores. We are proud of you.                            ____________________
