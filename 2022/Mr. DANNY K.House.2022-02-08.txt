 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I commend the  chairwoman of this committee and ranking member for bringing this very  important bipartisan bill to the floor.   I associate myself with many of the comments that have been made by  colleagues on both sides, but I also remember when Chicago, the third  largest city in the United States of America, believed that its Postal  Service was the best thing it had going. We took great pride in it.  That has not been the case for the last several years.   And so we are coming to this point today where we can restore the  viability of our Postal Service. I also worked at the post office. It  was my first real job. And we had a saying: ``Clean hands, gentle  touch, surely we owe a letter that much.'' We will restore that.    DAVIS of Illinois introduced a bill (H.R.               6652) for the relief of Reverend Olusegun Samson               Olaoye; which was referred to the Committee on the               Judiciary.                            ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois:         H.R. 6652.         Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant       to the following:        Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 of the Constitution: To       make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for       carrying into Execution the powers enumerated under section 8       and all other Powers vested by the Constitution in the       Government of the United States, or in any Department or       Officer thereof.
