 Mr. President, we have been talking here in the Senate  for months now about what needs to be done to respond to COVID-19.  Right now, we are debating behind the scenes a fifth bill dealing with  COVID-19. We have already passed four through the House and the Senate  that the President has signed.   Many Americans know the effects of those previous bills. They have  received deposits from the Treasury of $1,200, and they have received  assistance from the Paycheck Protection Program. Their schools have  received assistance. Their hospitals have received assistance. Their  States have received assistance. Their local jurisdictions have  received assistance. There has been wide support in multiple areas--for  housing and for health, for testing and for vaccines. All of those  things have happened in the previous four bills.   Yet, when we passed the last set of bills, there was a lot of thought  about what would happen next. How would the virus spread? How long  would this last? Would Americans continue to just stay sequestered in  their homes, away from everyone else?   Now, after months of dealing with this COVID-19, not only in the  United States but globally, we know a lot more about not only how we  are going to respond and treat the disease but also about what we are  dealing with, for COVID-19 doesn't affect everyone in the same way  health-wise or economically.   There are some people who get COVID-19, and they, literally, never  know it--they experience no symptoms at all--while others end up in a  hospital, in the ICU, or on ventilators. There are even fatalities.   Economically, we are at the same spot with COVID-19. Some businesses  in America and some individuals in America are, literally, making more  money now than they ever have before. They are in one of those  businesses that is in high need--maybe home improvement. Since lots of  folks are staying at home, they are doing home improvements. The price  of lumber has skyrocketed and the price for replacement windows. All  kinds of people are installing pools at their homes. They aren't going  on vacation this year. So they are doing things to fix up their homes.  Construction and home improvement have skyrocketed. Retail sales and  craft businesses and things to do at home have skyrocketed.   A lot of other businesses that we have seen have actually increased  dramatically, not just grocery stores and department stores and such,  but online retailers. They are doing really good business. In my State,  the incomes from many small towns to their communities are higher now  than they ever were in the history of their cities because people  aren't driving to other towns to shop. They are staying at home and are  shopping locally or online. So that tax revenue is going back to the  cities. Literally, they are doing better now than they ever have done.   For other communities and other businesses, there have been horrible  effects during this time period, if you are a hotel or a convention  center or a restaurant that surrounds a convention center. If the  businesses deal with travel, transportation, or vacations, all of those  are struggling horribly during this time period, and there are multiple  others.   Here is the challenge that we have: Should our response now be the  same as it was in March--to just pretend that this has struck everyone  exactly the same--or should we pay attention to the realities  economically around the country?   I think we should be more strategic and understand that what we are  spending is other people's money. It is not just printed monopoly money  that we can just throw out of here. It is debt on our future or it is,  literally, taking money from the person next door or from your house.   So what do we need to do in a bill, and what are the needs at this  point?   Some of them are very obvious. For the next bill that is coming, we  need to focus in on vaccines, tests, and therapeutics.   What are we going to do with telehealth? How are we going to be able  to help?   This is, first and foremost, a health crisis, and it is amazing to me  the  [[Page S4891]]  number of topics that are being discussed for the next bill that have  nothing to do with COVID-19--nothing to do with it.   My friends on the other side of the aisle came forward with the  Heroes Act--a great name. It is a $3 trillion bill, and a full $1  trillion of it has nothing to do with COVID-19. Unrelated completely is  $1 trillion of it because it is a big bill, and we want to get other  things in. We want to just throw it in there.   Why don't we start with this as a health crisis, and let's focus in  on the health issues there--vaccines, testing, therapeutics,  telehealth. What can we do for rural hospitals? What needs to happen at  urban and suburban hospitals? Those are basic questions that should be  there.   One of the most successful programs that we put forward in the CARES  Act was the Paycheck Protection Program. Now that it has had its  headlines, as some folks have said, there are people who have abused  it. Well, welcome to government. Every single program that comes out of  government will be abused by someone at some time.   We have seen that in the unemployment system. Unemployment insurance  has gone out, and it has been widely abused. Well, so have some  portions of the Paycheck Protection Program, but we have all seen the  long lines at unemployment offices around the country. The reason this  was put in place--the Paycheck Protection Program--was to do whatever  we could to help shorten those lines at unemployment offices, for  people to not have to leave and go on unemployment but to stay  connected to their small business or not-for-profit. That has worked.   In my State, 65,000 businesses and nonprofits have taken advantage of  the Paycheck Protection Program--about $5.5 billion of assistance just  in my State.   But there are some things that need to be dealt with. The forgiveness  system on it is just coming out--much delayed, much to our frustration,  but there are some straightforward things that can be done.   If you are an entity with a loan that is $150,000 or less, there  should be a very straightforward process of testimonial--a single page  to fill out to complete this. We want to see this.   We want to see businesses with the highest need--let's say businesses  with a 35-, 40-percent, 50-percent--some of them, 70-, 75-percent loss  in revenue from the previous year should have an eligibility to get  through this.   Now, some businesses took the Paycheck Protection Program, and they  had a 5-percent loss over last year. To me, that is fine because at the  beginning of this, no one knew who was going to survive. Many of those  business owners were in the process of saying: I am going to have to  lay everyone off or I can keep them on the Paycheck Protection Program.  They kept them on the Paycheck Protection Program and that helped those  families have a stable time, where they knew where their check was  coming from. It helped those businesses reopen, and many of them are  reopening now. It kept them off the unemployment assistance.   Now, if we do a second round of paycheck protection, it really needs  to be focused in on those businesses that are significantly off on  revenue that will not survive without some additional help.   We need to be attentive to how we actually handle this and be more  strategic. We are not in the same situation that we were in March.   We need to also look at businesses that were funded with private  equity. It makes no sense to me that if a business started and got  their loan from a bank, they can get a Paycheck Protection Program, but  if they got their capital from private equity, they are not eligible  for this.   The employees that work there don't know where the capital came from  to start the business; they just know they work there. But for some  reason, there is a continual pushback to say: Well, if they were funded  with private equity rather than a bank, then they are evil. No, they  are startup companies doing technology, innovation, healthcare. Those  are the kinds of companies that are out there that are being funded  with private equity, but yet we have told their employees: You can just  go to unemployment, and, literally, the business next door to them: No,  you get paycheck protection. That makes no sense. We should fix that.   We should put into this next bill some help for schools that are  reopening. Now, not every school is reopening. They are not going to  need the same level of help. Some schools are not reopening or they are  choosing not to. I understand that. We gave additional funds--$30  billion of funds--across the country from the previous CARES Act to  help schools transition to online learning, to help them get through  the process of finding cleaning supplies, do additional training. That  was $30 billion that was sent out to do that.   Additional dollars should be helping those schools that are reopening  that will have additional expenses. They are going to have to run  additional bus routes to make sure they keep kids separate. They are  going to have to do A and B schedules to open up their classrooms.  There are going to be greater expenses for them, so we should help  those schools that are reopening through the process. That is common  sense in this.   There has been a big request for an additional assistance check for  those that need additional assistance. There are some families who are  struggling to make their payments and are going to be evicted.   The $1,200 that was sent out earlier this year went out to help stop  that early in the year, and some families are still unemployed and  still struggling through this. What are we going to do to help them?   There are some strategic ways to get out some additional assistance,  but we should target it to those families of greatest need, and that  should be the same with their unemployment assistance.   Unemployment assistance passed in March. There was an additional $600  per week, per person that was sent out on unemployment assistance in  addition to the normal State unemployment assistance.   For many individuals in my State, that meant you made more on  unemployment than you did on employment. That is a problem long term.  Now, this program was set up to be short term; that it would be  assistance through the end of July, which has now passed. It was a week  ago. But individuals applying for unemployment assistance this week are  still getting unemployment assistance in my State, exactly as they were  in February of this year, exactly as they were in November of last  year, exactly as they were in August of last year. Unemployment  assistance is still happening in my State, just like it is happening in  every other State.   But the debate is, do we want to go above and beyond unemployment  assistance that literally takes people to the spot where they make more  staying at home than they do at work?   Now, there are some folks who are saying: Well, that doesn't actually  deincentivize work. Really? Tell that to the folks whom I have talked  to who work in manufacturing, who are there at the job working every  day, and the person who usually works a pod away from them is at home  because they have talked to them, and they are saying: I will come back  once my unemployment goes away.   So this person is busting their tail working, making less than the  person who is staying at home, and the person staying at home is  telling their friend: I will come back when the benefits run out. That  is not right for either one of those folks. That tells that person  working: You are a sucker for not just staying home and getting  somebody else's money.   We should not incentivize for not working. We should help people get  through a very difficult time, and that is what this is, but not  discourage engagement in work. That is not fair to the guy or the lady  who is still working. That is not fair to the employer that has opened  up and saying: I have got jobs available but no one will apply. And  that is not right for that family who is staying home, taking money  from their neighbors, when they know they could come back and work.    Now, the law says that if you are offered a job and you are on  unemployment, you have to take it. But we know of way too many cases  already where individuals are not taking the job they are offered, and  the employer knows it is one of their employees who is a good employee,  and they want  [[Page S4892]]  them to come back, so they hate to turn them in. So it puts everyone in  a quandary--the employer and the employee because the employee is  breaking the law by staying home, teaching their family to do the wrong  thing, because it gets them more money. We shouldn't put them in that  spot, and we shouldn't encourage people to be in that spot.   In this bill, we should deal with unemployment, but we should make  sure we are helping people through this season, not incentivizing them  to break the law.   We should deal with nursing care and senior living. We should deal  with hospital care in this bill. Those are the areas that have been the  hardest hit in all of America. The largest number of fatalities that we  have had and the greatest amount of expense are in that area. We should  do something to come alongside them.   We should do something in this bill about liability protections. I  have letters and phone calls from universities in my State and from  businesses in my State saying they are terrified to reengage for fear  of what is going to happen with lawsuits coming in the days ahead that  they can't stop.   They want to be able to serve their students at school, they want to  be able to serve their customers in their business and the families who  depend on that, but they are afraid of an entrepreneurial lawyer that  will file lawsuits and will push them to settle or push them into  bankruptcy at a very difficult time for them, only because this body  will not step up and do basic liability protections.   Now, if there is gross negligence, we should never protect that  company. But if they are doing the best that they can, why wouldn't we  have basic liability protections for our universities, our schools, and  our places of business?   We need to have in this bill some help for the postal system. There  is a lot of debate about what that should be. Is it total reform of the  postal system? No, that is not what this is about. But just like we  helped the State Department in the CARES Act, we should help USPS in  this bill as well.   We have had some pushback on helping some of the areas on  immigration. Many of the entities in immigration are totally fee-based.  When someone applies to come into the country with our visa system,  they pay a fee to do that. Well, obviously, they are not coming in  right now, so those areas of our immigration policy are really  struggling right now. We should come alongside and help. That is a  unique situation in a Federal agency.   We should deal with election issues--maybe not like some people in  this body want. In the CARES Act, we included $350 million to the  States to help them in their elections for this fall--$350 million.  Almost none of that has been used by States because in the bill itself  it also required the State legislatures to add matching dollars to be  able to come into session, and when we put that out from this body,  those State legislatures were going out of session or they were locking  down because they didn't know what their expenses would be. So almost  no one has taken those funds because their legislature wasn't in  session to vote for it and because they didn't have any ability to  anticipate what funds would be needed this session, and so there is  $350 million of unused money from the last bill that we should just  take the strings off of and make it clear to States: You could use  these funds for the election coming up this fall.   Now, there is a big push to say: Let's add another $350 million. Come  on, people. Let's read the last bill that we wrote and bring it forward  into this bill and fix the problems from the last one. It shouldn't be  that difficult.   Our States are going to need help on the elections this year. There  will be much greater expenses, but we want the election to go smoothly.  We have already allocated them the dollars. Let's allow them to  actually use it in a way that they can during this session.   But that shouldn't be for just mass mailing of every ballot. Just  printing off ballots and mailing it to every house doesn't solve the  issue; it complicates the issue. But we should help people with their  election systems.   And while I speak on State funding, this whole issue of State funding  does need to be addressed. During the CARES Act that passed in March,  this body gave the States $150 billion. There was also an allocation  for healthcare of $260 billion. There was an allocation for education  of $30 billion. Why do I bring that up?   The three most expensive aspects in any State budget are education,  public safety, and healthcare. Those are the three most expensive  portions from any State budget.   This body allocated $260 billion toward healthcare, $30 billion  toward education, $150 billion toward public safety and COVID expenses.   Just to put that in perspective, the total budget for every State in  America is $900 billion. Every State's total budget combined spending  that they do in a year--$900 billion.   My Democratic colleagues want us to give almost $1 trillion to the  States for COVID expenses. The total budget for every State in the  entire country for the entire year is just over $900 billion, and they  are going to give $1 trillion to them on top of it. That is more than  replacing every State budget in America. That is absurd, and that is  why these negotiations are so difficult--because it is not reasonable.   They can just throw a number out and say everybody needs this.  Replacing the budget of every State in America is reasonable? I don't  think so, especially when we have already allocated $260 billion toward  healthcare, $30 billion toward education, and $150 billion toward  public safety and COVID response.   The real issue is with the public safety and the COVID expenses  because so many of the States--now with this whole ``defund the  police'' movement--don't want to allocate their public safety dollars  toward public safety. They want to be able to use it for other things,  not public safety.   Well, that is a decision States can make, but they have the  flexibility already to use those dollars. Literally, they could pay for  every single law enforcement officer in their State--their salary and  their benefits would be fully taken care of--but they are saying: I  don't want to pay our law enforcement. I want to use it for other  things. Well, those funds have been allocated, and they need to make a  decision on what they are going to do with it.   Now, there is a lot that could be done with this bill, but my  challenge for us is, let's focus on the things that are essential to be  done, not the long wish list of what people want to cram into a bill  because it is getting big, and they can hide something in it.   Let's keep it focused and let's continue to remember this is a health  crisis and it is a season during which we should work across the aisle  to solve things that are common sense and not ignore the problem.
