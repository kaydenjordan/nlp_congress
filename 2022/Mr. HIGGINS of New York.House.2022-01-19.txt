 Madam Speaker, the bipartisan Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs law will invest more than $14 billion this year  alone in the Nation's ports and waterways.   In my community, this will provide $10 million for Times Beach Nature  Preserve on Buffalo's Outer Harbor to preserve and improve the natural  habitats and parkland.   Once a dumping ground for contaminated Buffalo River sludge, today  Times Beach is a vibrant 55-acre home for wildlife and a destination  for visitors.   This funding will support work by the United States Army Corps,  Buffalo District to fortify the breakwater at  [[Page H229]]  Times Beach, to help restore public access that was lost in storm  damage 2 years ago, and to reduce the influence of that kind of damage  from happening in the future.   This funding builds on previous Federal Great Lakes and  infrastructure investments that are transforming Buffalo's waterfront  and revitalizing the western New York community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.  452, the Willie O'Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act.   Willie O'Ree, which has been already said, was a trailblazer for  hockey both on and off the ice. He was to the National Hockey League  what Jackie Robinson was to Major League Baseball.   As the first Black player in the National Hockey League, he endured  racism, bigotry, and prejudice from both players and fans. Despite  this, he played more than two decades in the National Hockey League and  in the minor leagues developing his skills and later becoming the  National Hockey League's diversity ambassador.   Willie O'Ree broke down historic barriers and paved the way for young  athletes in marginalized communities. In 2012, he visited my community  for the Willie O'Ree Skills Weekend hosted by the National Hockey  League Buffalo Sabres. Today we honor his dedication to improving  diversity and accessibility in sports which makes him most deserving of  this high honor.   He is an inspiration to all athletes, and particularly to young  athletes of color in western New York and throughout the Nation. I  strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.                                time  1315
