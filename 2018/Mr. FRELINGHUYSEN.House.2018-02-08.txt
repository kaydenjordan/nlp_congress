 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the further discussion of H.R. 1892.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 734, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to  provide for the flying of the flag at half-staff in the event of the  death of a first responder in the line of duty, with the Senate  amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment thereto, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to present the Senate amendment to  the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892, a bipartisan,  bicameral bill outlining the funding for the next 2 fiscal years and  funding for the government through March 23, providing much needed  emergency supplemental funding for disaster recovery, and raising the  Nation's debt ceiling.   This legislation will help our Nation move forward without the threat  of a shutdown or default and with greater budget scrutiny. This bill  will also allow us to move past the destructive cycle of continuing  resolutions, which undermine the appropriations process and promotes  only more uncertainty and doubt about our government's and this  Congress' ability to function and to meet the needs of those we  represent.   I am pleased that this legislation includes an agreement reached on a  bipartisan basis by House and Senate leaders on spending caps for both  fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019.   Especially important is a substantial increase in funds for national  defense. Our Nation faces multiple security challenges and increasingly  aggressive, not to mention well equipped, adversaries. We must be  prepared to meet these challenges, and we must take care of our men and  women in uniform who truly do the work of freedom.   After years of reduction in military funding and months of  uncertainty caused by continuing resolutions, it is time we provide our  Armed Forces with what they need to rebuild and keep our Nation safe.   The agreement also outlines investments in important bipartisan  domestic priorities such as fighting the opioid abuse epidemic,  supporting veterans, and rebuilding and renewing our infrastructure  around the Nation.   These top line spending levels will enable us to get to work  immediately on our 12 appropriations bills to wrap up the fiscal year  2018 and quickly turn our attention to fiscal year 2019.   This legislation also includes a short term continuing resolution,  our last for this year, which will fund the Federal Government through  March 23. This will maintain programs and services that all Americans  depend on until all of the annual appropriations bills can be enacted.  I look forward to working with our Senate counterparts to negotiate and  complete all of these bills ahead of that deadline.   In addition to these critical pieces of government funding, this  legislation also provides $89.3 billion in emergency disaster funding,  funding that has been urgently needed since this House passed its  version in December. This funding will provide the residents of Texas,  Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Western States with the  resources to rebuild their lives after last year's historic and  devastating natural disasters.   Lastly, this bill increases the debt limit through March 1, 2019, so  we can pay our bills and avoid the economic damage of a default.   Mr. Speaker, the Senate has just passed this bill, and now it is up  to this House to do the same and to send this legislation to the  President for his signature.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill and reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins), a member of our  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have the right to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.  [[Page H1071]]     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday, February 13, 2018,  when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from  the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 1301) making appropriations for the  Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017,  and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur  in the Senate amendment.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from  the Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 104)  providing for a correction in the enrollment of H.R. 1892, with the  Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 36 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  February 13, 2018, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
