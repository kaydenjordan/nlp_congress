 Madam Speaker, I am in Washington to continue to fight  for Utah's business owners and our working families affected by the  coronavirus.   The Paycheck Protection Program was designed to help small businesses  stay afloat and to keep employees on the payroll.   Utah financial lenders processed more than $5.2 billion in loans to  help our businesses, but we must make sure the program works for these  businesses, and especially for their employees.   Some Utah small businesses affected by the COVID-19 shutdown, through  no fault of their own, may not be open or fully functional within 8  weeks. That is the original deadline to spend the funds for loan  forgiveness.   The bipartisan bill I support today extends the loan forgiveness  period to include costs incurred over 24 weeks and provides additional  flexibility to ensure PPP is the lifeline it was meant to be.   Utah small businesses are trying do the right thing by their  employees, their customers, and local communities. This legislation  supports them in that effort and improves the likelihood of a stronger  economic recovery.                            ____________________
