 Madam Speaker, it is a somber time to come into this  Chamber as we have colleagues at the other end of the building who  formed something they call the Common Sense Coalition, which is, I  think, a gentle euphemism like so many things in this town are, which  might well be called the ``kick the can down the road'' coalition, the  ``doing the same thing again and again and again and again and  expecting a different result'' coalition, or the ``those who do not  learn from the past are doomed to repeat it'' coalition.   The photo that is to my left and to your right if you are viewing at  home is of me at a ceremony at Red Hill Farm in the Fifth District of  Virginia, where a man named Patrick Henry lived.   Patrick Henry is notable as an early patriot who sought to ensure the  blessings of self-determination and liberty for a fledgling nation that  determined that it was unjust that they should be governed by edict  from across the sea and most notably said the words: ``I know not what  course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me  death.''    Indeed, anyone who signed the Declaration of Independence understood  at that time that they were literally signing their own death warrant,  yet they did because it was the right thing to do.   Today we have degenerated into a political class that knows pandering  and efforts to placate individuals without the interests of the mass  constituency that we all unitedly serve, and that is the American  people.   In fact, when Patrick Henry spoke about liberty one day in a separate  speech, from the back of the room, someone shouted, ``Treason,'' and  Henry responded eloquently: ``If this be treason, make the most of  it.''   What has happened to our leaders?   So that day I spoke to a group of a couple of dozen new Americans  from every corner of the world--from Asia, Africa, the Middle East,  Europe, and South America--who had, in some instances, worked decades  to become Americans and to earn those blessings of liberty gained for  us by people like Patrick Henry, like 1 million nameless faces who died  of combat death, disease, or starvation during a war to end the  horrific institution of slavery, and like Abraham Lincoln and Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.   So they, indeed, looked like America--Brown people, White people,  Black people, Asian people, American people--and they earned it. But  what is coming out of the Senate now essentially throws aside the  sacrifices of so many in order to score political points.   It was, indeed, one of the greatest honors of my life to welcome  those new brothers and sisters to our American family. Yet the process  through which they pained and labored does not in any way mirror the  process that we would continue by kicking the can down the road under  the proposed Senate ``compromise.''   I could really, literally, do this all day, all week, all month, and  all year if I wanted to highlight the cases of individuals who had lost  their lives because our Federal Government is completely unwilling to  enforce the laws that it currently has on the books.                                time  1245    Many of you recognize the lovely face of Kate Steinle, who was  enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the Embarcadero district of San  Francisco on pier 14 with her dad. A graduate of Cal Poly, San Luis  Obispo, she worked in the medical field and had recently moved in with  her boyfriend when an illegal who had been deported 5 times, who the  local government refused to turn over to Federal authorities,  discharged a weapon that he stole from a member of law enforcement at  what he said was a sea lion--which is bad enough--and killed this  lovely young woman whom her friends say loved yoga and helping others.   Reports indicate that among her last words was a plea to her father  to please help. She passed away because we refuse to enforce our law.   Edwin Jackson, a linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts, was born in  the same town that I was: Atlanta, Georgia. He didn't have big-time  football offers out of high school. Indeed, instead of the University  of Georgia or Florida or Clemson, he matriculated to Georgia Southern  University. But he worked, and he worked with an optimism that radiated  from the very smile on his face.  [[Page H1205]]    And not long ago, Edwin Jackson became one of nearly 1,000 people per  year who die in alcohol-related accidents involving people in this  country illegally; as well as his Uber driver, Jeffrey Monroe, who  should also be noted. Edwin Jackson's obituary indicated that his  greatest goal in life was to be a positive role model for young people  to overcome challenges.   The individual who was detained had a blood alcohol content of .239,  or nearly three times the legal limit. He had been deported twice  before, tried to run from the scene, and lied to police officers about  his name upon his apprehension.   Edwin Jackson and Jeffrey Monroe are dead because we refuse to  enforce our laws.   Denise Mosier, in my home State of Virginia, in 2010, was riding in a  van with two other nuns from the 33-women monastery where she made her  home, aspiring to help people. Her two dear friends were horrifically  injured in an accident that took Miss Mosier's life. This Benedictine  nun had devoted her life to the service of others. Quite literally, you  could find nothing bad that anyone could say about this woman.   The driver who took her life was ultimately charged with DUI third or  subsequent offense. He had arrived illegally in this country and was  only weeks away from a deportation hearing, which he was only having  because of his multiple prior arrests for driving under the influence.   Tragically, our unwillingness to enforce our own laws cost about 10  percent of the community at the monastery where Denise Mosier made her  home dearly and cost about 4 percent their life.   In fact, 13 percent of all drunk drivers arrested in the United  States every year are here illegally--13 percent of 1.5 million. And  the death toll of drunk-driving-related offenses in this country is  about 10,000 per year. So extrapolating those numbers, nearly 1,000  people per year are killed in alcohol-related accidents involving those  here illegally. And we refuse to enforce our own laws.   Peter Hacking was a volunteer fire department captain in Texas. One  afternoon not long ago, Peter stopped off Highway 78 to pick up his  children, which included 4-year-old Ellie and a son who was 2, when  they were killed by a previously deported drunk driver, who ultimately  received a sentence of about 2 years, and who was here because we will  not secure our border and we will not enforce our laws.   Let me be clear: those two dozen or so individuals whom I had the  great honor--of all faiths and all creeds from around the world--of  welcoming into our American family are American just like everyone  watching this today. But those who are not here legally, who will not  go through the processes prescribed by this very body, are a discredit  to those who work so hard and those who have sacrificed so much to make  this Nation the beacon of freedom that it is. And no nation of laws can  perpetuate itself so long as it looks the other way as its laws are  selectively enforced and not enforced.   Tessa Tranchant, from Virginia Beach, Virginia, was riding with a  girlfriend and killed by a drunk driver here illegally.   Danny Oliver and Michael Davis were law enforcement professionals  from Sacramento, California. They were murdered by a frequently  deported individual who swears that he will find a way to kill more  police officers.   Dominic Durden was killed while riding his motorcycle by an illegal  drunk driver.   Jamiel Shaw was brutally shot and murdered by an illegal.   Marilyn Pharis, who devoted her life to the service of this Nation in  the United States Air Force, was beaten, tortured, raped, and murdered  by an illegal who had been arrested 6 times in 15 months, the most  recent time being 8 days before this crime was perpetrated but not  reported to Federal authorities because the sanctuary community that  she was in did not deem it worthy to report.   I want to see a healthy and robust immigration system into this  country, legally. I want to live in a nation that enforces the very  laws that these bodies pass to protect those people who we are tasked  with serving, the American people, be they naturalized or native born.   I literally could keep telling these stories for weeks and weeks and  weeks.   So we now find fiscal responsibility a rallying cry from individuals  who don't seem to care about that at any point in time except for when  it is convenient to their political agenda. We have a President in the  White House who suggested that we would build a border wall and we  would have those who are responsible for the immigration problem pay  for it. We have a media that glowingly and gleefully pokes fun and  asks: How is that plan going for you?   Well, I have a proposal. About 92 percent of foreign nationals in  U.S. Federal prisons are here illegally. That is over 9 out of 10. That  comes out to about 34,500 inmates in our Federal prison system here  illegally. And they are not here for immigration violations. They are  here for robbery; they are here for rape; they are here for murder.    The cost to incarcerate one individual in the Federal prison system  annually is about $32,500. I'm not that good at math, but that comes  out to about $1.1 billion per year. If you move away from the Federal  prison system and extrapolate those numbers across the State prison  systems, you are looking at something like $9.5 billion per year to  incarcerate illegals here convicted of violent crimes, felonies. We are  talking about prisons, not jails.   Now, the Senate plan says: Okay. Well, what we are going to do is we  are going to spend $18 billion over 10 years.   I will tell you what. If we can just secure the Southern border and  stop the inflow of illegals, we could reduce our Federal and State  prison expenditures by about $9.5 billion a year, and I'll get you your  $18 billion in 2 years.   In other words, you want to pay for this wall?   Build it; it will pay for itself. And that is in dollars and cents.   But, folks, how do you quantify the lives of these people?   How do you put a dollar value on the life of a woman who spent her  entire life serving our country and was tortured, raped, and murdered  by someone who had been arrested just 6 days before and, under the  Federal law, should have been reported to Federal authorities, but they  didn't think it was necessary in California?   Or Jamiel, is there a dollar value you can put on this young man's  life?   How do you quantify these lives? How about these law enforcement  professionals? How about this teenage girl from Virginia Beach,  Virginia? How about a firefighter and father of a 22-month-old and a 4- year-old? How about a nun who devoted her entire life to serving  others? How about a football player who worked his way up from the  bottom and only wanted to motivate and inspire young people who faced  challenging circumstances?   I genuinely love my brothers and sisters of all races, creeds, and  origins; I genuinely do. I welcome them to apply to a process to allow  them to avail themselves of the benefits of, I believe, the greatest  Nation the Earth has ever seen. Winston Churchill said: ``Democracy was  the worst form of government, except for all the others.'' This is the  worst country in the world, except for all the others.   But if we won't enforce the laws that we pass, who are we? What have  we become? And if we won't protect those people who protect us-- firefighters, police officers, nuns, and mothers--how can we look at  ourselves?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Budd for his  comments.   At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida, (Mr.  Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Budd for his  comments.

In 42 years, 3,037 Americans have been killed on U.S. soil by  foreign-born terrorists. There have been 182 foreign-born terrorists,  to be precise, who have taken the lives of almost 3,050 Americans, and  63 of those 182, or greater than a third, came here legally on visas,  to include the diversity visa scheme. In fact, our office has tried  relatively diligently to calculate the actual death toll of native-born  Americans by recipients of diversity visas, unsuccessfully. These are  difficult data points.   But just in the last few years, the name Sayfullo Saipov has been in  the American news. This jihadist who had an admiration for terrorists,  to include the murderous raping, intolerant thugs of ISIS, took the  lives of eight Americans and injured many more in a truck attack on  Halloween, just last October. He was the recipient of a diversity  lottery visa.   Before that, Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev from Uzbekistan was also  the recipient of a diversity lottery visa, and he was arrested in 2015  for conspiring to ``kill as many Americans as he could.'' He wrote:         I am in the USA now. We don't have the weapons we need. Is       it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway       while here? What I am saying is, to get guns, to shoot Obama,       and then maybe get shot ourselves. Would that do? That would       strike fear into the hearts of the infidels.    This legal diversity visa recipient from Brooklyn said:         If this is not successful, maybe bomb Coney Island.    Fortunately, he was arrested before he could bring to fruition his  plans to assault individuals in the very Nation that had so graciously  opened its doors.   It is incredibly interesting to me the results that I learned when my  wife and I engaged in that which is all the rage these days and looked  at our DNA. I found out I had relatives from multiple continents, and I  am proud of that. But I am an American just like those people who stood  with me that day at the home of the great American patriot Patrick  Henry, from Africa and Asia, the Middle East, South America, Europe,  Oceania. They are my American brothers and sisters. They did everything  by the numbers and availed themselves of a dream that we all share.  Those who do not, cheapen the sacrifice made by so many who have come  before them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
