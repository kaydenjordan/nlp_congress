 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 4368, and that I may include tabular  material on the same.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to bring before the House H.R. 4368, the  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024 appropriations bill.   I thank Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Granger and commend her  for her leadership in moving this bill and the fiscal year 2024  appropriations process forward.   I also recognize the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee  (Ms. DeLauro), and the ranking member of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Subcommittee (Mr. Bishop).   I appreciate the conversations he and I have had regarding the bill.  While I know we don't agree on everything, we have reached areas of  consensus that will keep our ag communities strong.   As Americans know all too well, our country continues to battle high  inflation driven by the overspending of the last Congress and the Biden  administration.   The fiscal situation in the United States, in fact, has changed since  the Appropriations Committee passed this bill in June.   While we were on the August recess, the Congressional Budget Office  projected the deficit to reach $2 trillion for this fiscal year,  doubling last year's deficit of $1 trillion, and the deficit outlook  for the future has gotten much worse.   We simply cannot continue down this path of spending large sums of  money without regard to the fiscal future of our Nation.   This bill takes the same approach American families take every day.  They simply have to do more with less under the Biden economy.   American families decide every single day where to cut back spending  to pay for what is most important for them. For them, those decisions  are difficult.   Likewise, we have to make tough, difficult decisions for the good of  the Nation. This is why the rule implements further reductions totaling  $2.7 billion across the discretionary accounts in this bill, except for  the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and  Children, or WIC.   With this reduction, the fiscal year 2024 Agriculture appropriation  bill's discretionary allocation is $15.1 billion.   By redirecting nearly $7.5 billion in unobligated funds from the  Inflation Reduction Act, this bill funds the Department of Agriculture,  the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission with an effective program level of $22.5 billion--a decrease  of 12.8 percent from the current fiscal year.   This legislation prioritizes critical ag research and plant and  animal health programs, invests in our rural communities, provides  nutrition assistance to those in need, and ensures that American  consumers have a safe food and drug supply.   This legislation rejects the Biden administration's unrealistic  proposed spending levels that disregard the dire fiscal reality our  country faces.   It also rejects the administration's continued push to bloat inside  the beltway Federal bureaucracy by halting new hires in the Washington,  D.C., office; instead, focusing on hiring an increased USDA workforce  outside of the Capital Beltway in the offices that directly serve and  support rural America.   I will highlight a few areas where this legislation prioritizes  essential functions while being responsible stewards of taxpayer  dollars.  [[Page H4506]]    In regard to supporting the core mission, the bill provides $1  billion for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to support  the Department's efforts to protect our producers from foreign plant  and animal diseases.   The bill continues to invest in the delivery of farm programs,  disaster assistance, and crop insurance to farmers and ranchers by  maintaining funding for the Farm Service Agency and the Risk Management  Agency.   The bill provides $1 billion for the Food Safety and Inspection  Service to fund our Nation's frontline inspectors of meat and poultry  products.   We also continue to make important investments in critical  agriculture research that will keep our producers on the cutting edge  of technology and production practices.   We continue to fund rural development programs, including critical  infrastructure investments in water and wastewater systems, broadband,  and rural housing programs.   For the Food and Drug Administration, the bill provides just over $6  billion in direct appropriations and user fees to enable the agency to  keep food, drugs, and medical devices safe and effective.   The bill includes $296 million for the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission to continue to oversee and ensure the integrity of U.S.  derivative markets.   With regards to fiscal responsibility, at the same time, this  legislation reins in some of the administration's wasteful, out-of- control spending.   For instance, it removes the Secretary's discretionary use of the  Commodity Credit Corporation to fund unauthorized, nonemergency  programs by returning statutory language to its pre-COVID language that  didn't have that discretionary authority.   The CCC is not intended to allow USDA to completely bypass Congress  in establishing new programs. Yet, the USDA apparently just can't help  themselves, and that is exactly what they have been doing with the  Commodity Credit Corporation.   According to a recent article in AgriPost, the USDA intends to use  the Commodity Credit Corporation to spend nearly $1.4 billion on trade  programs and another $1.1 billion to pay for ``commodity-based  international food aid.'' That sounds a lot like the Food for Peace  program.   Since the USDA has provided $1.1 billion for food aid that will be  distributed during fiscal year 2024, the rule amendment reduces Food  for Peace to $532 million.    This bill will put an end to the habitual abuse of the CCC. In doing  so, the bill saves $1 billion in fiscal year 2024 alone.   Given that the USDA used these discretionary powers to spend another  $2.5 billion and $6.6 billion in the last 2 fiscal years, respectively,  I would submit to my colleagues that the real savings to taxpayers of  taking these discretionary authorities away will be much higher than  the CBO score.   Mr. Chair, that is exactly what we need in times of the fiscal crisis  we are in. Let me be clear: Restricting these authorities in the CCC  will have no impact on farm bill and conservation programs, crop  insurance, or the Secretary's ability to access the CCC in an animal or  plant health emergency, the uses for which the program was created, not  as a de facto slush fund for the department. All of those important  duties and functions will continue under this bill.   This legislation also rescinds wasteful spending from the Inflation  Reduction Act. It is finally time to be responsible stewards of  taxpayer dollars by rescinding these new government giveaways.   We must work to rightsize programs, especially since the pandemic is  over and President Biden ended the public health emergency in May.   It, in fact, is time to return to pre-COVID spending levels. Perhaps,  Mr. Chair, we can return to pre-COVID inflationary levels, too, which I  am sure the American public would, indeed, welcome.   Well, this is why we are returning the WIC cash value voucher  benefits to a normal, sustainable inflation-adjusted funding level.   The American Rescue Plan provided a one-time increase in these  benefits due to the pandemic, but these increases continue to be built  into the WIC program in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 after they were due  to expire. Keeping these increases on autopilot adds an additional $1  billion to the program.   This bill does provide cash value vouchers above prepandemic levels  to help with the food price inflation caused by the Biden economy. With  the end of the public health emergency, it is time to return this  program to normal pre-COVID operations.   On the regulatory front, this legislation puts a stop to USDA's  efforts under the Packers and Stockyards Act to dictate how poultry and  livestock producers raise and market their animals.   This bill also prevents the purchase of farmland by our foreign  adversaries, while providing funds for the Farm Service Agency to  fulfill its duty to track foreign ownership of land.   The bill also returns the use of mifepristone to in-person dispensing  by a healthcare provider. This is a drug that should not be used  without the supervision of a physician or a similarly licensed  provider.   Anyone who truly cares, who genuinely cares about women's health and  safety, should support this commonsense provision.   Finally, as I said earlier, this bill takes the same approach  American families take every single day now. They have to do more with  less under the Biden inflation economy. American families decide every  day where to cut back spending to pay for what is most important.   We are not appropriating monopoly money, Mr. Chair. It is hard-earned  taxpayer dollars, and sometimes tough decisions have to be made, and  this bill makes them.   In closing, I ask for your support for this important piece of  legislation. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, what is really harmful is a $2 trillion  deficit, not the legislation before us.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Miller).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I remind Americans, if they are watching, that we are not dealing  with Monopoly money.   Where are the ideas to solve a $2 trillion budget deficit?   The President didn't have any. In fact, the President submitted a  budget to Congress that never ever balanced and was supposed to have $1  trillion deficits, but in fact, we had overspending in the so-called  Inflation Reduction Act, which is one of the biggest misnomers we ever  had in the history of Congress.   The American people know, when you increase spending by hundreds and  hundreds of billions of dollars, you increase inflation. You don't  reduce it, you increase it. The fact of the matter is, our deficit is  now $2 trillion, not $1 trillion.   Mr. Chair, I am hoping to hear from the other side of the aisle: How  do we pay for all of this?   We have to borrow every single penny of this bill, and it has to be  paid back by our children, our great-grandchildren--those are the  facts. I know the facts are disturbing, but we have a $2 trillion  deficit, and it is the House Republicans who are taking the responsible  position in Washington and dealing with it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, it is only in Washington that this can happen. Last  year's bill, from the other side of the aisle when they were in the  majority, funded WIC at $6.0 billion. This year's bill in front of us  funds WIC at $6.0 billion. That is a slash, if you listen to the other  side of the aisle.   The average American is going: What? Wait a minute. We are funding it  at exactly the same level as last year and they are accusing us of  taking food out of the mouths of women, infants, and children.                                time  2100    This is the same level they did last year. That is what the American  people can't stand about Washington. The average American understands  that $6.0 billion last year is the same as $6.0 billion this year.   All they see is a partisan struggle going on. They don't see  Americans and the House of Representatives wanting to solve their  problems.   The price of food in the grocery store, the price of gas, the price  of everything, the inflation, they don't want to solve the problem at  the southern border. What they want to do is accuse us of slashing  things when we fund it at exactly the same level.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I guess we are just going to have to be fact-checking all  night long. Once again, the gentlewoman said that we are slashing $800  million from the WIC program.   Now, maybe this is new math. Maybe this is why our public schools are  failing our children, but $6.0 billion this year, our amount, is  exactly the same as the $6.0 billion last year--6.0 minus 6.0, for  those of you watching on TV, take note, is exactly the same. It is not  $800 million less.   Now, I think I heard that we are taking this down to FY 2000 funding  levels. Well, that is interesting because we just looked up the FY 2000  funding levels, and the ag bill was funded at $14 billion. We are  funding it at $25 billion. Now, again, this might be new math, 14 might  be more than 25, maybe in some alternate universe. That is the way this  government functions. It is in an alternate universe. It doesn't  understand what every American family knows: Inflation is what our  problem is. Inflation is driven by out-of-control government spending,  by a $2 trillion deficit, and then we are accused of cutting spending  to the FY 2000 levels. Again, for those who weren't paying attention  the first time, FY 2000, look it up. It is easy. Google it--$14  billion. Our bill, $25 billion.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I am going to fact check myself. Our budget, the bill that  is coming to the floor is $22.5 billion, not $25 billion, but that is  still a whole lot more than $14 billion.   The toxic hazard is not this bill. Rather, it is a $2 trillion  deficit and an open southern border. That is what the toxic hazard is,  and we are not discussing that in Washington. We should be discussing  it in Washington.   Mr. Chair, I just have a question. Aren't the remarks supposed to be  directed to the chair, the speaker's comments?    Okay. I thought so. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I guess it is fact-check time again for the American people. FY 2000  was $14 billion. I think I demonstrated that 22.5 is more than 14. The  gentleman says we are cutting it to FY 2001 levels. Well, Mr. Chair,  that was $15 billion. Again, it might be new math, but when I went to  school, I was taught that 15 was less than 22.5. No matter how many  times you say it on the floor of this House, we are not cutting  spending to FY 2001 levels. We are cutting them to pre-COVID levels  because, Mr. Chair, the pandemic is over.    The free-wheeling spending during the pandemic has to end. A $2  trillion deficit and an open southern border are existential threats to  this country, and the Republican House majority is dealing with it.   Mr. Chair, I remind the body that the Senate is not controlled by  Republicans, and they haven't passed a single appropriations bill to  the floor. Now, we only passed one, but, again, when I went to school,  one was more than none.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, first, it was that we are cutting it to FY  2000 levels, then it was 2001 levels. Now, they raised the ante. It is  FY 2003 levels. The FY 2003 funding level in this bill was $17.55  billion. I will remind all the Americans watching that 17.5 is less  than 22.5. In fact, we are $5 billion above that.   We are not cutting spending to FY 2003 levels. Now, maybe the next  speaker will suggest 2005, 2007. If they get to FY 2019, pre-COVID,  yes, we are.   The floor leader on the other side of the aisle said Republicans talk  of everything going up. Mr. Chair, if that were true, if it were only  Republicans that talk of everything going up, we would be getting 95  percent of the vote in America because everybody is talking about  everything going up. You can't go anywhere without someone saying they  have to pay $4.80 a gallon for diesel, or they have to pay so much for  milk, pay $2 for a loaf of bread that they used to pay $1.20 for.   It is not Republicans talking about that. We are just listening to  what Americans say. That is why we are returning spending to the pre- COVID levels.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the Republicans were sent back to the majority  this term of Congress to get things in order in Washington.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2024  Agriculture appropriations bill, which returns to pre-COVID spending  levels and starts us on a path to decreasing our Federal spending and  decreasing inflation. That is what the American people want.   This legislation does prioritize critical programs that support our  Nation's farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.   The bill importantly reins in Federal spending and regulatory  overreach as well as includes a number of conservative policy victories  to stop the Biden administration's woke agenda.   Mr. Chair, again, I ask my colleagues to support the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 723, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I rise in favor of this amendment. This is the  bipartisan amendment, which includes priorities for Members on both  sides of the aisle. I appreciate Ranking Member Bishop working with us  on this amendment and ask for your support.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I congratulate the gentleman, because the  gentleman brings an amendment to the floor that does something with the  $2 trillion budget deficit. He is right, we have a $33 trillion debt.  Our interest payments in a few years are going to be over $1 trillion-- more than Social Security, more than Medicare, more than Medicaid, more  than food stamps, more than all of them.   One fact check before I sit down. Now we heard it was FY 2007, so I  guess the  [[Page H4528]]  speechwriters can't make up their minds. Is it FY 2000, 2001, 2003? Now  it is 2007.   I would remind the Chair, the spending level in the 2007 bill was  $17.8 billion, and that is almost $5 billion less than what we  appropriate in this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  coming to the floor with a specific idea of how we stop the out-of- control Federal spending leading to a $2 trillion deficit and runaway  inflation. That is the bottom line.   There are plenty of ideas on how to spend more money, believe you me.  There are plenty of ideas circulating around Washington. What we need  are ideas on how to cut spending.   Mr. Chair, I suggest that going after parts of the Federal Government  that encourage high-cost energy, because that is what renewable energy  is, it is all high cost. That is the fact of the matter.   If we want to create low-cost energy, Mr. Chair, you know what we  have to do, we have to extract our natural gas and burn our natural gas  and then we can compete with China for the cost of energy.   All that we are doing with programs like this that fund renewable  energy is yielding unilateral disarmament to China on energy, and it  doesn't belong in the agriculture department.    Mr. Chair, I congratulate the Member from Florida for  bringing a concrete idea to the floor on how to cut our $2 trillion  Federal deficit.   Once again, it is very easy to spend money. We could make a list of a  thousand programs that are deserving programs, but the fact of the  matter is we have to borrow every single cent to fund the programs in  this agriculture bill, and our grandchildren have to pay it back. That  is immoral.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for  yielding time.   This is a commonsense amendment. The bottom line is it is a myth to  say that electric vehicles produce no CO2. Where do you  think the electricity comes from when you plug it into the outlet? Most  electricity in the United States is producing CO2.   Secondly, why would we want the Federal Government to buy a vehicle,  an expensive vehicle, that people don't even buy for themselves?   We should run the Federal Government much more efficiently. These are  not the most efficient purchases to make. We have a $2 trillion  deficit.    Madam Chair, the Thrifty Food Plan, this is the official  political appointee who decided that the SNAP benefits weren't high  enough, so they devised a new food plan that was used as a vehicle to  just increase the SNAP benefits.   The bottom line is we are spending over $100 billion a year. We have  a $2 trillion deficit. We should reevaluate that increase in the  Thrifty Food Plan that has resulted in a double-digit increase in SNAP  benefits.   What this amendment does is sends a clear signal to the  administration that this probably wasn't a well-thought-out idea.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for  offering this amendment.   There is one thing the Federal Government should not do when it has a  $2 trillion deficit, and that is do duplicative things in one  department.   There already is an Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of  Agriculture. There is no need for an Equity Commission. Oh, but that is  right, we have got to get the word ``equity'' in there somewhere.   I suggest maybe we should go back and just rename the Office of Civil  Rights. It is cheaper, and with a $2 trillion deficit, that is probably  what we ought to do.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  offering the amendment.   It turns out in the wisdom of the committee we have already defunded  the Civilian Climate Corps, but belts and suspenders is fine, I have no  problem with that, because good-paying  [[Page H4556]]  jobs shouldn't come from the government, they should come in the  private sector. That is why we don't need the Civilian Climate Corps.  Oh, that is right, it has the word ``climate'' in it, so you have to  create something in the Department with the word ``climate'' and with  the word ``equity'' and with the words ``diversity'' and  ``inclusion''--the whole thing. We don't need it.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for  putting forth this amendment. It is common sense. Able-bodied people  ought to work. That is the bottom line.   There are two things about this program. One is that my colleague on  the other side of the aisle says you never know, the economy could get  bad. Now, this is only a 1-year amendment. We are only discussing the  next fiscal year.   The President has said this is a great economy. I don't know what we  are worried about. The President has said this economy is great. So  don't worry about this amendment. It shouldn't be a problem.   The other thing is that this is one of the greatest State scams in  the country right now. States vie with each other as to who can get  this waiver. Do you know what, Madam Chair? This is no cost to the  State. We could solve this problem by just asking States to have a 20  percent copay.   Do you think food stamps are a great deal or SNAP is a great deal?  Great. The Federal Government pays 80, you pay 20, just like Medicaid.  That means States will have skin in the game, and they won't go for  these scams.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for  offering this amendment.   My colleague across the aisle read verbatim from an executive order  to analyze the effect of climate on migration. What we need is an  executive order to examine the effect of an open border on migration  into the United States, the effect in the large cities--New York,  Chicago--and bankrupting this country. That is the executive order we  need from the President, not these.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  bringing this forth.   Mr. Chair, look, I urge everyone just to read the Fifth Circuit Court  opinion. The fact of the matter is, the Fifth Circuit Court said the  FDA way overstepped their congressional fencing in on how they have to  approve drugs. The bottom line is, it is not us saying this. It is the  Fifth Circuit.   Maybe this is one way to send a message that you actually ought to  listen to the way Congress set up the safety and efficacy approval  process. Maybe we need something like this so the FDA actually pays  attention to how Congress told them they have to operate.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Rosendale) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Miller of Illinois, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 4368) making  [[Page H4566]]  appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. today.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 11 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until today,  Wednesday, September 27, 2023, at 9 a.m.
