 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of the robust funding to electrify Federal vehicle fleets included in  the Build Back Better Act.   Our climate is rapidly changing, and humans are the primary cause.   In 2019, the transportation sector accounted for 70 percent of  petroleum used in the United States and was the largest contributor to  greenhouse gas emissions nationwide.   Transitioning to electric vehicles will reduce our carbon output and  improve the environment for our children and our grandchildren.  [[Page H5517]]    That is why the Committee on Oversight and Reform approved nearly $12  billion to transition the postal fleet and GSA fleets to electric  vehicles and to charge them at post offices across the country.   This funding will help purchase more than 300,000 electric vehicles  and the devices needed to charge them, making the United States a  leader on climate change and building an environmentally friendly fleet  of the future.   I urge my colleagues to support the Build Back Better Act and its  robust funding for electric vehicles.                            ____________________
