 Mr. President, before beginning my remarks about the  requirement for a larger Navy, I do want to extend my deepest  condolences to the loved ones of those who lost their lives aboard the  USS Fitzgerald recently.   During Saturday morning's early hours, the USS Fitzgerald--a guided-  [[Page S3642]]  missile destroyer--collided with a Filipino merchant ship off the coast  of Honshu, Japan. The USS Fitzgerald sustained significant damage,  including the rapid flooding of three compartment areas, and seven  sailors lost their lives. These young Americans were on board because  they chose to serve their country, and they are heroes whose names will  be added to the list of those who will be forever honored by our  country.   Questions remain about the collision, and I am hopeful that they will  be answered soon. Administrative and safety investigations into this  tragedy are already underway, but we cannot change the horrific turn of  events that occurred at 2 a.m. off the coast of Japan.   Our hearts go out to the loved ones who are dealing with the grief  this accident has caused. We wish a quick recovery for those who were  injured, and our gratitude goes to the many sailors who acted swiftly  and resolutely to save lives and prevent further damage aboard.   Does the distinguished majority leader wish me to yield for some  business?   Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator would yield so that I may do wrapup  here.    I would be delighted.   Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let's talk about the size of our Navy's  fleet.   The current fleet has 276 ships, but the Navy's requirement is now  for 355 ships--a figure supported by congressionally mandated future  fleet architecture studies.   Last week, I spoke on the floor about the national imperative to  build a larger Navy. I outlined the critical missions that our Navy  performs every day to help secure the country's vital interests. I also  described an intense naval competition with our real and potential  adversaries. This is a competition America cannot afford to lose.   America needs a bigger Navy. How do we get there? Related to that  question is when we get to a 355-ship fleet. According to the Chief of  Naval Operations, ADM John Richardson, we should reach our 355-ship  objective in the mid-2020s. To do that, we should have started  yesterday. Building and sustaining technologically advanced ships is a  long-term national project. It cannot happen overnight. It takes years.   As chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, I intend to lay a firm  foundation this year to help support a buildup. Based on my  subcommittee's work, I am convinced that Congress has a critical role  to play in determining how we get to 355. All options should be on the  table. Here are four ideas to consider.   No. 1, ramp up hot production lines.   The Navy's accelerated fleet plan states that over the next 7 years,  the shipbuilding industrial base can support building more ships than  are currently planned. The Navy plans to build 59, but the shipbuilders  can actually complete 88. We should do this. Many hot production lines  have excess capacity. Congress should authorize the Navy to ``buy in  bulk,'' using multiyear and block buy contracts. These contracts would  help solidify the skilled workforce, stimulate suppliers, and drive  down costs. We can also authorize advance procurement funding to buy  long-lead-time pieces and parts.   No. 2, extend the service life of ships in the fleet.   A quarter century ago, the Navy had 450 ships and deployments that  averaged 167 days. Now the average deployment exceeds 200 days. In  other words, the Navy is smaller, but the tempo of its operations has  accelerated. An extra month of deployment puts additional wear and tear  on ships, and this can force early retirement and ultimately squander  taxpayer dollars.   Better maintenance can extend ships' service lives, delay retirement,  and help us reach the 355-ship goal faster. I applaud the President's  budget request for fully funding ship depot maintenance. We must build  new ships and maintain the current fleet better.   In a recent speech to the Naval War College, the CNO, Admiral  Richardson, noted that extending the lives of Arleigh Burke-class  destroyers could help the Navy reach the 355-ship objective 10 to 15  years earlier. The commander of Navy Sea Systems Command, VADM Thomas  Moore, agreed with the CNO in a recent speech in which he stated that  proper maintenance would extend service lives and help grow the fleet  more rapidly.   No. 3, reactivate ships in the Ready Reserve fleet.   During the Reagan buildup, the Navy brought ships out of mothballs,  including battleships with massive guns, to help grow the fleet size.  The Navy should look at the Reserve fleet ship by ship to determine if  any can be restored to operational status.   In his Naval War College speech, the CNO revealed that he is  considering bringing some retired Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates  out of mothballs. Vice Admiral Moore also suggested examining the  merits of returning some logistics ships to the force.   Reactivating retired ships does not simply mean bringing back less  capable ships. Jerry Hendrix and Robert C. O'Brien wrote in POLITICO in  April that reactivated ships could be outfitted with modern missile  systems and potentially cutting-edge electromagnetic railguns and  directed energy weapons. In other words, reactivated ships could  perform completely different and relevant missions at a fraction of the  cost of new construction.   No. 4, develop and deploy unmanned maritime systems.   The fleet of the future will include new types of ships. Again,  according to the CNO, ``There is no question that unmanned systems must  also be an integral part of the future fleet.'' Unmanned undersea and  surface ships can offer significant advantages, such as the ability to  conduct persistent operations. We have seen drones revolutionize combat  from the skies. The same is possible on the seas.   I believe the Navy needs a dedicated range to test unmanned systems  with other manned and unmanned platforms, while also training new  operators and maintainers. I applaud the Navy for including substantial  R&D funding for unmanned underwater vehicles, UUVs, in its unfunded  priorities list. I am hopeful that Congress will provide the resources  that are necessary to rapidly develop and deploy new unmanned systems.   To conclude, we should be considering all options for building up our  naval capacity. I do not dismiss the fact that these options cost money  and some are controversial, but they deserve to be explored. It would  be irresponsible for Congress not to do the work now to ensure that the  Navy of the future has what it needs to respond to challenges and  fulfill its missions. That means 355 ships, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues to set this imperative national project into  motion.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.
