 Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, Congress launched the Pell  Grant Program to provide direct financial aid to low-income students to  increase access to higher education. This program has opened up the  door of opportunity and made the dream of college a reality for  millions of students across the country.   In North Carolina's Sixth District, over 30,000 students are  utilizing nearly $140 million in Pell grants to pursue their higher  education goals at local colleges and universities. Nationwide, nearly  7 million students, or 40 percent of undergraduates, are Pell grant  recipients.   As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I am proud to share  my support for Pell grants and to have supported a $400 increase to the  maximum annual award. By increasing the Pell grant award, we are  ensuring that more students can attend college and join the skilled  workforce in their desired career field.   I look forward to Congress continuing the bipartisan support for  expanding student access to college through Pell grants for another 50  years.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Cicilline for holding this  Special Order. I am proud to rise to celebrate Pride Month.   This month, we honor the many contributions of the LGBTQ community  while recognizing that the fight for equality is ongoing.   I recently watched a documentary on PBS called ``The Lavender  Scare.'' I was amazed to learn how liberating military service during  World War II was for so many members of the LGBTQ community. The people  from small towns and rural areas were relieved to meet so many others  in the military who shared their feelings about sexuality and gender.  They realized that they were not alone, and they could be valuable  members of the war effort.   But then, when they returned home after V-E Day, they were confronted  with the Red Scare and the nightmare that was Senator Joe McCarthy, who  ruined many lives by calling on government officials to identify  homosexuals and remove them from their government jobs, claiming they  were vulnerable to blackmail by Communists and could be induced to  reveal national secrets. It is a shameful part of our history that I  never really knew about.   Thankfully, we have come a long way since the Lavender Scare and the  Stonewall riots of 53 years ago, including the recognition of marriage  equality in 2015, the enactment of landmark hate crime legislation, and  extending title IX protections to include LGBTQ students. We have made  progress toward equality, but there is much more work to be done.   We must remain vigilant in our fight to protect freedom of  expression, equal marriage rights, and the right to access gender- affirming healthcare and healthcare free of discrimination. We also  need to continue the fight against discrimination in housing,  employment, public accommodations, and much more.   To every LGBTQ person who is concerned about what the future holds, I  will tell you this: I see you; I value you; I support you; and I will  continue to fight for you in Congress.    I believe that all Americans should be able to live their lives free  from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and  I condemn all attempts to roll back hard-won progress.   As a member of the Equality Caucus, I have helped pass LGBTQ-related  bills, including two pieces of legislation that were recently signed  into law by President Biden.   The first of these new laws is the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, which  improves data collection for hate crimes, including hate crimes  motivated by sexual orientation or gender identity. This law also  allows States to apply for grants to create hotlines to assist victims  of hate crimes.   The other law designates the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, as  a national memorial, honoring those who lost their lives to the  senseless violence that took place on June 12, 2016.   I am proud to have cosponsored and voted in favor of H.R. 5, the  Equality Act, which bars discrimination in the workplace, housing, and  lending systems. I remember when we passed that that day, Mr. Cicilline  said to me: This bill will change lives.   For far too long, LGBTQ Americans have lived in fear of hate and  discrimination. The passage of the Equality Act is an important step  toward guaranteeing that every American has the fundamental right to  equality under the law.   The House passed the Equality Act last year. It is time for the  Senate to do the same.   I thank Mr. Cicilline for bringing us here tonight to recognize and  celebrate the LGBTQ community.
