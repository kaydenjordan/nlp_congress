 Madam Speaker, I rise today to follow the words of my  good friend, Dr. Raul Ruiz, as we honor this towering figure from our  region, the Inland Empire.   For more than 50 years, Dr. Rivera served our community as an  educator, administrator, and community leader. His passing in March was  felt by all of us, and it left too large of a void for just one of us  to fill.   Back in 1985, our region suffered. More than half of the Latino  students in our region didn't finish high school.   While others ignored the problem, Dr. Tom rolled up his sleeves as an  elected school board member, as a lifelong educator. He joined with  community leaders to form the Inland Empire Future Leaders Program to  help these students stay in school.                                time  1030    As a result, more than 99 percent of the students who go through this  program have graduated high school. Ninety percent have gone to  college. Dr. Tom's positive influence, his beliefs in what we could  become if given the opportunity, helped shape doctors, lawyers,  teachers, and, yes, a couple Members of Congress.   Dr. Tom gave working-class kids like me a chance for a better life,  for ourselves and for our family, and he taught us that no matter where  life takes us, never lose sight of our heritage and our culture, and  always give back to our community.   It is a testament to his unwavering faith in our young people that  Dr. Raul Ruiz and I are standing on the House floor today. I was proud  to call Dr. Tom a mentor, a friend, and importantly, a constituent. He  would always ask me how my grandmother was doing. He went to school on  the south side of Colton with members of my family, and he always took  the time to ask how they were doing, what they were up to, how he could  help them.   My thoughts go out to his wife, Dr. Lily Rivera, his children, and  grandchildren.   Madam Speaker, now it is our responsibility, those of us in roles of  making policy, those of us in our communities who strive to make our  community a better place, it is up to us to carry his legacy forward  and to lift up the next generation of Latino leaders.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the vice chair for yielding time.   Madam Speaker, we have been entrusted by the American people to  investigate the attempt to overturn a free and fair election. That  attempt to subvert the will of the American people resulted in a deadly  attack on the people in this building. But it was bigger than just 1  day of violence and destruction that resulted in the deaths of U.S.  Capitol Police officers.   For weeks, various schemes were hatched by individuals, ranging from  State legislators to the former President's senior aides to Members of  Congress, with a singular objective: Keep Donald Trump in office.   These are the facts, Madam Speaker, facts that were backed up last  week by a Federal judge, who, after reviewing some of the evidence our  committee has in its possession, said, in part, ``The illegality of the  plan was obvious.''   We are here today to hold two individuals involved, Peter Navarro and  Dan Scavino, in contempt of Congress.   Peter Navarro has failed to comply with our investigation in any way  despite the fact that he has given multiple TV interviews. In fact, Mr.  Navarro appeared on television in support of the former President's  failed reelection efforts, so much so that he was found to have  repeatedly violated the Hatch Act.   But his political work did not stop when the election was over. We  know Mr. Navarro led a call with State legislators about the efforts to  convince Vice President Pence to delay election certification for 10  days. We know Mr. Navarro spoke to Steve Bannon, both during and after  the attack on the U.S. Capitol.   Mr. Navarro has publicly stated that he is protected by executive  privilege, but he has never sought counsel, as others have, and he has  not filed any case seeking relief from his responsibilities to comply  with our lawful subpoena.   This is a textbook case for contempt, Madam Speaker. While I am not  surprised by some of my colleagues who refuse to pull their heads out  of the sand and face the facts of what really happened and continues to  happen, I remain deeply concerned about what this country looks like if  the perpetrators aren't held accountable.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1037.
