 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for giving me the  opportunity to serve as the co-chair of the Pro-Life Caucus and to  speak briefly today on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.    Mr. Speaker, for the last hour, those of you who listened, and there  are a lot of people watching who listened, was a discussion about the  humanity of individuals, the humanity of people here in America, and  how we need to deal with it, how we need to respect it, how we need to  take that humanity into consideration. And we will. That had to do with  the DREAMers. It was about DACA.   But for this hour, we are going to talk about 1 million human beings  a year who lose their life through abortion in the United States--one  million human beings per year.   Now, why do I emphasize human beings? Because the science on this is  very clear. These are human beings. From the moment of conception,  their genetic makeup is unique from every other human being in the  world and uniquely human.   So how can we not consider those 1 million human beings a year who  lose their life to abortion not the greatest human rights challenge  that faces us here in the United States?   When we have the March for Life in 2 days, we are going to see many  people from the millennial generation, many young people, who I think  realize, because they have grown up and they learn in their science  class, that these, in fact, are 1 million human beings every year who  lose their life in the United States. They realize the science is  clear. They are human beings. They deserve the protection of this  Congress.   We are going to deal with the issues that they talked about last  hour, and then the Congress should turn its attention to ending that  human rights abuse for those 1 million human beings every year who lose  their life to elective abortion right here in the United States.   I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for his  leadership over the decades on this issue. The struggle is not over.  This human rights issue is not over, but hopefully, thank God, one day  it will be.                                time  1915    Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris for his very  eloquent remarks and for reminding us that this is the greatest human  rights struggle on Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx), the chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Ms.  Foxx has been a lifelong leader on the issue of life and, of course, in  leadership, and now as a full committee chairman. I thank the  gentlewoman for all she does on behalf of the unborn and their mothers  each and every day.
