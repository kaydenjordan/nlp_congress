 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and recognize our  Department of Defense laboratories. I am pleased to introduce a  bipartisan resolution to designate May 18 as Department of Defense  Laboratory Day 2017.   Mr. Speaker, Defense labs have played a unique role in countless  innovations that have enhanced and strengthened our national security.  Defense-supported research and development has yielded many game- changing state-of-the-art weapons systems and technologies, ensuring  that we never send our men and women in uniform into a fair fight.   Our Defense labs also contribute to American economic growth by  spurring  [[Page H4324]]  the creation of new industries, companies, and jobs across the country,  guaranteeing that America leads the way in cutting-edge science and  technology.   Mr. Speaker, in celebration of all the work and accomplishments of  our national network of Defense laboratories, and most especially the  incredibly talented scientists, researchers, and support staff who  support them and staff them, please join me in honoring their  contributions to our security.                            ____________________
