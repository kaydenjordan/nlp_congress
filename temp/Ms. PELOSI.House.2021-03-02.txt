 Madam Speaker, I join the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) in her beautiful acknowledgment of the passing of Vernon  Jordan.   Madam Speaker, I also commend her for her great leadership in  honoring  [[Page H979]]  our Constitution with this For the People legislation. I am fond of  saying of Chairwoman Lofgren that she has so much experience, so much  knowledge, such deep values about our Constitution and about our  electoral system and how they are connected. I thank her for her  tremendous leadership.   Madam Speaker, I also thank   John Sarbanes for his long-term  dedication to this For the People legislation so that we can have  elections that enable people to participate more fully. That is what  this is all about. Mr. Sarbanes chaired the Democracy Reform Task  Force. He is the godfather of this bill. His determination, his  deliberation, and his dedication to democracy have brought us to this  important moment for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I am especially pleased that this moment is happening  in March when it is Women's History Month because I am very fond of  saying that if we reduce the role of money in politics and increase the  level of decency and civility, we will be able to elect many more  women, many more people of color, many more young people into elective  office. I am absolutely certain of that in terms of women, and this  legislation does just that.   Madam Speaker, ``We the people,'' the first words of the Preamble to  the Constitution, how appropriate that that is what this legislation is  called.   I come to this conversation, not just as Speaker of the House, but as  a person who, for years, was a leader in the California Democratic  Party. Our purpose was to remove obstacles of participation for  Democrats or Republicans. That is what the law requires. That was the  right thing to do. Whether it was in registration or getting out the  vote, we had to be nonpartisan. That is what this legislation does.   Madam Speaker, it is very interesting in the rules of the House that  we can have people misrepresent the facts, but if we call them on it,  our words are taken down for mistrusting the integrity of Members. But  let's be very clear: There is no public funding use of taxpayer money  for congressional races in this legislation, no matter what you hear  someone else say. There will be an amendment on the floor.   Madam Speaker, speaking of amendments, there are 56 amendments. The  list takes pages and pages and pages, so this will take a couple of  days to deal with. This idea that we don't have a full discussion and  full amendment process, let's not talk about process. Let's talk about  the policy and what we hope to achieve.   The first 300 pages of this bill were written by John Lewis to  eliminate voter suppression, which has become rampant in our country.  How do we say to our Founders, ``We salute you for what you have done,  and we are going to do everything in our power to make sure we suppress  the vote''? It is so inconsistent. We see even just in recent days a  torrent of pieces of legislation to reduce voter participation. So,  that is what we are going to do.   Madam Speaker, another aspect of this that distorts our democracy is  the partisan gerrymandering. That is why I salute the distinguished  chairwoman for her leadership for a long time now in putting forth  redistricting by way of commission.                                time  1015    The people should choose their politicians. Politicians should not be  choosing their voters by this political gerrymandering. This  legislation does that.   Part of voter suppression that people don't always recognize is the  suffocation of the airways of big, dark, special interest money.   And one aspect of this bill that has such popular appeal is the fact  that people will realize if we reduce the role of big, dark money in  politics, we increase the voices of the people. We will have a better  chance to preserve our planet if big, dark money, special interest  money is not weighing in.   We have a better chance of protecting our children from gun violence  with background check legislation if big, dark money, in terms of our  gun lobbies, is not weighing in. We have a chance to reduce the cost of  healthcare. We have the chance to increase paychecks. The list goes on  and on.   Big, dark money has been an obstacle to progress for America's  working families, suppressing the ability of people to bargain  collectively, suppressing the rights of workers in our country. So,  again, this is, as Mr. Sarbanes says, this caffeinates all the other  issues because it gives people confidence that it really can happen,  that we really can pass legislation that is not dominated, and the  debate of it is not suffocated. The airways suffocated big, dark money.   Of course, we have to look at what is happening in terms of  misinformation in the social media and the rest. And what we want to do  is to clear the air; clear the air of that big, dark money; clear the  air of political gerrymandering; and clear the air of the voter  suppression that is out there.   Just last night, the Georgia House passed a draconian new voter  restriction bill, which would end weekend voting, slash the number of  mail ballot drop boxes, impose restrictive voter ID for mail ballots,  among other actions.   They know that their issues are losers with the America people when  they oppose some of the issues that are very popular in the public  domain. They know that big money and voter suppression is their path to  victory, and that is why they are engaged in this. These voter  suppression tactics are fundamentally discriminatory.   In 2018, 70 percent of the Georgia voters purged from the rolls were  African American. And nationwide, counties with larger minority  populations had fewer polling places and poll workers per voter. In  fact, 1 in 13 Black Americans cannot vote due to disenfranchisement  laws nationwide.   We must ensure that all voters have a voice in their democracy,  particularly in light of many grave challenges that our Nation faces  today. Strong, clean, ethical leadership for the people is needed to  tackle today's crisis, ranging from the pandemic and economic crisis to  the national reckoning on racial equality and justice, and, as I  mentioned earlier, the surging climate crisis.   The For The People Act will meet this moment. Again, the moment:  restoring the public's trust in government, and re-empowering our  leaders to fight in the people's interest, not the special interest. It  will combat big, dark money in politics, taking on the power of special  interests, forcing disclosure, reining in the lobbyist influence and  empowering small donors.   I do believe that one of the most undemocratic acts of the Supreme  Court of the United States in its history was the so-called Citizens  United decision.   How could the Justices of the Supreme Court ever have made such a  decision?   I don't know if they examined their conscience in light of what has  happened since then with big, dark money weighing in. And they gave  very little opportunity--usually when the Court makes a decision,  Congress can act, change the law, change the perspective, make it more  constitutional, whatever the question is; but not with Citizens United.  They went all out, closed every window to any opportunity to make  change in the House of Representatives, except one: Disclosure.   Disclosure. They said, okay, you can pass a law that says you must  disclose. When this decision was made, we tried to have a disclosure  act. We had 59 votes in the Senate, not 60. So we couldn't pass it  because the Republicans in the Senate said, No, we cannot insist on  disclosure.   When that happened, the Chamber of Commerce, it was reported that  they said, oh, if we had to disclose, our members would not be giving  of their chamber, would not be giving in the big amounts because they  didn't want the public, their employees, their customers, their clients  to know how much big money they were spending to suppress the vote and  the discussion in our country.   So the Republicans supported low disclosure. The money flowed and  continues to flow. It must be stopped.   Now, it would take a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens  United, and I think we should strive for that. However, in the  meantime, it would take an act of Congress to say: You are proud of who  you are supporting in a big, dark money way?   Disclose it. Let's have disclosure. The public has a right to know,  your employees have a right to know, your customers and your community  has a right to know how you are weighing in against their interests,  against clean air for their children, clean safety in  [[Page H980]]  terms of water safety in their neighborhoods in terms of gun violence  protection, safety in terms of preserving the planet, safety in terms  of issues that relate to the health. The list goes on and on.   There is a direct connection between the suppression of the vote; the  suffocation of the airways with big, dark money; and the health and  well-being of the American people.   So this bill will combat big, dark money in politics. As I said, it  will expand voting rights, ensuring secure and accurate elections,  guarding elections from foreign interference. Let me say that again.   Why would the Republicans oppose guarding the elections from foreign  interference?   This is one of the most popular aspects of this legislation in the  public.    Again, the For the People Act would hold elected officials  accountable, establishing tougher ethics, establishing conflict of  interest rules for all government officials to ensure that public  officials are working for the public good.   The For the People Act is unifying, supported by a majority of the  American people across the country, Democrats, Republicans,  Independents, more than 170 civil rights groups, environmental, faith- based, consumer protection, and gun safety groups, all of whom know  this legislation is urgently needed.   Two examples. Stacey Abrams of Fair Fight wrote yesterday: ``The For  the People Act understands the facets of free and fair elections:  mitigating voter suppression, advancing a fair redistricting process,  and empowering small dollar donors to have a more prominent rule in our  elections. Together, this comprehensive bill signals a restoration of  our Nation's commitment to the most durable democratic Republic.''   I will say it again: Together, this comprehensive bill signals a  restoration of our Nation's commitment to the world's most durable  democratic Republic, the United States of America.   Passing and enacting H.R. 1 will put the American people back in  charge of the Republic, paving the way for transformative progress in  terms of policy for our country, for the future, for our children. With  this legislation, we can build back better for the people, advancing  justice, opportunity, and progress for families in every ZIP Code.   Madam Speaker, to restore our democracy and to advance progress for  the people, I urge a strong vote for H.R. 1, the For the People Act.   Again, I express my appreciation to Madam Chair Zoe Lofgren, John  Sarbanes, and so many others; Mondaire Jones, speaking for the freshman  class and what it means to young people to come into the process, not  to be blocked by big, dark money and foreign influence in our  elections.   Vote against foreign influence in elections. Vote for H.R. 1.
