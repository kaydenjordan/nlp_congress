 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Postal Service Reform Act.   As my colleagues have pointed out here, this is a long-overdue reform  measure that will ensure 6-day delivery, eliminate the prefund mandate  which, by the way, applies only to the U.S. Postal Service. Not a  single other government agency across this Nation  [[Page H1048]]  has been subject to this wildly outrageous provision that has  significantly undermined the financial stability of the post office.   Madam Speaker, the very first Postmaster General was someone from my  hometown of Philadelphia, a man by the name of Ben Franklin. His annual  salary was $1,000 a year. And you look at the history of the U.S.  Postal Service, all the way up to and including the time of the COVID- 19 pandemic where they were up there on the front lines serving our  communities, serving our constituents, making sure that our country  continued to run. We owe them this support to reform these measures and  ensure the stability and strength of our hero letter carriers and  postal workers across our Nation.
