 Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise  today to commemorate and celebrate the life of a great and noble  American, Ms. Bessie Swindle, who will be laid to rest.   Madam Speaker, Ms. Swindle was born in 1939 at a time when she could  buy a hat but she couldn't try it on. She was relegated to the balcony  of the movie and the back of the bus.   Yet, notwithstanding all of the obstacles that life afforded her, she  was a servant to multiple elected officials: two constables and two  mayors.   She has been given a day in her honor by Mayor Bill White in 2007.   She was, literally, a commissioner without a commission. She was a  council person without a council. She was a lawyer without a license.  She was the person who gave hope to the hopeless and help to the  helpless.   She lived up to the words of Ruth Smeltzer:         Some measure their lives by days and years,        Others by heartthrobs, passions, and tears.        But the surest measure under God's sun,        Is what for others in your lifetime have you done.    God bless you, dear Bessie. We love you. Your spirit will live  forever, and your legacy will continue to change the lives of others.   You made headway when others were making headlines.   We love you.                            ____________________
