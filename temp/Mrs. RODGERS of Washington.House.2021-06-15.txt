 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I want to also thank my colleague from Washington State  (Mr. Kilmer) for his attention to the Puget Sound, and his commitment  to putting us on a better path.   The Puget Sound is in crisis. The salmon in Puget Sound, the salmon  that are most crucial to the orcas, are in crisis. You can see right  here; this is the State of Salmon report. This is the graphic  Washington State of Salmon report, and it says that the Puget Sound  Chinook, the Puget Sound steelhead--over here--are in crisis.   And I might just point out, the Snake River Chinook are actually  approaching goal. The Snake River steelhead are making progress. It is  part of the reason that I believe the Puget Sound SOS Act is so  important, to bring much needed oversight and enforcement of Federal  pollution standards in Puget Sound. But we must do more.   Despite NOAA's research indicating that these salmon stocks are the  most critical to our orcas, the State of Washington continues to allow  outdated sewage treatment plants to illegally dump raw sewage into the  Sound, creating conditions that are literally suffocating the salmon.   Over the years, 80 sewage treatment plants have illegally dumped  toxins into the Sound, and now the Washington State Department of  Ecology is considering permits to allow 58 plants to continue poisoning  the water. It is unacceptable.   By establishing a Puget Sound Recovery National Program Office, I  hope this bill will finally push the EPA to hold the State of  Washington accountable for the damage that unchecked pollution in the  Sound is doing for our endangered salmon and orcas.   It is also critically important that we stop this pollution at its  source so that the money we are authorizing for the Puget Sound  Recovery Act is actually effective.   Madam Speaker, I am urging leadership in my State, stop the sewage,  save our Sound, save our salmon, save our orcas.
