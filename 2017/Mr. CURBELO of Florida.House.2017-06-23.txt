 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support  of H.R. 2842, the Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act.   Here in the House, we have prioritized helping Americans escape  poverty, and we are working to create policies that are focused on  getting individuals into jobs so they can achieve self-sufficiency.   A job is something that dignifies the human condition. It is an  opportunity for every individual to make a contribution to their  family, their local community, and to our country.   This bill is an innovative solution that will give more people access  to that opportunity. Through proposals like H.R. 2842, we can help  struggling Americans find work and get on the path to success.   This bipartisan legislation connects Americans looking for work with  employers looking to fill job openings, including through  apprenticeships and other forms of on-the-job training. It uses $100  million from the TANF Contingency Fund for grants so States can conduct  demonstration projects intended to assist TANF recipients in entering  the workforce and maintaining employment.   Importantly, this legislation requires that States meet certain  criteria to ensure they achieve their intended goal. This includes a  description of how local governments will coordinate these efforts with  others that assist low-income individuals.   States must also report on the outcomes of the demonstration projects  and provide evaluations to determine whether such employer-led  partnerships were effective.   This bill empowers States, giving them the ability to take into  account their own unique challenges and design programs that meet both  their employers' and job seekers' needs, rather than a top-down  Washington approach.   This legislation has support from our business leaders. I include  this letter of support in the Record.                                            Business Roundtable,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2017.      Hon. Carlos Curbelo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Danny K. Davis,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Curbelo and Representative Davis:       Business Roundtable appreciates your bipartisan efforts to       bring more people into the workforce who currently have few       skills and lack job experience. Your bill, H.R. 2842, the       Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act, is a       thoughtful approach for encouraging companies to hire       recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).       We are pleased to support it.        Business Roundtable CEOs believe earn-and-learn programs       help people become familiar with the workplace, gain needed       skills, and earn a wage. In many inner cities, the       unemployment rate for young people is distressingly high, but       their prospects improve dramatically if they find a first-      time job.        By supporting partnerships among business, government, and       education to hire  [[Page H5116]]       TANF recipients, the Accelerating Individuals into the       Workforce Act will give the unemployed an opportunity to work       and succeed.            Sincerely,      Wes Bush,        Chair, Education and Workforce Committee, Business       Roundtable; Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President,       Northrop Grumman Corporation.     Mr. Chairman, I was happy to partner with  Representative Danny Davis on this effort to move individuals from  welfare into long-term employment, and I am proud of the work we have  done together.   I would also like to thank Chairman Brady and Subcommittee Chairman  Adrian Smith for their leadership and hard work, as well as Rosemary  Lahasky, Anne DeCesaro, and the rest of the House Committee on Ways and  Means staff who have worked on this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, if I may add one thing. Last week, in the wake of the  tragic shooting against Members of Congress, we all vowed to come  together, to find common ground. The Committee on Ways and Means  answered that call, and I am very confident that this House will do the  same later today.   The American people expect us to have our differences, our  disagreements, but they also expect us to find common ground; and  Republicans and Democrats have done this today in favor of those who  need it most, welfare recipients, needy families in our country. I am  very proud to sponsor this legislation, to support it, and I would ask  all of my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, June 26,  2017, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m.  for legislative business.
