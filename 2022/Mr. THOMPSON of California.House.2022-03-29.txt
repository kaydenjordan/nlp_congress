 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal and  Ranking Member Brady for their hard work on this important piece of  legislation.   The Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2021 is bipartisan  legislation that gives workers the tools they need to retire with the  financial stability they deserve and worked so hard to obtain.   Importantly, this legislation allows individuals to pay down a  student loan instead of contributing to a 401(k) plan while still  receiving an employer match in their retirement plan.   I have heard from thousands of individuals in my district who are  facing an overwhelming amount of student loan debt. These are people  who are struggling to start their careers while also trying to pay off  their loans. The SECURE Act provides the opportunity to make payments  on their student loans now while also investing in their future.   I am proud to support this legislation that we are hearing today, and  I thank you for this great bipartisan bill that you have put before us.
