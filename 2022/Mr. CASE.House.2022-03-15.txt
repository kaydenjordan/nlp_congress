 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1908,  the Ka'ena Point National Heritage Area Act. I wish first to recognize  and say ``mahalo,'' or thank you, to my partner in our Hawaii  congressional delegation, Representative Kaiali'i Kahele, who co- introduced this bill with me.   Our bill directs the U.S. Department of the Interior to study whether  Ka'ena Point, a treasured wilderness area on the western tip of the  island of O'ahu, should be designated as a national heritage area, or  NHA. The 3-year study would evaluate whether Ka'ena Point holds  invaluable resources that reflect our country's heritage and are worthy  of conservation and special recognition nationally. Such a designation  would also offer critical support to our local community in Hawaii to  conserve the area for present and future use.   I am certain that Ka'ena Point is a perfect candidate for NHA  designation. It houses a rich cultural and environmental history. It is  the location of one of Hawaii's most sacred places, a leina a ka  `uhane, a leaping place of souls where, according to native Hawaiian  tradition, the spirits of the recently deceased leap from this realm to  the next.   As one of the last few remaining and easily accessible wilderness  areas on O'ahu, the sand dunes of Ka'ena Point are home to a number of  endemic and endangered species, such as the Hawaiian monk seal, laysan  albatross, and the ohai flower.   Our bill will ensure the full collaboration of the local community in  preserving the traditions and pristine nature of Ka'ena Point. The  community, our local organizations, fishers, hikers, and neighborhood  groups, will be fully  [[Page H3723]]  engaged throughout the study process and, if the area is eventually  designated as an NHA, will be integral partners in the area's  management.   Finally, I also thank the chairs and ranking members of my full  Committee on Natural Resources and Subcommittee on National Parks,  Forests and Public Lands, and our staffs for your understanding and  support of our proposal.   And yes, to the ranking member, I look forward to showing you Ka'ena  Point as soon as you can come out.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1931,  the Japanese American Confinement Education Act, as well as H.R. 6434,  the Japanese American World War II History Network Act, which we will  consider later today.   I am honored and humbled to cosponsor these measures, and I sincerely  thank my colleagues from California, Representatives Matsui and  Obernolte, for their work in crafting both pieces of legislation to  ensure that the inexcusable injustices faced by our Nation's Japanese  American community during World War II are never forgotten.   The memory of World War II evokes one of the darkest periods of our  history as a country, the mass internment of Japanese Americans. Over  the course of the war, our Federal Government forcibly relocated and  incarcerated about 120,000 Japanese Americans, the majority of whom  were U.S. citizens, in barbed wire enclosed camps.   H.R. 1931 and H.R. 6434 both strengthen our ability, if not  necessity, to tell what happened in these confinement sites, and to  ensure that future generations learned what happened so it never occurs  again.   I urge my colleagues to honor and remember the Japanese Americans who  were incarcerated at still-infamous sites like Manzanar, Tule Lake,  where my wife's uncle and aunt, simple truck farmers from Sacramento,  were interned, Heart Mountain, and the Honouliuli Internment Camp in  Honolulu by voting ``yes'' on both H.R. 1931 and H.R. 6434.                                time  1500
