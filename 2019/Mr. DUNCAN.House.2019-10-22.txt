 Madam Speaker, the American people are asking: What in  the world is going on in the people's House? But it is easy to see when  you hear the words from Mr. Green from Texas, who said: ``If we don't  impeach this President, he will get reelected.''   That has led to closed-door hearings, secret depositions, and a  parity by a committee chairman. Nothing good happens in the dark behind  closed doors. In fact, the German people knew this after reunification  at the end of World War II.   At the end of years of being behind the Iron Curtain, they rebuilt  their Parliament with a glass dome and a mirrored spire, directing  sunlight into the chamber, a chamber made of glass walls for sunlight  and transparency.   This people's House operates the same way, or at least it should,  until these hearings, behind closed doors, these secret depositions  happen.   Madam Speaker, I support President Trump.                            ____________________
