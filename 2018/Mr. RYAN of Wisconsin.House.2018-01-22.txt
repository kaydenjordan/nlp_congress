 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say a few words about the last couple of  days.   I know there is great relief that this episode is coming to an end.  This shutdown did not need to happen. However brief, it inflicted  needless costs on the country.   There are no winners here today--I want to make that clear--no  winners except for, perhaps, the millions of families who depend on the  Children's Health Insurance Program. Soon the longest reauthorization  in the program's history is about to become law.   But this is not a moment to pat ourselves on the back, not even  close. We very much need to heed the lessons of what just happened  here.   We need to move forward in good faith: yes, on DACA and immigration  and, yes, on funding our military so that it gets the resources that  our military so badly needs. Let's address these urgent challenges.   Finally, I think all of us want to join in thanking the men and women  who  [[Page H620]]  serve in our Armed Forces and who serve in our government around the  country and around the globe. They and their families are the ones that  kind of get caught up in things like this. For them, these aren't  political debates; they are livelihoods.   The country's safety and security depend on responsible governing.  That is why I sincerely hope that we never find ourselves in this  position again.   I thank all of our Members for their patience this week.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to the order of the House of today, the previous question is  ordered.   The question is on the motion by the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy).   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
