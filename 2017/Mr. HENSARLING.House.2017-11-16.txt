 Mr. Speaker, for almost a decade, Americans suffered  under Obamanomics. Their savings remain decimated, their paychecks were  stagnant, and their American dreams were diminished.   But, Mr. Speaker, a new day has dawned. Under the leadership of  President Trump, Speaker Ryan, and Chairman Brady, we are on the  precipice of passing a fairer, flatter, simpler, and more competitive  Tax Code, one built for 3-plus percent economic growth.   The American people can now imagine a Tax Code that brings jobs and  capital back to America. They can imagine a Tax Code that is simplified  from 70,000 pages to 500, where 90 percent of Americans can fill out  their return on a postcard. They can imagine a Tax Code swept of all  the special interest loopholes. They can imagine a Tax Code creating  lower rates for working Americans and small businesses, and they can  now imagine a Tax Code that is all about economic growth.   All my friends on the other side of the aisle can offer is the  politics of division, envy, and class warfare.   I am proud to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because it is all  about better jobs, fair taxes, and bigger paychecks.
