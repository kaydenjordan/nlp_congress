 Madam Speaker, as a 34-year-old woman, I can tell you  that affordable and accessible childcare is a top priority for my  generation, but the problem isn't that millennials can't budget or that  we are eating too much avocado toast; it is that the cost of childcare  has skyrocketed, if you can even find it.   In San Diego, the average annual cost for childcare for one infant in  a licensed center is more than $19,000, which is out of reach for most  middle- and low-income families.   And it is not any easier for providers who are in one of the lowest  paid professions in the country and struggle to make ends meet and keep  their doors open.   The free market hasn't fixed the childcare crisis, and small or  temporary fixes just aren't good enough.   That is why I am proud to introduce the Child Care for Every  Community Act today with Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congresswoman  Mikie Sherrill.   Our bicameral legislation would guarantee access to childcare that is  affordable for every family, and it would support childcare workers in  their incredibly important work.   We need big, wholesale changes to our social safety net to support  kids and families starting with the Child Care for Every Community Act.                            ____________________
