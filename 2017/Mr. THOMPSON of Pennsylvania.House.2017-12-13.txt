 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  the 381st birthday of the National Guard.   A component of the United States Army, the National Guard is  primarily composed of citizen soldiers who hold down full-time civilian  jobs or attend school. At the same time, National Guard members are  available to provide support and protection for their States or to be  called for military operations for the country. They serve their  community and their country.   Each U.S. State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico, and the territories of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands maintain  both an Army National Guard and an Air National Guard.   The Massachusetts General Court issued an order on December 13, 1636,  requiring all able-bodied men between the ages of 16 and 60 to create a  standing Army for protection. With that order, what we now know as  America's National Guard was born. The idea was simple: establish an  Army of citizen soldiers who could be called upon to fight when needed.    In honor of the National Guard's birthday, here are some lesser known  facts about the branch: each member of the National Guard is sworn to  uphold two constitutions, Federal and State. The term ``National  Guard'' didn't become an official term until 1916. 50,000 members of  the National Guard were called to take on various missions during the  9/11 attacks in 2001. Only two Presidents have served in the National  Guard in its modern structure: Harry S. Truman and George W. Bush.   The National Guard is older than the Army. Militias were used as  early as 1636 to protect British colonies. The U.S. Army wasn't formed  until the beginning of the Revolutionary War.   American Samoa is the only territory of the United States to not have  a National Guard unit.   National Guard units were called minutemen during the American  Revolution due to their rapid response ability.   The most senior member of each State National Guard unit is the  adjutant general. Some States elect the adjutant general while others  have their Governor appoint someone to that position.   The National Guard formed one of the first all-African-American units  in U.S. military history, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteers. Their  creation was met with mixed reactions, but the unit serves to this day,  and the first African American to receive a Medal of Honor, William  Harvey Carney, hailed from it.   The National Guard is second only to the United States Army in terms  of number of members.   Mr. Speaker, I commend all those who join the ranks of the esteemed  National Guard. They answer the call of duty to protect their community  and their country. We are grateful for their service and proud of their  commitment.   Happy 381st birthday to the National Guard.

Supervisor Glossner, who is 84, will retire this year after 47 years  of service. Next Tuesday, he will oversee his last board of supervisors  meeting.   Supervisor Glossner has been a resident of the township his entire  life. He is a member of the Forty and Eight organization and the Masons  in Lock Haven.   He and his wife of 60 years, Wilma, were married in 1955 in First  Evangelical United Brethren Church in Lock Haven. In September 1955,  Clyde and Wilma purchased their home in Woodward Township. They still  live there today, and they have three grown sons.   In his earlier years, Supervisor Glossner worked as a food inspector  for the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. He has shown his  dedication to his neighbors through his years of public service, and  the community will gather next Tuesday, December 19, at the Dunnstown  Fire Hall to honor him.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Supervisor Glossner for a life of service, and  I wish him well in his retirement.                            ____________________
