 Mr. Speaker, for over 6 years, we have watched House  Republicans attack the Affordable Care Act. The law may not be perfect,  but Republicans can't ignore the fact that the ACA has allowed 30  million Americans to access affordable health care.   Calls and emails have poured into my office from my constituents who  are begging me to do everything in my power to protect their health  care and to strengthen the ACA. Earlier this week I received an email  from Brian in San Bernardino, who shared that his wife didn't have  insurance before the ACA. When the law went into effect, she had a  physical, whereby doctors discovered she had ovarian cancer. It was  caught early and treated, and now she is living healthy in San  Bernardino. If she had not obtained health insurance through the ACA,  she wouldn't have had a preventative screening, which saved her life.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot strip 30 million people of their health care.  We cannot look people in the eyes and say we are doing everything we  can to help them if we allow insurance companies to discriminate  against them and to cap their coverage. I will not compromise their  health care or our future, and neither should you.                            ____________________
