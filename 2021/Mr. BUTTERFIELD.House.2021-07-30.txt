 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the important  work being done all across North Carolina to reduce food insecurity.   I commend the outgoing president of the North Carolina Association of  County Commissioners, Ronnie Smith, for his leadership on this effort.  Ronnie is also chair of the Martin County Board of Commissioners, a  constituent, and a good friend.   Under Ronnie's leadership, the association's Resilience Task Force  was formed to develop local strategies to promote food system  resilience. The task force recently released a report to help counties  deepen relationships with the local food banks, improve efforts to  transport food to homes, and strengthen local food sources to reduce  food insecurity.   To date, nearly a quarter of North Carolina's counties have passed  resolutions to support the initiative. This year, 42 million people  nationwide will experience food insecurity.   Madam Speaker, I applaud President Ronnie Smith's leadership. I  applaud him for his leadership and commend him and the members of the  Resilience Task Force for their hard work in combating food insecurity  in North Carolina. Thank you, Commissioner Ronnie Smith.                            ____________________
