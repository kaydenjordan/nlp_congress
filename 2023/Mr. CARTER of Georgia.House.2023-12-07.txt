 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Kevin  Exley, who was recently elected city councilman for the city of Rincon  on September 21, 2023.   The city of Rincon opened polls up for a special election to fill an  empty council seat after Damon Rahn's departure in June. Now, thanks to  Kevin Exley, that seat is occupied.   Exley has made it known that he wants to focus on updating  ordinances, adjusting term limits, and adding some neighborhood safety  measures.   Rincon's special election was, indeed, special. September 19 started  out with only a few voters but quickly grew to hundreds showing up to  cast their ballots.   We congratulate Kevin. We know he will serve the city of Rincon well.                            ____________________
