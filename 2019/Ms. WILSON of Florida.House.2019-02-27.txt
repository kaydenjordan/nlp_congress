 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my  name be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 787.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to address an  actual national emergency. There are too many damn guns in America, and  far too many lives have been lost. Last year alone 40,000 Americans  were fatally shot, the most in 50 years.   My county suffers from gun violence on a near-daily basis. In the  last 5 years, we have lost 370 people to gun violence; 127 of these  victims were children.   Recently, a pregnant mother was killed, and her teenage daughter  injured in a senseless shooting. The family had already lost a relative  to gun violence.   Almost as shocking as these statistics, for 25 years Congress failed  to pass significant gun control legislation until today. I am comforted  by how swiftly House Democrats began tackling this crisis, and pray  that the Senate finds the courage to follow our lead.   American voters sent us an urgent message last November; thoughts and  prayers and moments of silence are not enough. Let us reassure them  that passing the Background Checks Act of 2019 is just the first step  of many more to come; and we won't stop until this national emergency  is over.                            ____________________
