 Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Carmella  Mary Rizzo, who passed away at the age of 101 on July 15, 2018.  Carmella was the wife of former Philadelphia mayor Frank L. Rizzo and  will be remembered for her community advocacy and political prowess. I  admired her very much, and I am grateful to have known her.   Born on July 25, 1916, Carmella was raised in a large family in the  Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia. The daughter of first- generation Italian Americans, her family encouraged her to form her own  identity and establish close ties within the Philadelphia community. In  1942, she married Frank L. Rizzo, a Philadelphia police officer. Frank  and Carmella had two children, Francis and Joanna.   During her husband's time as police commissioner and as a two-term  mayor of Philadelphia, Carmella avoided the spotlight. She did,  however, play a private yet pivotal role in Mayor Rizzo's career.  Notably compassionate, Carmella regularly discussed community affairs  with her husband during his administration in the 1970s. Carmella's  insight and charisma proved invaluable to the city of Philadelphia.   Carmella passed away just a day shy of the 27th anniversary of Mayor  Rizzo's passing. In the years after his death, she remained very close  to her children and grandchildren.   It is my honor to commemorate the life of Carmella Rizzo, a woman  whose decades of advocacy for Philadelphians has set an example for  many to follow.                            ____________________
