 Madam Speaker, it is a great honor to recognize Wayne  Metropolitan Community Action Agency's After-School 21st Century  Learning Centers program participants. The young people who have  participated in this program have shown initiative and growth.   Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency has been a resource for  the people of Wayne County. Their wraparound programming demonstrates  an understanding that investing in our children is investing in a  better future and better quality of life for all the residents in the  13th Congressional District. The young people who have participated in  this program have shown determination to achieve their highest  potential.   It is an honor to recognize our young people in this program and,  hopefully, be able to show that they can be an investment for the  future, and I acknowledge their outstanding accomplishment.                            ____________________
