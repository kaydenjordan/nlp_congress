 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act.   With Chairman Brady's leadership, my colleagues and I worked hard to  combine our ideas to help Americans across the Nation have lower taxes,  better careers, and more money in their family budget.   Over the past year, it has been a collaborative effort. I have  listened to and worked with people and businesses about their ideas on  tax reform from all across the Second Congressional District of  Arkansas. With today's vote, we are one step closer to reforming our  broken Tax Code.   Over the past several months, we have worked to reduce taxes on  families and let them keep more of their money. For businesses, we want  to have a more competitive tax system that promotes investment, which  will spur our economic growth and family prosperity.   According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, H.R. 1 will raise after- tax incomes for hardworking Arkansans by over $2,000. Furthermore, H.R.  1 benefits families by increasing the child tax credit to $1,600,  instead of $1,000. That helps over 50,000 taxpayers in my district.   By passing this bill, it could lead to the creation of an additional  5,000 jobs.                            ____________________
