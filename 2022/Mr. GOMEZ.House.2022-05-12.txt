 Mr. Speaker, Latino servicemembers have been vital to the  defense of our country, including the thousands who have made the  ultimate sacrifice. It is important that our communities and our  government pay tribute to the diverse history of Latinos in the United  States military, which is why I am proud that the House passed my bill,  H.R. 5900, honoring World War II hero, Private Jacob Cruz, an Angeleno  and Boyle Heights resident, and a United States Marine Corps Reserve  private.   Private Cruz was 17 years old and a junior at Roosevelt High School  when he asked his single immigrant mother, Gracia Cruz, a custodian at  White Memorial Medical Center, for permission to enlist. After initial  training, Private Cruz shipped off to the Pacific where he gave his  life running ammunition boxes to gunners amid enemy fire during the  Battle of Tarawa in 1943.   Private Cruz's heroic devotion to duty posthumously earned him the  Silver Star and the Purple Heart. Unfortunately, his remains were not  recovered after he was killed. During a storm in 2019, Mother Nature  brushed away a house where the battle took place, and the remains of  Mr. Cruz were found. In 2020 they were identified, and in 2021 they  were finally returned to Private Cruz' family for a long-awaited proper  burial with full military honors.   In recognition of Private Cruz' service and sacrifice, the House  passed H.R. 5900 designating the Boyle Heights Post Office as the  Marine Corps Reserve Private Jacob Cruz Post Office.   I take a moment to give thanks to Private Cruz' family, including his  brother, Isaac; his sister, Ruth; his nephews, Mike and Isaac; and his  niece, Alta, who have kept Private Cruz' legacy alive in Boyle Heights  for almost eight decades and never gave up the fight to bring him home.   As we approach Memorial Day, I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 5900 to  honor Private Cruz' sacrifice and those of other Latino military  heroes, both fallen and alive, in Los Angeles and across the country  for decades to come.   Roosevelt High School, where Private Cruz attended, has a long  history, as well as Garfield High School, in giving up boys to go to  fight the World Wars. There is a football game called the East L.A.  Classic between Roosevelt and Garfield. The 4 years during World War II  were the only years that they couldn't field a team on either side.  This is an honor of Private Cruz, but it is also an honor of all the  Latino men who gave their lives during our conflicts, especially during  World War II.                            ____________________
