 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   I rise only to express my real disappointment in the way that this  bill has been brought to the floor. Had the majority not insisted on a  closed rule, preventing the House from voting on any and all amendments  to repair and improve S. 1094, I would have offered an amendment to  ensure that it applies in a way that respects the due process rights of  Federal workers, and that it would apply only to collective bargaining  agreements ratified on or after enactment.   I support the goal of improving accountability at the VA, but I want  to make sure it is not done in a way that prejudices and undermines the  collective bargaining rights and the due process rights of the  workforce.   There are real problems at the VA now, we know. There are 45- to  49,000 vacancies there. There is bureaucratic dysfunction in a lot of  places, and all that this bill would do is to change the evidentiary  standard of proof from the preponderance of the evidence to substantial  evidence in leveling sanctions and discipline against employees.   That is a tiny detail. It is an irrelevant distraction from the  massive problems that actually are facing the VA today. So we should be  filling these vacancies. We should be improving the function of the VA,  but we should not use this or that problem as an excuse to undermine  the due process rights of the workforce. That sets a terrible example  for the Federal workforce, generally, and it does nothing to repair the  underlying problems and inadequacies that are taking place at the VA.
