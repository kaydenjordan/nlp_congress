 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the chairman,  Chairman Shuster, and the committee for all of their work on WRDA. It  has been timely, and they have been a joy to work with.   WRDA 2000, however, authorized a plan known as the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan and it granted the authority to the  Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works to provide credit to  the State of Florida for reasonable cost of any work that was performed  toward the completion of the project. However, current law does have  some ambiguity that my amendment clarifies with respect to when the  work is performed.   Now, the Army Corps ultimately has the discretion to determine what  work performed by Florida is integral to the project, and this  amendment makes no change to that discretion whatsoever.   Questions have been raised with regard to the scope of the Army  Corps' authority to grant credit for work Florida has done that is not  explicitly stated in the Project Partnership Agreement. My amendment  clarifies that, so long as the Secretary and Florida agree that the  work completed during the construction phase is integral to the  project, the Secretary does, in fact, have the authority to provide  credit for that work that is done.   I appreciate the full committee and the subcommittee's leadership  working with me on this language, and I encourage my colleagues to  adopt this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again I applaud the committee on their work,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
