 Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the No Abortion Bonds  Act, to end Federal tax-exempt bonds that support abortion providers.   Under a loophole in the current law, cities, counties, and States can  issue Federal tax-free bonds to finance construction of abortion  clinics.   In 2012, the New York City government issued a tax-free $15 million  bond for a $30 million renovation of Planned Parenthood's national  headquarters, which was subsequently sold 3 years later for $60  million. In 2007, Sarasota County, Florida, floated an $8 million tax- free bond to pay for a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic.   These tax-free bonds are intended to finance schools, hospitals,  infrastructure--not abortion clinics.   The No Abortion Bonds Act has over 30 bipartisan cosponsors and is  endorsed by Americans United for Life, Susan B. Anthony List, National  Right to Life, March for Life, the Family Policy Alliance, and the  Eagle Forum.   Please join me today in applying the spirit of the Hyde amendment to  the Tax Code by preventing tax-free bonds from going to abortion  providers.                            ____________________
