 Madam Speaker, I am here to tell a story about gun  violence that spans multiple generations, and it started in my hometown  of Camden, a city in New Jersey.   A tragic event happened in Camden in 1949. Howard Unruh shot and  killed 13 people. This event is now considered the first modern mass  shooting in our country's history.   During those horrific events that unfolded, a 12-year-old boy hid in  the closet as his mother and father were slaughtered. His name was  Charles Cohen, and nearly 70 years later in a school in Parkland,  Florida, his own granddaughter, Carly Novell, hid in a closet, just  like her grandfather did. Carly is with us today to see how true  democracy works.   I will end with Carly's words. She said: ``This pain shouldn't be  generational.''   She is right. It shouldn't have happened, and we must do more for our  children, for our grandchildren, and for everyone in our communities.                            ____________________
