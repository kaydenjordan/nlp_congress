 First, Madam President, we will do a little  housekeeping, and then I will give my remarks.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Madam President, on Friday, the city of Memphis released  the brutal, truly sickening body cam footage of the murder of Tyre  Nichols.   I am heartbroken, horrified, and appalled by this heinous murder.  This should have just been a routine traffic stop. It never, never  should have ended the way it did, in unnecessary violence and  bloodshed.   The repetitiveness of unjust murders like Tyre Nichols' is a stain on  America. The five police officers who betrayed their oath to serve and  protect should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.   We should remember Tyre for who he was and for the life he lived. By  all accounts, he was a beautiful and gentle soul. He was creative, he  was energetic, and he was deeply passionate about the things he loved  most: sunsets, skateboarding, and, above all, his family. He was a  father, a son, a friend, a talented young man with his whole life ahead  of him, and he should still be alive today.   So let us honor his memory by bringing lasting, meaningful change to  create a more just and a more fair America, our long-trodden path to  try and make this country--this beautiful country--a more perfect place  and a more perfect nation.                            ____________________     Madam President, on the debt ceiling, one of Congress's  top priorities this year is ensuring the United States does not default  on its debt for the first time in our history. Even approaching a  default would be disastrous for American families. The damages will  show up on everything from people's credit card bills, their mortgage  rates, and when applying for things as basic as a car loan. It risks  thousands of dollars lit on fire for millions of American families.  Everyone's life in this country will take many steps backward if we  default.   Now, Republicans have done a lot of talking about cuts, but when it  comes to actually showing us a plan for avoiding default, they are  playing a dangerous game. Republicans, it is time to come out of  hiding, put pen to paper, and show us your plan. Republicans, show us  your plan.   According to some reports, Republicans want significant cuts across  the board. But from where? Is funding for our troops safe? We don't  know. Republicans, show us the plan.   Is funding for police and firefighters and first responders safe?  Republicans, show us the plan.  [[Page S138]]    Is funding for Social Security and Medicare safe, which some in that  party, particularly on the MAGA wing, think should be cut? We don't  know. Show us the plan.   The silence is unacceptable because the American people have a right  to know whether they are going to see crucial services suddenly dry up.  And if Republicans don't get their way, Americans have a right to know  whether or not the hard-right GOPers are really prepared to lead the  House Republican conference to push the United States to default and  whether the Republican House, led by McCarthy, will follow them over  that devastating cliff, sending costs spiking on everything from credit  cards to auto loans, to mortgages.   We have seen in realtime how dangerous it is for Speaker McCarthy to  have empowered the most extreme elements of the GOP to set the agenda  in the House. The MAGA wing of the GOP, which has set the rules on how  the House should run, has left no doubt that, under their watch, no  form of funding, however necessary, is safe.   Democrats, meanwhile, have been very clear about our position. When  it comes to the debt ceiling, there can be no brinksmanship, no  threats, no hostage-taking. This is simply too important. It has to get  done.   Republicans need to show their plan to the American people. The clock  is ticking on the debt ceiling every day. We must make sure that a  first-ever default doesn't occur. Yet Republicans are making it more  and more likely.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on Gateway, tomorrow is a big day  for New Yorkers, as we welcome President Biden to celebrate progress on  the most important infrastructure project in America, the new Gateway  rail tunnel.   This day has been a decade in the making. The Northeast corridor is  the busiest passenger rail line in the country, and the crossing under  the Hudson is its most important nexus point. But for far too long,  these two single-track tunnels have been badly in need of repairs.   After Hurricane Sandy devastated New York and the experts said there  is limited time in which they will be operable, fixing the tunnel  became one of my greatest passions, a labor of love, because I love New  York and, without it, New York's economy would come screeching to a  halt. For years, I worked hard, bringing together public and private  partners from New York, New Jersey, and Amtrak to get everyone on the  same page on Gateway. We met a lot of resistance along the way.   When President Trump was in office, he tried to freeze progress on  the Gateway project altogether, going as far as holding it hostage in  negotiations over the border wall. Still, I was proud that, even during  the Trump administration, I was able to double, triple, quadruple, and,  in one case, increase tenfold the funding for various Federal spending  accounts pertaining to Gateway because I knew that one day--one day-- President Trump would no longer be in office.   Now, thanks to our bipartisan infrastructure bill and with great help  from President Biden, Gateway is moving forward. Under our  infrastructure law, tens of billions of more dollars have been  dedicated to Federal accounts, which will support Gateway and many,  many other large projects in the country, and this is something I am  very, very proud to celebrate.   I will have more to say in New York tomorrow, but, today, I want to  affirm once again that progress on Gateway is a very important example  of how our infrastructure bill is making life better for millions of  everyday Americans. Building two new tunnels and updating the existing  tunnels will lead to work with good-paying union jobs--tens of  thousands of jobs--and lead to a burst of economic activity for decades  to come.   I want to thank President Biden for making the trip to New York  tomorrow, and I am happy to say that, after a lot of hard work and a  lot of stubborn persistence, our efforts are finally paying off.                            ____________________     On a final note, Madam President, last Thursday, I  announced the slate of committee members for the 118th Congress on the  Democratic side. I want to thank every one of my colleagues for their  continued good work and readiness to make life better for the American  people. I expect that, by the end of this week, we will have the full  slate of all the committees fully locked in, enabling us to move  forward on the important work we have before us.   We got a good deal--a tremendous amount--of bipartisan work done last  year, and I am optimistic and hopeful that we can likewise continue  this year in a productive, bipartisan spirit whenever possible. I look  forward to having all committee memberships announced in full really  soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider PN62, Roger Israel Zakheim;  that the time until 5:30 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form on  the nomination; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate  vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in  consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider PN61, Joseph Lee Falk; that there be 10  minutes for debate, equally divided in the usual form on the  nomination; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote  on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if either  nomination is not confirmed, all action with respect to both  nominations be vitiated.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.,  on Tuesday, January 31; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and the Senate be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each; further,  that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  Republican caucus meeting.    For the information of the Senate, no rollcall votes are  expected during Tuesday's session.                            ____________________     If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order, following the remarks of Senator Scott of South  Carolina.
