 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the  heroic acts of two Pennsylvania volunteer firefighters, Chief Howard M.  Fausey, Sr., and Assistant Chief Ethan Goodbrod of Citizen's Hose  Company, Station 45, in Jersey Shore, PA.   On the evening of February 15, 2020, Chief Fausey and Assistant Chief  Goodbrod responded to a multiple alarm fire reported at the Broadway  Hotel and Restaurant in Jersey Shore, PA. The hotel is a historic  building with multiple residential apartments in its upper levels. When  Chief Fausey and Assistant Chief Goodbrod arrived on the scene, the  building was already consumed in flames, and they soon learned that a  man was trapped on the third floor. Without regard to their own  personal safety, these volunteer firefighters climbed to the third  floor on ladders, forced their way into the building by breaking a  window and removing an air-conditioner, found the trapped man amidst  heavy smoke, and safely removed him from the building. And they did not  arrive a moment too soon. The man they rescued suffered severe burns  and smoke inhalation while he was trapped inside. Thanks to Chief  Fausey's and Assistant Chief Goodbrod's heroism, he lived to see  another day and has recovered from his injuries.   Chief Fausey's and Assistant Chief Goodbrod's courageous acts call  attention to the heroic service that first responders provide for their  communities every day, often on a volunteer basis. In fact, Citizens  Hose Company, Station 45, is made up entirely of volunteers. These  individuals, many of whom hail from generations of voluntary service,  place themselves in harm's way to protect the rest of us.   We should never take for granted the risks that first responders take  to ensure that we are safe in our communities. I want to say to Chief  Fausey, to Assistant Chief Goodbrod, and to all of Pennsylvania's first  responders, that we are grateful for the service that you provide to  the community and thankful for your sacrifices.                            ____________________
