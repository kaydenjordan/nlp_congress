 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in the 1980s, as Representative Nadler said, Congress  enacted harsh penalties for Federal drug offenses, including mandatory  minimum sentences. In the 1986 act, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, it did  create 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine,  meaning an individual convicted of selling 5 grams of crack cocaine  would receive the same sentence as someone convicted of selling 500  grams of powder cocaine.   Earlier, years before, Representative Dan Lungren--he had been here  in the eighties--in 1986, when this was passed, said that Republicans  were told in 1986--with a Democratic majority--by Representative  Charley Rangel, that if they did not support the huge disparity, then  they did not care about Black neighborhoods and the scourge that crack  cocaine was creating and how it was ruining Black neighborhoods. So it  easily passed because in 1986, no one wanted to be called a racist.  This law contributed to the growth of the U.S. Federal prison  population from the 1990s through 2000s.   In 2010, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the  sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to  18:1. And as I recall, at the time, I thought it would be good to go  1:1; that is what we did in Texas when I was a judge. But if I recall  correctly, there were some Republicans that said we can't go all the  way to 1:1, but we will agree to 18:1. If that is not right, the chair  can correct me, but that is what I recall. Because I didn't see why we  didn't go ahead and go 1:1 back then and just fix it.    But that was what happened. It went from 100:1 to 18:1 disparity. But  in 2018, Congress passed--President Trump signed--the First Step Act,  which made the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive. This law allowed those  sentenced for Federal drug offenses relating to cocaine prior to the  passage of Fair Sentencing Act to move for a resentencing under the new  law.   The EQUAL Act before us today truly lives up to the name of  equalizing sentences for similar crimes and would eliminate the Federal  sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine and allow those  convicted under the prior law to move for resentencing under this new  standard.   At the State level, more than 40 States do not treat crack and powder  cocaine differently in their sentencing structures. Passage of the  EQUAL Act now would align Federal sentencing laws with the vast  majority of States.   And I would like to also say in a prior hearing Mr. Jeffries  indicated that he intended to go forward and would try to push a bill,  as the chair also had hoped, that would finally eliminate the  sentencing disparity and go 1:1.   In that hearing, I made the comment that if Mr. Jeffries would draft  a bill that did just that, then I would support that. And I am very  pleased that Mr. Jeffries, who is a man of his word, he did exactly  what he said. He prepared a bill that fixed this problem.   I am pleased to agree and to be part of what Mr. Jeffries prepared  and what the chairman has seen through our committee, and glad we are  finally going to deal with this problem and do right by the people that  are sentenced under it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend Mr. Jeffries mentioning Cedric  Richmond and also Kelly Armstrong who were such an important part of  bringing this bill to this place.   Of course, Congressman Cedric Richmond has passed on to his just  reward.  [[Page H5479]]  Of course, that means going to the White House to work. Mr. Armstrong  is still here laboring in the field. He was unable to be here and asked  that I read this statement from him into the Record.   He said: ``I wish I could be here today, but I am grateful to  Representative Gohmert for sharing my remarks with the Chamber.   ``I am proud to support passage of the EQUAL Act, which will finally  provide sentencing parity for Federal crack and powder cocaine  offenses.   ``This bill will also provide relief to those who have been sentenced  under the previous unequal guidelines. In 1986, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act  created a 100:1 sentencing disparity for crack cocaine and powder  cocaine offenses. For instance, the law created a 5-year prison  sentence for distribution of 5 grams of crack cocaine. At the same  time, an individual would need to possess 100 times that amount of  powder cocaine to receive the same sentence.   ``The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced the disparity from 100:1 to  18:1. The First Step Act of 2018 was supposed to make the 18:1 change  retroactive. The EQUAL Act not only provides sentencing parity for  crack and powder cocaine offenses, it also solves the retroactivity and  implementation issues.   ``This is not being soft on crime. It is being smart on crime. Many  Americans struggling with addiction are no stranger to the Federal  prison system. We know that addressing substance use disorder and  mental health challenges are the most effective way to help these  individuals as well as improve our communities.    ``The answer isn't to lock people up for crimes of addiction. We  tried that method for decades, it does not work. In an increasingly  partisan time, the EQUAL Act is an example of how commonsense  legislation can receive bipartisan support from across the political  spectrum. You don't have to look further than the prime sponsors of  this bill.   ``I am a conservative Republican from North Dakota. Congressman  Jeffries is a Democrat from New York City. We disagree on a lot of  issues, but we have come together to support this bill because it is  the right thing to do. It is also why this bill has broad support from  across the ideological spectrum.   ``The House Judiciary Committee reported the EQUAL Act favorably by a  vote of 36-5. The bill also is supported by dozens of group ranging  from the ACLU to Americans for Prosperity.   ``Thank you to everyone who has worked so hard to bring us to this  point. I urge everyone to support the EQUAL Act.''   That ends the statement by Mr. Kelly Armstrong.   Let me just say in conclusion--and I appreciated the comments of Mr.  Jeffries regarding treatment--what I saw during my decade on the bench  was, whether it was crack cocaine or powder cocaine, it was incredibly  additive. And every now and then somebody might be able to deal with  their addiction in a 30-day program, but normally it took a lot longer  than 30 days.   Something I thought Texas did right was have an up to 12 months  substance abuse felony punishment facility. Some thought it was strange  that a strong conservative, like myself, used that as much as I did. I  saw that this is so additive and it needs a length of time to help  people change their lives for such a time that they have got a better  chance of making it out, understanding just how addictive those  substances are, all coming from cocaine.   I know the second checks act dealt with some of those issues, but it  might be something else we can do in the future, where if you are  convicted of an offense where you are an addict, then a long-term  substance abuse facility where you are only with people with your same  problem. And it is a lockdown facility, you don't have a choice of  going anywhere.   And as I have sat and watched some of the encounters in the meetings,  like AA, that you have there in those facilities, boy, they have a BS- detector. They don't let people get away with anything. They have been  there. They know, and it had a better success rate than any other  program that I had seen.   So this is a great start toward getting the right thing done, and I  appreciate Mr. Jeffries, and in the past, Mr. Richmond--I know it was  his desire--and Chairman Nadler, for making this happen.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr.  Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's efforts in  regard to this bill.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
