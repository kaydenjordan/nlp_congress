 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    The Presiding Officer and I and another 20 or so Senators  listened yesterday in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee  to the CEOs of the Nation's six largest banks testify to our committee.  Those six CEOs are among--or maybe the six most--powerful business  people in America.   I look to what has happened to my hometown of Mansfield, OH, and to  Zanesville, OH, and Lima and Chillicothe and Portsmouth and  Springfield--medium-size industrial cities that 40 years ago were  prosperous industrial communities that created and which were the homes  of thousands--tens of thousands, really, of good-paying union jobs,  allowing people out of high school to go into the plant and make a  decent middle-class living, allowing them to send their kids to North  Central State or Mansfield OSU or Denison or schools all over Ohio.   But in the last 30 or 40 years, we have seen what Wall Street has  done. Wall Street has done just fine for themselves. We have seen  profits go up dramatically. We have seen executive compensation  stratospheric--tens of millions of dollars for most of these CEOs and  their earnings every year and their compensation.   But we see middle-class wages in places like Toledo and Akron simply  flat. And we heard a lot at that hearing yesterday, from these CEOs,  about how much they value their employees. Yet not one of these CEOs  agreed to remain neutral if their workers want to unionize.   And I know from my State, whether it is Dayton or whether it is  Trotwood or whether it is Zanesville--I know from my State--that when  workers are lucky enough to carry a union card, they are much more  likely to prosper.   These CEOs said: Yeah, we want our employees' voices to be heard.   But that is not what remaining neutral means--not using their vast  power to intimidate their employees.   The Presiding Officer has seen it in Georgia, we saw it recently in  Alabama, and I have seen it many times in Ohio, where an employer uses  the vast resources of the corporation to browbeat--or however they do  it--to stop people from voting for the union that would make their  lives better.   I heard these CEOs say they are focused on lending to small  businesses and growing the economy, but I don't see that in Newark. I  don't see that in Canton. I don't see it in Warren or Youngstown. These  small businesses want help.   The community bankers did it. For community bankers, their lending  went up during the pandemic, but these large six banks restricted their  lending in the pandemic.   But they had enough money left to do major stock buybacks. One of  these companies planned to do $25 billion. It was announced just  recently that one of these six banks was going to do a $25 billion  stock buyback.   Do you know who that enriches? It certainly doesn't enrich the  community. It doesn't enrich Columbus or Cincinnati or Blue Ash or  Bellaire or Steubenville. What it does is enrich the executives. These  six CEOs said that, yes, climate change is a threat to the entire  economy, but they drag their feet when it comes to investing in new  technology and jobs for the future.   I am glad they raised wages, a number of them--and I know the  Presiding Officer from Georgia saw this. Right before the hearing, one  of the companies agreed to raise the minimum wage of its employees  significantly. A couple others of them bragged about their diversity in  their workplace. They had just put the first Black woman on their  board.   But we also know that one of those CEOs--this is not even quite  believable, but I can prove it with the math, as we did during the  hearing. One of these CEOs makes 900 times what the lowest, what some  of their new employees make--900 times. I don't think they claim to  work 900 times harder. But how do you figure this out? How does this  come about, that a CEO will make 900 times what some of its workers  make?   I am glad they raised wages. I am glad they made some investments in  minority depository institutions. And I was even welcome to hear them  brag about their investments in Howard and Fisk and one of the great  institutions in the Presiding Officer's home State, in Atlanta, with  Morehouse. I am glad they are doing that. I am glad they are increasing  diversity in their senior leadership. I hope they continue it, and we  will be watching.   It is not close to enough, though, when these are the most powerful  actors in this country. The signals that these companies send to  influence workers and companies all over the country--it is not just  the thousands of employees. It is important to remember, when financial  services makes about 25 percent of the profits of all corporations in  the country--financial services accounts for about 25 percent of it,  but they are only 4 percent of all the employees. Four percent of all  the employees in the country work for financial services, but they  account for 25 percent of the profit. That tells a story too. It tells  the story that these large banks have built an economy that is good for  them. They built an  [[Page S3860]]  economy that is good for financial services. They built an economy that  is good for the largest banks--not the community banks in Savannah or  Lagrange or Griffin, GA, or Mansfield or Shelby or Crestline, OH, but  they have built an economy that is good for the big guys.   Let me give you a couple examples. Before the pandemic, Bank of  America downgraded Chipotle's stock because an analyst decided the  company pays its workers too much. They downgraded the stock because an  analyst said it pays the workers too much. As a result, the company's  share price declined.   When American Airlines announced pay raises for its pilots and flight  attendants, Wall Street punished the company, dropping its stock price  by 5 percent. So when American Airlines does the right thing--they  decide to invest more money in their workers--Wall Street slaps them  and says: Don't do that. That doesn't help the economy.   A Citibank analyst actually wrote--believe this:         This is frustrating. Labor is being paid first again.       Shareholders get leftovers.    Leftovers? Shareholders get leftovers?   We might have thought that after the pandemic things might start to  change a little bit. No one could deny how much essential workers  contribute--the bus driver in Cleveland, the drugstore worker in Lima,  the nurse in Bellaire. Those are the people who really were the heroes  in this economy. Our economy is supposed to reward people whose talents  are in high demand. That is what we are taught. That is what corporate  leaders tell us, right   But this year, after Amazon defeated Alabama's workers' union  organization effort, the company stock climbed. Just a few weeks ago,  Wall Street sent Uber and Lyft and DoorDash stocks down when Labor  Secretary Walsh said gig workers should be classified as employees.   So when the government decides we need to do something, we need to  make sure these workers are treated better, Wall Street essentially  attacks those companies' stocks. Think about that. It sends a pretty  clear message. The more you pay your employees, the worse you are going  to do on Wall Street. The less power you give workers, the better you  will do. That view that American workers are costs to cut instead of a  valuable asset to invest in, that is what is wrong with this system.  So-called analysts at Wall Street, often at the banks--these six  largest banks--make decisions for people in Ohio, Georgia and  Pennsylvania and across the country. They make decisions about whether  workers they have never met, in towns they have never been to--whether  those workers are a good investment.   I hope these banks make progress not only within their own  institutions but thinking about the role these banks play in leading  this system and leading our economy and leading this country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
