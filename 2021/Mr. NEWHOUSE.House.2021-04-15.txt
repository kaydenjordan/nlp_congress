 Madam Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 104.    Madam Speaker, right out of the gate, President Biden  took unilateral action that dealt devastating blows to rural  communities across the United States.   As chairman of the Western Caucus, I have heard firsthand how the  cancellation of the Keystone pipeline and the moratorium on Federal oil  and gas leases have directly impacted rural America.   From eliminating good-paying union jobs in Minnesota and decimating  small businesses in South Dakota, to gutting local government and  school district revenues in New Mexico, to harming State infrastructure  budgets in Utah, these orders have negatively impacted workers,  families, and business owners throughout the West.   But let's be clear: All Americans will feel the effects of President  Biden's actions.   Also, let's be clear: Just because we cut domestic energy production,  does not mean our energy needs decrease. Our Nation will face higher  costs on energy, on goods, on transportation.   Under this ban, the President has throttled our economic recovery. We  will continue working to reverse these misguided actions.                            ____________________
