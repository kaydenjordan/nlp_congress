 Madam Speaker, Article II, Section 4 of the United States  Constitution states that the President of the United States may be  removed from office for treason, bribery, or high crimes and  misdemeanors.   As a former prosecutor, I am confident that no court would accept  these Articles of Impeachment as having met the standards set forth by  our Founding Fathers. The impeachment articles rely almost exclusively  on hearsay and opinion testimony, and they present no direct evidence  of wrongdoing.   As a former district attorney, I am dismayed that the Democrats have  submitted Articles of Impeachment against a sitting President using  circumstantial evidence that fails to offer proof of an impeachable  offense.   Additionally, the charges levied against the President in the  Articles of Impeachment lack historical precedent and are motivated by  pure political reason. If the House of Representatives passes the  Articles of Impeachment, the Democrats will have set a dangerous  precedent by undoing America's vote for President because a single  party disagreed with the 2016 Presidential election results.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Articles of  Impeachment.
