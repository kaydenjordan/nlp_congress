 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3055 and  ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I am offering this amendment to spare  the Country from the so-called Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is  not about protecting the environment. It is about making Big Government  even bigger.   This socialist scheme would destroy jobs. It will reduce the quality  of life for the American people. Millions and millions of Americans  will suffer. It would worsen already high inflation. It will drive a  stake through the economy and eventually bankrupt the Nation.   Senate Democrats have made it clear that they want to use this  reckless tax-and-spending spree to implement the Green New Deal. Just  last night, Senator Markey of Massachusetts made this statement, he  said: ``Without question, the Green New Deal is in the DNA of this  budget resolution.''   Let me repeat. He said: ``Without question, the Green New Deal is in  the DNA of this budget resolution.''   Instead of raising the costs of energy, we should be working to lower  the costs of alternative technologies and  [[Page S6208]]  fuels through innovation, not taxation and resolution.   I would encourage a ``yes'' vote on the Barrasso amendment and reject  the job-killing Green New Deal.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I rise to oppose the Carper amendment.   Let's be clear. We all want to address climate change, period. Now,  this amendment does much more than that. Just because you say you want  to address climate change does not mean every policy that you propose  is a good idea. There can be disagreement. And I disagree strongly with  the Green New Deal policies in this $4.2 trillion bill that wastes  taxpayer dollars. It costs hundreds of jobs, and it hurts our economy.   Our economy should be a priority here. It should be the priority. We  can protect the environment without punishing the economy, and this  bill and amendment fail that test.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3330
