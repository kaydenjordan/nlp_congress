 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6. Over the  past 2 weeks, America has witnessed something impressive. Both parties  have come together, once again, to take action on one of the more  challenging issues of our time: the opioid epidemic.   But this health threat is not unique. In the past, Congress faced the  AIDS epidemic that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of  Americans, and stared down the Ebola nightmare. Congress responded  methodically and thoughtfully by investing massive resources into  medical research at the NIH and into treatment and prevention programs.   That is exactly what Congress is trying to do today. In this bill, we  are funding NIH to develop alternatives to opioids for pain management,  increasing treatment and prevention programs, and equipping our law  enforcement to stop dangerous drugs like fentanyl from coming into  America.   This bill is going to make a difference in the lives of millions of  Americans. Congress is building on the work that it started with CARA  and with the 21st Century Cures, but this isn't the end. It is vital to  continue working together.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6.
