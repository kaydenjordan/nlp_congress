 Mr. Speaker, it was in this Chamber in  1941 that Franklin Roosevelt told the world that every man, woman, and  child in the world should be guaranteed four freedoms: the freedom of  speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from fear, and the freedom  from want.   And Mr. Speaker, today, our President has taken a wrecking ball to  all four of those guarantees. He has declared that the press is the  enemy of the American people--going after that treasured freedom of  speech, the right for me to speak here in this well, for people to  assemble outside, and for the journalists behind me in the gallery to  report on it--the freedom of worship that every man and woman and child  could pray to the God of their choosing and not be discriminated  because of it. Our country, as we speak right now today, has a Muslim  ban in place.                                time  1100    Freedom from fear: Nearly daily, the President tweets out that the  immigrants fleeing the harshest places in the world from violence and  abject poverty are the problem, that they are murderers and rapists.   And freedom from want: The idea that if you work hard, it will mean  something. Well, Mr. Speaker, this Chamber passed, and the President  signed, a tax cut where 83 percent of the benefits went to the  wealthiest among us. Not a tax cut that told our businesses: You can be  more competitive, but you have to share the profits with those who  generated your productivity.   Those four freedoms that we have all relied upon and depend upon in  our country are being knocked down. We have an opportunity in this  Chamber, Mr. Speaker, to unite and work together to restore those  freedoms and rebuild them.   Our Founders, in their wisdom, envisioned that you could have a  wrecking-ball, out-of-control Presidency, and they did not leave us  helpless. They envisioned that the Article I check and balance of a  Congress, elected by the  [[Page H6050]]  people, could be a check on the President.   As our President right now is abroad, insulting our allies, drawing  us closer to adversaries like Russia, we can be a check. We can say,  when it comes to those families separated at the border, we are not  going to put a single priority of the President forward until he  reunites all of them. When it comes to the press, who are under attack  in speech that is constantly being suppressed, we can pass the  Journalist Protection Act, which I recently introduced, which would  make it a Federal crime to commit violence against anyone in the news  gathering business. There is a lot we can do together.   And as it comes to our democracy, Mr. Speaker, we are just 4 months  away from an election. The adversary that our President is meeting with  is determined to interfere again. The best antidote to stop that would  be for us to unite and pass legislation to have an independent  commission. That is bipartisan legislation that is out there.   We can be the check that our Founders envisioned. We can be the check  that our constituents really need us to be during these trying times.   We are not helpless, Mr. Speaker. We can pick up the pieces, and we  can rebuild and restore those freedoms that FDR stood in this Chamber  and guaranteed to the world that we would have. That should still be  true today in America.                            ____________________
