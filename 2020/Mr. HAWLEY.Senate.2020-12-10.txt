 Mr. President, July 19, 2018, is a date that we in  Missouri won't ever forget. There were 17 people who lost their lives  and 11 who were injured in a boating accident on Table Rock Lake.  During a severe thunderstorm, a duck boat called Stretch Duck  [[Page S7394]]  7 sank with 31 people aboard, including children. Today marks 875 days  since that tragedy.   To the families and friends who lost loved ones that day, I am sure  that every one of those 875 days since has come with a new and painful  reminder of your loss.   I am here today to honor those who lost their lives, the 17 victims  of that tragedy--a tragedy that should never have happened--and also to  honor the survivors who live with the memory of that tragedy every day.  They deserve to be remembered. They deserve to be respected by this  body, and I am here to do something about it. The time has come to act.   I am here to ask this body to do its job and finally pass my bill  that will impose tough, new security restrictions and measures on every  duck boat operation in America. This is a bill I introduced almost 2  years ago that passed the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation unanimously.   Now, truth be told, it has taken this body far too long to act. The  tragedy in Missouri may have been one of the more recent duck boat  tragedies, but it is far from the first. In 1999, 13 people were killed  when a duck boat sank during a tour of Lake Hamilton in Arkansas. In  the years since, the death toll has climbed to over 40. In 2001, there  was a duck boat accident in Seattle, WA. In 2010, a tugboat on the  Delaware River in Philadelphia collided with a duck boat. In 2013, a  duck boat caught fire in the San Francisco Bay. I could go on.   Now, the National Transportation Safety Board has issued numerous  recommendations to improve duck boat safety, and it has issued many of  these recommendations multiple times. The U.S. Coast Guard, which  regulates these crafts, has recently concurred with quite a number of  these recommendations. Yet, to be frank, we need more than  recommendations. We need more than studies and surveys. We need laws.  It has been 875 days, and we have seen investigation after  investigation conclude the same thing: that lives could have been saved  if action had been taken--if this body had acted, if the security  measures had been put in place.   The time for delay has passed, and the time to act is now in order to  save future lives and to make sure that the tragedy that happened in  Branson is not repeated again in Missouri or in any other State.   My legislation would take those recommendations and put them into  law. It includes provisions to ensure that duck boats remain buoyant  during flooding. It requires dangerous canopies to be removed. It  requires life jackets for passengers. My legislation would also ensure  that duck boats would not go out during severe weather and also require  the operators of duck boats to know what the weather is--a commonsense  provision but one not currently required under the law.   I thank Senator Blunt, Senator Cotton, and Senator Duckworth for  supporting this legislation and for their strong support for lifesaving  provisions. I thank Chairman Wicker for moving this bill through the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where, once again,  it received unanimous support. Now it is time to make it the law of the  land.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from further  consideration of S. 1031 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the Hawley substitute  amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a  third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senator  Sanders in this important legislation.   It is very simple legislation, and this is, to my mind, a very simple  proposition. Here is the proposition: that when it comes to COVID  relief in the midst of this crisis, working families and working people  should be first to get relief, not last. Their interests, their needs  should be first on our to-do list, not last.   Now, I have heard some of my colleagues say that there just isn't  enough left for working families; that once we take care of our other  priorities in COVID relief, there just isn't enough left to give direct  assistance to individuals.   I want to respectfully suggest that those priorities are exactly  reversed. We should begin with the working people of this country, and  that is why the legislation that Senator Sanders and I are introducing,  which I believe every Senator voted for in March--it is simple  legislation--$1,200 for each individual, $2,400 for a couple, and $500  for every dependent in the family. It is exactly what this Congress  approved overwhelmingly back in March, and it was, indeed, a lifeline.  I know it was for Missourians in my State, for working families in my  State.   I remember, in the hours and days after Congress passed this in  March, fielding call after call after call from friends, from people I  didn't know in my State but whom I represent, who called me to say:  First of all, is it really true? Are we actually going to be getting  this support? And then just to say thank you.   And I said: Don't thank me. Thank you for being the ones who have  built this country, the ones who sustain this country, the ones on whom  this country depends.   And I will just say also, as a matter of fairness--if the U.S.  Government is going to shut down your business, if it is going to tell  you to go home for health reasons, if it is going to give you no choice  in the matter, I think that there is an obligation to support and help  the people who are affected, through no fault of their own. Let's be  clear. The millions of Americans who are out of work because of this  pandemic, they haven't done anything wrong. The 853,000 Americans who  today, the new numbers tell us, filed for unemployment benefits, they  are not at fault in this pandemic.   We want to support and stand with working individuals and working  families. I want the working people of Missouri to know that they are  first on the priority list, and when it comes to COVID relief, we will  not leave this town until we have voted--up or down--until we have  voted on direct relief for working people in my State, in Senator  Sanders's State, and in every State in this Union.   With that, I thank Senator Sanders, and I yield back.
