 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of the Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of  our Nation's most beloved and revered sports figures, John Madden.  Since his passing in late December, words such as ``legendary'' and  ``iconic'' have deservingly been used to describe John Madden.   Residents of Pleasanton and the Tri-Valley region I represent in  California's 15th Congressional District had the privilege of knowing  John as a devoted and down-to-earth husband to Virginia, father to Mike  and Joe, and a fixture at his grandchildren's games and throughout the  community.   John Madden was simultaneously a larger-than-life Hall of Fame coach  and broadcaster but also someone you could hang with and have a cold  Miller Lite with at the Outback Steakhouse in Dublin after his  grandson's football game, bump into at Ace Hardware on a Saturday  afternoon looking at power tools, or join for ham and eggs after mass  on a Sunday morning at Vic's All Star Kitchen on Main Street in  Pleasanton.   While our Nation mourns his passing at the age of 85, the loss is  particularly felt in the Tri-Valley community we share.   Whether you were from an older generation of fans that simply knew  him as ``coach''; my generation of fans that connected with him as  ``John'' from his years in the broadcast booth, hosting SNL, and  starring in commercials; or the younger generation who simply knew him  as ``Madden'' from the video game, it can be stated that few if any  individuals have had a greater impact on football and popular culture  in the last 50 years.   It is rare to find someone who connected with so many generations  over so many different mediums. In fact, New England Patriots head  coach, Bill Belichick, recently marveled at his success at coaching,  broadcasting, commercials, video game planning, and real estate,  stating that while most of us make an impact with one successful  professional career, John Madden had five of them.   It doesn't appear that Coach Belichick was aware of Madden's  proficiency as a restaurant owner, grape grower, and almond farmer. For  those scoring at home, that is actually--boom--eight successful careers  that John Madden had.   Yet, in the end, as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated, Madden  ``was football.'' That was his passion. Simply put, John Madden made  football and the NFL what it is today.   Hired by the Oakland Raiders in 1969 at the age of 32 as the league's  youngest coach, Madden was on the sidelines during a transformational  time in the NFL. He posted a 103-32-7 regular-season record, which is  still the highest winning percentage for a coach with 100 or more games  coached in NFL history.   Despite their reputation as free-spirited renegades, Madden's teams  never had a losing season in his 10 years at the helm, and he led them  to a Super Bowl victory in 1977. Beyond the numbers, many of Madden's  games actually have names. Whether it was the ``Immaculate Reception,''  ``Ghost to the Post,'' ``Sea of Hands,'' or ``Holy Roller,'' never has  one coach been involved with so many instant, iconic classics of a  golden era of football. Madden never hid his emotions on the sidelines  and is featured in many of the game's lasting images.   After retiring from football in 1978, Madden quickly became one of  the greatest ambassadors the sport of football has ever known. He moved  to the broadcast booth to become the most popular commentator in all of  professional sports.   Madden would describe his teaming with his longtime broadcast partner  Pat Summerall ``like the day that peanut butter met jelly.'' He won 16  Emmys sharing his insights, humor, and love for the game of football  while working for every major network. He also lent his name to the  popular football game ``Madden NFL,'' which ranked among the top- selling titles of all time.   During that time, it would be hard to argue that any person did more  for the growth of the popularity of football. Players and fans knew  that if Madden was calling their game, it was the biggest and best game  of the week.   Madden's enthusiasm for football through the television set inspired  passion, while his voice also literally taught the game of football to  millions of kids through their video game controller.   Despite many of the other descriptors of John Madden, one that I like  to use is ``teacher'' because I don't feel that anybody has taught the  game of football to more people over the years in his capacity as  coach, broadcaster, and video game producer than John Madden.   John Madden was that rare communicator who was both a teacher and  entertainer. He innovated both the telestrator and the yellow ``line to  [[Page H34]]  gain'' for first downs that is standard for every broadcast today.   Madden also educated audiences about the intricacies of football and  communicated in a straightforward manner and plain language that  everyone could easily understand. He never overcomplicated things, but  his analysis touched the football novice as much as the die-hard fan  just the same.   He was truly authentic. I can tell you, what you saw on TV is what  you would see in real life.   Like any great teacher, Madden was in a never-ending quest to learn  about his subject and to perfect his craft. Whether it was analyzing  freshman football games that his son coached at Foothill High School,  watching game film, attending his grandson's practices, talking to  coaches, facilitating production meetings, his preparation was  unparalleled. He had a lot of time to prepare as he traveled the  country to and from games coast to coast, first on Amtrak trains and  later the Madden Cruiser bus.   John Madden loved people, and the people loved John Madden. John  Madden stopped throughout 48 of the continental United States at a  number of diners, drive-ins, and dives before that was even a TV show,  and he shared his story and countless meals with hundreds and thousands  of Americans.   Speaking of meals, Madden became a part of every American families'  Thanksgiving tradition as he would broadcast a game every year from  1980 to 2009. He literally termed the meal ``turducken,'' a combination  of turkey stuffed with duck stuffed with chicken.   Even as his health declined in recent years, he would still raise  money at home to support high school football programs throughout his  hometown region of the Tri-Valley as well as various local charities  through the annual Madden-Mariucci Bocce Tournament. He also continued  to advocate for measures to increase safety in the game of football  that he loved so much, with a focus on youth football.   Whether you talk about his coaching career, broadcasting career,  video games, or various commercials, his greatest legacy to those who  knew him was that he achieved national fame but remained one of us. He  stated at his Pro Football Hall of Fame induction in 2006 that he never  worked a day in his life and that he was one of the luckiest men alive.    But the lucky ones are all of us who had the privilege of laughing,  learning, and sharing his passions for football and life.   The first time I met John Madden was about 10 years ago. We were at a  barbecue in a friend's backyard. He said to me: Eric, things are pretty  screwed up back there in Congress.   He didn't use the word ``screwed.'' I looked at him and said: Coach,  I will try to do better.   He said: Do better. Just try to find the deals.   Things have been pretty tense around this place over the last 10  years, but I am happy that I am about to yield right now to my friend,  Rodney Davis of Illinois, a Raiders fan.   Coach, I don't know how many deals we can find right now, but Rodney  and I have a deal today that we think you are the greatest. We think  you have inspired millions. The game of football and the country is  better because you coached it, and you taught all of us.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney  Davis), my Republican friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for that  very personal tribute. I grew up the only 49ers fan in an all-Raiders  household, so there is a lot of influence there on me, and rightfully  so.  [[Page H35]]         I yield to the gentleman.    Yes, of course. And I was the only Giants fan in an  all-A's household, the only 49ers fan in an all-Raiders household, and  the only Democrat in an all-Republican household, so outnumbered in  every way. But my mom and dad loved John Madden in the way you just  described him because of what he taught all of us.   I thank the gentleman for coming down with his helmet, and I think we  are all rooting for a Raiders win this weekend.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the Central Valley of  California, who I believe will tell us that Mr. Madden had almond  orchards in his district.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McNerney), who is my colleague from the bay area who represented  [[Page H36]]  Coach Madden for many years before redistricting changed the districts  in 2012. Jerry McNerney is my neighbor and friend.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, it is very evident from the tribute  today across the aisle, and across California, that we grieve Coach  Madden's loss, but we have all tremendously benefited as a country  because he so humbly coached, and because when he interacted with  everyday Americans, he treated everyone with respect, and he treated  everyone the same.   So to the Madden family, we grieve with you. And to Coach, rest in  peace, to a great coach.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
