 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Whitney Wagner, have privileges of the floor for the remainder of the  day.    Mr. President, the most important words of our  Constitution are its first three, ``We the People.'' It is the mission  statement of our Constitution, the mission statement of our country, a  nation ``of the people, by the people, for the people,'' as President  Lincoln so eloquently stated, not a nation by, for, and of the powerful  and the privileged.   Critical to that vision of ``we the people'' is a strong and  independent judiciary, particularly a strong and independent Supreme  Court, since all the decisions from the lower courts can be appealed  right on up to the very top.   Today, there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court with Anthony Kennedy's  announced retirement. On Monday night, President Trump announced his  nominee to fill that seat--Judge Brett Kavanaugh.   A single vote can make all the difference in the world on the Supreme  Court in protecting the freedoms we hold dear. A single vote can tip  the scales toward the vision of our Constitution, the ``we the people''  vision of our Constitution, or it can tip the scales away from that  vision toward government by and for the powerful.   We can see the impact of the single vote when we look at Justice  Kennedy's own legacy, his own record of 5-to-4 decisions. Time and  again during his three decades on the Court, he made the deciding vote  in a critical decision--a single vote making a big difference.   In 1992, he wrote the majority opinion in Planned Parenthood v.  Casey, not only reaffirming Roe v. Wade but protecting a woman's  fundamental right to make decisions about her own healthcare. As  Justice Kennedy wrote, ``These matters, involving the most intimate and  personal choices a person may make in a lifetime . . . are central to  the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment,'' the amendment  prohibiting States from depriving a person of liberty without due  process.   In 2005, he wrote the ruling in Roper v. Simmons, which barred the  execution of juveniles, declaring it cruel and unusual punishment  banned by the Eighth Amendment, highlighting the ``evolving standards  of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.'' Justice  Kennedy said that even when a child commits the most heinous of crimes,  ``the State cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a  mature understanding of his own humanity.''   In Boumediene v. Bush, he appealed to the better angels of our nature  and channeled the sentiment behind Benjamin Franklin's adage that  ``Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little  temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety'' when he wrote  the majority opinion that detainees at Guantanamo Bay had the  constitutional right of habeas corpus to challenge their detention.   Certainly, in looking at Justice Kennedy's legacy and the importance  of a single vote, it is worth noting cases that involve the rights of  opportunity for our LGBTQ brothers and sisters. Because of that 5-to-4  vote, our Nation declared finally that love is love and that everyone  has the right to marry whomever they love, regardless of gender or  sexual orientation.   In United States v. Windsor, he helped strike down the Defense of  Marriage Act, declaring it unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment's  due process clause after the surviving spouse of a legally recognized  same-sex marriage was denied the Federal estate exemption given to all  surviving spouses.   Then, in Obergefell v. Hodges, he wrote: ``No union is more profound  than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity,  devotion, sacrifice, and family.'' Justice Kennedy went on to say that  same-sex couples who sought legal recognition of their unions in the  case asked only ``for equal dignity in the eyes of the law,'' and that  ``the Constitution grants them that right.''   Think about these powers, these freedoms, these rights: due process  under the 14th Amendment; protection from cruel and unusual punishment  under the 8th Amendment; the right to petition for a writ of habeas  corpus granted in article I, section 9 of the Constitution; due process  under the 5th Amendment, all upheld by a single vote.   If there is any doubt about how much difference that vote can make,  look at some of the recent decisions handed down by the court.   The Janus case was a 5-to-4 decision undermining the rights of  workers to organize. The ability of workers to organize is a  fundamental right, a key power to be able to participate in the wealth  that you work to create, yet it was undermined just the week before  last by a 5-to-4 court decision.   Trump v. Hawaii was a 5-to-4 decision upholding a travel ban against  Muslims, effectively shutting the door of our country to a group of  people simply because of their religion. What a 5-to-4 assault that was  on the freedom of religion.   Abbot v. Perez was another 5-to-4 decision green-lighting racial  gerrymandering in Texas, violating the Voting Rights Act.   One case after another has come down in recent weeks against ``we the  people,'' decided by a single vote. How many cases are we going to see  in the coming years where a single vote transforms the landscape of our  country as we know it, where a single vote takes away a fundamental  right in the vision of a ``we the people'' nation? That is why this  nomination is so unlike any other recent confirmation; the impacts on  the court and on our Nation will reverberate for decades to come.   So many core issues are under consideration: the influence of money  in politics; the power of big corporations to prey on consumers and  workers; marriage equality; the right of every American to have their  voice heard at the ballot box. How can you believe in the foundation  and vision of a democratic republic if you don't believe in voter  empowerment? Yet we have members of the Supreme Court who don't. The  right of every American to receive a quality education, affordable  healthcare and a woman's right to choose--it is clear that the very  soul of our ``we the people'' Nation is hanging in the balance.   But here is a certain circumstance that we may never have seen  before; that is, we have a President who is under investigation for the  possibility of colluding with an enemy, with an adversarial foreign  power. In case after case, time after time, he has sought to make it  difficult to conduct an investigation into the Presidency and the  campaign that preceded it. He said in a tweet: ``As has been stated by  numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself,  but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?''   I ask this: Why would he tweet that topic if he is not worried about  needing a pardon? He is a President who talks openly about the  possibility of pardoning himself--something there is no precedent for,  which no President has considered? This is the situation we are in.   With a President at this moment nominating a Supreme Court Justice  who well may have the power to determine whether it is possible under  our Constitution for a President to pardon himself, who may well  determine under our Constitution whether a President can fire a special  counsel at will, the march to an authoritarian nation is one that  should concern us at this moment because that is the issue of the  expansive power of the Presidency. Is it so broad, so large that the  checks and balances written into the Constitution become irrelevant?  This is exactly what President George Washington warned the Nation  about in his Farewell Address, when he said, ``The spirit  [[Page S4922]]  of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments  in one, and thus to create whatever the form of government, a real  despotism.'' He said this ``is the customary weapon by which free  governments are destroyed.''    Here we have this issue of the President having chosen as a nominee,  off a long list of possibilities, an individual who has gone to great  lengths to talk about the President being above the law. Therefore, we  have every right to worry.   About this expansive view of Executive power, in a 2009 Minnesota Law  Review article, he said:         We should not burden a sitting President with civil suits,       criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions.    He said:         [A] possible concern is that the country needs a check       against a bad-behaving or law-breaking President. But the       Constitution already provides that check. If the President       does something dastardly, the impeachment process is       available.    So here he is saying directly that his reading of the Constitution is  that the check on the President is through impeachment.   ``The President,'' he says, ``should have absolute discretion . . .  whether and when to appoint an independent counsel.''   In another point, he argued that it should be the President who has  the power to dismiss an independent counsel and to do so without cause.  In a 1998 panel discussion called ``The Future of the Independent  Counsel Statute,'' he said: ``If the President were the sole subject of  a criminal investigation, I would say no one should be investigating  that.''   When the moderator asked how many on the panel believed a sitting  President cannot be indicted, it is Mr. Kavanaugh who raised his hand.   In his dissent in Seven-Sky vs. Holder, Kavanaugh wrote a footnote  stating: ``Under the Constitution, the president may decline to enforce  a statute that regulates private individuals when the president deems  the statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held or would hold  that statute constitutional.''   Wow, not only does this nominee believe that the only power to  address a misbehaving President is impeachment--the power granted to  the Congress--but also that the President has the power to ignore laws  just by virtue of feeling that they are unconstitutional, even if a  court says they are constitutional. That is not the system of checks  and balances set up in our Constitution.   That is a big concern, and it leads us to the conclusion that when a  President is under investigation for the possibility of a serious crime  of collaborating with the enemy, that President should not have this  Chamber considering holding hearings and proceeding to take a debate  and a vote on that nominee. Let that cloud be cleared first.   There is more to be concerned about. There is a lot to be concerned  about in healthcare. In Garza v. Hargan, he dissented from a decision  protecting a woman's constitutional right to control her own  reproductive health decisions. Then, there is Priests for Life v. U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services, where he wrote a dissenting  opinion in which he stated that the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive  coverage requirement violated religious nonprofits' religious freedom.  The nonprofits said that even submitting the one-page form from the  Obama administration to allow religious nonprofits to opt out might  make them complicit.   As for net neutrality, in U.S. Telecom Association v. Federal  Communications Commission, he wrote an opinion in favor of striking  down the FCC's net neutrality rule. He argued that the net neutrality  rule violated the First Amendment by ``restricting the editorial  discretion of internet service providers.''   The editorial discretion of internet service providers? This issue of  net neutrality is whether or not an internet service provider can  charge a series of fees based on the content of the information. If you  want to protect freedom of speech, then you protect net neutrality.  This net neutrality issue was about whether an internet service  provider can charge fees based on the type of platform you are using or  the computer program you are using. It was about whether you can create  a fast lane on the internet for those wealthy enough to afford it while  the rest of us in America are stuck in the slow lane behind a truck  going 30 miles per hour. That is what net neutrality is about.   Did he even understand the basic fundamentals of the issue? He said  it is about the editorial decision of the internet service providers-- talk about a decision warped and twisted and crafted to support the  powerful or the fundamental opportunity for us as a nation to make  rules that regulate fair opportunity on the internet.   Our Nation is at a pivotal moment. We have a Court that in a 5-to-4  decision, a 5-to-4 decision, and a 5-to-4 decision has proceeded to  weigh in on behalf of the powerful, against the people, against the  workers of America, against the consumers of America, against the women  of America and healthcare rights in America. Now we have the  possibility of a nominee being considered who wants to make the  Presidency of the United States above the law, not subject to  investigation, not subject to the possibility of indictment, not  subject to the courts saying that a law is constitutional or  unconstitutional.   Perhaps it is appropriate for a King in a kingdom but not for a  democratic republic, not for a ``we the people'' constitution. That is  why we absolutely should not proceed to consider this nominee until the  President is cleared of the investigation for conspiring, for  collaborating with an enemy of the United States of America. It is  absolutely why if that cloud is cleared, we should still be  dramatically concerned about the viewpoints of this nominee, who  doesn't respect the healthcare opportunities and rights of Americans,  who doesn't respect the government's ability to create a fair playing  field, equal lanes for individuals on the internet, and who certainly  doesn't understand that no one is above the law under the vision of the  Constitution, not even the President of the United States.   Thank you.                            ____________________
