 Madam Speaker, as a physician, I took the  Hippocratic oath to first do no harm. That means caring for the sick  and protecting those who cannot protect themselves. That means fighting  to protect the unborn.   Sadly, not all Members of Congress share that commitment. Right now,  liberals in this body are attempting to repeal the Hyde amendment which  prohibits tax dollars from funding abortions. Worse, they are  attempting to legalize abortions on demand until the moment of birth.  While science tells us that the unborn baby is a human life and  deserves protection, our collective conscience should motivate us to  protect these unborn children.   We owe it to the American people to defend the sanctity of life. We  owe it to  [[Page H4868]]  them to protect the most vulnerable among us. As a doctor and as a  legislator, I will always stand for life.                           Strong American Military     Madam Speaker, as Congress prepares to  consider the National Defense Authorization Act, our Nation continues  to face national security threats abroad. I am proud that this  legislation protects our military from the administration's reckless  spending cuts that would have made Americans less safe. It also  provides a 2.7 percent pay raise for our Nation's servicemembers and  protects their right to personal expression.    This bill would allow our troops to make their own choice on whether  to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. It would prohibit them from being  dishonorably discharged for making their own healthcare decisions.  Furthermore, this legislation would increase security on our southern  border. It acknowledges the record number of illegal crossings which is  truly a national security crisis.   With the threat of global terrorism on the rise, now is not the time  to allow our borders to be more vulnerable. President Reagan once said  that we maintain peace through our strength and that weakness only  invites aggression.   Now is the time for a strong United States military. Now is the time  for that peace through strength. And now is the time to pass the  National Defense Authorization Act and to continue to protect each and  every American.                            ____________________
