 Mr. Speaker, this week, Congressman Adam Smith and I  introduced the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act. This legislation is  critical to dismantle President Trump's mass deportation machine, to  protect families, and to restore justice and due process to our broken  immigration system.   Our detention system brings huge profits for large private  corporations. About 38,000 people are detained every single day at a  cost to taxpayers of over $2 billion a year.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is about two things: dignity and justice for  families, pregnant women, people with serious illnesses, survivors of  torture and violence. It is unconscionable that we are detaining these  people sometimes for months or even years.   Congress can't afford to sit on the sidelines anymore. It is time to  make clear that locking people up without due process is not only  unconstitutional, it is un-American.   At a time when net migration is zero, when DREAMers are at risk of  losing their DACA status, and the world reels from unprecedented  numbers of refugees fleeing for their lives, we must act with  compassion.   I urge my colleagues to pass the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act,  and I thank the over 55 cosponsors who have already come on to this  piece of legislation.                            ____________________
