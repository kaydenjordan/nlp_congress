 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Eck, Sr., of  Springfield, Illinois, on being named the 2018 First Citizen by the  State Journal-Register newspaper.   Each year, the State Journal-Register recognizes a community leader  as the First Citizen who is committed to helping our Springfield  community prosper, and they chose a phenomenal leader for 2018.   Upon retirement 13 years ago, Mr. Eck's commitment to philanthropic  endeavors has surged throughout Springfield and central Illinois. Most  notably, Mr. Eck was instrumental in helping to raise money to save the  financially struggling St. Patrick Catholic School, which was set to  close on its 100th anniversary.   In addition, John has served on numerous local boards, including the  St. John's Hospital Foundation, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central  Illinois, the United Way, and the American Business Club.   Throughout John's career, he has never been afraid to step up and do  what is right to support the greater Springfield community, and it  doesn't appear he plans on stopping now.   Mr. Speaker, I thank John for his relentless commitment to helping  others, and I congratulate him on a well-deserved award.                            ____________________
