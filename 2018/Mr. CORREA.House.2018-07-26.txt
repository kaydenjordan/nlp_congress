 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Mason on his  retirement.   John was born in 1927 in Madrid, Nebraska, and spent his childhood on  a family farm in Nevada before moving to Los Angeles at the age of 22  to fulfill his dream of becoming an artist. He enrolled in the Los  Angeles Institute of Art where he collaborated with other artists and  visionaries.   It was through clay that he first found the tools to realize his  vision, and he quickly became an innovator in the field of ceramic  sculpting. His creations pushed the limits of what clay could do and  forever changed how artists thought about the material's possibilities.   After moving to New York in the 1970s, Mr. Mason expanded his  artistic pallet further, working with firebricks and welded steel  pieces to construct even more abstract sculptures in his future career.   Mr. Mason has been recognized by countless venues around the world.  His passion for making art is unmatched throughout the world. His  contributions to the field of sculpting and the many young artists he  has inspired make me proud to honor John Mason today.                            ____________________
