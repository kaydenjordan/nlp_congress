 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  upcoming 2018 Pinecrest, Palmetto Bay, and Cutler Bay Relay for Life.   On March 17, friends, families, neighbors, and community leaders from  my congressional district will gather together to remember lost loved  ones, to honor survivors, and to raise money for a cause that has  affected too many in our community and around the Nation.  [[Page H1355]]    Sadly, in 2018 alone, over 1.7 million Americans will be diagnosed  with cancer and more than 600,000 individuals will lose the battle  against this dreadful disease.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, Relay for Life is such an important event  to raise awareness and funds to help cancer patients and their families  in my area of south Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the countless volunteers and local  sponsors who are going to make this wonderful day possible, a day  filled with activities, games, and fun.   Let us all join together to make a difference in the fight against  cancer and make this year's Relay for Life the best one yet.                            ____________________
