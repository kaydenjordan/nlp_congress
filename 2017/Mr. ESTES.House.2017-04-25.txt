 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jenkins and our entire  Kansas delegation, and thank you to all the Members for serving.   I also want to thank my wife, Susan Estes, who is up in the gallery  tonight.   My mother, Lou Estes, is also up there, my son, Brent Estes, and my  daughters, Laura Estes and Grace Estes.   As you all know, you can't run an election and you can't serve  without the support of family and friends, so I appreciate the effort  that they put in on my behalf. I look forward to serving with you. This  is an honor to be a public servant and to work with you in the Chamber.   I want to mention that my background, both in the private sector  before I was elected county treasurer and then State treasurer, was to  focus on how to make things more efficient and how do we get things  done. The message that came through in the election was that the voters  in my district, like the voters in your district, want to see us  accomplish things and want to get them done.   I appreciate the time, I appreciate the opportunity, and I look  forward to serving with you to accomplish things for our country.                            ____________________
