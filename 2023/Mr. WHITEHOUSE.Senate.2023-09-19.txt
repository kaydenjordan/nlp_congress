 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I will call this my ``let's say''  speech. Lawyers know what a hypothetical is. We will talk about some  hypotheticals related to the scheme to capture the Court.   Let's say, Mr. President, that you are a creepy billionaire and it is  your plan to capture and control the Supreme Court, to take it over  just like 19th-century robber barons would have taken over and captured  the railroad commission that set the rates for their own railroad.   Let's say you sent millions of dollars--secret dollars--to the  Federalist Society for it to funnel money to its employee and your  operative, Leonard Leo.   Let's say that Leonard Leo got his cred with you and your rightwing  billionaire pals when he helped you kill the nomination to the Supreme  Court of President George W. Bush's friend and White House Counsel  Harriet  [[Page S4580]]  Miers-- a political hit job from the far right against a Republican  President's nominee, which produced none other than Sam Alito.    Let's say you also sent millions of dollars to Leonard Leo's Judicial  Crisis Network, a fictitious-named front group for another front group  operating out of the same hallway, on the same floor, in the same  building as the Federalist Society.   Let's say you sent the Judicial Crisis Network secret millions of  dollars--checks as big as $15 million, checks as big as $17 million--to  run ads against Merrick Garland to help Mitch McConnell block his  confirmation by the Senate.   Let's say you also sent millions of dollars, secret dollars,  identity-laundered through front groups, like 501(c)(4)s and Donors  Trust, which exist for the purpose of scrubbing off your identity from  your money, and through the 501(c)(4)s and through Donors Trust to  Republican political groups, like super PACs controlled by Mitch  McConnell.   Let's say, with those secret millions funneled into those super PACs,  you acquired loyalty and obedience from Republican political figures.   Let's say that worked. Let's say that for your millions of dollars to  the Federalist Society, the Federalist Society allowed you to use its  name on a list of Supreme Court nominees that you and your rightwing  billionaire pals and Leonard Leo cooked up--a list that the Federalist  Society never considered or approved, never an agenda item, never a  vote, but a list from some back room of the Federalist Society, pulled  together by Leo and the billionaires that Candidate Trump promised to  follow.   Let's say that for that Trump promise to let you pick Supreme Court  Justices, you agreed to hold your nose and not object to Trump's  candidacy.   Let's say that Trump kept that promise and nominated your chosen ones  to the Supreme Court, and let's say that when Trump kept that promise  and nominated your chosen ones, you sent millions more to the Judicial  Crisis Network and to Mitch McConnell's political operation, not just  to stop Merrick Garland but to push the confirmation of your chosen  ones: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.   Let's say that you funded dozens of front groups to bring cases and  to file briefs at the Supreme Court at your orchestrated direction--10,  11, 12, and in one case, it is 50 at a time--like piano keys on the  piano, and you sent that message through those front groups in those  briefs to remind your chosen ones what it is exactly that you wanted  them to do in those cases.   Let's say that the chosen ones produced an amazing, statistically  stunning record of doing, in the opinions they produced, just what your  front groups asked.   Let's say you and your fellow billionaires played your front groups  like piano keys and your chosen Justices harmonized perfectly with  their direction.   Let's say that to keep your chosen ones loyal and happy and  entertained, you secretly paid for their personal lives. You paid for  family tuitions. You bought family houses and let family members live  rent-free. You paid for ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"-level  vacations, including free travel to resorts on private jets, travel on  private yachts. You gave them expensive gifts, and you directed money  to their spouses, and, of course, you hung out with them.   Let's say that last part--keeping them loyal and happy and  entertained with all those gifts--was illegal. Illegal.   Let's say that your loyalty gifts program required the chosen ones to  file false Federal disclosure forms and perhaps even false tax returns.   Let's say that your loyalty gifts program might put you in trouble  with the tax man for claiming false business expenses. How could that  be?   Let's say that the chosen ones were calling this bonanza of freebies  ``personal hospitality.'' ``Personal hospitality''--a term of art  allowing nondisclosure under the disclosure laws.   Let's say that they were all calling it ``personal hospitality,'' but  you were calling the bonanza ``deductible business expenses of  corporate yachts and jets.'' Then it wouldn't all add up.   That is a lot of ``let's say,'' I know, but that is about what we are  looking at with the Supreme Court right now. We know it is not one  rightwing billionaire but a little bunch of them. We don't know all the  freebies yet. Maybe we only know 10 percent of the freebies. We know  that there has been no meaningful investigation of this, so there is  lots left to learn. That is our job in Congress, to investigate  malfeasance in government and expose abuse so the citizens can see what  has been going on and laws can be changed to better protect against  that kind of abuse.   So let's say Congress starts doing its job and starts asking nosy  questions. What is a creepy billionaire to do? That is easy. You lawyer  up. You refuse to cooperate. You are a billionaire, remember, so you  can pay lawyers a thousand dollars an hour until the cows come home and  not even notice it. A thousand hours of thousand-dollar lawyering  wouldn't cost you a thousandth of your wealth. You live above the law,  sheltered by your billions. You actually direct the law through your  chosen ones on the Supreme Court.    The impertinence of being investigated is insufferable, so this is  what you send.   Here are two actual lawyer letters. One was sent by the lawyer for  the billionaire Harlan Crow. The other was sent by the lawyer for the  billionaire's operative and his painting mate, Leonard Leo.   When I say ``painting mate,'' I mean this painting that Harlan Crow,  the billionaire, has of his time with Clarence Thomas, one of the  chosen ones, and Leonard Leo, the operative. Couldn't be more cozy.   So you send these letters.   Leo, by the way, has himself joined your billionaire boys' club. He  did so when one of your billionaires, Barre Seid, set him up with his  own $1.6 billion slush fund, held through a Utah 501(c)(4) front group  confected for that transaction.   Let's walk through what these letters say because the arguments are  so preposterous, it is hard to imagine they could be made in good  faith.   As you can imagine, when letters come from lawyers for billionaires  in the billionaire Court-packing boys' club, the letters are pretty  alike.   The first one for Crow says:         Congress does not have the constitutional power to impose       ethics rules and standards on the Supreme Court.    The second one for Mr. Leo says:         Your inquiry exceeds the limits placed by the Constitution       on the Committee's investigative authority.    Then there is a third one for another billionaire where they just did  one paragraph. Basically, it just says: Yeah, what Leonard Leo's lawyer  says.         This inquiry exceeds the limits placed on the legislature       by the Constitution.        We refer you to the relevant portions of the letter . . .       directed to you on behalf of Mr. Leo.    I feel kind of bad for these lawyers because I don't think you can  bill very much for one paragraph, whereas these guys can bill quite a  lot. Anyway, poor fellas.   So let's look at these other letters   I ask unanimous consent that the first page of the letter of lawyer  Bopp for billionaire Crow and the first page of the letter of lawyer  Rivkin for billionaire operative Leo--as exhibits at the end of my  remarks--with the short, one-paragraph letter, the tagalong letter from  attorney Clark, be printed in the Record.    Lawyers Bopp and Rivkin both tell me that  investigating their clients' activities is unconstitutional under the  separation of powers. We can't legislate about Supreme Court ethics, so  we can't investigate Supreme Court ethics.   First, remember that alongside separation of powers is its twin,  checks and balances, which requires branches, like the legislative  branch, to check and balance the behavior of other branches, like, in  this case, the judicial branch.   That is what we are doing here--checks and balances. Let's dive down  into the specifics a little bit more.   There are primarily three topics. One, did the billionaire or the  operative take improper advantage of the Tax Code in their dealings  with the Justices? That is what we are looking into. The Finance  Committee has its own investigation, along with the Judiciary  Committee, to focus on the tax side of this.  [[Page S4581]]    Well, I have to say it is hard to see how abuse of the Tax Code by a  private citizen in his tax filings could raise any separation of powers  concern. That is between the tax filer, the government, and the law.  The Justices are simply not a party to that. Even if we were looking at  the Justices' own tax filings, were it to come to that, they would be  investigated in their roles not as Justices but as taxpayers. Being a  Justice doesn't allow you to violate the tax laws or immunize you from  tax investigation or permit you to make actionable false statements in  your tax returns any more than being a Justice would allow you to  commit any other offense. So there is tax abuse, issue 1--no visible  separation-of-powers angle to it.    Issue 2, did the Justices receiving gifts and emoluments from the  billionaire or the operative properly report them, or did the judicial  gifts reporting system fail here? The billionaires' lawyers say that is  not our business. Well, that is Congress's business for two pretty  obvious reasons. First, the reporting requirements are a law passed by  Congress whose implementation we can absolutely oversee like any other  law passed by Congress, and this law includes Justices. Second, the  implementing body of that law is the Judicial Conference, a body  created by Congress whose activities we can absolutely oversee--we  created it. The notion that Congress cannot investigate to see if an  Agency it created is properly implementing laws Congress passed is  ludicrous on its face.   Peripherally, it is worth noting that the Supreme Court has never  objected on constitutional grounds to that body or to those laws. The  Chief Justice actually chairs the Judicial Conference without objection  to its congressional nature.   When questions about Justice Thomas's first round of free yacht and  jet travel from Harlan Crow were raised a decade ago, those concerns  went, under the law, to the Financial Disclosure Committee of the  Judicial Conference for review, without objection to the power of  review by Justice Thomas.   And when Thomas's recent round of billionaire-funded free yacht and  jet travel--Crow-Thomas 2.0, you might call it--raised questions anew,  again, those questions went to the Financial Disclosure Committee of  the Judicial Conference for review, where those questions pend now,  again, without objection. Nobody said: The Judicial Conference is  unconstitutional. The reporting laws are unconstitutional. You can't  look at this. Congress could never pass those laws. Congress could not  create judicial conflict.   Nobody said that.   Additionally, when Justice Scalia's trick came to light of obtaining  dozens of free hunting vacations and not disclosing them because it was  supposedly a ``personal invitation,'' which supposedly made it  ``personal hospitality'' that didn't have to be disclosed, the question  of that trip's propriety went to the Financial Disclosure Committee of  the Judicial Conference for review. The conference shut that trick down  firmly, and Justice Thomas conceded he would abide by the Judicial  Conference's determination--again, with no assertion that there was  anything unconstitutional about it. So the separation-of-powers  argument, in addition to making no sense, founders on the decades-long  acceptance in real life by Supreme Court Justices of our congressional  role through these laws and through the Judicial Conference.   Here is another argument they make. This is an interesting one. We  have been too mean. We have been too mean looking into these facts.  They tart that argument up in constitutional terminology, but that is  it in a nutshell. I have used the analogy, describing Leonard Leo's  role, in the billionaires' Court-capture scheme, of a spider in a web.  They think that is too mean.   The problem with that ``too mean'' argument is that it assumes the  result. If, in fact, there is a secret operation to capture and control  the Supreme Court for the benefit of special interests, and if, in  fact, Leo is its key operative, it is not actually all that mean to  make an analogy to a spider and a web. It is actually pretty mild and  quite descriptive.   The accusation that we are doing this just to be mean and it is  unfair to ask questions presumes that there is nothing secret and  sordid and wrong that would be revealed by our investigation. It is a  little like saying the police can't investigate me because it would be  unconstitutionally unfair because I am so innocent. Well, that is what  the police investigation would reveal, just as this congressional  investigation, unless successfully obstructed by the billionaires,  might very well reveal a dark episode of secret corruption of our  highest Court--perhaps, even the most covert, most persistent effort at  judicial corruption in our country's history.   To be continued. I will be back with more of this story.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Gibson Dunn,                                         Confidential, May 22, 2023.      Re Response to May 8, 2023, Letters to Harlan R. Crow, CH           Asset Company, Carey Commercial Ltd., and Topridge           Holdings, LLC.       Hon. Dick Durbin,      Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Durbin: We represent Harlan Crow in relation       to your letters of May 8, 2023 (the ``Letters''). Today, we       also are responding on behalf of CH Asset Company, Carey       Commercial Ltd., and Topridge Holdings, LLC. We recognize the       important role the Senate Judiciary Committee has in       considering legislation related to our federal court system,       and we appreciate the opportunity to engage with the       Committee.        After careful consideration, we do not believe the       Committee has the authority to investigate Mr. Crow's       personal friendship with Justice Clarence Thomas. Most       importantly, Congress does not have the constitutional power       to impose ethics rules and standards on the Supreme Court.       Doing so would exceed Congress's Article I authority and       violate basic separation of powers principles. That precludes       the Committee from pursuing an investigation in support of       such legislation.        Separately, the Committee has not identified a valid       legislative purpose for its investigation and is not       authorized to conduct an ethics investigation of a Supreme       Court Justice. The Committee's stated purpose of crafting new       ethics guidelines for the Supreme Court is inconsistent with       its actions and the circumstances in which this investigation       was launched, all of which suggest that the Committee is       targeting Justice Thomas for special and unwarranted       opprobrium. Moreover, any information the Committee might       legitimately need to draft legislation on this subject is       readily available from other sources, the use of which would       not trigger the same separation of powers concerns created by       the Committee's requests to Mr. Crow.        We address each of these points in greater detail below.                                   ____                                                   BakerHostetler,                                                      July 25, 2023.      Re Response to July 11, 2023 Letter to Leonard Leo.       Hon. Richard Durbin,      Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency           Action, and Federal Rights, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Durbin and Senator Whitehouse: We write on       behalf of Leonard Leo in response to your letter of July 11,       2023, which requested information concerning Mr. Leo's       interactions with Supreme Court Justices. We understand this       inquiry is part of an investigation certain members of the       Senate Judiciary Committee have undertaken regarding ethics       standards and the Supreme Court. While we respect the       Committee's oversight role, after reviewing your July 11       Letter, the nature of this investigation, and the       circumstances surrounding your interest in Mr. Leo, we       believe that your inquiry exceeds the limits placed by the       Constitution on the Committee's investigative authority.        Your investigation of Mr. Leo infringes two provisions of       the Bill of Rights. By selectively targeting Mr. Leo for       investigation on a politically charged basis, while ignoring       other potential sources of information on the asserted topic       of interest who are similarly situated to Mr. Leo but have       different political views that are more consistent with those       of the Committee majority, your inquiry appears to be       political retaliation against a private citizen in violation       of the First Amendment. For similar reasons, your inquiry       cannot be reconciled with the Equal Protection component of       the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. And regardless       of its other constitutional infirmities, it appears that your       investigation lacks a valid legislative purpose, because the       legislation the Committee is considering would be       unconstitutional if enacted.

Re Response to Letter Dated July 11, 2023, to Robin P.           Arkley, II, Our File No.: 00018.010802.       Hon. Richard Durbin,      Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Federal Courts Oversights, Agency           Action and Federal Rights, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Durbin and Senator Whitehouse: We write this       letter on behalf of Robin P. Arkley, II in response to your       letter dated July 11, 2023, which requested information       concerning Mr. Arkley's interactions with Supreme Court       Justices. While we respect the Senate Committee's oversight       role, we believe that this inquiry exceeds the limits placed       on the legislature by the Constitution. For our stated       reasons, we refer you to the relevant portions of the letter       dated July 25, 2023, from Baker & Hostetler directed to you       on behalf of Mr. Leo.        Thank you very much.            Sincerely,                                                   Samuel E. Clark.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I have four requests for committees  to meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
