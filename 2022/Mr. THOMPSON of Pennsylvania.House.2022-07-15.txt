 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the Smith family ahead of their 400th anniversary of arriving  to the United States.   In 1622, William Smith traveled across the ocean from England and  made landfall just north of Plymouth. Mr. Smith, like so many of the  original Pilgrims, left England in search of a new life as a result of  religious persecution. Being Methodist in a mostly Puritan colony meant  he and his family were considered strangers and outsiders in their  English community.   The Smith family eventually made their way to Jefferson County,  Pennsylvania, in 1816, which they have now called home for more than  200 years.   Madam Speaker, this weekend, the Smith family will gather in Clarion,  Pennsylvania, to mark 400 years in the United States in the form of a  family reunion. Their uniquely American story deserves to be  celebrated, and I want to extend my sincerest congratulations to the  Smith family for their longstanding history in the United States.                            ____________________
