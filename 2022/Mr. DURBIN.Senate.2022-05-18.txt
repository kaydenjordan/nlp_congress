 Mr. President, the majority leader reminds us of the  tragedy that occurred in Buffalo over the weekend and how the shooter  was somehow captivated by the notion of replacement theory--a theory  which is so insane and so mean-spirited that it ignores what this  country is all about.   A few minutes ago, over at what they call the House swamp, we held a  press conference. Senator Alex Padilla of California, myself,  Congresswoman Ross, and Congressman Bera met with a group of young  people. There were about 50 of them. Some were high school age; some  were in college. They are the sons and daughters of people who came to  the United States on H-1B visas. These are visas where people are  allowed to come here for a period of years and work, and the visas can  be renewed.   Children and families who accompany them are growing up in America,  living in America, while the breadwinner goes off to work each day, but  the clock is ticking. When the kids of these visa holders reach the age  of 21, they are subject to self-deportation. In other words, they have  no legal rights in America to remain.   The reason that they are in suspense for so long is that the green  card backlog can be decades while the parents are waiting for  permission to become legal in the United States on a permanent basis.  So these young people live in uncertainty.   Senator Padilla's bill is an effort--and I join with him in that  bill--an effort to give them the opportunity to earn their way to  citizenship, to become legal in America. Why would we give up this  talent? These young people have grown up in America. They have  [[Page S2556]]  been successful in school. They have participated in community  activities. They are ready to be part of America's future, I can tell.   One young woman got up there and told the story of how she came to  California with her parents under similar circumstances. She now is  completing her Ph.D. in biochemistry at Cornell University. She wants  to go into cancer research. Is America better if we force her to leave  this country at this point? She doesn't think so. She thinks she can  make this a better nation and better world if she can stay in America.   The folks who are so dead set against immigration ought to just pause  for a moment and meet the people we are talking about, the people who  are coming into this country, taking the jobs which Americans don't  want to take, doing things which Americans aspire to but don't achieve,  and many other aspects of our life that are really enriched by their  presence.   So I would urge my colleagues to support us in this bipartisan effort  for this bill. But I would also urge them to step back and make it  clear, the ``replacement theory'' is an insane approach to America. It  ignores our history; it ignores our future; and it ignores the reality  of our economy today.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate will consider three  outstanding nominees to the Federal district courts.   All three nominees are eminently qualified for the Federal bench and  have the character and judicial temperament to serve with distinction.  The nominees likewise represent important progress in ensuring that the  Federal judiciary reflects the nation it serves.   First is Jennifer Rochon, who has been nominated to serve on the U.S.  District Court for the Southern District of New York.   Today, Ms. Rochon serves as the first general counsel of the Girl  Scouts of the United States of America, a role she first assumed in  2013. She provides guidance, strategic insight, and legal counsel on a  wide range of issues, and she also advises the Girl Scouts' board of  directors on their fiduciary duties.   Prior to joining the organization, Ms. Rochon was a partner at Kramer  Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP and a general commercial litigator,  experience that will serve her well on the district court. Notably, she  was also elected by Kramer Levin's partnership to be the first woman to  serve on the firm's executive committee.   Over the course of her career, Ms. Rochon has advocated for gender  equality and the advancement of women in the legal profession. She is  yet another example of President Biden's commitment to a professionally  diverse, exceptionally qualified judiciary, and I know she will serve  the Southern District of New York well.   Ms. Rochon has the strong support of her home State Senators, Mr.  Schumer and Mrs. Gillibrand, and she was unanimously rated ``Well  Qualified'' by the American Bar Association.   Given the depth of her experience and her demonstrated prowess in the  law, I am proud to support Ms. Rochon's nomination, and I encourage my  colleagues to do the same.   Our next nominee is Judge Trina Thompson. With 14 years as a trial  litigator and over 21 years of service to the Alameda County Superior  Court, Judge Thompson is unquestionably qualified to serve as a Federal  district court judge.   She began her legal career as an assistant public defender at the  Alameda County Public Defender's Office, where she tried over 35 cases  as sole counsel over the course of 4 years. She then spent 10 years as  a criminal defense solo practitioner, trying over 30 additional cases  as sole counsel and another eight cases as cocounsel.   Back in 2000, the Alameda County Superior Court Judges appointed  Judge Thompson to serve as a juvenile court commissioner on the  Dependency and Delinquency Court. Just 2 years later, she was elected  as an Alameda County Superior Court Judge, a role she continues to hold  to this day.   Throughout her 22 years of judicial service, Judge Thompson has  presided over 150 criminal jury trials, thousands of hearings, and  hundreds of criminal and civil bench trials.   With her incredible depth of trial experience on and off the bench,  it is no surprise that this Bay Area native, who earned both her A.B.  and her J.D. from the University of California at Berkeley, has the  strong support of her home State Senators, Mrs. Feinstein and Mr.  Padilla.   It is also no wonder that the American Bar Association unanimously  rated Judge Thompson as ``Well Qualified.''   The decades of trial litigation and judicial experience that Judge  Thomas has accumulated will be an immense asset to the Northern  District of California, which has a number of vacancies that urgently  need to be filled by qualified judges.   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting her  confirmation.   Finally, the Senate will vote on Judge Sunshine Sykes, who has been  nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Central District  of California.   Judge Sykes is an experienced litigator and jurist with a long record  of unbiased decision-making. She attended Stanford University and  Stanford Law School before beginning her legal career with a focus on  civil litigation and juvenile dependency cases. She served as a staff  attorney for California Indian Legal Services; worked for the juvenile  defense panel in Murrieta, CA; and served as a deputy county counsel in  Riverside County.   In 2013, Sykes was appointed to serve as a California Superior Court  judge. As a member of the Navajo Nation, she was the first Native  American individual to sit on the Riverside Superior Court. During her  time as a Superior Court judge, she has presided over more than 90  cases that have gone to verdict or judgment and over thousands of  additional hearings.   Judge Sykes has the strong support of Senator Feinstein and Senator  Padilla, and she was unanimously rated ``Well Qualified'' by the  American Bar Association. If confirmed, she will be the first Native  American article III judge to serve in California.   Her record on the bench is deeply impressive, and she will continue  to administer justice in a thoughtful, evenhanded manner as a district  court judge. I will vote to confirm her to the Central District of  California. I hope my colleagues join me in doing the same.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Ms. Rosen) and  the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) are necessarily absent.
