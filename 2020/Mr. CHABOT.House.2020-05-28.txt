 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in reluctant opposition to H.R. 6782, the Small Business  Transparency and Reporting for the Underbanked and Taxpayers at Home  Act, or the TRUTH Act, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to express my appreciation to Chairwoman  Velazquez and her staff for working with me and with my staff on this  legislation, as well as many other pieces of legislation in the past.   On this specific bill, we were able to negotiate a couple of changes  that made the bill slightly more palatable for those of us on this side  of the aisle, and that would have not happened without the chairwoman's  leadership, so we do appreciate that.   That said, philosophically, it is exceptionally difficult for me and  others on this side of the aisle to accept the bill in its entirety.  For instance, I am a firm believer that small businesses are just that,  small businesses; and as long as they qualify under the Small Business  Act and the SBA size standards, no one small business ought to have to  do anything different under the law than any other small business.   In addition to all the burdensome reporting requirements this  legislation would impose on small businesses, there are two specific  provisions that are difficult for us to support.   First, the bill we have before us attempts to name--and some would  say, shame--businesses that are recent PPP loan recipients above $2  million. And I do appreciate Chairwoman Velazquez going from $250,000  to $2 million.   These businesses--at least the ones that acted in good faith-- followed the law and the guidelines and received their loans based on  the best information available at that time, and I do not believe that  those businesses should be put on public display for potential shaming.   If they didn't follow the rules, we have remedies for calling them  out, such as the SBA's Office of the Inspector General, even the  Department of Justice, to seek out waste, fraud, and abuse. Publicly  naming them will do little to increase transparency or anything else,  for that matter, we believe.   Second, the bill requires, albeit voluntarily, small businesses to  disclose whether they are economically disadvantaged, minority owned,  women owned, or veteran owned. As I mentioned previously, I believe we  ought to be making regulatory burdens fewer and farther between, not  imposing more paperwork that doesn't help any business fight this  pandemic.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly oppose this legislation but again  thank the chairwoman for her leadership and willingness to work with us  on these bills and on many issues facing America's small businesses  moving forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  want to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) on her  leadership, and I regret that we cannot support this particular piece  of legislation; however, I am certain that we will continue to work  together in a bipartisan manner to address the needs of America's small  businesses.   I would note, just in response, briefly, to the gentleman's mention  that this is called the TRUTH Act, just because something is called the  TRUTH Act doesn't necessarily mean that it is the truth, just like  something called the Affordable Care Act doesn't necessarily mean it is  going to make healthcare more affordable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Unlike the previous bill, I am happy to say that I agree with the  chairwoman, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 7010, the Paycheck  Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020, as amended.   I would, again, like to thank Chairwoman Velazquez for conducting  this process in such a bipartisan manner. It is more important than  ever to maintain our strong bilateral negotiations as we continue to  combat the spread of COVID-19 and its devastating, absolutely  devastating, effect on our economy, especially our small businesses in  that economy.   Over the past 3 months, I have been in contact with literally  thousands of small businesses, not only in my hometown of Cincinnati,  but across the country. I have joined dozens of conference calls with  my congressional colleagues and with their constituents and mine all  the way from the State of Washington to the State of Florida, and just  about everywhere in between.   There has been broad consensus during those interactions that the PPP  program has served as a lifeline for small businesses and their  employees, many of whom have been shut down through no fault of their  own.   By and large, it would be hard to argue against the fact that the PPP  program has, for the most part, been successful. Over 4 million small  businesses have received a PPP loan thus far, allowing them to hang on  as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across our Nation.    Of course, there have been some shortcomings, some unintended  consequences. That will happen when you do 6 months of legislative work  in 6 days. That is why we are here today, to fix some of the unintended  consequences.   For example, when we crafted the original CARES Act back in March,  the covered period was defined as 8 weeks. The true emergency period  has evolved over time. This bill begins to address that.   To fix the miscalculation in how long this pandemic would last, this  bill extends the 8-week original covered period to 24 weeks and creates  an option allowing businesses that want to stay within the original 8- week window to do so. This promotes greater flexibility for small  businesses to decide when it is best to start spending their PPP loan.   It is important to remember that this change isn't as simple as  moving a few dates around. There are a lot of unintended consequences  that we need to account for because more than 4 million loans have  already gone through the program in the amount of half a trillion  dollars.   First, the original CARES Act allows principal, interest, and fees to  be deferred for between 6 and 12 months. The administration adjusted  this deferment period to just 6 months through guidance.   This deferment time period needed to be shifted to ensure a business  knows its loan forgiveness amount before its deferment period  concludes. This bill accomplishes that by extending the deferment  window to end once the SBA makes the forgiveness payment to the lender  on the borrower's behalf.   Second, the bill amends the 75/25 rule which was inserted into the  PPP by the administration through guidance to require 75 percent of the  loan to be used on payroll costs and 25 percent to be used on mortgage  interest, rent, and utilities. So that is what the previous rule called  for, 75/25.   This bill replaced that with a 60/40 split to, again, give small  businesses greater flexibility as to how to best utilize their PPP  funds.   Third, the bill extends the 2-year maturity of the loan to a 5-year  maturity for new loans to help small businesses struggling to make  their payments in a weakened economy. Loans already processed remain at  the 2-year maturity rate so that there is no retroactivity in this  provision.   The bill makes clear that small businesses and lenders are free to  negotiate modifications in the maturity terms if they both agree.  Again, both have to agree, both the borrower or the small business and  the lender.   Fourth, the bill allows businesses that receive PPP loan forgiveness  to also receive their employer payroll tax deferment.   And that was a big issue. Many of the small businesses were concerned  that they were losing one of the advantages that was in the original  PPP program in the CARES Act. So this is back in. They will be able to  take that business deduction from their taxes.   Fifth, the bill also codifies the rehire flexibility provision. So as  long as a good-faith offer to return to work is provided to a recently  laid off worker, the business will satisfy the head count requirements.   This safe harbor provision attempts to address the challenges many  small businesses have had getting some employees to return to work with  the $600 Federal unemployment check per week on top of the State  unemployment checks which they are also receiving.   Finally, the bill establishes a new safe harbor to account for  businesses that are required by civil authority to open only at 50  percent capacity. This ensures that businesses that have no choice but  to run at half capacity are not left behind by their counterparts who  have the ability to operate fully. So it is a fairness issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed  bipartisan bill that provides real solutions to American small  businesses facing this very difficult situation.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the chairwoman for working on this  on a bipartisan basis.   This flexibility allows America's small businesses to go a long way  to addressing many of the concerns that we heard time and time again  from small businesses all across the country. They need to have the  flexibility to spend the money most efficiently so that the businesses  can actually stay afloat, make it through this pandemic, and, most  importantly, be able to keep as many of their employees on the payroll  so that they are able to support their families as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation on both sides of the aisle, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and thank the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Roy) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips)  for working together in a bipartisan manner on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), a very important member of the Committee on  Small Business.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez)  for her cooperation and Mr. Roy and Mr. Phillips, as well, for working  together in a bipartisan manner on this important legislation.   COVID-19, the coronavirus, has had a tremendous impact, an adverse  impact on our Nation, particularly on our Nation's economy,  particularly on America's small businesses. Many of them,  unfortunately, have had to shut down during this time.   When we originally passed the CARES Act, which included the Paycheck  Protection Program--or now it has become so popular, now it is PPP. It  is known by that by millions of small businesses all across the  country.   We didn't know exactly how long the pandemic would last. We still  don't know, for that matter. So 8 weeks, for example, was the period of  time that determined the payouts and whether the loan would be forgiven  or not, whether in fact it would be a grant, whether these small  businesses would have to pay it back.   As it turned out, 8 weeks, alone, isn't a sufficient period of time  for many small businesses. This legislation extends that to 24 weeks,  at the option of the borrower. So this will allow many small businesses  all across the country to see what benefits them the most so they can  survive, so they can keep their employees employed so they can support  their families. So that is an important item that is in this  legislation.   In addition, changing the 75/25 rule to 60/40, again, is going to  give these businesses the flexibility that they need.   How long do small businesses have to pay it back? Well, those who  have already taken out the loans, 2 years. For new loans taken out from  here on--and there is over $100 billion left in the  [[Page H2338]]  fund, so there will be many small businesses that still get loans--the  period will be 24 weeks. Now, by the time the Senate gets ahold of  this, it is always possible that that may be compromised, but at this  point, it is 24 weeks in this particular piece of legislation.    But I think one of the important things to remember is that the  borrower and the lender can get together and mutually agree, if they  want to agree, if they don't necessarily fall into the two categories  that I just mentioned. So there is some flexibility for them to  negotiate there as well. And there are other items, as we have already  discussed.   But the important thing is this will give America's small businesses  the flexibility to ensure that they at least have a chance to survive.  And I know in my district in Cincinnati, and districts all over the  country, their very survival is at issue here.   The PPP program--and it is a lot of money, as was mentioned: $350  billion and another $310 billion, so around $660 billion in this  program going out all over the country to these small businesses that  are the backbone of the American economy. About half the people who  work in America work for one of these small businesses. So this will  help them to survive.   Thank goodness the House of Representatives was able to work together  in a bipartisan manner to come to this point today where this  legislation will likely pass in a few minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the chairwoman, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
