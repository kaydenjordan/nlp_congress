 Madam Speaker, I stand before this room to hold  this Supreme Court in contempt; this Supreme Court that is wildly out  of step with both precedent and public opinion.   This Supreme Court which, through its terrible lack of judgment, both  in chambers and on luxury vacations, has lost the faith of the American  people.   This extremist Supreme Court, through its affirmative action  decision, has reaffirmed the entrenched power of the wealthy elite who  pay for their luxury vacations while, at the same time, pulling the rug  out from under millions of minority students who have excelled despite  adversity, who strive to attain the American Dream, and who seek to  help their communities.   I will talk about the real life-and-death consequences of this  decision, the collateral damage these Justices have inflicted, because  in this country Black women have a maternal and infant mortality rate  three times that of their White peers, while the rate of African- American medical residents entering OB/GYN programs has been declining.   The mortality rates for Black mothers and their babies in the United  States rivals those of many Third World countries. What happens to our  Nation's shameful infant and maternal mortality rate when fewer Black  doctors are entering the field able to recognize and combat the biases  that lead to such misery?   How many mothers will bear the burden of burying their newborn  because some faceless organization engaged the Supreme Court in its  radical politics to uphold white supremacy?   How many young mothers will be ripped away from their children and  their husbands due to the perceived slights of fragile men in black  robes?   These decisions have consequences.   Right now, just 4 percent of psychologists are Black. At a time when  suicide rates are climbing among Black children, what is the  consequence for a generation of Black children when a generation of  culturally competent Black therapists and counselors disappears?   How many American families will be destroyed because the help their  children needed was not available due to the extreme decisions of  unaccountable, reckless political actors?   Something tells me these questions were not top of mind for Justice  Samuel Alito or Clarence Thomas. They are making decisions not based on  honest interpretation of the Constitution, but on their own radical  ideology.   They are a captured, unelected arm of the extreme rightwing of the  Republican Party. The American people recognize this and have lost  faith in their ability to pass judgment impartially.   This decision is not just about who gets to go to school. It is about  who lives and dies and who is left to pick up the pieces.   We must reform the Supreme Court and balancing it through expansion  is a critical response to the crisis we experience.                            ____________________
