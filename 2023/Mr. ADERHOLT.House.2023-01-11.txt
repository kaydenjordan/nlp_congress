 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for yielding.   As I have said before and will continue to say, I am pro-life, pro- family, and pro-child. I am very proud to see that one of the very  first pieces of legislation that comes before this Congress and the new  majority is protecting the vulnerable. That is something I have always  stood up for since my first time here in Congress.   It seems like there is some confusion, especially on the other side  of the aisle, Madam Speaker, about what this legislation is about. This  legislation is very simple. It simply states and ensures that babies  who survive an abortion receive care and protection and that they are  not discarded because someone else had intended to end their lives. It  prohibits healthcare practitioners from turning a blind eye to abortion  survivors.   No matter the intent of what you believe about life, failure to care  for an unborn child is infanticide, and the law must be enforced.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to remember that the last time we  voted on this bill, there was bipartisan support, and I ask again for  support of this commonsense, lifesaving legislation.
