 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, 5,000 of my fellow New Jerseyans have died and many  more will in the weeks to come, and still we can't get enough tests for  those who need it.   We are the richest, most powerful country in the world, and we are  now tired of excuses. We need a national testing program to let us know  if our loved ones are healthy or sick so we can reopen our country and  help our small businesses.   That is our challenge. It is what history will judge us by. Let's get  it done.
