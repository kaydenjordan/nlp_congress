 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as my colleagues know, this week we will  take up the nominations of the men and women who President-Elect Trump  has selected for his Cabinet. I have to say, for myself, that looking  at the quality of the people the President-elect has nominated gives me  quite a bit of reassurance about what his administration will be like,  starting with the Vice President, Mike Pence. Mr. Pence is somebody  well known to those of us here in the Congress, having served 12 years  in the House of Representatives, and then he went on to be the Governor  of Indiana for 4 years. He is eminently qualified to help the  administration and the President-elect navigate the perils and pitfalls  of the legislative process here in the Senate and in the House.    Then we look at the other people who have been nominated, whether it  is for Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, or the Department of  Homeland Security. In some cases, they are unconventional choices, but,  in every case I can think of, they are people who have eminent  qualifications to offer to the administration and to the country in  this new administration.   This is one of the most important responsibilities a Senator has--to  make sure we conduct the advice and consent process and make sure we  vet the nominees for these important posts. But in one case in  particular, it is not going to be all that hard because we have served  alongside Senator Jeff Sessions, for 15 years in my case and for 20  years in other cases.   We should be working together, as President Obama himself has said,  recognizing the importance of a smooth transition from the outgoing  administration to the new one. That should be true no matter what side  of the aisle you are on. Unfortunately, I think some of our Democratic  friends are still in some shock from the election on November 8.   I remember a book written on the grieving process, describing that  first comes denial, then comes anger, and then ultimately acceptance. I  think what our Democratic colleagues have to work through is their  denial and anger to get to acceptance of the fact that President-Elect  Trump and Vice President-Elect Pence won the election.   So what is our responsibility? It is to work in a bipartisan basis to  make sure that they have the people around them that they need in order  to run the government.   We are simply trying to stick to the same standard set under  President Obama. In 2009, our Democratic colleagues held seven  confirmation hearings in one day. That is more than we are planning to  do on Wednesday. So my response to our friends across the aisle is to  listen to the junior Senator from Connecticut, who told a reporter: ``I  can figure out how to walk across the hall and attend two hearings  occurring simultaneously.''   One of the most important hearings, in my mind, we will hold is the  hearing we are going to have in the Judiciary Committee starting  tomorrow on the President-elect's nominee as Attorney General--our  friend Senator Jeff Sessions. As I said, the junior Senator from  Alabama has a lengthy history serving his State and country in law  enforcement, but his passion for public service started long before  that.   Before we knew him in the Senate, Jeff Sessions was an Eagle Scout  from Hybart, AL. He later served in the Army Reserves. After college,  he taught at Goode Street Elementary School in Montgomery, AL. I bet  even those of us who have known him a long time did not know that he  taught at Goode Street Elementary School in Montgomery, AL, after  college. Then he went on to become a lawyer, receiving his law degree  from the University of Alabama. He later worked as a Federal  prosecutor, including 12 years as a U.S. attorney for the Southern  District of Alabama. Then--where I got to know him--he became his  State's attorney general.   Senator Sessions' record is one of a person not afraid to go after  those who are abusing power. From State judges and senators to county  commissioners and school board members, Jeff Sessions has rooted out  and punished corrupt officials as was his job as a U.S. attorney. As  U.S. attorney, he fought to secure the rights of African Americans to  vote and successfully advocated to uphold the death penalty sentence of  Ku Klux Klan member and murderer Henry Hays.   Here in the Senate, he served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for  20  [[Page S133]]  years, where I have come to know him well. Working with him has shown  me not only his sharp mind but his passion for the people of this  country and his commitment to the rule of law. He is a hard worker and  a person who makes his decisions based on what he thinks is the right  thing to do and his own integrity. I know many of us can attest to  this, including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. While  holding true to his principles, Jeff Sessions has found common ground  with folks across the ideological spectrum on many issues, including  ones he will work on as Attorney General of the United States.   For example, in 2003, Senator Sessions worked closely with the late- Senator Teddy Kennedy, whom I have called the liberal lion of the  Senate. Perhaps, I am not the first one, but he certainly was that. He  was a larger-than-life personality and somebody who personified our  political opposition across the aisle. But Jeff Sessions and Teddy  Kennedy worked together to help fight sexual assault in prison in a way  that was both proactive and pragmatic. Senator Sessions crafted  legislation to encourage State governments to take affirmative measures  that reduced the frequency of sexual assault in jails and prisons. We  continue to see the benefits of this legislation today, as more and  more States get serious and crack down on this crime. Last Congress, I  was proud to work with Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, the ranking  member in the 114th Congress, and others in this Chamber, to pass the  Justice for All Reauthorization Act, which created additional tools  that strengthened the Prison Rape Elimination Act.   Then there is the work Senator Sessions has done with the assistant  minority leader, the Democratic whip, and the senior Senator from  Vermont, two of this Chamber's more liberal Members, to address  sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. It  became obvious over time that many people living in our inner cities  were using crack cocaine, but their fellow countrymen living in more  affluent areas caught with powder cocaine were subject to far lesser  sentences than those in the inner cities using crack cocaine. The work  Senator Sessions did with Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy, called the  Fair Sentencing Act, was signed in to law by President Obama in 2010.  Senator Sessions saw the harsh penalties many young African-American  men experienced for possession of crack, compared to the lighter  punishments given to suspects found with powder cocaine, who as a group  tended to be more White or Hispanic. To me, this is the sort of thing  that offends the most basic sensibilities of Jeff Sessions--somebody  who believes unequivocally in color-blind justice and equal justice  under the law. Of course, the utmost responsibility of the U.S.  Department of Justice is to enforce the law and ensure equality for all  Americans under our Constitution.   Senator Sessions has demonstrated that he is qualified and prepared  to serve as the Nation's top law enforcement officer--not only thanks  to a proven track record but, because at his core, he understands the  importance of justice for all and upholding the rule of law. Now, you  don't have to take my word for it. Here is what some of our leading  Democratic colleagues have had to say about working with Senator  Sessions over the years:   The incoming Democratic leader, Senator Schumer of New York, called  Jeff Sessions ``straightforward and fair.''   Senator Durbin, the Democratic whip, in June 2010, working with him  to eliminate the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine  called Jeff Sessions ``a man of his word.''   Then, perhaps, there is an unlikely person to compliment Senator  Sessions, because of some of the positions Attorney General Holder took  that I think Senator Sessions found objectionable--particularly when  injecting too much politics into the work of the Department of Justice  and not enforcing what Senator Sessions saw to be the rule of law.  Nevertheless, former Attorney General Eric Holder on January 2016,  2009, called Senator Sessions ``a great U.S. attorney.''   Senator Sessions has both the temperament and experience to restore  the faith of all Americans in our justice system, and we have the  responsibility to grant him a fair confirmation hearing starting  tomorrow. I suspect our Democratic colleagues agree, because in 2015  they penned a letter that said:         The Attorney General plays a pivotal role in administering       our nation's laws and protecting our national security. This       is why the Senate, regardless of the party in control, has       historically given swift consideration to Attorney General       nominees.    Those were our Democratic colleagues. The chance to do so is right  before all of us, and I hope they will assist us in a fair and swift  confirmation process for a truly honorable and deserving candidate for  Attorney General.   I know we will miss Senator Sessions in the Senate. Not that we  always agreed with him, but he always disagreed in the most congenial  sort of manner and in a way that we knew he had respect for people of  widely divergent views. But the fact is that our country needs him to  lead the Department of Justice now more than ever.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr.  Graham), and the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).
