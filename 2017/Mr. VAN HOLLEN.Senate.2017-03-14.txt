 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the so- called healthcare bill coming out of the House of Representatives which  has been supported by the President.   We just yesterday got the report from the Congressional Budget Office  which analyzes this legislation and its impact on Americans. What we  find in great detail and with great clarity is that this TrumpCare  legislation is a huge tax windfall to the wealthiest Americans at the  expense of affordable healthcare for tens of millions of our fellow  citizens. It is time the Senate begin to pay attention to what is  happening in this legislation.   Someone might look at this and now call it not ``TrumpCare'' but  ``Trump doesn't care'' because what we find out is that in the very  first year, in 2018, 14 million Americans will lose their health  coverage--14 million in the very first year this is implemented. Those  are moms, dads, kids, people of all ages--our fellow Americans. Just 2  years after that, beginning in 2020, we are going to see 21 million of  our fellow citizens lose their access to health coverage. Let me be  clear. When we say they lose their access to affordable care, we are  talking about compared to what they have right now under the Affordable  Care Act, under ObamaCare. So in the year 2020, 21 million Americans  who have access to affordable care through the Affordable Care Act are  going to lose it, and within 10 years, that will rise to 24 million of  our fellow citizens.   Not only are those millions of Americans going to lose their health  care in the early years of this new plan, people are going to see their  premiums spike in the individual market. We have heard understandable  complaints about the increase in premiums in the Affordable Care Act  exchanges. There are commonsense things we can do to fix it. Many of us  have put forward proposals to do that, but this will actually  dramatically spike up to 20 percent premiums in those markets in the  early years. Who gets especially hard hit? Well, older Americans.  Americans between 47 years old and 64 years old, before they are old  enough to receive Medicare but when they are old enough to be  potentially experiencing many healthcare issues.    In fact, if you look at the Congressional Budget Office report, and I  know people sometimes gloss over the fine print, but table 4 indicates  that if you are a 64-year-old with an income of $26,000 a year, your  premium is going to increase from $1,700 a year to a whopping $14,600  per year. That is in the Congressional Budget Office report, but you  know what, AARP, they believe it. They are on full alert, letting  Americans throughout the country know how damaging this will be to  older Americans who will, all of a sudden, see their premiums, their  copays, and their deductibles going through the roof. It is going to  become absolutely unaffordable for those older Americans to get health  insurance.   On top of that, despite what we all know is an opioid crisis in the  country, an epidemic of substance abuse and addiction, despite that,  this TrumpCare bill actually eliminates the Medicaid funding  specifically to deal with opioid addiction. I know many members of the  Senate and the House have been going back home, going to all parts of  their States, urban areas, suburban and rural areas, to talk about the  scourge of opioid addiction, and many have been talking about the fact  that the Senate was able to work to increase funding to address those  addiction issues, but this House bill, this TrumpCare bill, actually  eliminates the Medicaid Program for opioid abuse and addiction.   The list of horribles goes on and on. They claim you are going to be  able to get coverage--no problem if you have preexisting conditions or  whatever. The reality is, let's say you have a job, let's say you lose  your job, let's say you lose your income because you lost your job, you  only have 63 days to turn around and get insurance, which may not be  affordable. If you are not able to find your insurance, an affordable  insurance plan in those 63 days, when you finally do, they are going to  charge you a 30-percent penalty. So you lost your job. You have no  income so you can't afford insurance. Yet, when you are finally in a  position to do it, they are going to charge you a penalty of 30  percent.   The more you dig into this TrumpCare legislation, the more things  like that you find out. It is really important that the American people  know what is in it as we debate this important issue.   Women's health. The TrumpCare bill directly goes after women's access  to affordable healthcare, including their defunding of Planned  Parenthood. I think all of us know that in many parts of our country,  Planned Parenthood clinics are the only viable source of healthcare for  women who are looking for cancer screening, breast cancer screening,  cervical cancer screening, and other preventive healthcare measures.   As we read this report from the Congressional Budget Office that just  came out yesterday, we are getting a better idea of why the House of  Representatives was so eager to rush this through the committees-- rushed it through the Ways and Means Committee, rushed it through the  Energy and Commerce Committee in the House--because apparently it is a  lot easier to vote for a piece of legislation when you don't know the  consequences. Apparently it is easier to say yes to this bill when you  don't know that it will deny healthcare coverage to 24 million  Americans, spike premiums over the next couple of years, eliminate  other important coverages for our fellow Americans, but people don't  have that excuse anymore.   They tried to rush it through. They got it through those two  committees. Willful ignorance allowed them to have those votes and it  passed those committees, but now we have, from the  [[Page S1790]]  Congressional Budget Office, a comprehensive and thorough analysis of  the impact on our fellow Americans. It hurts. It hurts a lot. Now, I  recall, and I think the American public recalls, that during the  campaign on ``60 Minutes,'' Candidate Trump said:         I'm going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it       costs me votes or not. Everybody is going to be taken care of       much better than they are taken care of now.    Well, you tell that to the 14 million Americans who are going to lose  their health insurance in 2018. You tell that to the 64-year-old who  would be paying $14,000 in premiums a year, up from $1,700 under the  Affordable Care Act. You tell that to people who are suffering from  opioid abuse in all parts of our country when the Medicaid Program no  longer has to provide coverage for substance abuse.   That is not taking care of ``everybody.'' That is leaving tens of  millions of Americans behind. That was during the campaign. Here is  what we heard from President Trump in January, this year. He is going  to provide ``insurance for everybody.'' That is just not so, unless  what you are saying is we are going to offer you a totally unaffordable  insurance plan.   By the way, if you happen to have enough money, you can pay for it.  It is kind of like saying to somebody: You know what, that Rolls Royce  or that Lamborghini, that is available for purchase, but most of us  just don't have the money to afford that kind of purchase. In that  theoretical sense, you may argue that health insurance is available,  but the Congressional Budget Office did not look at theories. They  looked at facts. They looked at the impact on real Americans and  concluded that 14 million would lose their access in 2018, rising to 24  million over the next decade.   Despite the fact that on March 9 President Trump tweeted that ``it  will end in a beautiful picture,'' that is not a beautiful picture for  tens of millions of Americans who will be left behind by this series of  broken promises, broken promises and betrayal from President Trump. As  he campaigned around the country, he promised coverage for everybody,  affordable coverage. We would all love it.   Now we have the hard facts. So it was quite a spectacle to see the  Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Tom Price,  trying to run away from the facts in the Congressional Budget Office  report. He got up and said, you know, he does not really believe the  Congressional Budget Office report.   Well, the reality is that Tom Price, when he was Congressman Price,  when he was the chairman on the House Budget Committee, along with  Senator Enzi, helped pick the current Director of the Congressional  Budget Office, Keith Hall. I know that because I was the senior  Democrat on the House Budget Committee. I was part of the interview  process. You know, they let us come along, but the reality is, at the  end of the day, he was picked by Secretary Tom Price.   Here is what Tom Price said about the Director of the Congressional  Budget Office. He said:         Keith Hall--    That is the Director--       will bring an impressive level of economic expertise and       experience to the Congressional Budget Office. Throughout his       career, he has served in both the public and private sector       under Presidents of both parties and in roles that make him       well suited to lead the Congressional Budget Office.    He goes on to praise the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.  I know the Presiding Officer and our colleagues have experience  understanding how important it is to have a nonpartisan referee in the  Congressional Budget Office. Otherwise, it is anything goes. Senators  get to make up their own facts. I know we have a White House and a  President that has invented the term ``alternative facts'' and  ``alternative reality'' and ``alternative universe,'' but here in the  Congress, we have prided ourselves in knowing there is some referee on  the field when it comes to the Congressional Budget Office. We don't  agree with every single conclusion they have, but we don't work to  discredit them. It really is a discredit to the Secretary of HHS that  having praised and picked the current Director of CBO, he would now  attack that institution simply because he does not like the results of  their analysis.   I would not like the results either because they show how devastating  TrumpCare is for the American people. It shows what a total betrayal of  the President's promises TrumpCare is to the American people. It is not  just the Congressional Budget Office analysis that has reached that  conclusion. He is going to also go after AARP because they are on full  alert, and they are calling all their members to say this is a really  bad bill for tens of millions of Americans, especially older Americans,  people in the range of 47 years old to 64 years old, before they get on  Medicare.   The American Hospital Association and hospitals in all parts of our  country, and especially rural hospitals, areas Candidate Trump  campaigned heavily in, are letting their members know the devastating  consequences of this TrumpCare bill. The American Medical Association,  the people who are providing health care to our fellow citizens, they  are letting people know how damaging this will be.   So we have a wide array of Americans who are in the position, and it  is their job to provide health care to the American public, who say:  Whoa, this is harmful to your health. This is a danger to the  healthcare of the American people. It is not simply the numbers, it is  also the people and faces behind those numbers.   From Maryland, I got a note from Jenny from Salisbury. That is in  Eastern Maryland. That is a rural part of our State. She said:         I have a rare progressive lung disease. With good care I       may live 30 more years. Without it, I may live 5 or 10, sick       and disabled. I remember high-risk pools and preexisting       conditions exclusions. I need the ACA. I may die without it       and I am afraid for my life.    Here is Gail from Annapolis:         I'm very concerned with the repeal of the Affordable Care       Act. It helps the disability community. Our adult daughter       who has a severe cognitive disability will be relying on       Medicaid for health services after my husband retires this       summer at age 70 with a second-time recurrence of lymphoma. I       don't know what you can do, but this is a concern as aging       parents find their special-needs adult child may not have       coverage as she loses her family's ability to support her       healthcare.    The letters go on and on from all parts of Maryland and all parts of  the country. What adds insult to injury is that all these Americans are  going to be harmed, the 24 million who will lose their healthcare  coverage, those who will experience spikes in their premiums and  copays, the older Americans--47 to 64--who are going to see gigantic  increases in their costs so they are not going to be able to afford  healthcare anymore, those in rural areas and urban areas in all parts  of our country who are suffering from opioid abuse but Medicaid is no  longer going to cover it. All of that harm is being done to tens of  millions of our fellow citizens in order to give this huge tax break to  the wealthiest Americans and special interests, including insurance  companies and the pharmaceutical industry.    The Congressional Budget Office report is pretty clear--$590 billion  in tax cuts. Do you know what the top one-tenth of 1 percent income  earners will get in terms of tax cuts? An average tax cut of $200,000.  Millionaires will get an average tax cut of $50,000. There is even a  provision in here that says to insurance companies: We are going to  subsidize the bonuses you pay to CEOs. You are now going to be able to  deduct the multimillion-dollar bonuses you pay to your CEOs. We are  going to do that so that fewer people can have health coverage.   We get rid of the fee on insurance companies that helps to provide  access to millions of Americans.   It is simply grotesque that we see this legislation getting as far as  it has. We know why they tried to move it so quickly without a  Congressional Budget Office report--because this report is devastating.  It should be the final nail in the coffin of TrumpCare, and we should  all, frankly, be a little embarrassed by a proposal that provides $590  billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and some of the most  powerful special interests at the expense of healthcare for so many of  our fellow citizens.   We have to say no to this plan. We have to say no to TrumpCare. And  let's get about doing our business. There are some issues we can deal  with, with the Affordable Care Act, but you don't destroy it while  giving these tax breaks  [[Page S1791]]  to the wealthiest Americans in order to do our job.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 42  today, a bill in search of a problem. Back in 2012, Congress passed  legislation to extend temporary unemployment insurance as our country  worked to recover from the recession. That legislation included a  bipartisan compromise that allowed States to drug test people applying  for unemployment compensation if they were fired from their previous  job for drug use or they were pursuing employment in a field that  regularly required drug testing for safety reasons. The Department of  Labor was charged with determining those occupations.   This guidance is critical because courts have twice ruled against  States who implemented blanket testing for TANF benefits. Without  probably cause, they ruled that such testing violated constitutional  rights. By overriding the Department of Labor's rule, States are left  in confusion.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle might argue that the  authority to drug test is important to help save money in the program.  There is no clear evidence that this is the case. There is also no  convincing evidence of rampant drug use among beneficiaries. States  have engaged in drug testing for TANF recipients with remarkably few  results. In Oklahoma in 2015, nearly 90 percent of those required to  take a drug test had a negative result for drug use. In fiscal year  2014, Utah's drug testing returned just 18 positive results. As of  2016, only 0.1 percent of all applicants for Tennessee's cash  assistance program tested positive.   We all acknowledge an opioid crisis in our communities. Instead of  using resources to help people access treatment programs, we are  debating creating costly drug testing programs that have failed to  produce significant results in States where they have been tried. Over  in the House, they are considering TrumpCare, which would erode drug  treatment coverage. We should be working to address this tragedy, not  spending time on wasteful and damaging measures like these. I urge a  ``no'' vote.
