 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson) for this opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to discuss our commitment to civility, a  promise that I have made to my constituents at home and a promise that  I have made to my colleagues here in Washington, D.C.   Prior to my being sworn in, during my campaign of 2016, the number  one question I heard and I received from the people in my district on  the Central Coast of California was: Why would you want to go to  Washington, D.C., right now?   I heard that over and over and over. I heard that people were  dissatisfied with the dysfunction in Congress. I heard that they were  disgusted with the partisanship of Congress. I heard that they were  disheartened with our system of government. And I believe that it is  that sentiment that lent to the denouement of November 8.   I admit I was disappointed by the Presidential election, and I  believe that partisanship that was displayed during that election  continued in Washington, D.C. It started when I got here for new Member  orientation.   When we got here as freshmen, Republicans and Democrats, we were  automatically split up. I did not get to know my fellow freshmen  Republican colleagues here in D.C. It wasn't until we went on to Boston  and Virginia that we actually took time to get to know each other,  where they are from, and what they were about.   What I can tell you--the thing that I say that gives hope to so many  people--is that my freshman class heard the exact same things during  this past election: That it is time that we get things done and that we  do it together.   Now, I believe that once we get past these turbulent times at this  point, I do hope we can work together on issues that affect our  country, be it immigration reform, investment in our infrastructure,  and ensuring that our health care is not just accessible but  affordable.                                time  1715    But I also realize, as many of you, that that is easier said than  done. Yet I believe that to get things done in Congress, you have to  treat it like a marathon and not a sprint, and I believe that we begin  this race by building relationships.   My predecessor, Congressman Sam Farr, spent 23 years representing the  place I call home on the central coast of California. He will tell you  that for most of that time he was in the minority, yet he was able to  get numerous things done; and he will tell you that the way he was able  to do it is by relationships, with Democrats and Republicans.   I can tell you that Sam's predecessor would say the exact same thing;  and I can tell you that Sam's predecessor and his three roommates, whom  I was able to live with back in the eighties, would all say the same  thing, that it is the personal chemistry amongst people here in  Washington, D.C., that will lead to our ability to compromise  professionally. That is what we must develop.   That is why I am honored and pleased to enter into this commitment of  civility, for that is the first ingredient to that chemistry that we  must strive for. And I believe that this commitment that we have all  taken to each other, to our communities, and to our country, that will  lead to our constituents' confidence, not just in Congress, but in our  democracy.
