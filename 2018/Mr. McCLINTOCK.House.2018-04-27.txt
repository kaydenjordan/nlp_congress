 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I have offered this amendment whenever  the opportunity presents itself because it tests whether there is any  program in the Federal budget that Congress can bear to cut.   Essential Air Service is perhaps the least essential program in the  entire government. It is a direct subsidy paid to airline companies to  fly empty and near empty planes from small airports to regional hubs  nearby. There was supposed to be a temporary program to allow local  communities and airports to readjust to airline deregulation in 1978.  Instead, it has grown to include 173 communities and a program that has  doubled in cost in the last decade.   I want to emphasize, this program has nothing to do with emergency  medical evacuations. It solely subsidizes regular scheduled commercial  service that is so seldom used that it cannot support itself.   And why can't it support itself? In many cases, the small airports in  the program are less than an hour's drive from regional airports.  Essential Air Service flights are flown out of Merced Airport near my  district in the Sierra Nevada of California; yet, Merced is less than  an hour's drive from Fresno Regional Airport, offering regular  scheduled commercial air service.   Subsidized service is available from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, just 31  miles from Harrisburg International Airport. Subsidized flights from  Pueblo, Colorado, are just a 45-minute drive from Colorado Springs  Regional Airport, and I could go on and on.   There are supposed to be subsidy caps of $200 per passenger and a  minimum of 10 passengers per day, and yet, every request to waive these  requirements has been granted--every one--for passenger subsidies that  can go as high as nearly $1,000 per passenger. Now, by comparison, you  can charter a small plane for around $150 to $200 an hour.                                time  0945    Over the next 5 years, this program will cost taxpayers nearly $1  billion in direct appropriations, which this amendment would cease. The  program also gets another $100 million a year from overflight fees that  would otherwise be available to fund high priorities in the aviation  system, like 21st century air traffic control technology.   The argument for abolishing this program is simple: if a route cannot  generate enough passengers to support its costs, that means that  passengers themselves are telling us that it is not worth the money to  them.   Perhaps we should listen.   Our country is drowning in debt. It now costs us $475 billion a year  just to pay interest costs on the $21 trillion that we have already  borrowed. Debt and taxes are driven by one thing: spending.   In the last 10 years, inflation and population combined have grown 26  percent. Revenues have more than kept pace, growing 29 percent in the  same period; but spending has grown 46 percent, and it has doubled  under this program. If we don't get control of spending soon, our  Nation could enter a debt spiral that threatens our very future; and  the Orwellian-named Essential Air Service is a prime example of  nonessential programs that we just can't afford.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, three points:   First, these amendments don't cut the fee support, only the $1  billion in direct taxpayer subsidies that would be paid into this  program over the next 5 years. Under the so-called reforms referenced  by the chairman, this program has doubled in cost over the past  decade, and all Americans do not benefit from this program.    Let's take the remote communities, like those in Alaska. This program  subsidizes 61 small communities in a State with 259 airports. That  means there are roughly 200 airports and 350 local communities in  Alaska, alone, that seem to do just fine without Essential Air Service.   If Alaska or any State believes that air service should be subsidized  within their State, they certainly have the ability to do it  themselves. So do individual towns. The States choose not to pay for  the service; the local communities choose not to pay for the service;  and, most importantly, the passengers, themselves, choose not to pay  the actual cost of the service. Perhaps as we approach $1 trillion  annual deficit, we should consider choosing not to pay for it either.   We hear that it helps prop up small airports and small airlines that  service them. Well, sure, if you hand somebody wads of cash, that  person does very well. The problem is that the people you took that  cash from do very poorly to exactly the same extent.   A $275 million program out of a $4 trillion Federal budget seems like  a drop in the bucket, and I agree we are not going to balance a $1  trillion annual deficit just by cutting programs like this. But if we  can't cut a 40-year-old temporary program that has doubled in cost over  the last 10 years--this is the kindest and easiest cut of all--then I  fear that we will never summon the courage to get our budget back to  balance before we bankrupt our country.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
