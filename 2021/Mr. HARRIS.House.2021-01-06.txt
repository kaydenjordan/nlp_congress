 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The oath I took is very simple. Madam Speaker, you administered it.  It is to support and defend the Constitution.   Now, as you walk back to the office buildings, you will walk by that  wall that has when the various States accepted that Constitution.  Remember, when a State accepts the Constitution, it agrees to accept  every part of the Constitution. It doesn't get to pick and choose.   Pennsylvania was there when it was written. They were so enthusiastic  about the Constitution, they approved it in 1787.   My State, Maryland, is a little further down the wall, 1788. They  were there when it was written.   The clause that gave the legislature the power over the elections was  there when they accepted it. It has been there since. How dare the  judicial branch or the executive branch of that State usurp the  legislative authority. That is a clear violation of the Constitution.   Now, we heard there is no evidence.   Evidence?   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court unilaterally extended the deadline to  receive absentee and mail-in ballots.   Does anybody contest that over here? Does it say the legislature did  that?   No, it doesn't. It says the court did it.   That is a violation. That is what the Texas lawsuit was all about. We  disadvantage other States when States like Pennsylvania, the executive  branch and judicial branch, cheat on the Constitution; and that is what  they did here.   But there is more evidence. But wait, there is more. The Democrat  secretary of the Commonwealth eroded integrity by dismissing signature  authentication on a ballot.   Does anyone here believe the Pennsylvania legislature would have  agreed  [[Page H102]]  to create a separate system for mail-in ballots and in-person ballots?  That if you mail it in, you don't need a signature? But if you vote in  person, you do and it has to be authenticated?   Of course not. The legislature clearly wouldn't have agreed to that.  But that didn't stop the usurpation of constitutional authority.   Madam Chair, I vigorously support this objection, and I include in  the Record the objection to counting the electoral votes for the State  of Arizona additional signers.
