 Mr. President, there are inventors in Colorado and Hawaii  and across this Nation whom we don't even know about because the fact  is, we have missed the opportunity to engage more people and have more  diverse inventors.   We have to look at this from several different perspectives. Let's  look at it from a national security perspective.   I have chaired the Intellectual Property Subcommittee for the last  two Congresses. We heard endless reports of how China is churning out  patents and more and more patents, breaking records every day. This  commonsense amendment does nothing more than allow people to submit  information that we can use to get a better beat on communities that we  need to get into to create more intellectual property, to create more  patents, and to get more people engaged in the patents and intellectual  property system. With this bill, I believe we will make great strides.   I hope everybody will vote for this amendment.   Thank you.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1517
