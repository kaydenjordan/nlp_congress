 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  seek recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Resolution Censuring Representative Jamaal Bowman.   Whereas, on September 30, 2023, as the House of Representatives was  considering legislation to avoid a lapse of appropriations for Federal  agencies and departments, which would result in a shutdown of those  agencies and departments, Jamaal Bowman, the Representative from the  16th Congressional District of New York, pulled a fire alarm;   Whereas, section 22-1319 of the District of Columbia Criminal Code  makes knowingly causing a false alarm of fire a misdemeanor punishable  by fine or imprisonment up to 6 months, or both;   Whereas, section 22-1319 of the District of Columbia Criminal Code  states: ``It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to willfully  or knowingly give a false alarm of fire within the District of  Columbia, and any person or persons violating the provisions of this  subsection shall, upon conviction, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor  and be punished by a fine not more than the amount set forth in section  22-3571.01 [of this code] or by imprisonment for not more than 6  months, or by both such fine and imprisonment;''   Whereas, on October 26, 2023, Representative Bowman pled guilty to  violating section 22-1319 of the District of Columbia Criminal Code and  was required to pay a $1,000 fine and write an apology letter to the  United States Capitol Police and was placed on probation; and   Whereas, the actions of Representative Bowman forced the evacuation  of the Cannon House Office Building and disrupted the work of Congress  as a vote was underway on the floor of the House:   Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives  censures Jamaal Bowman, Representative from the 16th Congressional  District of New York; Representative Jamaal Bowman will forthwith  present himself in the well of the House of Representatives for the  pronouncement of censure; and Jamaal Bowman will be censured with the  public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.
