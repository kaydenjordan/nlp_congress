 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the dedicated  service and enlightened research of Dr. Kashyap Patel, the chief  executive officer of Carolina Blood and Cancer Care Associates.   Dr. Patel was born and grew up in Gujarat state, India, where his  father taught him about the great activist Mahatma Gandhi. During this  time, he learned life's guiding principles: You walk with people. You  don't walk over them; you don't talk over them. Be a voice for the  voiceless, marginalized, and underprivileged citizens.   In 1996, Dr. Patel immigrated to the United States from the United  Kingdom on an EB-1 as an individual of extraordinary ability due to his  achievements in cancer research. He became a naturalized citizen in  2002.   Upon moving to the United States, he completed his residency at  Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York, primarily serving a low-income  minority population.   As the CEO of Carolina Blood and Cancer Care Associates, a practice  with eight providers, Dr. Patel and his colleagues have never turned  away any patients with cancer in more than two decades, irrespective of  ability to pay.    This is all due to his 501(c)(3) foundation, No One Left Alone, or  NOLA, which supports uninsured cancer patients. All proceeds from his  book, ``Between Life and Death,'' also go to the NOLA Foundation.   Dr. Patel has an encouraging and loving family. His wife, Alpa, his  son, Maharshi, and his daughter-in-law, Hirangi, support him in walking  his path of placing others above himself.   In 2022, Dr. Patel was recognized for his work in ``The ASCO Post  Narratives in Oncology,'' an annual special issue commemorating  oncology leaders from across the world. He is the first community  oncologist to receive this distinction.   Just a few of his other awards and outstanding achievements include:  president of the Community Oncology Alliance; Living the Mission Award  NCODA 2021; Lifetime Achievement Award, SCOS, for contributions to  cancer; 2022 nominee of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor; associate  professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at VCOM in  Spartanburg, South Carolina; medical director of the Internal Oncology  Network for diversity, equity, and inclusivity; and associate editor in  chief at AJMC's ``Evidence-Based Oncology.''   Dr. Kashyap Patel has truly set the gold standard for decades of  dedicated service and commitment to his patients and to the community,  for which he will long be remembered. For that, we all join in saying a  big thank-you.   In the words of Winston Churchill, there is a time when doing your  best is  [[Page H9739]]  not enough; you must do what is required. Dr. Patel has done what is  required to serve his patients and live a lifetime of dedicated  service.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in total support of S. 2607. It is a bill that will award a  Congressional Gold Medal to the former hostages of the Iran hostage  crisis of 1979-1981.   Mr. Speaker, on November 4, 1979, Iranian students in Iran's capital  city, Tehran, stormed the American Embassy, trapping more than 50  American workers within the embassy grounds. This violent act was  carried out to declare a break from Iran's past and put an end to the  perceived American interference in the region.   The response by the Carter administration at the onset was limited  to, one, asset freezes; and two, blockading the shipment of goods to  Iran. There was fear that anything more would encourage the students to  destroy the embassy and harm the hostages.   I am sure we all remember Walter Cronkite ending his nightly program  reporting the number of days the hostages were held captive, a daily  reminder of those who were still trapped.   During this time, the hostages were subjected to intense physical and  psychological torture, but their spirit never wavered. Those held  captive showed extraordinary courage by continually engaging in acts of  resistance against their captors, such as by refusing to sign  condemnations of the United States despite the gross violations of  their human rights.   This infamous incident in American history lasted 444 days, and it is  important that we continue to remember the bravery shown by those  courageous Americans.   S. 2607 will honor the captured United States diplomats, military  personnel, and civilians with the recognition that they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support it as well. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will say, this is the least we can do for  these American heroes, what they sacrificed, the abuse they took. This  is such a worthy cause.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
