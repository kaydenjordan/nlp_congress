 Mr. President, in 1993, American journalist and author  John Wallach hosted a dinner with leaders from Israel, Egypt, and the  Palestinian Authority. As he toasted his guests, he urged each country  to send 15 youngsters to a new summer camp he had established in  Otisfield, ME. That year, 46 teens, ages 13 to 18, and including three  Americans, comprised the first class of the Seeds of Peace Camp.   Twenty-five years later, Seeds of Peace now has 6,698 alumni  throughout the Middle East, South Asia, Europe, and the United States.  They came to Maine from 27 countries, many from places of conflict, for  3 weeks of camping and social activities to promote understanding,  reconciliation, acceptance, dialogue, coexistence, and peace. They  returned home uniquely positioned to lead change and with the courage  to dispel the fear, mistrust, and prejudice that fuel conflict.   It is a pleasure to congratulate this remarkable organization on its  landmark 25th anniversary. Seeds of Peace is able to bridge borders and  foster peace in the midst of longstanding global conflicts. Many of  those early campers are now holding decisionmaking positions in their  home countries, and I believe that the ``seeds of peace'' that were  planted during their time in Maine will blossom into lasting, visionary  solutions to conflicts perpetuated by cycles of violence.   Building on the success of the international program, Seeds of Peace  launched the Maine Seeds leadership program in 2000 in response to the  changing demographics in our State resulting from a growing refugee  population. These Maine Seeds organize year-round community and school  activities that bridge divisions and create positive change.   Seeds of Peace reveals the human face of youth who are too often  exposed to hatred by engaging campers in both guided coexistence  sessions and ordinary summer camp activities, such as sharing meals,  canoeing, swimming, playing sports, and exploring creativity through  the arts and computers. These interactions and the lasting friendships  formed are creating new generations of leaders who will choose dialogue  and understanding over violence and hatred.   In addition to the summer camp in Maine, Seeds of Peace provides  year-round opportunities, through regional programming and the  innovative use of technology, to enable former participants to build on  the relationships forged at camp, so that the learning processes begun  at camp may continue in the participants' home countries, where they  are most needed.   Seeds of Peace is strongly supported by participating governments and  many world leaders. Federal funding for Seeds of Peace demonstrates and  recognizes the importance of Seeds of Peace in promoting the foreign  policy goals of the United States.   The Seeds of Peace mission--to inspire and cultivate new generations  of leaders to accelerate the social, economic, and political changes  essential for peace--is more essential than ever before. From a small  summer camp in Maine a quarter of a century ago to a global movement  today, Seeds of Peace has carried out that vital mission and brought  new hope to the world.                            ____________________
