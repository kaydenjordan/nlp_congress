 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the birthday of a  Nevada icon. I am sure you all recall that the State of Nevada turned  150 a few years ago, and that the Biggest Little City in the World,  Reno, is turning 150.   Well, Bob Cashell, former University of Nevada regent, former Nevada  lieutenant governor, and former mayor of the city of Reno, is past the  halfway point in catching the State of Nevada and the city of Reno at  150. He is 80, four score.   A native of the Lone Star State, like many Nevadans, Bob got to  Nevada as fast as he could. A leader in Nevada's gaming resort  industry, an A list philanthropist, and a blue chip public servant, he  has done some great work as a Nevadan.   Of course, he owes all of his success, and his defiance of the  actuarial tables, to his wife Nancy, who has performed miracles during  their lifelong partnership of transforming this pilgrim from Texas into  a special part of Nevada's fabric. Thank you, Nancy. And happy birthday  to you, Mr. Mayor, for life. Bob Cashell is 80.                            ____________________
