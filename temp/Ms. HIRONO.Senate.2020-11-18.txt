 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act. This legislation would  formally establish the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative--or SVI-- within the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, DOJ.  While the SVI was created in 2015 as an initiative within the DOJ, this  legislation is needed to give the initiative authorization to protect  the legal interests of servicemembers, veterans, and their families. I  thank Representative Escobar and Representative Taylor for introducing  this important legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.   Our Nation owes a tremendous debt to our servicemembers, veterans,  and military families for the sacrifices they make to protect our  freedoms. Deployment can seriously compromise a servicemember's ability  to meet obligations back home and protect their legal interests.  Servicemembers and  [[Page S7079]]  their families have been charged unlawful lease termination fees when  they receive permanent change of station or deployment orders. While  deployed overseas, some have been denied voting rights, while others  have had their property unlawfully sold. Members of the Reserve forces  and the National Guard have been unjustly discriminated against and  denied employment because of their military service. Servicemembers,  veterans, and their families continue to be targeted by financial scams  and fraud schemes. They deserve better than this, and we must ensure  that our government protects their civil rights during deployment,  transition back home, and as they settle into their civilian lives.   The DOJ recognized that, while there are laws on the books to protect  servicemembers, veterans, and their families, more is needed to be done  by the Federal Government to improve education about what those laws  are and what rights they protect and to increase Federal enforcement  actions to ensure those rights are protected. To that end, the DOJ  announced the creation of the SVI to further its efforts to enforce  statutes that protect the civil rights of servicemembers, veterans, and  their families. The SVI works closely with the Department of Defense,  Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Judge Advocate General offices  at military installations to educate servicemembers, veterans, and  military families about their rights and how to report abuse. It also  serves as a resource for anyone looking to obtain legal assistance and  legal practitioners seeking information.   Through the work of the SVI, the Department of Justice has brought a  number of successful claims, including one against the city and county  of Honolulu in February 2018 for illegally auctioning cars belonging to  servicemembers. DOJ launched an investigation into the city's actions  after receiving information from a military legal assistance officer  and two Navy legal assistance attorneys that Honolulu had on at least  three occasions failed to obtain court orders before auctioning cars  belonging to servicemembers while those servicemembers were deployed  aboard U.S. Navy ships. The city had violated the Servicemembers Civil  Relief Act, SCRA, by denying these servicemembers their right to obtain  a court's review of whether the auction of their vehicles should be  delayed or adjusted to account for their military service. The  settlement that DOJ reached with Honolulu mandated that the city ensure  servicemembers receive notice that their car has been taken into  custody and that the city obtain a court order or SCRA waiver prior to  auctioning a car owned by an Active Duty servicemember.   The Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act recognizes the work  this initiative has carried out on behalf of servicemembers, veterans,  and military families in Hawaii and across the Nation by making it  permanent within the DOJ. This bill also tasks the initiative with  serving as legal and policy advisor to the Attorney General, and  liaison between the DOJ and military departments. The SVI is further  tasked with coordinating prosecution of fraud that targets  servicemembers and their families and enforcing Federal laws to protect  servicemembers and veterans.   I call on my colleagues in the Senate to support the DOJ's efforts to  defend the rights of those who protect our country by swiftly passing  the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act during the 116th  Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act.
