 Mr. President, later today the Senate will vote on  H.J. Res. 69, and I am here to state as strongly and emphatically as  possible my opposition to this misguided and unwise measure.   As a Senator who fights to preserve and protect the vast diversity of  American wildlife and honor the natural beauty of our Nation's great  refuges, I urge my colleagues to reject the effort to revoke a  commonsense rule of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This rule of  the FWS is designed to prevent the use of cruel, unsporting, and  inhumane killing methods on Federal land. It is really that simple, and  repeal of it is an outrage.   Proponents of H.J. Res. 69 have attempted to frame this debate as an  effort by the Federal Government to usurp State power, but that  argument is simply absurd. The rule at issue is about Federal  management of Federal land, Federal control over land owned by the  Federal Government, pure and simple. The rule, which took effect in  September, does not restrict subsistence hunting or normal hunting  practices. It does not imperil public safety or impede on defense of  property. It simply prevents brutal, cruel, barbaric hunting methods  that target vulnerable bears, wolves, and coyote from occurring on  lands that were intended to provide refuge for these animals.  ``Refuge'' is the key word.   This resolution subverts the judgment of professional wildlife  managers to adopt sensible wildlife management actions that are based  on the best available science. If the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  rule is undermined, any State would be permitted to allow egregious  killing methods on these wildlife refuges, which is the one category of  Federal lands specifically set aside to benefit wildlife. That is its  singular purpose.   I will oppose this legislation because I believe in preserving our  Nation's natural ecosystem and the constitutional responsibility of the  Federal Government to manage Federal lands for all citizens and prevent  the inhumane treatment of our Nation's most iconic wildlife.   This rule bans the killing of wolves and their pups at their den  sites in springtime when they are most vulnerable. It bans the killing  of sleeping black bear mothers and their cubs while they are  hibernating in winter--not exactly fair sport and certainly damaging to  our environment. The rule also bans the baiting of grizzly bears, which  involves the use of toxic, rotting food or grease to lure and acclimate  bears to a certain area so that trophy hunters can get a point-blank  shot. It prohibits the use of traps such as steel-jawed traps or  snares, which cause animals to suffer injury as they fight the trap or  even slow and painful death from starvation or exposure. It prohibits  using airplanes and helicopters to scout, land, and shoot brown or  black bears. These practices are not only cruel and inhumane, they are  really unsporting and have no place in a civilized society.   This resolution would foreclose our wildlife managers from making  Federal wildlife management decisions. It will undoubtedly affect the  future of all American wildlife, including regulating  [[Page S1877]]  inhumane practices on Alaska national wildlife refuges even though  those practices may be recognized as cruel and unsustainable.   All in all, voiding the U.S. Fish and Wildlife rule would set a  dangerous precedent for the management of public lands across the  country. Time and time again, our Federal courts have held that the  Federal Government has the authority to regulate wildlife on Federal  lands and cannot be superseded by initiatives at the State level. This  Federal rule explicitly prohibits only these particularly gruesome and  egregious methods of hunting or other kinds of practices on national  wildlife refuges. It does not apply to hunting in State-owned  wilderness or to rural Alaskan practices for residents who hunt for  subsistence.   Regardless of my colleagues' claims, there is not a Tenth Amendment  issue here, and the case law clearly demonstrates it, from the Supreme  Court decision in 1976 that held that ``the Property Clause also gives  Congress the power to protect wildlife on public lands, state law  notwithstanding''; the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which followed  it; and just last year, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which  repeated the Supreme Court's well-established jurisprudence on the  supremacy clause and the property clause.   Neither the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act nor the  Alaska Statehood Act grants any State official the power to overrule  these Federal land managers' decisions.   Putting aside the legal issues--and there are none that really argue  in favor of sabotaging this Fish and Wildlife Service rule--it is the  right thing to do for us and for our future. This legislation would  essentially reject our authority and our responsibility and our  obligation to future generations to promote humane wildlife management  practices. It is not only a matter of our law but who we are and what  kind of society we believe we should have.   I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this abhorrent and  appalling legislation.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch
