 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 246,  the Stimulating Innovation through Procurement Act of 2019.   My bill helps small businesses compete for government contracts and  research grants and gives them the opportunity to grow and innovate.   I grew up in a small town in northeast Iowa, and I am proud to  represent communities like mine in Congress. The Iowans I know want to  be able to stay and build a life in the communities that raised them. I  am proud to introduce legislation that will give the next generation of  Iowans opportunities to innovate in our State.   Too often, small businesses, especially rural ones, get locked out of  the competition for government contracts and grants. This bill ensures  that agency procurement officers will be more directly involved in this  process, helping small businesses pursue research that lets them  compete for these opportunities.   H.R. 246 requires procurement center representatives and other  contracting officials to assist small businesses in the Small Business  Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs.  Making this a statutory mandate levels the playing field for our small  businesses, ensuring they won't be at a disadvantage during the bidding  process.   It means that when a small business owner in Marion or Manly, Iowa  has a great idea that will create jobs in our communities, our  government is actually making it easier, not harder, for them to grow  and innovate. When Congress supports small businesses, it strengthens  communities like mine in northeast Iowa.   I thank my colleague and cosponsor, Congressman Curtis, and I thank  Chairwoman Velazquez for her support and leadership of innovative small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation.
