 Mr. Speaker, every day, dozens of Americans lose  their lives to guns. If a virus killed dozens of Americans each day, we  would treat it as a public health emergency. But despite that loss of  life from gun violence, our country has failed to implement commonsense  gun reform.   One of those solutions is my bill, the COOL OFF Act, which would  establish a 3-day waiting period on all handgun sales, to take the  passion out of crimes of passion.   Research has shown waiting periods reduce murders by 17 percent and  suicides by 10 percent. A national waiting period would save hundreds  if not thousands of lives each year by preventing handgun sales to  those motivated toward crimes of passion.   Thousands of Americans have died as we have waited to pass gun  reform. By passing the COOL OFF Act, we can ensure that a wait of just  3 days starts to save lives.                            ____________________
