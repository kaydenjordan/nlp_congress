 Mr. Speaker, I am devastated by Hamas' brutal attacks on  innocent civilians in Israel, which include taking children, women, and  elderly people hostage. I strongly stand by our ally Israel and  unequivocally support its right to defend itself.   This vicious assault was enabled by Iran, which has publicly praised  the attacks. Now more than ever, it is vital  [[Page H5058]]  that the United States does not walk away from its global commitment to  defend democracy.   This war is against Hamas; it is not the Palestinian people.  Palestinians have also lost communities and loved ones because of  Hamas' atrocities. Israel has to end Hamas' role in Gaza, while we work  together to minimize harm to civilian populations. Hamas' presence is  an assault on humanity, and I want to work with the unity governmental  in Israel to create the conditions for peace again.   As ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am intent  on ensuring that we do everything that we can to provide the  humanitarian and military assistance that is necessary for Israel to  recover from this devastation and continue to defend itself.                                time  1615     Mr. Chairman, last year, the Energy and Water  Development Appropriations bill lowered energy costs for families,  created good-paying jobs by growing and supporting a robust clean  energy sector and rebuilding water infrastructure, promoted American  energy independence, strengthened our national security, and ensured  American energy outcompeted China. Sadly, this is not what this year's  bill does.   The majority has put forth a bill that cuts domestic energy  investments by a staggering 25.4 percent or $6.4 billion  [[Page H5068]]  lower than last year--with the consequences of increasing energy costs  for American families at a time when families are living paycheck to  paycheck and struggling with the high cost of living.   This bill undermines growth and modernization of our energy  infrastructure, weakens our national security, and it would yield  leadership of the world's energy future to our greatest adversaries.   As much as my Republican colleagues may refuse overwhelming evidence,  deny scientific consensus, and ignore the catastrophic natural  disasters becoming more severe and more common in their districts and  across the country, we have no choice but to transform our energy  sector to reflect our climate reality.   The only path that addresses climate change, reduces our dependence  on fossil fuels, and curbs our reliance on foreign energy is to  diversify how we produce and store energy: wind, solar, hydroelectric,  hydrogen, and geothermal.   When it comes to addressing climate and driving a robust energy  sector, our answer to the question of ``how'' must be ``everything  under the sun.'' The Department of Energy's clean energy programs drive  down energy costs, making it cheaper to expand domestic energy sources.   For energy efficiency and renewable energy, the majority proposes  cutting the Department of Energy's budget by $1.5 billion or 42 percent  from the 2023 level. This office researches and develops manufacturing,  building, energy management, and weatherization technologies that are  critical to our Nation's growth and resilience. That is nearly half a  billion dollars that will not be invested in our economic, energy, and  climate future.   Furthermore, Republicans would cut $4.5 billion from the High- Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program. That program helps 250,000  low- and moderate-income households save upwards of $1 billion on their  energy bills annually, which creates 50,000 new jobs. There is a $1  billion cut from the Assistance for Latest and Zero Building Energy  Code Adoption, and $200 million from the State-based Home Energy  Efficiency Contractor Training Grants. It means that if American  families want to reduce their home energy consumption and lower their  monthly bills, my Republican colleagues say ``no.''    We must be innovative, creative, and aggressive in fighting for a  clean energy future to make America resilient in the face of climate  change, which is why it is irresponsible to cut $15 billion from the  Department of Energy's Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program.  That program supports critical projects that, for example, remove air  pollutants that can cause asthma and cancer from the atmosphere.   After watching the skies turn orange over parts of the East Coast and  Midwest this summer, I would hope that we could agree that air  pollution is a bad thing. Perhaps the majority feels differently.  Sustainability, at its core, is a demand that we responsibly steward  the planet and its natural resources to future generations. The  majority fails this demand.   If the proposed abandonment of America's energy future and of our  ability to build a robust and diversified energy industry were not  enough reason to vote against this bill, then the offensive political  riders on race, gender, and sexuality should be.   The majority continues to break the deal that the Speaker struck with  the President earlier this year to avert a default. Democrats and  Republicans from the House and Senate need to begin the process of  negotiating and finding common ground to pass bipartisan appropriations  bills immediately.                                time  1800    Pursuing these partisan bills all but guarantees we will need another  continuing resolution in 3 weeks. Continuing resolutions may keep the  government open, but they are no way to govern. There is no excuse to  be considering bills written to appease a minority of this Chamber, who  we know will not vote to fund the government.   For all of these reasons, I cannot support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to vote against it.
