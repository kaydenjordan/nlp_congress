 Mr. Chairman, since 2003, the pharmaceutical  companies have had free rein to gouge sick people. They forced into law  language that prohibited the Federal Government from negotiating with  the drug companies for lower prices, which already the Veterans  Administration does and has done for decades.   We know that negotiating for fair prices actually is the only way  that we are going to be able to lower prices, and that is what H.R. 3  is going to do. Even Donald Trump has said that, when he was a  candidate: When it comes to negotiating the cost of drugs, we are going  to negotiate like crazy.   That was then, and this is now.   The Congressional Budget Office says we are going to save about half  a trillion dollars when we negotiate in the most effective way to  protect seniors and families and anyone who has insurance, and we are  going to be able to use that money to finally help senior citizens who  need help with their eyeglasses, with their hearing aids, with their  dental care. We are going to be able to make such a difference in their  lives.   Ninety percent of Democrats, 87 percent of Independents, and 80  percent of Republicans say they support allowing the Federal Government  to negotiate for prices. The time is absolutely now for us to pass this  legislation.   H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, is  the solution that we have been waiting for, a historic step forward in  our fight to solve the problem of the prescription drug pricing crisis  that we face in this country.   I look forward to seeing it pass into law and the President of the  United States keeping his promise and not breaking it by signing  negotiation into law.
