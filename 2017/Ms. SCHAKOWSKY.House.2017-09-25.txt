 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Engel for  yielding to me, and I rise in strong support of the Women, Peace, and  Security Act.   I first want to thank my Republican colead on this bill, Kristi Noem,  for her hard work; and I want to express my gratitude to Chairman Royce  and Ranking Member Engel for their robust support for this legislation.   I want to thank Senator Shaheen and Senator Capito for their work in  the Senate on this, as well as Senators Corker and Cardin.   I want to thank the staff who has put in a lot of hours on this, last  session and this session, including my staff, Cassandra Varanka.   Around the world, women are disproportionately affected by conflict  and violence. At the same time, women are acting as some of the most  effective advocates for peace. Again and again, women have proven their  ability to advance peacemaking efforts where others have failed.   Look at Syria. In the town of Zabadani, women have been leading  efforts to save their city from violence. Over 470 women signed a  public petition, calling for a cease-fire. Their town had been under  siege, experiencing daily shelling and barrel bombings. As the formal  negotiations between the rebel-controlled local council and the Assad  government constantly broke down, the war prevented the town from  planting crops.   A group of women peace activists came together to found a group  called Damma, and they facilitated negotiations between the local  council, the Free Syrian Army, and the Islamic brigades. Where the  traditional actors had failed, these women moved through five rounds of  negotiations, ultimately achieving a cease-fire. Now, the cease-fire  only lasted 40 days, but those 40 days gave the town critical time to  plant crops and address its food shortage.   The power of women to advance peace and aid in postconflict  reconciliation is not limited to Syria. Women in Liberia played a  crucial role in bringing warring parties to the negotiating table, as  the chairman said.   When the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic  Liberation Front signed a major peace agreement in 2004, women made up  50 percent of the government's negotiating team and 25 percent of the  signatories.   In Ireland, women helped ensure that the Good Friday Agreement  included social issues, reconciliation measures, and compensation for  victims of violence.   Women around the world are actively working to advance peace talks  and ensure successful transformation from conflict to peace. Passing  the Women, Peace, and Security Act will ensure that the United States  actively supports these incredible women as we work toward ending  conflict around the world.   When women are involved in the negotiations, peace is more likely to  last. In fact, the International Peace Institute found that, with each  5 percent increase in women's participation in the political process, a  nation is five times less likely to use violence when faced with  international crisis or conflict.   Despite the strong evidence in favor of women's political  participation, women remain underrepresented in conflict prevention,  conflict resolution, and postconflict peace building efforts around the  world. We need to change that.   This legislation establishes women's participation as a critical  element of U.S. foreign policy. It would encourage the United States to  assist women mediators and negotiators by addressing barriers to their  equal and secure participation in peace processes.                                time  1600    It would institute comprehensive training modules on the protection,  rights, and specific needs of women in conflict, and require the  administration to evaluate the impact of U.S. foreign assistance on  women's meaningful participation.   In addition, the Women, Peace, and Security Act would require the  administration to report to Congress its strategy to promote women's  participation in conflict prevention and resolution.    It would empower Congress to exercise oversight of  that strategy's implementation.   As countries around the world are struggling with conflict, the  United States should be empowering anyone and everyone who can help  achieve lasting peace.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the Women,  Peace, and Security Act.
