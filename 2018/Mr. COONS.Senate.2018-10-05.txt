 Thank you, Mr. President.   I come to the floor to express my opposition to the nomination of  Judge Kavanaugh to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme  Court.   I come with a profound regret. I come today with profound regret that  this body has transformed from one that historically confirms Supreme  Court Justices with broad and bipartisan support to one in which rules,  norms, and courtesies fall away to serve the objectives of the majority  and one in which Justices are confirmed by the absolute narrowest of  margins.   I know I am not the only one to feel this way. We can simply wish for  the bygone era of consensus to return, we can give speeches about  bipartisanship with no hope of making progress, but to wish for it  without doing the work of reaching across the aisle is empty talk  without action, and as one who tries to inject some spirit of  bipartisanship in what has been the most bitter and most divisive and  most partisan fight I have seen in my 8 years here, I wanted to reflect  for a moment before we close today on my views on the nomination of  Judge Kavanaugh, the process that got us here and where we go next.   First, in this process, in this nomination, I saw barrier after  barrier placed in front of consensus and bipartisanship and the proper  functioning of the Senate Judiciary Committee on which I serve. These  barriers prevented us from fully and effectively performing the advice  and consent function to which we are called by the Constitution. We  have to do better. There needs to be a reckoning with all that went  wrong here.   I am sure that colleagues from the other side of the aisle may well  have different views on exactly which steps or developments led to the  sharply divided vote today and the heated and sharply divided hearing  and proceedings of last week, and I welcome their input.   But I thought today I should, for me, recount the course of this  nomination. It was fraught from the beginning because the Senate  Judiciary Committee majority used an unprecedented and partisan process  to rush this nomination while blocking access to millions of pages of  documents of Judge Kavanaugh's service in the White House, potentially  relevant to our deliberations.   For the first time since Watergate, the nonpartisan National Archives  was cut out of the process for reviewing and producing the nominee's  records, and Judge Kavanaugh's former deputy, who made his career  representing Republican and partisan causes, was in charge of  designating which documents this committee and the American people got  to see.   Nonetheless, the committee pressed forward, despite objections from  the minority to Judge Kavanaugh's hearing. During that hearing, I was,  frankly, disappointed. Judge Kavanaugh was not fully forthcoming when  discussing his interpretation of the Constitution and responding to  timely and important questions about his record.   I asked Judge Kavanaugh why he repeatedly criticized Morrison v.  Olson, a 30-year-old precedent about a now-extinct statute but a 30- year-old Supreme Court precedent holding that Congress can create an  independent counsel with authority to investigate the President and  whom the President cannot just fire on a whim.   I asked whether he still believes what he said in 1998, that a  President can fire at will a prosecutor criminally investigating him.  On these and other critical questions of Presidential power, Judge  Kavanaugh would not respond. He would not tell me whether he believes  all executive branch officials must be removable at will by the  President, according to his view of Executive power.   I asked whether critical rights like rights of access to  contraception, to abortion, the right to marry the person you love  would be protected under the test to evaluate substantive due process  that he has championed. Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly cited a test for  substantive due process that would limit the protection of liberty and  interest to rights ``deeply rooted in our Nation's history and  tradition,'' but he would not confront the consequences of applying  this test going forward.   Judge Kavanaugh would also not condemn President Trump's attacks on  the Federal Judiciary and the President's suggestions that the Justice  Department should consider politics when making prosecutorial  decisions. I asked Judge Kavanaugh about a comment he made on a panel  at Georgetown when he said: ``If the President were the sole subject of  a criminal investigation, I would say, no one should be investigating  that.'' In fact, Judge Kavanaugh testified he didn't say that, but I  reviewed the record.   I followed up with a series of questions for the record to get  additional information I think the American people should know and to  give Judge Kavanaugh a chance outside of our brief exchanges in the  confirmation process to explain his suggestions that perhaps I had  misquoted him. Unfortunately, I instead received pages of nonanswers.   When I asked Judge Kavanaugh specific questions about his criticism  of Morrison v. Olson, he simply referred to his prior testimony and  said he had ``nothing further to add here.'' He would not explain how  his proffered test for substantive due process is consistent with the  Court's landmark marriage equality decision by Justice Kennedy in  Obergefell.   After the hearing was over, I learned of Dr. Ford's allegations that  Judge  [[Page S6700]]  Kavanaugh had assaulted her in high school. Dr. Ford courageously  presented her account to the committee and the country. She gave  compelling testimony about a terrifying sexual assault she experienced  at age 15. She recounted Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh, stumbling  drunk, pushing into her bedroom, locking the door, laughing, and  turning up the music to muffle her screams.   Dr. Ford testified with 100 percent certainty that the person who  assaulted her was the judge whose nomination we were considering, whom  she had known through acquaintances and socialized with on many  occasions.   Dr. Ford had borne the pain of this attack alone for decades, but  over time, she told several people she trusted. She told her now- husband in 2002, she told therapists in 2012 and 2013, and friends in  2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018. She proffered their names in the subsequent  FBI investigation, but they were never questioned.   Importantly, Dr. Ford wasn't the only person to come forward during  this period. Her testimony gave courage to countless others to confront  their own trauma and share their own pain so that all of us can  understand.   As I just shared in a bipartisan conversation with colleagues at the  end of this divisive vote, we have all had the experience of friends  and colleagues, classmates and neighbors coming forward with stories  long concealed--whether out of shame or fear; whether out of a  certainty they would not be believed; whether out of pressures real,  recent, or long gone--and we all have work to do together.   Inspired by these survivors, I will never forget the experiences they  have shared, and I will not stop in efforts to make certain this body,  this Senate, acts in ways that respect them and their suffering and  their experiences.   When Dr. Ford came forward to speak to all of us and the American  people, I will remind you she had nothing to gain and a lot to lose.  She came forward to testify about her assault, and I am going to use  her own words to explain why, as she said to us: ``I am here today not  because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is  my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and  I were in high school.''   Civic duty to tell the truth.   What always struck me was how Dr. Ford came forward to voice concerns  before Judge Kavanaugh was nominated by the President. She reached out  to her Congresswoman and anonymously to the Washington Post when his  name was on a short list, but he had not yet been chosen.   Later, last Thursday, after Dr. Ford's testimony, Judge Kavanaugh  came forward to offer an aggressive, full-throated, angry denunciation  of her accusations. Even recognizing the understandable passion of one  who believes himself to be defending his honor against unjust assault,  I found his prepared opening statement and combative exchanges with my  colleagues deeply troubling. As a sitting circuit court judge, he  refused to answer fair and relevant questions, instead throwing them  back in the faces of two of my colleagues.   He was not candid with the committee about his own history of  drinking and aggressive behavior. To quote an editorial recently  published by three college classmates:         Telling the truth, no matter how difficult, is a moral       obligation for our nation's leaders. No one should be able to       lie their way onto the Supreme Court. Honesty is the glue       that holds together a society of laws. Lies are the solvent       that dissolves those bonds.    They stated: ``Brett lied under oath while seeking to become a  Supreme Court Justice.''   Most concerning of all to me, Judge Kavanaugh broke his own stated  rule of staying three ZIP Codes away from politics. In his sharply  worded and partisan exchange with Senators, he accused Democrats of  ``replacing advice and consent with search and destroy,'' of  ``Borking'' him, of engaging in some sort of revenge plot on behalf of  the Clintons, and of a calculated political hit. He looked us in the  eye and told us: ``What goes around comes around.''   Retired Justice John Paul Stevens explained he changed his mind about  Judge Kavanaugh's fitness to serve because his hearing performance  ``demonstrated a potential bias.''   I share the concern of my colleague Senator Murkowski's that after  last Thursday, the ``appearance of impropriety has become  unavoidable.''   Following the intense and emotional testimony of last Thursday, I am  grateful that we took a week pause so that the FBI could conduct an  investigation into credible allegations of sexual assault, and I remain  thankful to my colleague Senator Flake for supporting my call for an  FBI investigation. It showed courage on his part.   Unfortunately, regrettably, the investigation that ensued had a scope  so narrow, so cursory, so incomplete that it did not remove the cloud  hanging over Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Dozens of witnesses who  could have corroborated Dr. Ford's and Ms. Ramirez's accounts were  never contacted and never questioned, despite their contacts and names  being handed to FBI agents and despite the efforts of many offices in  the Senate to forward their information.   I fear that with the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme  Court today, we will look back on this moment not only as a moment of  raucous turmoil for the Senate but as a moment where the norms and  traditions of blind justice, a justice blind to partisanship, will have  slipped away.   The Court is critical to the rule of law in our country, and I am  deeply concerned that its legitimacy will be harmed with the addition  of an explicitly partisan Justice.   The Supreme Court plays a pivotal role in defining the scope of the  President's power in determining whether the President is above the  law.   The Supreme Court impacts essential rights enshrined in our  Constitution--the rights to privacy, intimacy, marriage, contraception,  abortion, the freedom to worship as we choose, the ability to  participate in our democracy as full and equal citizens, and the  promise of equal protection of the laws. There are so many more I could  list. These issues are not academic, and they are under assault. There  are cases proceeding to the Supreme Court now that are relevant to so  many of these concerns.   There are cases challenging the constitutionality of the ongoing  special counsel investigation now. A lawsuit that is aimed at striking  down the Affordable Care Act is proceeding in Texas now, and the Trump  administration is refusing to defend protections for people with  preexisting conditions. A challenge to restrictive regulations for  abortion clinics--regulations aimed at putting clinics out of  business--is headed to the Supreme Court now. Right now, there are also  lawsuits across the country in which LGBT Americans are challenging  discrimination they have faced in employment, in schools, and in  government service.   Our Supreme Court should be a bulwark against violations of law,  deprivations of freedom, and abuses of power. Yet we may now enter a  perilous time when the Court will, in fact, be shifting far right and  will end up issuing decision after decision on clearly partisan lines-- significantly more conservative than the majority of Americans at a  time when a President elected by a minority of Americans will have  appointed the Justice with a deciding vote, after his confirmation, by  the narrowest of margins. The Justice who has been confirmed today is  one who, in his conduct, will lead some to fairly doubt his  impartiality. He will likely play a central role for decades in  charting a course for interpreting our laws and rights and freedoms.   I hope and pray that I am wrong, that my interpretation of his  writings, of his speeches, and of his opinions is flawed, that the  apology and retraction he offered is genuine, in an opinion that was  published yesterday, about his partisan screed in his confirmation  hearing, and that his behavior as a Justice will put to rest all of the  concerns I have raised and that he will be a model of moderation and  balance. Yet I have profound doubts and grave concerns about Judge  Kavanaugh's ability to serve on the Supreme Court in an evenhanded and  nonpartisan way.   As I conclude, let me make a personal plea to those who are listening  and those who may watch: that we in the Senate, in going forward, must  address the flaws and weaknesses of the process that got us to today  and that we must do better. Simply retreating to our partisan  cloakrooms when we are faced with our Nation's challenges will not  solve them.  [[Page S6701]]    If we do not work to repair this institution, there will be nothing  left worth saving. If this Senate does not work, our Congress does not  work. If our Congress does not work, our Nation does not work. If our  Nation does not work, we teach the world that democracy is not the  model to follow. If we, simply, reflect the bitter partisanship that is  growing and festering across our Nation--fueled by some here in  Washington--we will fail.   We in the Senate must, instead, follow the Founders' vision for us  and, in fact, lead the country to common ground, to consensus, and to a  better future. We should, therefore, work together to get back to a  place where it is possible for Supreme Court Justices to be confirmed  with broad and bipartisan majorities, where it is possible to legislate  together on the issues compelling to our time, and where it is possible  to hear each other and to hear the concerns of all of our people.   I hope my colleagues will hear my remarks today as an invitation to  work together to face this challenge. We owe nothing less to the  Supreme Court, to our country, and to our people.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
