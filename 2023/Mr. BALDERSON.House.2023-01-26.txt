 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 21, the Strategic  Production Response Act, led by our Energy and Commerce Committee Chair  McMorris Rodgers.   I am proud to cosponsor and support this bill, which holds the Biden  administration and future administrations  [[Page H357]]  accountable for misusing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Under President Biden's watch, the stockpile has been depleted by an  alarming 40 percent, falling to its lowest level since 1984.   Established in 1975, the SPR was intended to respond to national  emergencies and to address severe supply disruptions, not to manipulate  gas prices.   This bill is quite simple. It requires the Secretary of Energy to  submit a plan to increase domestic energy production with any  nonemergency drawdown of the SPR.   Despite falsehoods from the members of the President's own Cabinet,  this legislation provides clear exceptions for legitimate energy supply  interruptions and only applies to nonemergency sales.   The American people want affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy  for America, not short-term political gimmicks. Mr. Chairman, I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 21.
