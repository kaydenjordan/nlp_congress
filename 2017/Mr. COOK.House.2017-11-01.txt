 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3279) to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to provide that extraction  of helium from gas produced under a Federal mineral lease shall  maintain the lease as if the helium were oil and gas.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3279         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Helium Extraction Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. MAINTENANCE OF FEDERAL MINERAL LEASES BASED ON                     EXTRACTION OF HELIUM.         The first section of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C.       181) is amended in the fifth paragraph by inserting after       ``purchaser thereof'' the following: ``, and that extraction       of helium from gas produced from such lands shall maintain       the lease as if the extracted helium were oil and gas''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3279, the Helium  Extraction Act of 2017. This straightforward piece of legislation will  incentivize helium production on Federal lands, help ensure the future  of America's helium supply, and provide a fair return to the taxpayer.   Under existing law, the Mineral Leasing Act only permits helium  extraction as a by-product of an existing oil or natural gas lease. As  a result, if oil and gas production on a Federal site is not  economically viable, the lease will expire, regardless of the revenue  brought in by helium sales. The Helium Extraction Act of 2017 would  correct this error and authorize helium production activities where  economically viable.   Helium is used for much more than balloons. It is a rare and unique  element which has become an indispensable part of our medical, space,  and defense industries, such as its use in MRI machines,  semiconductors, and air-to-air missile guidance systems.   Unfortunately, the future of our domestic helium supply is uncertain.  The Helium Stewardship Act of 2013, which details a commonsense  privatization process of the Federal helium reserve, also specifies  that all helium in the Federal reserve must be auctioned off by  September 30, 2021, and the facility closed.   This crucial source of helium has been relied upon for almost half a  century, but in a few short years, it will no longer be available. Our  country needs another way to access this critical natural resource;  otherwise, we will be relying on hostile interests such as Qatar,  Algeria, and Russia. Each of these countries presents security and  geopolitical challenges made even more apparent by recent unrest among  Qatar and its regional neighbors.   Unless something changes, foreign facilities are predicted to become  our chief source of helium by the end of the decade. This is why H.R.  3279 is such a necessary piece of legislation.   By authorizing the Bureau of Land Management to lease land for this  valuable nonrenewable resource, this legislation will raise $9 million  for the American taxpayer and help secure our supply of helium for  years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1074) to repeal the Act entitled ``An Act to confer jurisdiction  on the State of Iowa over offenses committed by or against Indians on  the Sac and Fox Indian Reservation''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1074         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the       Act of June 30, 1948, entitled ``An Act to confer       jurisdiction on the State of Iowa over offenses committed by       or against Indians on the Sac and Fox Indian Reservation''       (62 Stat. 1161, chapter 759) is repealed.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1074. This bill would rescind  criminal jurisdiction from the State of Iowa over crimes committed by  or against members of the Sac and Fox Tribe on their lands. In doing  so, the Tribe or the Federal Government would exercise exclusive  jurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act. This is the most common legal  situation for most tribes in America today.   In 1948, Congress granted jurisdiction over all crimes committed by  or against Indians on the Sac and Fox Reservation to the State of Iowa.  In 1949, there was no mechanism in the Federal Government concerning  criminal jurisdiction on the Tribe's land, and up until that point, the  Tribe had largely policed themselves.   Today, the Federal Government has criminal statutory authority on  Indian lands, the Tribe is again ready to police itself, and the State  of Iowa has  [[Page H8324]]  agreed that its Federal grant of criminal jurisdiction can be repealed.   Accordingly, under H.R. 1074, the Federal Government will have  criminal jurisdiction over crimes, especially major crimes, by or  against Indians on the Tribe's lands. The Tribe would have jurisdiction  over Indian offenders for crimes over which it exercises jurisdiction,  and the State of Iowa would retain exclusive jurisdiction over crimes  where both offender and victim are non-Indians.   I thank the sponsor of H.R. 1074, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum),  for his work on this bill, and I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Blum).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2600) to provide for the conveyance to the State of Iowa of the  reversionary interest held by the United States in certain land in  Pottawattamie County, Iowa, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2600         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE OF REVERSIONARY INTEREST REQUIRED.         (a) Conveyance.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior       shall convey, without consideration, to the State of Iowa the       reversionary interest held by the United States and described       in the quit claim deed dated April 13, 1998, instrument       number 19170, as recorded in book 98, page 55015, in       Pottawattamie County, Iowa.        (b) Costs.--As a condition of the conveyance under       subsection (a), all costs associated with such conveyance       shall be paid by the State of Iowa.        (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the State of Iowa should continue to provide information       regarding the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the       California National Historic Trail, and the Mormon Pioneer       National Historic Trail.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2600, sponsored by my colleague,  Representative David Young of Iowa.   H.R. 2600 directs the Department of the Interior to convey to the  State of Iowa the reversionary interest held by the United States in  certain land in Pottawattamie County.   By the way, there is going to be a test afterwards on this  pronunciation.   In 1989, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to provide  for the development of a trails interpretive center in Council Bluffs,  Iowa. Six years later, in 1995, the National Western Trails Center  donated property to the Federal Government, and the National Park  Service later constructed a trails center on the property to interpret  the history of the Lewis and Clark  [[Page H8325]]  National Historic Trail, the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail,  and the Oregon National Historic Trail.   In 1998, the Federal Government donated the trails center and  surrounding property to the State Historical Society of Iowa. Federal  ownership was transferred to the State subject to a condition that if  the trails center is not being used for the purposes specified in the  1989 Act, the land and the center would revert to the United States.   Since 1998, the State has owned and operated the trails center.  Presently, visitation at the center is very low, the hours of operation  are limited, and maintenance is falling behind. The State of Iowa would  like to remove the trails center from its responsibility and possibly  transfer the property to the city of Council Bluffs.   The National Park Service currently does not own or directly manage  any of the land associated with the 1989 Act. Moreover, it is the  Committee's understanding that the National Park Service does not have  any interest in taking over operation of the trails center or ownership  of the property.   I commend Representative Young for his outstanding work on behalf of  his constituents. I would also like to thank the minority for their  help and cooperation moving this legislation forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1488) to retitle Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore as Indiana  Dunes National Park, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1488         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Indiana Dunes National Park       Act''.       SEC. 2. INDIANA DUNES NATIONAL LAKESHORE RETITLED AS INDIANA                     DUNES NATIONAL PARK.         (a) In General.--Public Law 89-761 (16 U.S.C. 460u et seq.)       is amended--        (1) by striking ``National Lakeshore'' and ``national       lakeshore'' each place it appears and inserting ``National       Park''; and        (2) by striking ``lakeshore'' each place it appears and       inserting ``Park''.        (b) Nonapplication.--The amendment made by subsection       (a)(1) shall not apply to the title of the map referred to in       the first section of Public Law 89-761 (16 U.S.C. 460u), or       to the title of the maps referred to in section 4 of Public       Law 89-761 (16 U.S.C. 460u-3).       SEC. 3. PAUL H. DOUGLAS TRAIL.         The 1.6 mile trail within the Indiana Dunes National Park       designated the ``Miller-Woods Trail'' is hereby redesignated       as the ``Paul H. Douglas Trail''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1488 would redesignate Indiana Dunes National  Lakeshore as Indiana Dunes National Park.   Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was established by Congress in 1966.  The designation of the national lakeshore as a unit of the National  Park Service was the culmination of decades of work by  conservationists, area residents, and elected officials.   The original law included 8,330 acres of land and water. The National  Park Service conservation advocates continued to seek expansion of the  boundaries, and five subsequent laws increased the size of the national  lakeshore to more than 15,000 acres.   In October 1916, shortly after the National Park Service was  established, NPS Director Stephen Mather held hearings in Chicago to  gauge public sentiment on a Sand Dunes National Park. In a Department  of the Interior report published after the hearings, Director Mather  stated: ``No national park or other Federal reservation offers this  phenomenon for the pleasure and edification of the people, and no  national park is as accessible. Furthermore, the dunes offer to the  visitor extraordinary scenery, a large variety of plant life,  magnificent bathing beaches, and splendid opportunities to camp and  live in the wild close to nature.''   Despite Director Mather's support, the national park proposal was  abandoned at the onset of World War I, and  [[Page H8326]]  several years later, in 1925, Indiana Dunes State Park was established.  Redesignation of the national lakeside as a national park would make  Indiana Dunes the 60th national park in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
