 Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Klobuchar for  her work on this. I think the Senate has done good work today.                         TRIBUTE TO LORENZO D'AUBERT     Mr. President, I rise just for a few minutes to do  what we don't do often enough around here, and that is to recognize the  extraordinary work of the people who actually labor in the trenches of  the Senate.   Back in September of 2008, a young man came to work in my office as  an intern. Now, almost 10 years later, he is an essential part of my  life.   I am not sure that people understand what the beating heart of a  Senate office is, but everything revolves around the schedule. This  young man, Lorenzo d'Aubert, who came to work for me in 2008, worked  his way up from intern to staff assistant, which means you answer the  phones when everybody is upset. Then he became a legislative  correspondent, and then he worked as a systems analyst and on all of  the computer stuff in my office. Eventually, his talent was so obvious,  that I said: Please come sit outside my office and make everything work  right, and that is what he has done.  [[Page S2909]]    It is a really hard job because when you are the executive assistant  and the scheduler, you have to say no to a lot of people, and you have  to say it nicely. You have to make everyone happy, even when you are  telling them that the schedule will not allow that to happen. You have  to manage phone calls from all seven of my children and my husband, who  is upset, and manage the birth of grandchildren, the birthdays, the  schedule of when I can get there and when I can't. Is the plane  delayed, or is it not? Can you get on Southwest? No, maybe you can make  the American flight. On top of it all, he gets me to a million meetings  and a million places all at the same time, with a smile on his face,  with kindness in his heart, with a whip-sharp intellect, and with a  work ethic that is astounding.   I am really upset because he has the nerve to leave and go to law  school. I am proud of him for his determination to seek a degree in  law. I know he will be an amazing lawyer because he has that touch,  where even when he is giving you bad news, you know that he is  delivering it with kindness. We need much more of that in the legal  profession.   Lorenzo is really important to me, and I will miss him terribly. I  think it is important that all of us around here--who crave the lime  light, who want all the attention, and who want everybody to think that  we are moving mountains--know that it is the people around us who are  moving the mountains. We are just lucky to be on the ride.   We will all miss you, Lorenzo. Congratulations to you and to your  parents, Linda and Sergio. I know they are here today. I know how proud  they are of you. We will miss you terribly, and we will be really mad  at you if you don't stay in touch.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
