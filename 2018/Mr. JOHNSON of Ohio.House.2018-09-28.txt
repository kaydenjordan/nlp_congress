 Mr. Speaker, today is the culmination of months  of tireless work driven by heartbreaking stories of people whose lives  were destroyed by opioid addiction, and, just as importantly, the  powerful stories of hope and recovery.   I am grateful for the hard work of my colleagues and our Energy and  Commerce staff. I am proud that my legislation to improve how health  professional students are taught to recognize, prevent, and address  addiction, as well as to expand the availability of telehealth and peer  support services for those struggling with addiction is included.   Mr. Speaker, I am looking forward to continuing the hard work ahead  on this very important issue, and I urge support for the bill.
