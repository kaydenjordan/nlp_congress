 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, just a couple of short weeks ago, we  finally finished the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bills, and I  greatly appreciate those who worked with us to get that done.   I want to talk today about the need to reach a new 2-year budget  deal. We have to do that so the Appropriations Committee could then  begin to work in earnest on the fiscal year 2020 bills.   We have shown that we can move the appropriations bills quickly, but  we have to have the budget deal. In fact, unless we will get a budget  deal, sequestration returns in fiscal year 2020. That would mean steep  cuts in programs that invest in America and support working families.   It means we would have to make cuts in our defense programs for the  next fiscal year--cuts of $71 billion. This is real money. There would  be a 10-percent cut in funding to support our troops and to invest in  military readiness.   It would also require that we cut $55 billion for nondefense programs  in the next fiscal year. That is a 9-percent cut. The reality is, it  means less investment in infrastructure, education, housing, or  agricultural programs. It means less money for veterans' healthcare,  protecting our environment, or combating the opioid epidemic.   These cuts are not just hypothetical numbers on a piece of paper.  They affect real people and real families. They affect people in my  State. They affect the people in the State of the distinguished  Presiding Officer. They affect people in the 50 States represented by  all 100 of us.   Of course, the worst part about that is the cuts will come at the  same time we are facing significant increases in important programs  that we have no control over.   For example, we have to fund the decennial census. The Constitution  requires us to have this census, and we have to fund it by $4 billion  if we are going to follow what the Constitution of the United States  requires us to do in conducting the 2020 census.   We have all talked about veterans' healthcare. We have had a  significant increase in the healthcare costs for veterans, and we have  to have significant increases in the budget if we are going to  adequately fund their health.   The VA MISSION Act, which provides additional private care options  for veterans, becomes effective in June of this year. That is going to  cost at least an additional $3 billion, and estimates could climb  significantly higher. That is on top of the $3 billion increase for VA  medical care that we have already enabled through advance  appropriations.   Then we are going to need an additional $1 billion to ensure that an  estimated 5 million people who receive affordable housing assistance  can stay in their homes. In addition to these increased costs, we  expect to lose nearly $4 billion in receipts and cost savings in other  programs compared to this year.   This may sound like just a whole lot of numbers. It is more than  that. It means we have $15 billion right off the bat that we must  account for above this year's levels. Of course, I am sure there will  be more increases that we will have to address.   As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I know how hard  Chairman Shelby and I worked with Republicans and Democrats to get  through the bills we had this past year. We got them done, but it was  not easy staying within levels.  [[Page S1572]]    We have to have a 2-year budget deal. We have to negotiate it now. If  we wait until the very last second to pass these bills, it will cost  the taxpayers a lot more money because the Departments cannot plan. We  are not going to bury our heads in the sand and pretend it is going to  fix itself.   Of course, again, in the Appropriations Committee, we try to work in  a bipartisan way. But we cannot responsibly do our job in the absence  of cap levels that allow us to meet the needs of the American people.   Again, this is not just an accounting issue. This is the security and  the well-being of the greatest Nation on Earth. It is not rhetoric; it  is reality.   The budget deal has to be based on parity if we are going to pass it.  It has to have equal treatment for defense and nondefense programs, as  we have had in the past.   We have to invest on both sides of the ledger if we are going to  create a strong national defense, a strong economy, and a healthy  citizenry of the United States.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a letter to all Senators that was received yesterday from over 300  retired admirals and generals who agree with this premise.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                             Mission: Readiness,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2019.        Members of Congress: We write as retired admirals and       generals, and members of the national security organization       Mission: Readiness, to urge you to support programs that help       America's children grow into healthy, educated, citizen-ready       adults Particularly, we respectfully request that you       reevaluate spending caps mandated by the Budget Control Act       of 2011 (BCA) and provide balanced investments in both       defense and non-defense discretionary (NDD) programs.        As Members of Mission: Readiness, we recognize the fact       that the strength of our military--and our Nation--is       dependent on the strength of our people. We are deeply       concerned that 71 percent of young Americans ages 17 to 24       cannot qualify for military service because they are too       poorly educated, medically or physically unfit, or have a       disqualifying record of crime or drug abuse. The implications       of this recruitment crisis were underscored last year, when       the Army fell short of its 2018 recruiting goal by 6,500       soldiers. Further, in 2018 the Army missed its end strength       goal for the active duty component by almost 7,500 soldiers,       and the Army National Guard and Army Reserve missed their end       strength goals by 8,000 and 9,000 soldiers, respectively. The       shortage of qualified young people who are willing to serve       will continue to erode the strength of our military, unless       we address the root causes now.        NDD programs play a variety of roles in supporting and       enhancing our national security by contributing directly to       the health, education, and development of our youngest       generation. These crucial NDD programs include:        Child Care and Development-Block Grants (CCDBG), which help       low-income families afford child care. Research shows that       access to quality child care has significant positive impacts       on children's social, cognitive, and physical development.        Head Start and Early Head Start, which help children from       low-income families access early learning opportunities and       become prepared for kindergarten. Studies have found that the       Head Start participants gain long-term educational benefits,       including increased rates of high school graduation.        The sequestration cuts mandated by the BCA pose a direct       threat to the effectiveness of these and other key NDD       programs. Without a new budget agreement from Congress, NDD       funding will be cut by $55 billion compared to Fiscal Year       2019. These cuts would severely undermine the ability of       programs like CCDBG, Head Start, and Early Head Start to       serve children and put them on the path toward productive       citizenship.        Last year, Congress worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass       a two-year budget agreement that avoided sequestration cuts,       provided key new investments for important programs, and did       so in a balanced manner that strengthened both defense and       NDD activities. We strongly urge you to follow this example       for the coming fiscal years and avoid the drastic cuts of       sequestration, while maintaining a balanced approach to       setting discretionary budget levels.        Providing for the common defense is one of the most       fundamental and important constitutional duties of Congress.       By providing balanced investments across both defense and       non-defense discretionary programs, Congress will continue to       ensure our national security, both now and for generations to       come.     These admirals and generals, many of whom I know and a lot  of whom I do not, have been here with Republican and Democratic  administrations, but they are all people who have served our Nation and  care about our Nation. They are part of a coalition called Mission:  Readiness, Council for a Strong America. They call on Congress to  negotiate balanced investments in both defense and nondefense programs.   They wrote: ``As members of Mission: Readiness, we recognize the fact  that the strength of our military--and our Nation--is dependent on the  strength of our people.''   We have certainly seen this. You can go back to the time of World War  II, when Harry Truman found that we could not find the people we needed  in our military because of things like malnutrition or a lack of  education; we needed to improve the nutrition programs in our schools.  This is not rhetoric; it is reality.   These admirals and generals want a strong United States of America,  just as I do and just as every single Member of this body--of either  party--wants.   If the press reports are accurate, the President is planning to send  up a budget on March 11 that not only fails to provide a constructive  path forward, but it is going to be dead on arrival. If press reports  are accurate, the President will, yet again, propose deep cuts to  nondefense programs, even though Congress has rejected President  Trump's cuts for the last 2 fiscal years. Every Republican and every  Democrat knows that you have to have a balance between defense and  nondefense programs.   President Trump also proposes large increases for defense programs,  paid for using a budget gimmick that his own Acting Chief of Staff,  Mick Mulvaney, would rail against when he was in Congress. He says he  will move large portions of the defense base budget into the Overseas  Contingency Operation, or OCO, account so that it will not count  against the budget caps. Mick Mulvaney and most Republicans and  Democrats have said we cannot do this. It is not a recipe for success.   OCO is meant for costs associated with military operations in  Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. It is there to address crises overseas.  It supports our men and women deployed and in harm's way.   The OCO account should not be used as a slush fund to pay for the  everyday operations of the Department of Defense or to avoid a real  debate on the budget caps.   To suggest we should move billions in the base defense budget into  OCO at a time when the President is actively reducing our troop  presence overseas shows what a disingenuous move it is.   I went back in my notes, and I found a letter written by then- Congressman Mick Mulvaney--now the acting Chief of Staff for President  Trump. He wrote this in March of 2014. It is strikingly relevant today,  5 years later. Then-Congressman Mulvaney wrote a letter signed by  numerous Members. He opposed a $10 billion increase in OCO, calling it  is a ``misuse'' of funds and an attempt to ``circumvent the caps'' for  things unrelated to overseas combat at a time when war operations were  ``winding down.'' He opposed the gimmick. He argued for greater  transparency and discipline in the budget process.   He said he would not want any President--well, of course, in that  case, it was President Obama--to have this power. Now he is Acting  Chief of Staff of another President, and we are told the President may  propose an increase of $105 billion, more than doubling OCO funding, as  we are withdrawing troops. That is not the way forward.   Let's have an honest conversation, Republicans and Democrats  together, about our needs as a nation. We have to do the hard work to  set new caps. It is not easy. Every one of us will have to cast  difficult votes. Well, so what? We are elected to a 6-year term. There  is not a single Member of this body who, at one time or another during  their campaigns, did not say something to the effect of ``I am willing  to cast tough votes.''   Well, let us have it, this onerous conversation. Let us do the hard  work to set new caps. Let us cast those difficult votes. Let us show  the people who elected us they did the right thing. Let us invest in  the programs. Let us strengthen our military, grow our economy, improve  our infrastructure, and build the future of this country we love. Let  us not use a budget gimmick to frustrate that debate. Trust me, the  American people will see through that kind of a gimmick.  [[Page S1573]]    I am ready to have those conversations. I want to move forward with  the fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills. Let's get the work done the  American people sent us here to do. If we have to stay a few evenings  and if we have to stay a few weekends, let's do it. It is for the  greatest Nation on Earth. Let's do it. I urge leadership on both sides  of the aisle, in both Chambers of Congress, to begin these negotiations  now.   Then we have to take up, with urgency, a disaster package. In the  last 2 years, we have had the deadliest disaster seasons in recent  memory--Hurricanes Michael, Florence, Irma, and Maria, the California  wildfires, volcanic eruptions in Hawaii, and typhoons along the Pacific  coast. These communities, States, and territories need our help.   When Tropical Storm Irene hit Vermont in 2011, I found out firsthand  how devastating natural disasters can be. Roads were washed away, towns  and villages were cut off from vital services, and people's homes were  destroyed.   The day after Irene, I went around the State of Vermont with our  Governor and with the head of our National Guard in a helicopter,  landing in small towns. Many times the only way you could get into  these towns was by helicopter because roads were gone and the bridges  were gone.   You would see bridges, like a child's toy, twisted and a mile from  where it was supposed to be. A farmhouse that had been on the north  side of the river was now upside down on the south side of the river.  We were in the middle of the State, and we knew it was critical. The  Federal Government provided assistance to help recovery because we are  part of the United States of America.   The people of Puerto Rico and others that have been so badly damaged,  these are Americans. We should stand together to help them. I am sorry  we were not able to reach agreement to include a disaster package in  the fiscal year 2019 minibus we passed just 2 weeks ago. We were so  close to an agreement on a package--so very close, Republicans and  Democrats alike. It would have addressed the needs of all impacted  communities.   It broke down because the President insisted we eliminate disaster  assistance for Puerto Rico. I guess he thought tossing rolls of paper  towels for the people is good enough. Puerto Rico is part of the United  States. It is not, as the White House described it, an island  surrounded by water, I guess, as compared to those other islands. It is  a part of the United States. These are American people. They have  served in our military. They help us in our medical facilities. They  are Americans, and they cannot be left out.   Hurricanes Maria and Irma--they had two hurricanes--devastated Puerto  Rico. They destroyed the island's homes and infrastructure. They caused  the deaths of an estimated 2,975 people. It was one of the deadliest  hurricanes our country has ever seen, certainly in my lifetime.   Now, we provided Puerto Rico assistance in past disaster bills, but  they have so many unaddressed needs that have to be met. Many people,  even after the hurricane, are still living in temporary housing. Roads,  bridges, and communities still need to be rebuilt. One of the largest  infrastructure projects to be undertaken on the island is the  rebuilding of Puerto Rico's energy grid, which needs more assistance.   Most importantly, in the absence of supplemental assistance, we  estimate that 140,000 Puerto Ricans, U.S. citizens, are going to lose  nutrition assistance at the end of March.   We are the United States of America--United States of America--and  this is the U.S. Senate. We are supposed to take care of all our  citizens when they have crises. We do not pick and choose based on with  whom we are politically aligned.   I voted for disaster relief for States that were predominantly  Republican and other States that were predominantly Democratic, but I  don't look at it like that. I look at the fact that they are part of  the United States of America, and they had a disaster. They should be  helped.   Last month, the House passed H.R. 268, a comprehensive disaster  package that provided over $14 billion to help all States and  territories impacted by recent disasters to help them recover and  rebuild. I worked closely with the House on this bill. I believe it  will address the needs of all disaster-impacted communities.   On Tuesday, Senators Perdue and Jones and others, working very hard,  introduced a similar but not identical bill. I am taking these bills  with me this weekend. I am going to review them carefully. I thank the  bipartisan group of Senators--Senators Perdue and Jones and others--for  bringing the issue back to the forefront of the Senate. I am certainly  committed to working with my good friend Chairman Shelby. I also worked  with Republicans and Democrats in the House Appropriations Committee. I  want a package that can pass both Chambers in addressing the needs of  all States and territories hit by recent disasters.   I certainly urge the majority leader, Senator McConnell, to commit to  bringing this to the floor as soon as possible. With that, I see other  Senators on the floor.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the White House recently unveiled the  Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, W-GDP, an  interagency plan to increase women's global labor force participation  and advancement in the workplace, improve access of women entrepreneurs  to market opportunities, and remove barriers to economic growth for  women.   I support the initiative, although not based on the erroneous claim  of some in the White House that it is the first women's initiative ever  launched by the United States. On the contrary, I and many other  Members of Congress and previous administrations have supported such  efforts for many years. However, there is still a lot of work to be  done, and I hope W-GDP builds on those efforts.   Too many of this administration's actions have fallen far short of  the President's rhetoric or have been the antithesis of what he  promised, so while I am ready to do what is necessary to support W-GDP,  I worry that this initiative may be part of the same story. From human  trafficking at the southern border, to processing asylum applicants, to  combating HIV/AIDS, this administration purports to be serious about  addressing global problems while implementing policies or proposing  budgets that bear no resemblance to effective solutions and in many  cases would make the situation worse.   For example, while the objectives of W-GDP are laudable, it is being  implemented by the same White House that sought to cut the budget for  the Department of State and foreign assistance programs by roughly 30  percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, cuts that would have decimated  funding for programs that address the needs of the world's poorest  people, for water and sanitation, maternal and child health, education  and employment opportunities, to stave off poverty and disease that  disproportionately afflict women and girls. In fact, the President's  budget did not include a single dollar for W-GDP.   This administration has also waged war on reproductive health,  reportedly directing the omission of reporting on reproductive rights  in the State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights, and  one of President Trump's first acts after his inauguration was to  reinstate the Global Gag Rule. In fact, egged on by extremists in his  administration, he expanded it to condition funding for every  nongovernmental organization, NGO, implementing any health programs for  the United States overseas, even if their programs have nothing to do  with reproductive health. In other words, if an NGO spends millions of  dollars in India to combat HIV/AIDS, but spends $1 of its own private  funds--not U.S. taxpayer funds--to provide counseling on abortion, it  is ineligible for any U.S. Government funding for either purpose. Such  a policy would be unlawful in our own country.   So while I support W-GDP, I caution all those who defend women's  rights and support economic opportunities for women to not be  distracted by one initiative this administration launched on the backs  of the Congress's rejection of President Trump's budget and to call on  the White House to adopt a more consistent, comprehensive approach to  supporting women around the world.   With that in mind, I hope the White House will speak out forcefully  and consistently about the institutionalized and systemic persecution  and discrimination of women in Saudi Arabia and other countries whose  autocratic and corrupt governments this White House has embraced. If  the White House expects to be taken seriously about women's  empowerment, it cannot remain silent about governments whose laws and  policies treat women as property and that imprison women's rights  activists.   This is not the only area in which the administration is purporting  to support vulnerable populations while its short-sighted policies are  having the opposite effect.   In a November 30, 2018, op-ed in the Washington Post, Ivanka Trump  announced that the administration had  [[Page S1585]]  decided to limit the number of waivers for assistance for countries  that are identified in the State Department's annual Trafficking in  Persons Report as failing to meet minimum standards for combating human  trafficking. She also noted the administration's pledge of $45 million  to a fund to end modern slavery, funds that, as is true for W-GDP, the  President did not include in his budget and from an account the White  House proposed to cut.   I agree with the goal of holding governments accountable for failing  to meet minimum standards for preventing trafficking in persons, but  informed people know that cutting funding for health, education,  environmental conservation, counterterrorism, and governance programs  does nothing to prevent human trafficking, while it undercuts our  ability to make progress on other issues of national interest.   Yet that is exactly what the administration has done. By belatedly  approaching human trafficking as if nothing else matters and limiting  use of the waiver authority Congress provided, administration officials  have spent months tying themselves in knots over which programs to  continue and which to suspend. The result is that implementing partners  are running out of money, services are not being delivered, and  important programs are shutting down.   The Trump administration needs to stop governing by sound bite. If  the White House is serious about addressing human trafficking and other  complex challenges, it should work with Congress to secure the  necessary funding and apply the law in a common sense manner that is  consistent with our national interests.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss the situation in  Egypt, a country where unchecked repression has come to define the  government of President el-Sisi.   The 2011 Egyptian revolution brought hope of a democratic future for  the country, but it has failed to materialize, subverted by aspiring  autocrats. After winning historic democratic elections in 2012, the  Morsi government sought to consolidate its control, issuing a  declaration to provide the President with sweeping authorities and  eliminating checks on Executive power. The response was another popular  uprising and a military coup led by then-Defense Minister Abdel Fattah  el-Sisi.   Although cheered by some who favor President el-Sisi's crackdown on  the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and anyone suspected of being  affiliated with it, his Presidency has become a model for autocratic  rule. His police have arrested human rights lawyers, journalists, civil  society activists, and opposition politicians. Anyone who criticizes  the regime or calls for a more democratic system is threatened,  arrested, and accused of ``terrorism'' or some other vague crime  against the state. Once detained, they have been subjected to physical  and psychological abuse while they wait for months or more often years  before being subjected to sham trials that make a mockery of due  process.   Earlier this month, President el-Sisi's government took another step  to consolidate his rule. Egypt's rubberstamp Parliament approved  constitutional amendments that would enable el-Sisi to remain in power  until 2034, 12 years beyond the end of his second and final term. Other  amendments would enable el-Sisi to tighten his control of the  judiciary, create a second Parliamentary chamber dominated by  Presidential appointees, and expand the authority of the military to  codify its role in civilian political life. Egypt today is a civilian  government in name only. The military, led by el-Sisi, effectively  wields total control.   In 2011, we all hoped the Egyptian people had a brighter, albeit  challenging, political future ahead of them, but 7 years after the  overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, the el-Sisi government is erasing any  remaining hope for democracy in the country. The calls of those who  flooded the streets under Mubarak and Morsi for greater political  freedom and civil liberties, less corruption, and more accountability  are treated not as visions for Egypt's future, but as threats to el- Sisi himself.   Regrettably, it seems that the only constant in U.S.-Egyptian  relations over the last several decades, besides Egyptian Government  repression and billions of dollars in U.S. military aid, is the  reticence with which successive U.S. administrations have confronted  this issue. There always seems to be an excuse for why now is not the  time to insist on meaningful progress to advance democracy and human  rights by our ally Egypt. If not now, when? What line would the  Egyptian government have to cross for the Congress and the  administration to recognize the threat that a brutal military  dictatorship poses to stability in Egypt, and to our long-term  interests in the region?   Every U.S. administration has engaged, in varying degrees, in quiet  diplomacy to address human rights abuses and corruption overseas and  issued public statements or withheld foreign aid to encourage progress.  Diplomacy, if backed up with consequences, can achieve results, but  successive Egyptian Governments have gambled that, at the end of the  day, we will look the other way in the mistaken belief that doing so  serves U.S. security interests, and by and large, that has been the  case.   It is interesting to compare the Trump administration's selective  condemnation of government repression in other countries, where the  number of political prisoners is a fraction of those in Egypt, to  President Trump's pronouncement that President el-Sisi as a ``great  guy.'' What a sad commentary on what this country purports to stand  for.   We must acknowledge what history has repeatedly shown, that upholding  our values is the best way to protect our interests. That does not mean  cutting off all aid and walking away from Egypt. That kind of  reactionary approach is equally short-sighted. What it does mean is  that we need a more principled, measured, and consistent policy and  make clear that our aid is not a blank check--that Egypt's leaders are  not above the law; that freedom of expression is universal; that due  process is a right; that torture, cruel and inhuman treatment are  forbidden under international law; and that governments should be  accountable to their people.   At a time when President el-Sisi is seeking to manipulate the  legislative process to cement his hold on power for life, senior  officials at the White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon  need to stand up for what is first and foremost in our national  interest: the principles that define us as Americans.   I hope all Senators will join me in encouraging the Trump  administration to learn from the mistakes of its predecessors and  realign our policy toward Egypt with our values.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this morning, the Senate Appropriations  Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services and Related Agencies  held a hearing on the opioid epidemic and how States are responding to  the crisis. I was pleased Beth Tanzman, the executive director of  Vermont's Blueprint for Health, agreed to be a witness at today's  hearing to share the innovative approaches Vermont has taken to combat  opioid use disorders. Ms. Tanzman has also served as Vermont's deputy  commissioner for mental health and also directed adult mental health  services for Vermont's Department of Mental Health.   While certainly not spared from the opioid epidemic, Vermont is ahead  of much of the country in many ways: Our State openly identified the  problem, and our former Governor, Peter Shumlin, dedicated his entire  State of the State address in 2014 to constructively seek ways to not  just help addicts get clean, but to halt this scourge in its tracks.  Public health leaders, addiction specialists, doctors, and State  leaders came together and implemented a system to integrate substance  abuse treatment with primary healthcare.   Ms. Tanzman's testimony focused on the system developed through this  collaboration, known as the Hub and Spoke Model. The plan helps support  those in recovery with nine regional  [[Page S1586]]  hubs, offering daily medication assisted treatment for those with  complex addictions, and spokes, where patients receive follow-up care,  counseling, and general wellness services. This framework has allowed  Vermont to virtually eliminate wait times for treatment, which can be  enormous barriers for individuals needing help.   Every State in the Nation has seen the impacts of opioid abuse. Ms.  Tanzman's testimony was informative and offers an important perspective  for other States struggling with treating addiction. I ask unanimous  consent to that her testimony from the Appropriations Committee hearing  this morning be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          Department of Vermont Health Access, Vermont Blueprint             for Health    Testimony to the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor,       Health and Human Services, and Education Regarding the Opioid                        Epidemic--February 28, 2019    Beth Tanzman, MSW, Executive Director, Vermont Blueprint for Health,                    Department of Vermont Health Access         Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray, and Senator Leahy       and staff thank-you for the opportunity to outline what we       are learning in Vermont about addressing the opioid epidemic.        Vermont is here before you because we have successfully       scaled treatment availability for Opioid Use Disorder       statewide. Through our Hub and Spoke program we are currently       treating over 8,000 Vermonters (1.6% of the adult population)       with Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT). Vermont treats a       higher percentage of people with Opioid Use Disorder than any       other state in the nation.        We provide Medication Assisted Treatment in primary care       offices (Spokes) and in specialty addictions treatment       programs (Hubs). Through a Health Home Medicaid plan we've       built a programmatic framework that links primary care       (Spokes) and addictions treatment programs (Hubs). Patients       can move between Hubs and Spokes based on their needs.       Clinical expertise is shared across primary care and       substance abuse treatment providers.        There are strong signals that the Hub and Spoke program is       facilitating positive outcomes. Vermont has the lowest opioid       overdose death rate in New England. Vermonters receiving       Medication Assisted Treatment have lower rates of:       incarceration, hospitalizations, and emergency department use       than do Vermonters with Opioid Use Disorder who receive care       as usual. Our system of deploying teams of nurses and       counselors to primary care Spokes--2 FTE for every 100       Medicaid Members--combined with a strong back-up from Hub       programs has dramatically increased the number of primary       care providers offering Medication Assisted Treatment in       Vermont.        What we're learning may be helpful to others and a few       conclusions stand out.        Medication Assisted Treatment, the combination of       medications and counseling, is the most effective treatment       for opioid use disorder and as such, it should be       consistently available as the standard of care for this       condition.        Insurance should pay for Medication Assisted Treatment. In       Vermont we developed a Medicaid Health Home State Plan       Amendment under the authority of section 2703 of the       Affordable Care Act to create the Hub and Spoke Program.       There are other approaches to using Medicaid that states can       employ including: 1115 B Substance Use Waivers, State Plan       Amendments, including MAT in managed care organization       contracts, and increasing reimbursement rates for targeted       services. Commercial payers should also participate: in       Vermont two of our major commercial plans are piloting       payments for Hub and Spoke Services.        The health system--especially primary care--has a key role       in treating opioid addiction. The addictions treatment system       cannot do this alone; there is simply not enough treatment       capacity to meet the need brought on by this epidemic. The       participation of primary care can effect greater integration       of care, especially by coordinating pharmacological       treatments with counseling, rehabilitation, and recovery       supports.        The barriers to primary care participation in MAT (not       enough provider time, patient complexity, difficulty       integrating counseling supports) can be addressed by adding       nursing and counseling resources to the primary care       prescribing teams, as we did in Vermont.        Treatment is one element of a comprehensive response to the       opioid epidemic. Other elements include prevention--reducing       peoples' exposure to opioids in the first place, harm       reduction such as wide availability of the overdose reversal       medication Narcan to help prevent overdose deaths, and       recovery supports--including vocational services to help       people in recovery participate fully in our communities.        Leadership focus matters. I have had the honor of serving       under two consecutive Governors, Democratic and Republican,       who have both provided leadership and resources to address       the opioid epidemic in Vermont.        In closing, we have made much progress in Vermont, much of       it with the support of our federal partners. Yet while we       have some of the best access to treatment in the nation, we       have not solved this problem. Every week two Vermonters die       from a drug overdose. Tragically we've also experienced high       numbers of children under the age of five, who come into       state custody due to this crisis. We must learn how to do       better by our families and communities.        Thank you.
