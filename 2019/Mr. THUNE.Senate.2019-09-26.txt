 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the past 2 weeks have provided a kind of  microcosm of the Democrat Party since the 2016 election--a combination  of unhinged partisanship and a radical shift to the far left.   In the past 2 weeks, we have seen Democrats call for not one but two  impeachments--Justice Kavanaugh's and the President's--and introduce  another socialist-inspired, government-run approach to healthcare, this  time on the issue of prescription drugs.   First, there were the calls to impeach Justice Kavanaugh based on yet  another vague rumor. It quickly became glaringly obvious that there was  no substance to the rumor. The alleged victim apparently has zero  memory of the alleged behavior, but that didn't give Democrats any  pause. It was right on to the next rushed impeachment proposal.   On Tuesday, the Speaker of the House announced that she was opening  an impeachment inquiry into the President. Never mind that the  President had declared he would make public the transcript of the phone  call in question. Apparently, she couldn't take the time to wait. After  all, as the leader pointed out on the floor this week, Democrats have  been looking to impeach the President since the moment he was elected.   For Democrats, impeachment is not something to be gravely considered  as an answer to serious crimes; it is a political weapon they hope to  use to fix the fact that they didn't get their way in the last  Presidential election. Democrats' calls for impeachment have come so  thick and fast over the past couple of years, it would be difficult to  trust them to conduct an impeachment investigation if there ever were a  serious reason to consider one. They have made it absolutely clear that  they have no objectivity at all.   In addition to poisonous partisanship, the other thing that has  characterized the Democratic Party since the 2016 election is a rapid  swing to the extreme left. Last week, Speaker Pelosi introduced the  latest addition to the socialist agenda Democrats have been laying out  over the past year--a prescription drug bill that abandons the free  market and competition that have enabled the United States to lead the  way in drug innovation and lifesaving cures for Americans.   There is no question that many Americans face high prescription drug  costs, and there is no question that we can and should implement  measures to drive down these costs. For months, the Senate Finance  Committee, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee,  and the Senate Judiciary Committee have been working on this issue. The  same is true in the House.   There are multiple bipartisan ideas both houses of Congress could act  on, but Speaker Pelosi's bill is not the answer to the problem of high  drug costs. The Speaker's bill would force drug companies to either  accept government price controls or face up to a 95-percent tax on the  sale of their drugs. That is right, 95 percent. This is not a good- faith effort to come to the table to talk about solutions for lowering  drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for Americans.   Right now, America is a leader in prescription drug innovation and  the development of new treatments. The Speaker's bill would threaten  all of that. Under her bill, research into new treatments and cures  would decrease.   Yes, we need to address high drug prices, but discouraging the  innovation that has improved the lives of so many Americans is not the  way to go about it. The Speaker's proposal for government-run  prescription drug prices would do exactly what Democrats' larger  socialist healthcare fantasy would do, and that is to hurt Americans'  healthcare.   It would add limited healthcare innovation to the many negatives  Americans would experience under so-called Medicare for All--negatives  such as reduced access to care, limited treatment options, long wait  times, and big tax bills for ordinary Americans.   Of course, Democrats like to talk about forcing the wealthy to pay  for Medicare for All and their other pie-in-the-sky proposals. The  junior Senator from Vermont recently introduced a wealth tax he wants  to use to pay for some of his special socialist programs. His proposal  would ostensibly raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years. Here is the  problem. Let's suppose he put all that money toward paying for his  government-run takeover of healthcare, Medicare for All. At a  conservative estimate, Medicare for All would cost $32 trillion over 10  years--$32 trillion. The Senator from Vermont's wealth tax wouldn't  even cover 15 percent of that cost. Who is going to pay the other 85  percent? And that is supposing his wealth tax actually raises the money  he says it will.   European countries have repealed their wealth taxes right and left  because they were ineffective. While I am sure the Senator from Vermont  would be happy to levy additional taxes on the wealthy, the truth is,  there simply aren't enough wealthy people in the United States to pay  for all of the Democrats' socialist proposals. Ultimately, the burden  for paying for these proposals would fall heavily on the middle class.   There is no question that divided government can make things  challenging, but it can also be the occasion for real, bipartisan  action. Senate Republicans would love to work with Democrats on  solutions to problems like the cost of healthcare. Unfortunately,  Democrats have chosen to spend most of their time on partisan messaging  and on proposing socialist fantasies that would hurt the very people  they are supposed to help. I don't have a lot of confidence they will  change anytime soon, but I hope they will. There is a lot we could  still get done if Democrats are willing to come to the table and work  with Republicans on solutions that will meet the challenges faced by  the American people.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, it is always a privilege to honor the men  and women of America's Greatest Generation. They brought peace to the  world and defended the freedoms we all enjoy every day, and we owe them  a tremendous debt of gratitude for their service and sacrifice.   Today, I wish to recognize one of these heroic Americans from my home  State of South Dakota. Marcella Ryan LeBeau volunteered to serve in the  U.S. Army Nurse Corps during World War II--WWII--providing care to  wounded soldiers across Europe. Next month, Marcella will enjoy her  100th birthday at a celebration with family and friends, and I wish to  add my voice to the chorus of those praising her lifetime of  achievement and dedication to public service.   Marcella has dedicated her life to serving others. She completed a  diploma in nursing at St. Mary's Hospital in Pierre, SD, in 1942 and  served in the Army Nurse Corps as a first lieutenant in WWII, taking  her from the United States to Wales, England, France, and Belgium.  While serving in the Army from 1942 to 1946, Marcella cared for  countless wounded soldiers, including D-Day and the Battle of the  Bulge.   In 2004, on the 60th anniversary of D-Day, Marcella was among 100  WWII American veterans awarded France's highest civilian award, the  French Legion of Honor, at the French Embassy in Washington, DC.   Following her service in the Army, Marcella worked for the Indian  Health Service--IHS--in Eagle Butte for 31 years. She would eventually  become the Eagle Butte IHS Hospital's director of nursing. In addition  to her work at the IHS Hospital, she served 4 years on the Cheyenne  River Sioux Tribal Council while raising eight children with her  husband, Gilbert.   After retiring from the IHS, Marcella opened a quilting shop with her  granddaughter. They make a variety of quilts, with the main feature  being the star quilt used by the Lakota people for honoring and naming  ceremonies, memorials, and various life achievements.   In 2016, Marcella was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame,  and she received the Women in History award from the Spirit of the  Prairie Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She also  received an honorary doctorate of public service from South Dakota  State University in 2018.   With her lifesaving work in the Army and a longtime commitment to  South Dakota, Marcella has made a lasting impression on the lives of  many, and on behalf of all of them, I would I like to wish her a happy  birthday and thank her for her remarkable service to the United States.                            ____________________
