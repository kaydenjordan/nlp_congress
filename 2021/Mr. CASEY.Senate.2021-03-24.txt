 Mr. President, I rise, as my colleagues have tonight, to  talk about gun violence again. It seems that only a few months pass,  and we are here over and over again, talking about this uniquely  American problem.   Tonight, we gather in grief--a lot of sadness throughout the country,  people offering, as I do tonight, once again, condolences to the  families in both the State of Georgia, the State of Colorado, and so  many others--so many other families throughout the country who have  lost a loved one just in the last week or month or within the last  year.   But we also, I think, tonight have to do more than just offer  condolences and offer support for the families. We have to ask  ourselves some basic questions, and one question that keeps coming back  every time we gather--at least for me it does and, I know, probably for  a lot of Americans--is not simply why are we not beginning to solve  this problem, why aren't we taking action. They are obvious questions  we all ask. But one question that keeps coming to me over and over  again is a simple question about the U.S. Senate: Will the U.S. Senate,  once again, as it has now we can say year after year--will the U.S.  Senate surrender to gun violence?   That is a question I have been asking myself. I have certainly asked  it on this floor. Will the Senate continue to surrender to gun  violence? And, by extension, therefore, the country is not taking  action when we don't take action. The only way that we can begin to  solve this problem over time is to take action here in the Senate.   The House has acted over and over again, as we know, bill after bill.  In a larger sense, we have to ask ourselves: Is it really true? Will it  be true again that the most powerful Nation on Earth--really, the most  powerful Nation in the history of the human race--will that Nation once  again surrender to this problem because of inaction here?   I know this is true in every State in the Union, but I certainly know  it is true in Pennsylvania: The people of my home State and the people  of America expect us to act. They don't expect us to surrender once  again to this problem. They expect us to take action to pass  commonsense gun measures that will, at a minimum, reduce the likelihood  that we will have more mass shootings like we have experienced just in  the last week and over and over again over months and now years. And  even--even now we are moving into decades of mass casualty events  involving guns.   So they expect us to act, not to genuflect to the gun lobby. And  tonight we have to ask that question again: Will the U.S. Senate  surrender to this problem and, really, by implication, surrender and  genuflect to the gun lobby?   Tonight, I know that my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Murphy,  and others have read through some names of victims of gun violence, and  I will add to that list. It is about 20. Just--just a fraction, a tiny  fraction, of those we lost just in the last couple of years from so  many different States:   Kortlin Williams from the State of Missouri; Marcus Obrian Young from  the State of North Carolina; Marquez Warden from Virginia; Marvin Scott  from Maryland; Melvin Porter from Georgia; Omar Mohamed Juma from  Texas; Russell Jones, also from Texas; Saveon Th'Marcus Washington from  the State of Alabama; Angela Thompson from Oklahoma; Stephanie Lee from  Ohio; Tahjier Lafleur from California; Teon Burwell from Virginia;  Xavier Cancer from South Carolina; Brenda Sue Strawser Sines, Maryland;  Tera'Lynn Cantrell from Arkansas; Teshundra Fortune from Mississippi;  Quindarious Ford from Georgia; Raemel Richardson from Louisiana; Sarah  Larocca from Colorado; and, finally, Andre Odom from Ohio.   I am not sure it is possible for any one of us who hasn't been--whose  family has not been a victim of gun violence to in any way not only  understand but even to offer the appropriate words that we try to offer  to these families on a night like this and on so many other days and  nights.   I always turn back to the words of others about what this might mean  to those families. I just can't even imagine what it would be like to  lose a family member to gun violence or to any violence, for that  matter.   Remember the words of the great recording artist Bruce Springsteen.  He wrote a song in the aftermath--the horror of the aftermath of 9/11,  and he was trying to capture in a series of songs that he wrote and put  in an album at the time capturing the loss, the pain, the pain of the  loss that so many American families felt at that  [[Page S1756]]  time. And I always thought it was applicable, that kind of loss, to  what these families feel when a member of their family is killed by gun  violence.   Springsteen's refrain in that song--the name of the song is ``You're  Missing,'' and he keeps using that refrain:         You're missing when I shut out the lights.        You're missing when I close my eyes.        You're missing when I see the sunrise.    That is the reality for these families. Every moment of their day  will be a time when they will be missing that family member for God  only knows how long.   So we are thinking of those families tonight who have loved and lost.   We are also remembering--and this is another area where we have not  taken action--we are also remembering families that had a member of  their family become a victim of gun violence, but they survived, but  their life is changed unalterably. The life of that individual has  changed. The life of his or her family changes and so many burdens they  have to carry, having survived gun violence.   We know that 100 are killed each day--more than 40,000 across the  country in our country. But we also know numbers about those who have  survived: 230 people sustain a nonfatal gun injury every day, and it is  estimated that about 10 million Americans have been shot and injured  during their lifetime--10 million Americans.   We also know that gun violence injuries are more likely to occur in  younger people. Each year, approximately 15,600 children and teenagers  are shot and injured. Black children and teenagers are 14 times more  likely than their White peers to die by gun homicide.   Those who survive--those huge numbers who survive--have their lives  changed forever. The role that that victim plays in the family is made  exponentially more different.   I will talk about one of those individuals tonight. His name is Azir  Harris.   Azir Harris was 17 years old in February of 2018--February 15, to be  exact. It was the day after the Parkland shooting in Florida. Azir was  shot five times on his way to grab something to eat with two of his  friends in South Philadelphia.   He was paralyzed from the waist down, caught in the crossfire of gun  violence as an innocent bystander. Azir's life and his family's lives  were turned upside down in seconds. Their house was just blocks away  from where he almost lost his life--again, as I said, shot five times.   To navigate their two-story home, Azir's father would carry him up  and down the stairs in their home. They searched desperately to  relocate but were having trouble finding housing, which is often nearly  impossible for victims of gun violence.   The family was eventually able to relocate into a home in North  Philadelphia, but in the process, they were forced to leave behind some  of their adult children in the old home they came from.   Azir continues to learn about how to navigate his new life in a  wheelchair, and the family continues to struggle to find ways to  improve his quality of life.   Now they are searching for housing outside of the city so they might  be able to find a home with a backyard for Azir to enjoy.   Azir and his family will never be able to forget about this  shooting--and he was shot five times--because they live with the  consequences of that violence every single day. They are just one of  millions who struggle financially, who struggle physically, who  struggle emotionally because of the trauma of gun violence that has  ravaged our communities, our schools, our churches, and our businesses.   So the U.S. Senate has an obligation on this part of the problem as  well. We can't surrender to gun violence, and we can't surrender to the  question of what we are going to do to help those who survive.   We certainly have to pass commonsense gun measures, as I mentioned  before--something as simple and as overwhelmingly popular as universal  background checks. And at the same time, we can pass a number of other  commonsense measures, including a bill that I am leading here in the  Senate and paired up with U.S. Representative Dwight Evans in the  House, a great leader in our State from the city of Philadelphia. This  bill is the Resources for Victims of Gun Violence, and Dwight Evans and  I are working to get it passed.   The bill would create an interagency advisory council with experts  from Federal Agencies, victims of gun violence, and victim assistance  professionals. Among other things, this council would make it easier  for victims of gun violence to access resources by assessing,  gathering, and disseminating information about different benefits and  programs that could assist the victims--the victims of gun violence,  like Azir and his family.   But I come back to where I started as I conclude my remarks. We have  to ask that question: Will the U.S. Senate once again surrender to gun  violence, do nothing about the tragic loss of life that we have seen  just in the last week, surrender to the carnage that we see not just  this week and last week and month after month but now literally decade  after decade?   There hasn't been on the floor of the U.S. Senate a significant,  substantial debate on gun violence in I don't know how long; I guess  since maybe 2013--8 years. There has been 8 years of virtually no  debate and 8 years of not voting, not even passing a vote on these  commonsense gun measures, because the gun lobby has created a blockade.  So the Senate was not even permitted, I guess, under their rules--the  rules of the gun lobby and the rules of the majority until recently-- prohibited from even debating, let alone voting on commonsense  measures.    So while the victims of gun violence are burdened by all the changes  in their lives and the expense and the trauma they live through, while  others suffer through the consequence of losing a loved one and feeling  that sense of missing someone every day, while all that is happening,  the U.S. Senate has been frozen in place for 8 years at least. We  haven't even voted on commonsense measures.   It is time for the Senate to act, not to genuflect to the gun lobby  like so many in this Chamber seem to want to do year after year. It is  time for the Senate to act, to pass commonsense gun reform at long  last.   I yield the floor.
