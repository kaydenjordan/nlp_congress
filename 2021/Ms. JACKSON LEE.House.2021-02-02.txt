 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on  the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, and as the Member  of Congress for a congressional district that has experienced the worst  of COVID-19 as a public health emergency and economic catastrophe, I  rise in strong support of the rule governing debate on H.R. 447, the  National Appenticeship Act of 2121, and H. Con. Res. 11, 447, as well  as the underlying legislation.   The National Apprenticeship Act has the potential to yield $10.6  billion in net benefits to U.S. taxpayers in the form of increased  workers productivity and decreased spending on public-assistance  programs and unemployment insurance and which bring America's  investments in apprenticeship more in line with countries around the  world.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation could not be more timely because during  a time of record unemployment, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021  creates an additional 1 million new apprenticeship opportunities and  invests more than $3.5 billion over 5 years in expanding opportunities  and access to Registered Apprenticeships, youth apprenticeships, and  pre-apprenticeships.   I also strongly support H. Con. Res. 11 because it reorders budgetary  priorities to provide $1.9 trillion to allow Congress to take immediate  and decisive action to crush the virus and vaccinate our people, build  the economy back better, reopen schools, and provide needed support and  assistance to state and local governments that have been asked to do  too much with too little for far too long.   Let me make clear at the outset Mr. Speaker, that nothing in this  resolution precludes the reaching of a bipartisan and bicameral  agreement to pass and fund the President's America Rescue Plan, which  in nearly all material respects mirrors the Heroes Act passed by the  House Democratic majority on May 15, 2020, nearly nine months ago, only  to languish on the Republican Senate Majority Leader's desk while  hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans succumbed to the virus  and millions of others lost their livelihoods and businesses, and  everyone faced an uncertain future.   So if our Republican colleagues are amenable to reaching an agreement  on a legislative response that is commensurate to the challenge facing  Americans, nothing in the legislation before will preclude that from  happening.   But have no doubt, if they refuse to be part of the solution, the  unified and bicameral Democratic congressional majority, in  coordination with the new Democratic Administration, will take the lead  and act boldly to address and overcome the present crisis.   I would urge my Republican colleagues to heed the words of Republican  Governor of West Virginia who said colorfully just a few days ago, ``At  this point in time in this nation, we need to go big. We need to quit  counting the egg-sucking legs on the cows and count the cows and just  move. And move forward and move right now.''   The same sentiment was expressed more eloquently by Abraham Lincoln  in 1862 when he memorably wrote:   ``The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the  occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.''   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took last December was a step  in the right direction but only a long-delayed down payment; we cannot  afford any more delays, especially since Republican stalling already  caused a painful lapse in critical unemployment assistance last year,  and additional unemployment assistance is set to expire in March.   That why this resolution, which creates a failsafe alternative to  debating, voting, and passing the American Rescue Act, is absolutely  crucial and the right thing to do, right now.   The American Rescue Plan proposed by President Biden takes a  multiprong approach to tackling the public health and economic crises  stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.   To beat the virus and safely reopen schools, the plan will mount a  national vaccination program that includes setting up community  vaccination sites nationwide and makes the investments necessary to  safely reopen schools.   It will also take complementary measures to combat the virus,  including scaling up testing and tracing, addressing shortages of  personal protective equipment and other critical supplies, investing in  high-quality treatments, and addressing health care disparities.   The American Rescue Plan delivers immediate relief to working  families bearing the brunt of the crisis by providing $1,400 per person  in direct cash assistance to households across America, bringing the  total (including the $600 down payment enacted in December) to $2,000.   Additionally, the plan will also provide direct housing and nutrition  assistance to families struggling to get by, expand access to safe and  reliable child care and affordable health care, extend and expand  unemployment insurance so American workers can pay their bills, and  give families with children as well as childless workers a boost  through enhanced tax credits.   Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan provides much needed support  for communities struggling with the economic fallout, including hard- hit small businesses, especially those owned by entrepreneurs from  racial and ethnic backgrounds that have experienced systemic  discrimination.   Finally, the plan also provides crucial resources to protect the jobs  of first responders, frontline public health workers, teachers, transit  workers, and other essential workers that all Americans depend on.   The 2021 budget resolution is not a comprehensive fiscal blueprint  for the next 10 years; it is designed solely to provide the option of  using reconciliation to deliver critical relief and achieve the goals  of the American Rescue Plan.   As such, the total spending and revenue levels in the resolution  simply reflect current-law projections adjusted for the estimated costs  of the American Rescue Plan.   Once the American Rescue Plan becomes law, Congress will begin its  work on a forward-looking, comprehensive budget resolution for 2022  that will provide urgently needed economic support and address  longstanding deficits in our communities and underlying inequities in  our society, which have been so starkly revealed and exacerbated by  COVID-19.   I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members to join me  in voting for its passage.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                      Amendment to House Resolution 85         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 10. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       682) to encourage local educational agencies to resume in-      person instruction at elementary and secondary schools, and       for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and Labor. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit. If the Committee of the       Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on       the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the bill.  [[Page H273]]         Sec. 11. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 682.
