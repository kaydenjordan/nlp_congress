 I echo the words of Vice Chair Collins and thank her for  her tremendous work on this.   A lot of work has gone into these bills. All three of them were  reported unanimously out of our committee after a tremendous amount of  work. To finish that work and to allow all the Senate to speak, we need  to vote yes to get on this bill.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.                            ____________________     Mr. President, at the start of the year, when Vice Chair  Collins and I took over as leaders of the Senate Appropriations  Committee, we announced something ambitious: We were going to return  the committee to regular order.   The first thing everyone told us was: That is great. We all want to  return to regular order. We all want to show the American people that  Congress can actually function; that we can work together and solve  problems and pass bills to make their lives better.   But the second thing they told us was essentially: Good luck. You are  going to need it.   Well, Vice Chair Collins and I went to work. We said: Look, if this  is going to happen, we have to show we are serious about writing these  bills that can actually be signed into law. That meant a few things.   First of all, it meant we had to work with the funding levels in the  debt ceiling deal struck by President Biden and Speaker McCarthy, a  deal that I had--and I still have--concerns about and which required  tough funding decisions across each of our 12 bills. But the President  and Speaker shook hands, and that is the agreement that Congress passed  into law. We can't produce serious bills if we start by throwing that  framework out the window.   Secondly, it meant we had to work together to find common ground,  including on tough and thorny issues, and compromise where necessary to  produce spending bills that could make it through both Chambers and to  the President's desk. That meant avoiding poison pills that could sink  these bills.   And, third, we wanted to make sure that we had an open, bipartisan  process. We wanted to give each and every one of our colleagues the  chance to weigh in on these bills and the American public the chance to  see our work on them. So we held over 40 hearings this spring to assess  our Nation's needs for the year ahead. We sought input from all of our  colleagues. We wrote these bills together, and then we held markups for  the first time in 2 years. We televised the markups--the first time  ever--so people could follow this debate from home. And at those  markups, we discussed the draft legislation, considered amendments, and  voted on our bills.   The result: For the first time in 5 years, we passed all 12 of our  funding bills out of our committee, and we did it with overwhelming  bipartisan support. Nine of the twelve bills passed unanimously or had  just a single ``no'' vote. In total, 97 percent of the votes on our  bills in committee were ``yes'' votes.   These are not the bills I would have written on my own. They are not  what Vice Chair Collins would have written on her own. They are the  bills we wrote together, along with our colleagues on the committee and  with input from nearly every Senator on both sides of the aisle.   They are serious bills that can be signed into law, which is how this  process should work. We should come together, look for common ground,  and build on it to write bills that solve problems and make people's  lives better and give our Nation and communities the resources they  need to stay safe and competitive, to grow and thrive. That is exactly  what the three bills in this package do.   As chair of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans  Affairs, and Related Agencies, I am  [[Page S4366]]  pleased to say I was able to work with Senator Boozman to put together  a bill that gets our military and our veterans the support we owe them,  the support that they need.   This is essential to keeping our Nation safe because our ships and  submarines and aircraft are only as good as the infrastructure they  rely on and the troops who operate them. So this bill provides DOD with  $19.1 billion for military construction. That is an increase over  fiscal year 2023 levels.   This funding will help with construction needs across our country at  base installations for projects like childcare development centers to  make sure our servicemembers and their spouses can go to work knowing  that their children are safe and housing like the barracks project at  Joint Base Lewis-McChord in my home State and other facilities across  the country to support our troops.   It will help make sure that our shipyards, like the naval base in  Kitsap and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, are up-to-date and up to the  challenges of this moment.   These investments will build our presence around the world,  especially in the Indo-Pacific regions, and strengthen our military  infrastructure to keep it resilient in the face of threats like severe  weather and earthquakes.   And I am really glad we included funds to address harmful PFAS  chemicals and other toxins at former installations that could put our  communities in harm's way.   I am also very proud of the work we have done in this bill to support  veterans and their families. As the daughter of a World War II veteran,  I take the promises we made to those who fought for our country very  seriously, and this bill ensures that we keep those promises by fully  funding VA's budget request. We are talking about increased funding for  mental health, suicide prevention programs, the caregivers program,  expanding the childcare pilot program--that continues to be a huge  priority for me across all of our appropriations bills--funding for  homelessness prevention programs for our veterans, rural health  programs, and, of course, women veterans' healthcare.   By the way, women are the fastest growing demographic of veterans  overall. Our MILCON-VA funding bill also increases VA infrastructure  funding so we can begin to address the challenges related to VA's aging  medical facilities, and it reflects the much-needed pause and reset  happening with the electronic health record modernization program.   I was raising the alarm from day one about how the unacceptable  botched rollout of that program hurt veterans in my home State, and I  am watching closely to make sure we see changes that provide real  results for our veterans and our VA providers because, at the end of  the day, these investments are not just about programs and contracts.  This is about our promise to get veterans the benefits they earned and  need to stay healthy, like prescriptions, mental health care, cancer  screenings, and more.   So the stakes could not be higher for those families, and we owe them  that much, which is why I am proud this bill sends a clear, bipartisan  message: We are not going to shortchange our veterans and  servicemembers, and we will live up to our obligation to provide them  with the resources that they need.   The next bill in this package--from the Subcommittee on Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies-- makes sure we are living up to another crucial obligation, and that is  to keep our food supply safe and secure, and support rural communities  across our country, because, at the most basic level, we can't have  strong communities if people can't put food on the table. That means  making sure that the food that is sold in our country is safe. It means  protecting families from shortages--so avoiding and mitigating supply  chain disruptions, addressing climate crises, like droughts, which can  threaten crops we all rely on. It means addressing food insecurity so  people can afford--and access--the food they need to keep their  families healthy and fed. And it means supporting our Nation's farmers,  who are such a huge part of our economy. For example, every day in my  home State of Washington, we ship apples, cherries, wheat, potatoes,  pulse crops, and so many other commodities across the country and  across the world.   So I want to thank Senator Heinrich and Senator Hoeven for their very  hard work to help put together a bipartisan bill that delivers on those  crucial issues. This bill will make sure the FDA has the resources it  needs to keep grocery stores and dinner tables safe and to implement  the bipartisan cosmetics legislation that we negotiated last year and  that many of us worked on very hard to pass.   It also includes crucial funding to support our farmers, for example,  increased investments in agricultural research. Just last month, I was  home and visited my alma mater, Washington State University, which is  home to world class agricultural research programs. This funding will  help universities like WSU to tackle problems that our farmers are  facing, like, in my State, smoke exposure to wine grapes, herbicide  resistance, and little cherry disease; not to mention efforts that we  need to make to address water shortages, improve our yields, use  inputs, and more.   The bill also funds absolutely critical nutrition programs like WIC,  which is a lifeline that keeps so many families from going under. This  bill fully funds WIC at the level included in the President's budget  request, and we know that participation and costs for the program are  changing. So as we work to get final appropriations bills signed into  law, I will keep working around the clock to make sure that no one  loses their WIC benefits and no one is forced to be on a wait list. We  have got to maintain the strong bipartisan support for that program  going forward and continue to fully fund it, and that is a top priority  for me.   My family had to rely on food stamps for a short time, and thanks to  that help that we got when I was young, every one of my six brothers  and sisters and I have been able to now grow up and give back to our  communities because our country had our back when we needed it.   So make no mistake, our investments in WIC are not just the right  thing, the moral thing; it is an investment in the future of America.   So if I haven't painted a picture yet, investments like this, which  maintain our nutrition programs, support our farmers, and keep our food  supplies safe and secure are truly mission critical to our Nation's  future, but they are also bipartisan. There are things that we can all  agree on that are important for America.   Finally, this package includes the funding bill from the  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee. I previously led this subcommittee alongside Vice Chair  Collins, as the chair and ranking member, and, I can tell you,  investments here are critical to help prevent people from living on the  streets or being out in the cold and to get people and goods where they  need to go in a safe and timely way.   Washington State, like so many other States in our country, has  really been grappling with our Nation's housing and homelessness crisis  for years. So I am glad that we are able to maintain and build on some  key investments in this bill that provide rental assistance to families  in need, increase our housing supply, support maintenance for  distressed properties, and connect people with healthcare, education,  unemployment programs, and other support services.   And I hope we can come together in a bipartisan way to do more to  tackle those challenges in a serious way in the future, because while  this bill does take important steps and includes necessary investments,  our housing and homelessness crisis is going to take a lot more than  flat funding in most areas and modest funding increases in some  programs, which is what was possible to negotiate under the tough  budget caps in this debt ceiling deal.   When it comes to our Nation's transportation infrastructure, the  investments in this bill are especially important in light of some of  the derailments and disasters and disturbing close calls we saw this  year. I am very pleased that we were able to increase funding for the  Federal Aviation Administration so it can address the shortage of air  traffic controllers, reduce flight  [[Page S4367]]  delays, increase efficiency, modernize technology, and critically  improve safety, which is so important given the concerning number of  near misses we have seen recently.   This bill also increases the Federal Railroad Administration's  funding for its safety work to make sure we have enough inspectors to  keep our rails safe and that we can research important questions to  improve rail safety and efficiency.   So I really want to thank Senator Schatz and Senator Hyde-Smith for  their excellent work putting that bill together.   Each and every one of the appropriations bills in the package before  us today is the result of an open, bipartisan process that invited  input from every single Senator. In fact, that is true for all 12 of  the bills our committee passed--all in overwhelming, bipartisan votes.   And, as my colleagues know, the Senate Appropriations Committee has  plenty of Members on opposite ends of the political spectrum--strongly  progressive Democrats and deeply conservative Republicans. In other  words, getting here took a lot of hard work, late nights, and early  mornings. And we had to really set politics aside, listen to each  other, focus on the problems, and find common ground.   I think I speak for everyone when I say this work has not been easy.  And, of course, I know as well as anyone that our work is not done. I  think we all understand a CR will be necessary to see this process  through. And we all understand supplemental funding is absolutely  essential to respond to some of the urgent challenges our States are  facing, like delivering disaster relief that communities desperately  need today, paying our wildland firefighters, continuing to have our  Ukrainian allies' back, and addressing the fentanyl crisis, not to  mention the need, as I have spoken, of addressing the childcare funding  cliff that threatens to put childcare further out of reach for too many  families.    And, of course, even after we pass this funding package before us  today, we need to get all the rest of our appropriations bills across  the finish line. But by passing this package and the rest of our  appropriations bills, we are showing the American people that there is  a clear, bipartisan path for us to do our jobs and fund the government.   There is absolutely no reason for chaos or a shutdown, and I will  continue working nonstop with my colleagues to make sure we get that  job done. This was never going to be easy, but none of us came here  because we thought it was easy. We came here because we wanted to make  life better for folks back home, helping people and solving problems. I  have said that a lot during my time here in the Senate, and I have  brokered a lot of bipartisan deals, always in service to the people I  represent back home, the friends and neighbors that I grew up with.  Helping people and solving problems, that is our job, and I would like  to see us do more of that together--Democrats and Republicans.   So I urge all of our colleagues: Let's keep this momentum going.  Let's show the American people that Congress can work for them. There  doesn't have to be a calamity over funding the government. Let's show  that there can and will be major policy disagreements on any number of  issues, but their elected leaders can come together on what we agree  on, and we will fund the government responsibly so they don't have to  worry about chaos or shutdowns.   And on that note, I would like to encourage my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to come to the floor and talk about these bills-- what they mean for your State, what they mean for your constituents,  what your priorities are here--and to talk to me and to talk to Senator  Collins if you have amendments and ideas for how we can make these  bills better, because Senator Collins and I are working now to clear a  managers' package and set up votes. Our staffs are still working too,  and we are happy to work with your team so we can pass the strongest  bills possible.   We have been working closely from day one to run an open, bipartisan  process and to get input from all of our colleagues and to make sure  everyone can make their constituents' voices heard.   One issue Vice Chair Collins and I heard about from many of our  colleagues is the need to support communities rebuilding after recent  disasters. I will have more to say on that in the days ahead, but it is  front of mind for both of us and the Appropriations Committee as a  whole to take care of our communities that are working so hard to  rebuild after the recent horrible disasters, which include, as we know,  the wildfires in Hawaii and in areas in Washington State, flooding in  Vermont and California, as well as the damage caused by Hurricane  Idalia.   So, as we get started on this bill, I say to all of my colleagues:  Come to the floor. Talk to us. Work with us so we can get this funding  package passed, help people, and solve problems.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I certify that the information required  by rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate related to  congressionally directed spending items has been identified in the  committee reports which are incorporated by reference in Senate  amendment 1092 to H.R. 4366 and that the required information has been  [[Page S4381]]  available on a publicly accessible congressional website at least 48  hours before a vote on the pending bill.                            ____________________
