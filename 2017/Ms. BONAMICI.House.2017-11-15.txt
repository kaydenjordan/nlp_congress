 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  disastrous partisan tax plan that cuts rates for wealthy corporations  and millionaires while leading to higher taxes for about 38 million  working families.   There is a lot to not like about this bill. It actually eliminates  the student loan interest deduction. That will increase the financial  burden for about 12 million Americans who are juggling their student  loan debt with housing, groceries, and childcare. The cost of higher  education is already out of reach for too many. We should be making it  easier, not harder for Americans to access higher education.    On top of that, removing the State and local tax deduction threatens  funding sources for public education and will most certainly lead to  cuts to America's public school budgets.   Mr. Speaker, across the country, families are working hard to get  ahead. Let's not take away their opportunity. We need a Tax Code that  leads to better jobs, better wages, and a better future for America,  for our children and our grandchildren. This bill fails the test, and  we should reject it and get back to working together.
