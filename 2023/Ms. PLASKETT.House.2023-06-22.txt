 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight my bill, H.R.  3385, the DiasporaLink Act. This critical piece of legislation would  request review of the feasibility of an undersea fiber-optic  telecommunications cable established between the United States and  Africa linked in the Virgin Islands of the United States.   This bill offers a significant opportunity to deepen economic  connections and aid American regional security by establishing high- speed, secure telecommunications data connection from the American soil  to the African Continent. The U.S. territory of the Virgin Islands,  which is strategically positioned in transit zones to fight  transnational crime and protect U.S. national and regional security,  will prove to be a mutually advantageous location.   With increased terrorism and Russian, Chinese, and other adversarial  nations on the African Continent, U.S. interests, the need for direct  linkage is mandatory. The United States undersea cable linked in the  Virgin Islands, which is already a hub, is within our national  strategic interests.                            ____________________
