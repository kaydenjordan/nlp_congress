 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three ``Legacy  Leaders'' from my district in Nebraska for Black History Month.   Every February, we celebrate the achievements of African Americans  and recognize their pivotal roles in the history of our great country.  This year, I recognize Ella Willis, Teela Mickles, and Bettie McDonald,  who have worked diligently to leave a meaningful and lasting impact on  the Omaha community.   Originally from North Carolina, our first Legacy Leader, Ella Willis,  came to Omaha in 1967, right after the race riots. After seeing the  damage and destruction from the riots not being repaired, she joined  the Neighborhood Action and Fact Association, founded by Andy  ``Handy''.   Around 2004, Mrs. Willis became the president of the association. She  worked to secure grant funding for the beautification of 24th Street  and the neighborhood garden and marketplace building. The association  assisted with the painting of murals along the 24th Street corridor,  including The Union for Contemporary Art.   In 2005, under Mrs. Willis' leadership, the association received the  Environmental Improvement Award from the Urban Community Improvement  Program. Her community advocacy started long before, when she joined  the NAACP in the early sixties, while her husband served in Vietnam.  She participated in the voting registration process, protesting for the  right for Black women to vote and registering Black men.   Mrs. Willis thanks God for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and praises  his belief in justice, hope, love, and nonviolence, saying, ``This is  what we must learn together as brothers and sisters of God. Have love  and faith in your heart.''   Another Legacy Leader is Teela A. Mickles, the founder and CEO of  Compassion in Action, a faith-based, nonprofit organization that serves  individuals confined in the State correctional facilities and families  affected by incarceration.   Mrs. Mickles became a single parent to five young children after an  unfortunate turn in life and later attended college, earning her  associate degree in Chemical Dependency Counseling. At the same time,  she developed Compassion in Action's Pre-Release Education/Reentry  Preparation Program, with her motto of ``Embracing the person,  rebuilding the family, and breaking the cycle.''   She has been recognized for her dedication and accomplishments  through the years: The UNO Woman of Color Award, Heartland Family  Services' Family Advocacy Award, and the City of Omaha Excellence  Award, and many, many more.   Mrs. Mickles is also an ordained minister on staff at Mission Church  and credits the success of her organization to her strong faith in God  and belief that every person is viable. As she says: ``If you're not  dead, God's not done.''   Our third Legacy Leader is Bettie McDonald, cofounder of Native Omaha  Days, a week-long homecoming event that celebrates the community's  historical and cultural legacies.   Born and raised in Omaha, Bettie belongs to the Bryant-Fisher family,  hailed as one of the most prodigious Black families in Nebraska. After  graduating from the Allhouse School of Beauty and Culture, she became  owner of her own beauty shop of over 50 years, The Economy Beauty  Salon.   The vision for a reunion of native Omahans was first arranged in 1976  and less than a year later the original founding planning members, Vera  Johnson and Bettie McDonald, started a tradition of the week-long  celebration. It is now known as Native Omaha Days and, every 2 years,  has brought people to Omaha from across the country.   Approaching its 22nd biennial, Native Omaha Days has reached a peak,  influencing cultural programming along 24th Street and adjacent North  Omaha neighborhoods.  [[Page H332]]    Bettie is an active member of St. Paul Baptist Church. This year she  will celebrate 70 years of marriage, 70 years, to her husband, Jesse  McDonald.   I personally thank these three women for making a difference and  leaving a legacy of future Black leaders in Omaha. We owe them much  gratitude and recognition.                            ____________________
