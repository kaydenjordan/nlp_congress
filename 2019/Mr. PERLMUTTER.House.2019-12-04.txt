 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 739 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 739         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant  [[Page H9231]]       to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into       the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union       for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2534) to amend the       Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit certain       securities trading and related communications by those who       possess material, nonpublic information. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services       now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       116-39 shall be considered as adopted in the House and in the       Committee of the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as the original bill for the purpose of further       amendment under the five-minute rule and shall be considered       as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill,       as amended, are waived. No further amendment to the bill, as       amended, shall be in order except those printed in the report       of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each       such further amendment may be offered only in the order       printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       further amendments are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill, as amended, to the House with such       further amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2. (a) At any time on the legislative day of       Wednesday, December 11, 2019, it shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order to consider in the House a       motion to discharge the Committee on Foreign Affairs from       further consideration of the concurrent resolution (H. Con.       Res. 77) directing the President pursuant to section 5(c) of       the War Powers Resolution to remove United States Armed       Forces from hostilities in the Syrian Arab Republic that have       not been authorized by Congress, if offered by Representative       Gabbard of Hawaii. The motion shall be considered as read.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion except 20       minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by       Representative Gabbard of Hawaii and an opponent. The       question of adoption of the motion may be subject to       postponement as though under clause 8 of rule XX.        (b) The provisions of section 7 of the War Powers       Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1546) shall not apply during the       remainder of the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress to House       Concurrent Resolution 77.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of the resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of  debate only.                                time  1215                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met last night and  reported House Resolution 739, providing for consideration of H.R.  2534, the Insider Trading Prohibition Act, under a structured rule,  which makes in order two amendments.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial  Services and provides for one motion to recommit. Lastly, the rule  makes the motion to discharge H. Con. Res. 77, if offered by  Representative Gabbard from Hawaii, in order on December 11 and that  the resolution be debatable for 20 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are here today to provide for  consideration of H.R. 2534, the Insider Trading Prohibition Act, which  will establish a statutory prohibition on insider trading.   For millions of hardworking Americans, investing in the stock market  is an important tool to save for retirement, send their kids to  college, or save for a downpayment on a home. The foundation of an  efficient market is rooted in fairness and transparency, that all  investors have access to the same information so they can make  reasonable and prudent investment decisions.   Insider trading erodes the foundation of fairness and transparency.  When company insiders, or market participants with insider knowledge,  use nonpublic information to trade stocks, bonds, or other types of  securities, not only do they unfairly gain a financial advantage over  families saving for their futures, but the insiders also erode trust in  our Nation's financial system. We cannot allow insiders to take  advantage of the folks who play by the rules.   Current law on insider trading has been largely developed by the  courts based on the antifraud statute in the Securities Exchange Act of  1934, yet there is no specific law prohibiting insider trading. This  lack of clarity in the law, combined with recent court decisions  limiting the ability of the SEC to prosecute insider trading, has  opened the door for bad actors to profit at the expense of average  investors.   Insider trading is wrong and undermines our economy. It is time for  Congress to act and provide a clear legal standard for insider trading.   This bill passed the Financial Services Committee on a voice vote in  May, showcasing the importance of finally codifying a prohibition on  insider trading. Since the markup, the sponsor of the legislation,  Representative  Jim Himes from Connecticut, has negotiated with Ranking  Member McHenry to address any outstanding issues and incorporate  feedback from the SEC.   The text of the bill we are considering today incorporates many of  the suggestions from Mr. McHenry and other Republicans. Discussions  between Mr. Himes and Mr. McHenry, which concluded late yesterday, have  resulted in the McHenry amendment, which enjoys the full support of Mr.  Himes and Chairwoman Maxine Waters.   I understand adoption of this amendment, which makes further  clarifying changes, will bring the support of Ranking Member McHenry  and many more of my Republican colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Himes on his efforts over the years in  coming to this bipartisan compromise. This bill will be a big step  forward in reinstating trust in our financial system and providing  transparency for our markets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and the  underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I always enjoy doing these rules with my friend from  Georgia. He is very kind in his compliments, and he makes points that  are well taken.   One, though, that I would take some issue with that he raised was  with respect to the widow's tax, the bill that he brought up in  committee last night. I would just say that particular bill was  incorporated in the National Defense Authorization Act, which this  House passed months ago, which, like so many other things, was caught  up in a logjam over in the Senate where at least 275 bills, bipartisan  bills, are sitting on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's desk and  have not seen any action being taken.                                time  1230    But we are here today to talk about the Insider Trading Prohibition  Act, which really has come a long way. Mr. Himes from Connecticut has  been working on this piece of legislation for some time. And, as Mr.  Woodall said, there has been a lot of collaboration which has resulted,  and, upon the passage of Mr. McHenry's amendment, will result in a  pretty good bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Himes) to speak on this rule and his bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would remind the body that we are here to talk about  insider trading prohibition and not specifically the National Defense  Authorization Act. But let's talk about some of the differences between  the House and the Senate that my colleague from Wyoming would,  apparently, just give up.   She doesn't, apparently, care or is recommending that we forget about  the widow's tax, which the gentleman from Georgia has really eloquently  discussed the need for it. But, obviously, that is something that is in  the House-passed bill and not in the Senate bill.   Secondly, in the House-passed bill, there is parental leave for  members of our military. That certainly is not part of the Senate bill.   There is a whole section on upgrading and improving military housing  for  [[Page H9234]]  those who serve our Nation and protect us; and I know there is a  specific provision in there to assist nuclear weapons workers who have  become sick or ill due to all the toxicity and radiation that they  suffered during, particularly, the Cold War period and, since then, in  dealing with our nuclear weapons arsenal.   I would suggest to the gentlewoman from Wyoming that she is just  wrong on wanting to give up, recede, and let the Senate control all of  this. Those priorities are serious priorities for the men and women of  our military, for our nuclear weapons workers, and for widows. I  appreciate her comments.   We certainly want to see the National Defense Authorization Act  passed as quickly as possible, but it, like so many other things, has  gotten stuck in the Republican majority Senate: 275 bills, minimum,  bipartisan in nature, sitting on Senate Majority Mitch McConnell's  desk, no action having been taken.    I would say that there is a lot of bipartisan legislation that  certainly can be passed today if the Senate majority leader would  actually take some action instead of just sitting there doing nothing.   But coming back to this particular piece of legislation, this is a  good bill; it is done in collaboration between Democrats and  Republicans; and it needs to be passed. I would urge that we need to  proceed with this process, move forward, get this rule passed, so we  can get on with this particular piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't have any other speakers as well,  so I will close. I assume that was my friend's closing.    I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, along with Mr. Woodall, I want to thank my colleagues  for joining me here today to speak on the rule and the Insider Trading  Prohibition Act.   The Insider Trading Prohibition Act has been a long time coming.  Since passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC has  relied on its antifraud statute and mounting case law without an  explicit statute prohibiting insider trading. This legislation provides  the clarity our regulators need in order to do their job and ensure the  fundamental foundation of fairness and transparency in our financial  system. We owe it to our constituents to ensure that their savings in  the stock market are on an equal footing with all investors.   My friend from Georgia and I have spent a lot of time talking about  bipartisanship today and how we can work together across party lines to  tackle the tough issues facing our constituents. That is what the House  has been doing this year under the Democratic majority. We have passed  over 275 bipartisan bills that are sitting on the Senate majority  leader's desk awaiting action in the Senate. These 275 bills represent  progress that the Democratic majority is delivering for the people to  strengthen the health, economic security, and well-being of every  family in every community in America.   The House has passed bipartisan and commonsense gun violence  prevention bills, we have strengthened background checks, we have  passed reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and we have  passed dozens of bipartisan bills to care for our Nation's veterans. We  want to see those particular pieces of legislation move from the Senate  to the White House and be passed into law for all Americans.   I hope the Insider Trading Prohibition Act doesn't get caught up in  this graveyard over in the Senate and is instead taken up quickly by  the Senate along with all these other important bipartisan bills our  colleagues have worked together to pass this year.   I appreciate the bipartisan nature of Mr. Himes and Mr. McHenry in  coming  [[Page H9235]]  together with this particular piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                          Amendment to H. Res. 739         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. The House being in possession of the official       papers, the managers on the part of the House at the       conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on S.       1790 shall be, and they are hereby, discharged. It shall then       be in order without intervention of any point of order for       the chair of the Committee on Armed Services or his designee,       after consultation with the ranking minority member of the       Committee on Armed Services, to move that the House recede       from its amendment and agree to an amendment to the Senate       bill (S. 1790). The motion shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to adoption without intervening motion or demand for       division of the question except for one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Armed Services.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
