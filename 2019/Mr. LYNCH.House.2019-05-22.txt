 Madam Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman Waters for her  great work on this bill. She has been a true champion on behalf of  consumers during her time in Congress.   This chart shows the decrease in enforcement actions which have  plummeted by 75 percent under the Office of Management and Budget  Director Mulvaney. Bear in mind that corruption and abuse of consumers  has not gone away. This is a time period when Wells Fargo--a perfect  example--robbed their customers, opened up fake accounts to basically  take the proceeds, used their--this is when customers went to Wells  Fargo, gave them all their information, Wells Fargo used their Social  Security numbers and data to open up fake accounts, so they could  charge their own customers--flat-out theft--and they had to fire 5,300  employees. That doesn't happen by accident. That is a business model  that is built on abusing the consumer.   That is why the CFPB is necessary, and that is why we need to pass  this bill today. I support the chairwoman's efforts in this regard.   A dramatic decline is evident, from 54 cases in the Obama  administration to 11 this year. The sheriff has basically left the  street. There is no more cop on the beat now with respect to protecting  the consumer.   Madam Chair, I thank the chairwoman for giving me this time to point  out the need for the Consumers First Act, a great bill.
