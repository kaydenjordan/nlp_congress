 Madam Speaker, I guess tomorrow we will find out if there  is anyone that Michael Cohen hasn't lied to. We already know he lied to  Congress. We already know he lied to law enforcement, lied to the IRS,  lied to three banks, and he is going to prison for his lies. So I guess  it will be relevant for us to determine: Does he lie to his own family?  Does he lie to his financiers? Does he lie to his financiers who are  members of his family?   It will be one heck of an inquiry for us because this is someone who  has tangled such a web of lies that he is not to be believed. I think  it is entirely appropriate for any Member of this body to challenge the  truthfulness, veracity, and character of people who have a history of  lying and have a future that undoubtedly contains nothing but lies.  That is the story of Michael Cohen.   We will see it play out tomorrow, and I for one can't wait to get to  the bottom of things and can't wait to get to the truth.                            ____________________
