 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  congratulate Mr. Wayne Haver, principal of Southside High School in  Fort Smith, AR. Mr. Haver will retire at the end of this school year  after 48 years of service to Fort Smith Public Schools.   Having started as a teacher at Southside in 1970, Mr. Haver has had a  long, distinguished career as an educator and administrator. He became  an assistant principal at the school in 1974 and, in 1982 was named  principal and has served in that role ever since.   Enrollment at Southside now stands at over 1,500 students, and the  community has witnessed how much the school has changed and grown under  Mr. Haver's guidance. Thousands of students have graduated from the  school during his tenure.   As principal for more than 35 years, some of those graduates have  returned as teachers and now work alongside an educator who served as a  mentor both while they were students and now as instructors. Southside  has also been recognized three times as a School of Excellence by the  U.S. Department of Education, a testament to Mr. Haver's leadership.   In 2013, Mr. Haver was named Administrator of the Year by the  National Association of Education Office Professionals. At the time, he  was only the second Arkansas educator to have received the award.   Upon his retirement, Principal Haver will be leaving an incredible  legacy of education and service to his community. He is only the second  principal Southside High School has ever had in its 55-year history. He  has spent his career devoted to education, seldom missing a day of  work. He is admired by his staff, who say he is an incredible man to  work for and will be greatly missed.   His musical ability has been cherished by students and faculty alike  and will be remembered fondly after he retires. He learned to play the  school's fight song on his harmonica, and his performances became a  fixture at pep rallies and other school events.   I congratulate Wayne Haver on a remarkable career and admire his  dedication to the students and families of Fort Smith and Southside  High School. As a native of Fort Smith, I am incredibly proud of  everything he has accomplished. His dedication and professionalism have  certainly helped to make the community a better place to live. I wish  him all the best in retirement and thank him for his countless  contributions to Southside High School.                            ____________________
