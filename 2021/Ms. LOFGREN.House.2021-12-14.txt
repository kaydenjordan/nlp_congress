Sadly and shockingly, Mr. Meadows has admitted he played both an  official and unofficial role in trying to overturn the results of the  2020 Presidential election.   He has also admitted that he has responsive and nonprivileged  documents and communications relating to January 6. In fact, he already  sent some of those materials to our select committee charged with  preventing a future attack on our Capitol. Now, the select committee  needs to speak with him about the full plot leading up to January 6.   For example, it has been reported that the White House was directing  the Department of Justice to investigate outrageous and really crazy  conspiracy theories to benefit Mr. Trump politically, as well as to  orchestrate the dissemination of election misinformation. We need to  talk to Mr. Meadows about this.   We have learned that Mr. Meadows made a surprise visit to a State-run  audit in Georgia, which led to the now-infamous call in which Mr. Trump  improperly asked the Georgia Secretary of State to find votes. We need  to talk to Mr. Meadows about that.   We also need to ask him about text messages which he provided to our  committee that show an official in Georgia texting Mr. Meadows during  the Trump-Raffensperger call saying that they ``need to end this  call,'' and emphasizing: ``I don't think this will be productive much  longer.'' We need to talk to Mr. Meadows about that.   We also know that during that same week in early January, Mr. Meadows  was in direct contact with campaign staff and organizers of the rally  at the Ellipse where his boss, the President, urged supporters to  fight. We need to talk to Mr. Meadows about that.   While domestic terrorists invaded the Halls where he used to work,  Mr. Meadows interacted with many people, including some of our  colleagues who were here in this Chamber. We have learned many of those  interactions took place on his personal device. We need to talk to Mr.  Meadows about that.   Clearly, Mr. Meadows has important information about events that  culminated in the violent attack on the Capitol and on our democracy.  He must follow the law. He must cooperate with the select committee's  lawful requests. No one is above the law. He must be held accountable  for his violation of the law.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 3377) to empower the Chief of the United  States Capitol Police to unilaterally request the assistance of the DC  National Guard or Federal law enforcement agencies in emergencies  without prior approval of the Capitol Police Board, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
