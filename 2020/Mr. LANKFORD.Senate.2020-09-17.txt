 Mr. President, a few days ago, Flight 971 took off from  Tel Aviv Airport. You may say: Of course the flight took off from Tel  Aviv; that happens every day--but not like this flight. You see, Flight  971 took off from Tel Aviv Airport, flew south, directly over Saudi  Arabia, which hasn't happened, and landed in Abu Dhabi because the  United Arab Emirates has formed a peace agreement with Israel-- recognizing its right to exist, opening up Embassies in Israel and in  the United Arab Emirates, beginning trade in commerce. Just days ago,  the first cargo aircraft took off and flew, taking supplies,  technology, medicine--engagement between the Nation of Israel and the  Arab nation of the United Arab Emirates, forming a new alliance in the  Middle East.   Flight 971 is significant because 971 is the country code if you are  going to call the United Arab Emirates. The return flight, by the way,  leaving from Abu Dhabi and flying back to Israel is Flight 972--the  country code for Israel.   That first flight that took off, on the outside of the plane were  emblazoned three words--one in English, one in Hebrew, and one in  Arabic--all translated, the word ``peace.''   It is a new day. And this week, when President Trump and the Foreign  Ministers from the United Arab Emirates and from Bahrain and the Prime  Minister of Israel all stood at the White House and spoke of each other  in a new partnership and then all sat at a table and signed documents  together, beginning a new relationship not just with UAE but also with  Bahrain, it was a remarkable day in world history.   In 70 years of Israel's history, only two nations that are Arab  nations have recognized Israel's right to exist, even--Jordan and  Egypt. In 1 day, two more nations joined--the UAE and Bahrain. It was  significant to be able to see the journey on that and to be able to  hear the Foreign Ministers of Bahrain and UAE compliment President  Trump, Mike Pompeo, and Jared Kushner for their leadership and, as the  Foreign Minister from Bahrain said, President Trump's statesmanship in  this process.   It was a negotiation that was turned on its head. For decades,  American negotiators have tried to work to solve the issues with the  Palestinians first and then to work to solve every other relationship  second. That has been the American focus. The Trump negotiations  reversed it. They believed that many in the Arab world were tired of  the Palestinians holding their foreign policy hostage, and they flipped  it and said: Why don't we start negotiating with the Arab world first  and see if they want to open up trade negotiations with Israel and be  able to stabilize those negotiations?   It has worked. Not only has it worked in two countries--in a single  day signing an agreement--but there are multiple other nations that are  currently looking at this same deal with Israel to say: Yes, we still  need to resolve the issues in the Palestinian territory. Yes, that is  still very important. But these nations can work toward peace and unity  together as they resolve their differences.   They signed a document dealing with relationships diplomatically, but  they also signed something they called the Abraham Accords Declaration.  Let me read this accord to you because it is significant. It begins  with this simple statement:         We, the undersigned, recognize the importance of       maintaining and strengthening peace in the Middle East and       around the world based on mutual understanding and       coexistence, as well as respect for human dignity and       freedom, including religious freedom.    That is a significant statement. Nations have spoken of religious  freedom, but it has not thrived there.   The document goes on to say:         We seek tolerance and respect for every person in order to       make this world a place where all can enjoy a life of dignity       and hope, no matter their race, faith, or ethnicity        We support science, art, medicine, and commerce to inspire       humankind, maximize human potential and bring nations closer       together.        We seek to end radicalization and conflict to provide all       children a better future.        We pursue a vision of peace, security, and prosperity in       the Middle East and around the world.    It was a document many people said would never be signed, but it is a  stake in the ground to say it is a new day in the Middle East in peace  negotiations and a pivot, as Prime Minister Netanyahu said.   Nations like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Amman, Morocco, Sudan, and  Lebanon should take notice and should see the benefit to economic trade  and engagement, to confronting Iranian influence in the area that tries  to destabilize so much of the Middle East, pushing back on terrorism,  and developing partnerships in science and health and technology and  prosperity for everyone in the region. That happened this week.                            ____________________     There is something happening on Monday that much of the  world has missed as well in the Middle East. For a year, there has been  a process ongoing to be able to confront Iran.  [[Page S5696]]  Iran has actively stated they are going to continue to pursue their  nuclear ambitions. They have actively stated they are going to pursue  weapons deals. They have actively stated they want to continue to break  the arms embargo.   Some of our allies have stood silent, but Iran has discussed  purchasing weapons of all types from all places. We used to be united-- regardless whether it was nuclear or not--that Iran should not continue  to accelerate that. As the largest exporter of terrorism in the world,  we should confront what Iran is trying to do--continue to provide heavy  arms.   As of Monday, the United States will move into a different mode with  Iran. As of midnight Sunday night, snap back sanctions begin on Iran on  Monday. And that is a different moment for us as a nation, to say we  have stated as a country, now through multiple Presidencies, that we  will not allow Iran to be a nuclear power or to continue to arm itself  in such a way to do its neighbors harm.   When snap back sanctions occur on Monday, all of our allies should be  aware that the United States is steadfast in that commitment. We would  ask you to join us in that as well.   Over the past few months, thousands of troops have come back home  from the Middle East--from Syria, from Iraq, from Afghanistan. By the  end of this year, we will have 4,500 troops still in Afghanistan; that  is from a high just a few years ago of 100,000 boots on the ground.   Ongoing negotiations for peace continue between Afghan leadership and  the Taliban. Those are problems that have existed for decades and in  some areas, generations.   While I don't believe Afghanistan will suddenly break out and be a  bastion of peace for the world, we do have a responsibility to help  them where we can but also an obligation to protect our sons and  daughters. Our blood and our treasures spilled in Afghanistan for  decades. We shouldn't lose the investment of that blood and treasure.  But it is good to see so many people coming home.   In Europe, a free-trade agreement is actively being negotiated with  the UK. We are pleased to be able to partner with such a special- relationship country like the United Kingdom. We have had a long- lasting friendship with them since we settled a little conflict in 1776  and another dustup in 1812. That special relationship with the UK  should continue on with a very good trade agreement.   I am pleased that the administration continues to push forward in the  area of trade--an area that it is amazing to me how many people didn't  even notice was the powder keg of Europe that just recently was  resolved.   For generations, the area around Serbia, Kosovo have been a hotbed  area for conflict.   In the past few weeks, the Trump administration has negotiated a  peace deal between Serbia and Kosovo that leaves Serbia to actually  officially recognize Kosovo. Again, that may not seem like a big deal  to many other people, but to Oklahomans--many of whom have served in  our 45th and who have served there in Kosovo, helping to protect and  stabilize that country and provide security there in that region--it is  very significant to us to be able to see peace breaking out between  Serbia and Kosovo.   I am pleased that, while many people in the world don't even pay  attention to what is happening in Serbia and Kosovo, the Trump  administration has, and their diplomatic team has been very engaged in  negotiating that and bringing to them some stability.   Interestingly enough, in the negotiations both Serbia and Kosovo also  agreed to designate Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization and  to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to be able to move  their embassies to Jerusalem, which is another affirmation of what is  happening in the Middle East in the string of what is ongoing.   One last comment that many people may have missed, we all grieve for  what is happening in Lebanon. That experiment in multiracial,  multifaith, and cooperative government has been a struggle, but they  have been a stronghold for religious tolerance in Lebanon. Watching the  hundreds of people who were killed and thousands who were injured in  the explosion at their docks in Beirut was painful for the entire  world. The United States has stepped up as being the top donor to  humanitarian aid to Lebanon during this time period, and we are  engaging in multiple ways.   At the end of the day, if we are going to help Lebanon be stable, we  have to help that experiment in democracy there in the Middle East to  be able to thrive with transparency.   I partnered with Senator Murphy and several other colleagues to help  set our Nation's priority to help Lebanon rebuild, including to utilize  the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, called the DFC,  to help them in their infrastructure projects; to push out China, which  is trying to work their way into the Middle East and dominate there; to  allow the people of Lebanon to decide their own future; to leverage  leadership in the International Monetary Fund to prevent multilateral  bailouts that don't allow for real reforms in their banking system; and  to push out corruption and push out Hezbollah.   There are things we can do that are not of a partisan nature on which  Senator Murphy and I cooperate together to be able to help push for  Lebanon. It is important that they continue to be a stable force in the  region. This is a real time of testing for them as a country. I am  proud the administration has pushed our diplomats in Lebanon to be able  to find ways where we can practically help now and long term for real  reforms for them. There is a lot going on around the world.   While we are focused on COVID, rightfully so for our own health,  while we focus on our economy, rightfully so, and while we focus on the  issues of racial inequality, rightfully so, we cannot lose track of the  issues we also need to be engaged in around the world. It is important  that America continue to be a leader in diplomacy and a leader in  bringing religious liberty and freedom and opportunity for all people.   Whether you are in Hong Kong, as we discussed before, or whether you  are in Abu Dhabi, all people deserve the recognition of their humanity  and respect and an opportunity to be able to live their lives with  freedom. Let's continue to stand for the values that define us and  define us together.   I yield the floor.
