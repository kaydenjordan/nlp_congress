 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Federal takeovers are being discussed in  both the House and the Senate this week. The Democrat leaders announced  that the Senate will once again be taking up legislation to put the  Federal Government, instead of the States, in charge of elections in  this country. Meanwhile, over in the House of Representatives, they are  expected to vote on legislation to eliminate essentially all State  restrictions on abortion, no matter how modest or how widely supported.   So what is up with all of these Federal takeovers? Well, Democrats  have been pushing election legislation--what they call H.R. 1, or the  For the People Act--for multiple years now. This radical legislation  would provide for a massive Federal takeover of our electoral system,  chill free speech, and turn the Federal Election Commission, which is  the primary enforcer of election law in this country, into a partisan  body, among other dangerous measures.   And the reason--the reason for this radical legislation? Well, as  even some Democrats have implicitly admitted, this legislation is  designed to make it easier for Democrats to win elections.   Fast forward to last week. With H.R. 1 unable to pass the Senate,  some Democrats produced a modified version of this legislation. It is  called For the People Act ``lite.''   And while I appreciate their efforts, unfortunately, as the  Republican leader said yesterday morning, ``This latest version is only  a compromise in the sense that the center left compromised with the far  left,'' or, as the Wall Street Journal editorial board put it this  morning, ``Calling this bill slimmed down . . . is like touting your  healthy choices after you order a Diet Coke with four Big Macs.''   The For the People Act ``lite'' would still impose troubling new  burdens on free speech; it would still undermine State voter ID laws;  it would still spend taxpayer dollars on political campaigns; it would  still make it easier for those here illegally to vote; and, most of  all, it would still put Washington, not State governments, in charge of  elections for no reason at all.   Let's be clear. There is absolutely zero reason to have the Federal  Government start dictating States' election policies--zero reason.  There is no systemic problem with State election laws, and State  election officials do not need Washington bureaucrats dictating how  many days of early voting they should offer or how they should manage  mail-in ballots.   This bill, like its parent H.R. 1, is a solution in search of a  crisis. States have been doing a fine job running elections. Even  Democrats have sort of had to admit that given the huge voter turnout  in the last election and the fact that Democrats won, albeit by the  slimmest of margins--even Democrats have had to admit that States are  doing a pretty good job running elections.   So now that they can no longer tell us that our electoral system is  broken, Democrats are telling us that we need election legislation like  this because States are passing legislation that will, Democrats claim,  threaten election access--baloney. It is just another attempt to  manufacture a crisis that will justify passing H.R. 1 or some variant.   Democrats are pushing election legislation for one simple reason:  because they think it will improve their chances in future elections.  That is not a good reason to bring up election legislation, and I will  continue to oppose any Federal takeover of elections.   South Dakota election officials are doing just fine without having  their every move dictated by Washington bureaucrats.                            ____________________     Meanwhile, Mr. President, over in the House, Members are  expected to consider legislation that would, as I said, preempt  virtually all State restrictions on abortion. Democrats are calling the  bill the Women's Health Protection Act. A more accurate name might be  the ``abortion on demand act'' or we could simply refer to it as what  it is--probably the most anti-life legislation ever to be considered in  the U.S. Congress.   This bill would eliminate pretty much any and every abortion  restriction in every State across the country: parental notification  laws, informed consent laws. Measures adopted by  [[Page S6600]]  States and upheld by the Supreme Court would disappear under Democrats'  legislation. The bill would also prevent States from restricting any  particular method of abortion, no matter how barbaric the method, and  the bill would make it essentially impossible to impose any meaningful  restrictions at all on abortion in any stage of pregnancy, including  after the point of fetal viability, when the baby can survive outside  its mother.   The bill would also jeopardize doctors' and nurses' right to refuse  to participate in abortions and specifically prevent them from having  recourse under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to protect their  conscience rights. It would put measures in place to ensure that any  State pro-life law would face an uphill climb in the courtroom. In  short, this legislation would make abortion on demand at any time, for  essentially any reason, the law of the land in the United States.   I hope--I really do hope--that during debate on this measure the  Democrats are not going to pretend that their proposed abortion law  somehow represents the prevailing sentiment of the country--because it  doesn't. The vast majority of Americans believe that there should be at  least some restrictions on abortion.   Gallup has been polling on abortion for decades, and in all that  time, the percentage of Americans who believe abortion should be legal  under any circumstances has always remained under 35 percent. In fact,  for most of the past several decades that number has remained squarely  under 30 percent.   A strong majority of Americans support at least some restrictions on  abortion. Furthermore, the Associated Press poll from this June found  that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortion should generally be  illegal in the second trimester, or from about 13 weeks of pregnancy,  while a whopping 80 percent--80 percent--of Americans believe that  abortion should generally be illegal in the third trimester.   And it is not surprising. Americans aren't dumb. And thanks to  ultrasounds and scientific advances and plain old common sense, they  know just how ridiculous it is to claim that unborn children are just  blobs of tissue. Most people are well aware that an unborn baby with  its own heartbeat and fingers and toes and DNA is, in fact, not a blob  of tissue but a human being.   And most people believe that human beings deserve to be protected,  even when they are small and weak and vulnerable--especially when they  are small and weak and vulnerable. And so it doesn't surprise me in the  least that 80 percent of the American people think abortion should  generally be illegal in the third trimester, because I can't imagine  anyone being comfortable with the idea of killing a baby who is not  only, like any unborn baby, a human being worthy of protection, but who  is actually old enough to survive outside of his or her mother.   And so, as I said, I really, really hope the Democrats are not going  to pretend that they are representing the American people with this  appalling legislation. They are not representing the American people.  They are representing the radical abortion lobby, and the radical  abortion lobby is terrified that, as it well knows, it does not have  the majority of the American people on its side. And so it is relying  on its Democrat allies to push for perhaps the most radical pro- abortion legislation ever considered.   The American people are better than this, and I would hope that the  Democratic Party would be better than this. The Democratic Party has  historically portrayed itself as the defender of the little guy. It is  unfortunate that that doesn't extend to the littlest guys and girls  among us: the unborn babies in danger of dying from abortion.   There are hundreds of thousands of abortions in the United States  every year. That is hundreds of thousands of innocent human lives lost.  Do we really need to remove even the most modest restrictions on  abortion?   While, unfortunately, the vast majority of the Democratic Party is in  the pocket of the radical abortion lobby, I hope that there are at  least some--some House Democrats--out there who aren't comfortable with  this bill in the Democratic Party's extreme abortion politics.   And I hope that these Democrats will stand up and oppose their  party's abortion-on-demand legislation. This anti-life legislation is  an abomination, and it should never, never make it out of the House of  Representatives.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds).
