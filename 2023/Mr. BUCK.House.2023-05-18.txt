 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 398, I call up  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 40) expressing support for  local law enforcement officers and condemning efforts to defund or  dismantle local law enforcement agencies, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 40.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 40 expresses our support for the brave men  and women who serve in law enforcement across our great Nation. These  individuals put their lives on the line every single day to protect our  communities and keep us safe, and it is time that we acknowledged their  selflessness and dedication.   Law enforcement officers are the backbone of our justice system. They  are the first line of defense against crime, and they work tirelessly  to ensure that our neighborhoods are safe places to live, work, and  raise families.   While most people fear danger and flee, police officers rush toward  the threat, and they do so without hesitation or reservation. They are  truly the embodiment of courage and bravery.   Unfortunately, over the past several years, we have seen an  unprecedented level of hostility toward law enforcement in this  country. The defund the police movement greatly fueled this hostility.   We have seen police officers subjected to unwarranted scrutiny,  harassment, and even violence. We have seen protests turn into riots  with law enforcement officers becoming targets of angry mobs. This kind  of behavior is not only unacceptable, but it is also dangerous and  destructive. It undermines the very fabric of our society and puts  innocent lives at risk.   As a former prosecutor, I am acutely aware of the vital role that law  enforcement plays in keeping our communities safe. I have seen  firsthand the sacrifices that these men and women make, and I am truly  grateful for their service.   That is why I am committed to doing everything in my power to support  our law enforcement officers and to ensure that they have the resources  and tools they need to do their jobs effectively. They are the unsung  heroes of our communities, and we owe them a debt of gratitude that  could never truly be repaid.   Let us work together to ensure that they have the support they need  to continue their important work and to keep our neighborhoods safe for  generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of  this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will mention in response to the gentleman from New  York's remarks about empty rhetoric, that this resolution says that  Congress recognizes and appreciates the dedication and devotion  demonstrated by the men and women of local law enforcement who keep our  communities safe and condemns calls to defund, disband, dismantle, or  abolish the police.   This is hardly empty rhetoric when we are thanking America's finest  for the work that they do to protect us.   I also appreciate the distinction that the gentleman tried to make  and the great difference that we have when Democrats across this  country called for defunding local police departments, they did so in  the face of rising crime.   What was the congressional response to the colleagues in various  parts of the country embarrassing Democrat Members in the House?   Of course, they did what Democrats do so well. They threw money at a  problem. They tried to cover up the embarrassment of defunding police  at a time when rising crime was occurring by throwing money at a  problem.   We are now faced with $31.5 trillion of debt because of strategies  like that, and we have to recognize that that no longer works.   Yes, there were Republicans who stepped up and voted knowing that the  vote might cause some commercials and some other issues about how they  don't support police, when the reality is that an overwhelming  percentage of police funding comes from local government--as it should.   Finally, the ranking member talks about how there have been efforts  with some of my colleagues to hold Federal agencies responsible for  their actions to make sure that Federal agencies don't overstep their  authority.   At one point in time, the civil libertarians in this country were on  that side of the aisle. Now it appears that the ATF, the FBI, and other  agencies can overstep their authority and not be held accountable. It  is a sad day when we can't come together and agree that this country is  stronger and better when we don't allow the Federal Government to spy  on our citizens, to interfere with political campaigns, and to  otherwise disrupt our normal life outside of their law enforcement  functions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I quote my good friend from the State of Washington.  ``Law enforcement as a whole has a culture of brutality that you cannot  deny if you look at all of these incidents. . . . Most of the  protesters are calling for a complete transformation of policing?''   To paraphrase, this reporter writes, Jayapal said that governments  should ``shift significant sums of money from police'' and put it in  other community-based programs.   I am happy to work with my friend and cosponsor a January 6  resolution of some type thanking the police officers.   Outside the door of my office in the Rayburn Building, there is a  ``Thank You, Capitol Police'' sign. There is a flag representing the  dedication that police officers have flying outside my door. I  absolutely thank the Capitol Police for their hard work.                                time  0945    Mr. Speaker, I do think we need to look at what the FBI, ATF, and  some other agencies have done in a fair, responsible, nonpartisan way  and address some of those issues. I actually think I probably will work  with my friend on this, also.   Some of my colleagues have started that process with an  appropriations angle. That is something I will look at. I may support  it. I may not. You may probably not. However, we have other ways to  deal with Federal law enforcement that have overstepped.   I also agree with my friend that an overwhelming percentage of  Federal law enforcement agents are great, hardworking people who  protect us from foreign terrorists and all sorts of violence in this  country, organized crime, other things that aren't dealt with as well  at the local level, and I appreciate what they have done.   The leadership in some of those agencies has gone astray, in my  opinion, and that is why we need to take a serious look at them, but I  thank my friend for her comments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to make one thing absolutely clear. There is not  a single Republican in the United States House of Representatives, to  my knowledge, that does not condemn the violent acts on January 6;  period, end of story.   If somebody wants to work on a resolution condemning the violence on  January 6, I welcome that and will work with them, but let's not talk  about January 6 when we are talking about a bill that is designated and  intended to compliment and uplift those who have been the targets of  really destructive action in terms of the defund the police movement.   I have heard my good friend from Washington--one of the leaders of  the Progressive Caucus here in the House--say that Progressives in the  House who we have quoted were not involved in that. That is fine.  However, certainly the leftists in this country moved to defund the  police. They succeeded.   As a result, we have seen rising crime, we have seen more victims,  and nobody on their side--nobody--takes accountability for the fact  that there are more murder victims, there are more robbery victims,  there are more people getting their cars hijacked, there are more  crimes being committed in this country as a result of failed leftist  policies.   If you want to talk about January 6, let's work together and thank  the Capitol Police. You want to talk about defunding the police, you  want to talk about how we need to uplift the police for their great  work, then we need to pass this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is highly disingenuous for my colleagues to  suggest that because this resolution doesn't thank all sorts of other  groups that we can't thank local law enforcement.   This resolution doesn't thank Governors. It doesn't thank Lieutenant  Governors. It doesn't thank secretaries of State. It doesn't thank  State attorneys general. It doesn't thank the generals and admirals at  the Pentagon. It doesn't thank the folks who are working so hard in the  cafeteria to provide us with food today. It doesn't thank a lot of  people.   It does thank local law enforcement, and for that we should unite.  For that, we should come together. For that, we should overcome these  ridiculous arguments and pat someone on the back.   Then let's work toward another resolution. Let's make sure we thank  those FBI agents who are working in the field, not the ones who planned  to dismantle our political system, but the ones who are working in the  field to protect us. Let's thank those ATF agents who are arresting  convicted felons who are in possession of a firearm. Let's thank them.  Let's thank Federal law enforcement. Let's thank the Capitol Police for  their great work on January 6.   Don't vote against this resolution thanking local police officers  just because it is not broad enough and doesn't include every single  category you can think of.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the words of my colleague from  New York, but I reiterate what this resolution is about and what it  says.   Congress recognizes and appreciates the dedication and devotion  demonstrated by the men and women of local law enforcement who keep our  communities safe and condemns calls to defund, disband, dismantle, or  abolish the police.   It is absolutely correct that this resolution doesn't include  everybody and everything. There will be time in this Congress where we  can work together to do that. To not pass this resolution, to not vote  for this resolution during police week is a slap in the face to local  law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I invite all the people who are watching today and all  Americans to tune in to the weaponization committee as they listen to  witnesses, whistleblowers from Federal agencies, talking about the  abuses in those Federal agencies.   It would be inappropriate, until we reach conclusions, until we pass  legislation protecting Americans and protecting our political process,  for us to take that extra step with Federal law enforcement.   I have said over and over, I absolutely respect the men and women who  are on the streets in Federal law enforcement protecting us. It is the  leadership that we have issues with at times. That is not in this  resolution. This resolution is a unifying resolution, and I hope my  friends on the other side of the aisle can join us in thanking local  law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back balance of my time.
