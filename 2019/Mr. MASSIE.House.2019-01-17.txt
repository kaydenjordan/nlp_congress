 Madam Speaker, for final passage of H.J. Res. 30,  disapproving of the President, I am not recorded because I was absent  on account of attending a U.S. Army Basic Combat Training graduation  ceremony.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 42.                            ____________________
