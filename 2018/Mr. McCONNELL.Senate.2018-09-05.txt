 Madam President, over the weekend, Senator McCain was  laid to rest at Annapolis. Our dear friend left a towering legacy of  service and sacrifice. As Senator Graham reminded us last week, while  none of us can hope to fill his shoes, we should all strive to follow  in his footsteps. Today, the great State of Arizona has sent us a  successor who is as well-equipped as you could imagine to do just that.   Our friend and former colleague, Senator Jon Kyl, is one of the most  serious, most expert, and most effective legislators with whom I have  had the pleasure of serving. In his 18 years of Senate service, he  forcefully defended the interests of Arizonans on issues local,  national, and international. He mastered the details of water and  natural resource issues. He became a go-to point person on missile  defense, nuclear modernization, strategy, and arms control. He built a  reputation as a steady and energetic public servant who put his State  and his country first.   On a point of personal privilege, I am glad we will have Jon back  with us. He has great judgment and an even keel. He is a team player, a  true friend, and an inspiring example of what a Senator can and should  be.   It is a good thing, too, because Congress has a lot to accomplish in  the coming weeks--like finalizing appropriations bills, completing our  consideration of Judge Kavanaugh, and confirming more of the  President's qualified nominees. It is going to be all hands on deck for  the American people. I could not be happier that this new, not-so- junior Senator from Arizona will be here to help us through this  period.                            ____________________     Madam President, speaking of continuing John McCain's  legacy, I am also happy that our colleagues on the Armed Services  Committee have officially chosen Senator Inhofe to serve as their next  chairman. Jim Inhofe filled in for Senator McCain during a difficult  year. He rose to the occasion and helped lead the committee in passing  crucial legislation that honored the example of his predecessor and the  volunteers who defend our Nation. He possesses rich experience on the  committee, including decades of work on behalf of American  servicemembers, as well as his own military service. Congratulations  and thanks to Senator Inhofe.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, the Senate  continues work on a number of important priorities. This morning, I  joined a number of our colleagues in the first conference committee  meeting for the farm bill, including the occupant of the Chair. Others  of our colleagues are continuing to confer with the House on  appropriations bills so we can stay on track with respect to funding  the government.   On the floor this week, we will continue attending to personnel  business. We voted yesterday to advance the nomination of Elad Roisman  to serve on the Securities and Exchange Commission. After we confirm  him, we will  [[Page S6036]]  turn to eight more qualified district court nominees.   Of course, the Nation turned its attention yesterday to the start of  Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings to serve as Associate Justice  of the Supreme Court. Those who tuned in heard about a well-respected  judge and well-respected professor with flawless judicial temperament  and integrity, someone who makes those around him better. They heard  these accounts from a former U.S. Secretary of State, a sitting U.S.  Senator, and a prominent liberal litigator with extensive experience  before the Supreme Court. From Judge Kavanaugh himself, they heard  about his guiding principles--among them, ``Interpret the Constitution  as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.''   In sum, the American people saw the impressive, talented, measured  jurist they have heard so much about. Unfortunately, the country also  saw disappointing displays of attempted partisan obstruction. The rude,  disrespectful, and boorish behavior we saw yesterday in the Judiciary  Committee was the confirmation hearing equivalent of an ``abolish ICE''  protest--the confirmation hearing equivalent of an ``abolish ICE''  protest right here in the Senate Judiciary Committee room.   Well, I guess we shouldn't be too surprised. The antics confirmed two  things that our Democratic colleagues have told us before: Their minds  are already made up--they have already made up their minds about the  Kavanaugh nomination--and they will try anything to stop it.   Democrats interrupted Chairman Grassley literally scores of times.  They treated the nominee rudely, even insulting the patriotism of this  devoted public servant and highly esteemed judge. They offered one  stale process complaint after another--completely ignoring the fact  that more documentation has been produced for Judge Kavanaugh's  nomination than for the last five Supreme Court nominations combined.   I guess our Democratic friends' coordinated plan was to throw a pot  of spaghetti at the wall and see if anything stuck. Nothing stuck.  Nothing stuck except the complete contrast between a gracious,  thoughtful, patient nominee and the hyperventilating by Senate  Democrats who are obviously not interested in giving Judge Kavanaugh  the fair consideration he deserves.   Half a million pages of documents, 12 years of opinions, the  testimony of peers and colleagues from across the political spectrum-- any Member who is actually willing to give Judge Kavanaugh fair  consideration has every tool they already need to do so.   I implore my friends across the aisle, let's put the partisan  theatrics behind us--it is rather embarrassing to see that in the  Senate--and continue these hearings with the dignity befitting the  serious task before us.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Madam President, I have a request for the Judiciary  Committee to meet during today's session of the Senate. I ask unanimous  consent that it be agreed to.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I would like to take a moment today  to congratulate the city of Edmonton, KY, for reaching an historic  milestone: its bicentennial anniversary. Throughout its 200 years, this  southcentral Kentucky community has developed a rich heritage, and its  weekend of celebrations this September is well deserved.   Edmonton was founded in 1818 and named after Edmund Rogers, who owned  the land and laid out the town. The community became the seat of  Metcalfe County at its formation in 1860. Today it is home to more than  1,500 Kentuckians, and Edmonton displays many of the best rural values  and traditions of our Commonwealth.   Following the opening ceremonies of the bicentennial celebrations at  city hall, there will be a parade throughout Edmonton, featuring floats  carrying schoolchildren. There will be a wide range of events,  celebrating the city's history and its promise for the future. From  beard contests to antique car shows and from bicentennial skits to  historical tours, there is something for everyone to enjoy.   The celebration will also feature a local talent showcase and a  performance by a hometown band, ``The Kentucky Headhunters.'' After the  show, attendees can watch a fireworks show to provide a fitting end of  the bicentennial celebration.   I would like to join Mayor Howard Garrett and everyone in Edmonton in  celebrating this occasion, and I would like to ask my Senate colleagues  to help me commemorate this bicentennial anniversary.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon,  Thursday, September 6; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; and that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate adjourn  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Manchin and  Inhofe.
