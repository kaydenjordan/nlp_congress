 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, agency guidance serves an important function in the  Federal regulatory system.   Agency guidance helps regulated parties and the public understand how  agencies will interpret the laws and administer their programs.   However, agency guidance can be--and has been--abused.   For example, agencies can use guidance documents to intimidate small  businesses and individuals into compliance with agency views, sometimes  under the threat of enforcement action.   Small businesses and ordinary individuals often do not have the legal  resources or necessary background to understand when an agency  statement is binding law.   It can be difficult for them to determine what agency statements must  be complied with versus what is merely a nonbinding description of an  agency's views on which they can push back.   Agencies have been known to try to start enforcement actions based on  mere guidance.   Agencies also have been known to attempt to issue binding rules by  quietly slipping what they intend to be rules in guidance documents.   This clearly bypasses the Administrative Procedure Act's requirements  that were put in place to protect regulated individuals and small  businesses.   The courts coined the term ``nonrule rule'' to describe this Big  Government sleight of hand.   And the courts have rightly struck down such rules that only appeared  in agency guidance.   The Guidance Clarity Act offers a simple solution to these problems.   It requires agency guidance documents to include the following  explicit statement: ``The contents of this document do not have the  force and effect of law and do not, of themselves, bind the public or  the agency.   ``This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public  regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.''   With that stroke of the pen, gone will be the days in which agencies  can use guidance documents to force small businesses and individuals to  comply with nonbinding agency views.   Gone, too, will be the days of agencies trying to issue nonrule rules  that bypass the Administrative Procedure Act's requirement for  legislative rules.   I thank the sponsor of the bill, the ranking member of the Small  Business Committee, Blaine Luetkemeyer, who has worked tirelessly on  this bill since it was first introduced.   I thank Chairwoman Maloney for her speedy efforts to help make  passage of this bill a bipartisan success.   And I also thank Senator James Lankford and Senate Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Chairman Gary Peters for their critical  efforts to achieve a bipartisan compromise on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer).    Mr. Speaker, thanks to the Guidance Clarity Act, small  business owners and individuals across the country will soon have  confidence that agency guidance, however helpful and clarifying it may  be, is not legally binding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this necessary  bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1170, which would name a  post office after Lieutenant Colonel Robert J. Friend, one of the last  surviving Tuskegee Airmen.   Lieutenant Colonel Friend was a fighter pilot for 2 years during  World War II, and destroyed critical Nazi military assets, bolstering  the United States. He also served in Korea and Vietnam.   After retiring from the military, he studied astrophysics and  business at the University of California, Los Angeles.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to name a post office in  Boulder, Colorado after Officer Eric Talley. Officer Talley served as a  police officer in Boulder for 11 years before being killed during a  mass shooting at a local grocery store, King Soopers, in Boulder,  Colorado, on March 25, 2021.   Officer Talley was the first police officer to arrive at the scene,  and one of ten individuals who would be killed that day. He left behind  a wife and seven children, who our hearts go out to.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill in honor of an American hero, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to name a post office  after the late Representative Benjamin Arthur Gilman.   Congressman Gilman was a Republican Member who represented New York  between 1973 and 2003. During his time in Congress, he served as the  chairman of the Committee on International Relations. He was also part  of the congressional delegation to the United Nations and a member of  the Ukraine Famine Commission.   In 2000, he helped establish the Benjamin A. Gilman International  Scholarship Program at the State Department. The scholarship provides  financial support to undergraduate students with limited financial  means so they can study or intern abroad.   Congressman Gilman was an important and impactful Member of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to name a Brooklyn, New  York, post office in honor of lifelong resident Joseph Lentol.   Joseph Lentol is a former New York Assembly member who followed in  the steps of his father and grandfather. He has been a strong advocate  for criminal justice reform, serving on the Governor's Commission on  Sentencing Reform, and is on the board of the New York State Public  Defenders Association.   Joseph serves as a role model to those in Brooklyn and beyond by  interacting with and supporting his local community.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to name a post office in  Winchester, Virginia, after Patsy Cline.   Patsy began singing and performing at events in the Winchester area  from a young age. Her childhood home in Winchester was designated as a  historic place in 2011 and draws visitors from around the world.   This post office would further honor the memory of her. Mr. Speaker,  I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of  my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I also heard a rumor that the  chairwoman of the committee will be singing a Patsy Cline song in her  closing.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H5696]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill which would name a post  office in Biloxi, Mississippi for Robert Stanton McKeithen.   After graduating from the University of Mississippi, McKeithen  enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. Following his military service, he  became a police officer in Biloxi. He was one of 13 Biloxi police  officers to earn the Medal of Valor for his rescue efforts following  Hurricane Katrina.   Sadly, after 24 years of service as a police officer, he was shot and  killed in the line of duty on May 5, 2019. He was only months away from  retirement. He left behind his wife, a daughter, two stepsons, and one  stepdaughter.   As a law enforcement officer, Robert McKeithen served his community  with honor, and I support naming a post office in his memory.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Palazzo).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill which would name a Kansas  post office after Captain Emil Kapaun, an Army chaplain during World  War II.   Captain Kapaun was an ordained Catholic priest and later served as an  auxiliary chaplain in the U.S. Army where he ministered to American  troops in the Burma and India theaters during World War II.   In 1950 he was mobilized to support the Korean conflict and was  captured by Chinese forces during the Battle of Unsan. As a POW he  helped find food, cared for the sick, and led prayers and spiritual  services for the other POWs. He died of illness and maltreatment on May  23, 1951.   In 1993 Pope John Paul II declared Captain Kapaun to be a Servant of  God, and he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President  Obama in 2013.   I want to thank my colleague and fellow Kansan, Congressman Tracey  Mann, for all his work on this project. Naming a post office after  Captain Kapaun is a small way we can honor this patriot and son of  Kansas for his service to our Nation. I might add that, as a Kansan, I  am very proud of this, but as a Catholic, as well. We hope that it is  soon Saint Kapaun.

Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill naming a post  office after Captain Emil Kapaun in Herington, Kansas--although he was  from Pilsen, a community of less than 100 people which has a beautiful  Catholic church but no post office--so a post office in Herington after  Captain Emil Kapaun.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would name an Ohio  post office for World War II veterans John Leahr and Herbert Heilbrun.   The Tuskegee Airmen in World War II were tasked with escorting  American bomber groups flying over enemy territory. I strongly support  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
