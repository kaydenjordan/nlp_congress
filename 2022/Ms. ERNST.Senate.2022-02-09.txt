 Mr. President, when the Biden administration ordered the  evacuation of families of U.S. diplomats from Ukraine last month due to  the increased threats of Russian military action and crime, a Ukrainian  official clapped back: ``Quite frankly these Americans are safer in  Kyiv than they are in [Los Angeles] . . . or any other crime-ridden  city in the U.S.''   Yes, that is what a Ukrainian official said. The comment really  struck a nerve because it may not be so far from the truth. In fact, an  L.A. Police Department detective says the out-of-control crime in the  city is ``so violent, we're telling people `don't visit,' because we  don't think we can keep you safe right now.'' The city was surrendered  to criminals by the L.A. district attorney on his first day on the job  in 2020 when he banned bail and prohibited prosecuting even the most  serious crimes, like murder and rape, to the fullest extent of the law.   The consequences of giving ``get out of jail free'' cards to  criminals shouldn't surprise anyone. Flash mobs of thieves breaking  into local businesses are giving new meaning to ``door busters'' as  they ransack city stores like bargain shoppers on Black Friday.   Looters are robbing trains like it is the Wild West, making off with  millions of dollars' worth of merchandise, including pistols and  shotguns. A Union Pacific Railroad official says that even when  apprehended, criminals boast that they will face no serious charges,  and within hours, they are let back out on the streets.   But most troubling, over the past 2 years, Los Angeles has  experienced a shocking 94-percent increase in homicides. The L.A.  sheriff says it is probably one of the biggest jumps ever, and he lays  the blame on the woke policies of both the district attorney and the  county board.   These senseless acts of violence aren't confined to liberal Los  Angeles, and neither is the revolving-prison-door approach that is  allowing career criminals to roam our streets. The U.S. murder rate hit  its highest point in a quarter of a century last year. More and more  felons are being released across the country as a result of permissive  policies being pushed by progressive politicians and lenient district  attorneys who view punishment as the real crime.   Democrats in New York, for example, recently pushed through a State  law requiring the release of suspects arrested for stalking, arson,  robbery, and other misdemeanors without bail. They require the release  without bail. And despite the dramatic increases in crime in New York  City, a Democrat district attorney released a list of crimes--I am  serious about this, folks--released a list of crimes on his first day  in office that would no longer be prosecuted, including resisting  arrest. The DA claims longer sentences don't deter crime or result in  greater community safety.   But a former New York City police commissioner points out the  obvious--that when you say you are not going to prosecute certain  crimes, you are sending a strong message to criminals. And it is the  wrong message to criminals. He notes that since the penalty was taken  away, stealing a car has become a game. As a result, vehicle theft is  driving up the city's crime rate, and the New York Post reported just  last week that the Big Apple is becoming a live action version of the  game Grand Theft Auto.   But the wave of crime that has been unleashed is far more deadly than  just stolen property. New York City's murder rate spiked an astounding  47 percent last year, and the killing spree is continuing into 2022.  The latest victims include a teenager who was working at Burger King  and two young police officers.   Refusing to keep dangerous, repeat criminals with a history of  violence behind bars allows anyone, at any time, to become the victim  of an entirely preventable crime.   For example, the low bail set by a Wisconsin District Attorney's  Office last November resulted in the release of a violent criminal with  a very long list of charges going back 15 years, including running over  a woman with a Ford Escape. Within days of being released, he drove  that same SUV into a crowded Christmas parade, injuring more than 60  people and killing 6, including a 5-year-old child and several members  of the Dancing Grannies, who were entertaining the crowds at that  Christmas parade. In a split second, the joy of the season was turned  into a gruesome crime scene because a violent, repeat offender was set  free. The Democrat district attorney has since admitted the release was  ``a mistake.''   Folks, we cannot afford any more of these mistakes by public  officials who are putting their personal political agenda ahead of  protecting our public.   If letting criminals out of jail without bail isn't bad enough,  progressive politicians are even--get this--providing perks for  perpetrators. The Biden administration, for instance, is allowing  illegal immigrants to use arrest warrants as alternate forms of ID at  airports to clear security checkpoints and board airplanes--arrest  warrants. Seriously, folks.   Some liberal cities, like New York and San Francisco, have cash for  criminals, programs that actually pay prior offenders in the hopes that  they won't shoot anyone. Great plan. That is right--the same gang  calling to defund the police wants to fund felons.   A California cash for criminals program may have allowed some  individuals to get away with murder. As long as the participants pledge  to improve, they are still paid. Even when caught with a gun or, worse,  suspected of murder, they get paid.   Folks, it is one thing to give first-time, nonviolent offenders a  second chance, but rewarding career criminals by letting them loose and  paying them an allowance is itself criminal.   Democrats' approach to criminal justice can be summed up as ``take no  prisoners'' literally.   Instead of admitting their approach has backfired, liberals keep  looking for excuses, and they play the blame game. To address the rise  in carjackings in Chicago, for example, progressive politicians  proposed banning the video game Grand Theft Auto. Perhaps the real  problem is making crime all fun and games, with no real-world penalties  and only rewards, just like the video game.   A retired police officer who was carjacked in his own driveway south  of the city says the carjackers know that even if they are caught,  ``they are going to get right back out.'' That is because the area's  State attorney promised to reduce the prison population, and by golly,  she is keeping that promise by dismissing tens of thousands of criminal  cases. As a result, about 100 people charged with murder in Cook County  have been let out on the city streets.   The Chicago police superintendent is even warning that the Cook  County court is ``making us all less safe by releasing violent  offenders.'' The horrifying numbers speak for themselves.   Chicago had more murders last year than any other city in the United  States with nearly 800 homicides. That is more people than in the small  community I grew up near--800 homicides.   Shootings in the city are up a shocking 63 percent since 2019. One of  the fatal victims was a 7-year-old girl who was gunned down at a  McDonald's by a gang member who was allowed out of prison despite being  charged with other crimes. The suspects in another recent shootout,  which left one dead and two others wounded, were released without  charges.   Public officials charged with enforcing the law who signal that it is  OK to commit crime by reducing or eliminating penalties are engaging in  criminal negligence. It is time to put an end to prosecutors being  partners in crime.   I took the first step towards making our streets safer by introducing  legislation to increase the penalties for some  [[Page S591]]  violent offenders and child predators, including life imprisonment for  repeat offenders.   Folks, progressive prosecutors need to stop playing politics and  start doing their job, which is enforcing the law. Criminal penalties  are not just suggestions; they are put in place to protect the public.  Parents shouldn't have to worry about the safety of their children, and  no one should feel unsafe, especially in their own neighborhood.   Let's get serious about crime so that the only people in America who  are afraid to walk the streets are the criminals.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Therese  Giles, a devoted public servant who tirelessly served our Nation with  distinction in the Department of the Navy for almost four decades.  Therese recently retired on December 31, 2021, after a successful 37- year government civil service career as an honored and distinguished  senior flight controls computer scientist.   Therese's remarkable career and her immeasurable contributions to our  national security can be categorized by so many unbelievable ``firsts''  and by a lifetime of selfless service.   As a child, Therese was always intrigued with the next technological  offering--from watching NASA put the first man on the Moon, to the  advances in next generation communications, to the invention of the  integrated core processer. Inspired by these ``firsts,'' she pushed to  be one of the firsts in her class, team, and field, carrying a life's  dream of making a difference in the technical field where women were  very scarce and disappointingly undervalued.   At a time when women weren't encouraged to pursue technical careers  and weren't thought of as computer scientists, Therese pushed forward  and persevered to achieve undergraduate and advanced degrees in  mathematics and computer science.   Wanting to be part of something bigger than herself, Therese found  her calling with the Navy's aviation research and development command.  As a junior software computer scientist in the mid-1980s, she was  instrumental in developing the innovative, first-ever, advanced digital  flight controls architecture that revolutionized the way all Navy and  Marine Corps jet aircraft operated.   Therese was also instrumental in resolving the catastrophic failures  of the V-22 Osprey in the early 1990s and generating the software  solutions that eventually returned the V-22 to flight and to the  successful combat operations of today.   With similar accomplishments across the F-14, A-6, F-18, E-2, and the  F-35 spectrum of aircraft, Therese directly contributed and helped  develop the flight control and safety control systems of the majority  of every naval aircraft from 1985 to current day.   Throughout these many successes and ``firsts,'' Therese has remained  committed to supporting and inspiring the next generation of young  women in STEM fields. Serving as an avid mentor, teacher, and leader of  the people around her, Therese has been a North Star role model for  generations of up-and-coming young women to follow their dreams and  become technical leaders in public service.   In addition to her thirst for discovery and problem solving, a  primary reason for Therese's tenacious focus is that she had personal  ``skin in the game'' when it came to our Nation's security. Four of  Therese's siblings proudly served in our Nation's military: Therese's  brothers VADM Mat Winter, USN; CDR Tom Winter, USN; Capt. Steve Winter,  USMC; and sister CDR Elizabeth Winter Scruggs, USNR, all put their  lives in harm's way during their military careers to ensure our  Nation's security. Therese's husband, Tim, is himself a retired member  of the government civil service and an Army veteran. This is a family  where duty and service run deep.   Therese, as you and your family celebrate your well-deserved  retirement, I congratulate you and thank you for almost four decades of  unbelievable and lasting impact. I thank you for the many years of  sacrifice you and your family have made in service to our Nation. I  join my colleagues in the Senate and all Americans in expressing our  sincere appreciation and wish the very best for you, your husband, your  son Eric, and daughter Meghan on your next exciting chapter.                            ____________________
