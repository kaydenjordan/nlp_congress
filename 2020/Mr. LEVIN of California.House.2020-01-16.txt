 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lee for  yielding and for her leadership on this critical issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this legislation,  which reverses actions by Betsy DeVos that would deny debt relief to  students defrauded by predatory colleges.   Over recent years, we have seen for-profit colleges like Corinthian  and ITT Tech collapse, leaving students in my district and across the  country with crushing debt and none of the job opportunities that they  were promised.   These students were defrauded, plain and simple, and they have been  left holding the bag, thanks to Betsy DeVos' refusal to implement an  Obama-era rule that provides defrauded students with relief and helps  them move forward with their lives.   Instead, DeVos rewrote the rule to make it harder for borrowers to  get relief, severely restricted how much relief they can receive, and  shifted the costs of providing debt relief from predatory schools to  the taxpayers.   DeVos is putting the interests of predatory for-profit schools above  students, and it is wrong. We should always put students first, and  many of them are waiting on Betsy DeVos to do the right thing.   As of last month, 240,000 defrauded students, including more than  41,000 students in California, are still waiting for DeVos to take  action on their claims for debt relief. Many of these students can't  afford to enroll in another school without the debt relief they are  owed. They can't move on with their lives because Betsy DeVos is  dragging her feet. That is simply not fair.   We must pass this legislation to stop DeVos from making it even  harder for defrauded students to get the relief they desperately need.   Ultimately, we must do much more to help stop schools from defrauding  students and taxpayers in the first place.
