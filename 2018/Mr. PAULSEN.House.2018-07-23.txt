 Mr. Speaker, human trafficking hurts women and children  all around the world. Sadly, the United States is no exception.   As many as 300,000 American children are at risk of child sexual  exploitation. It is happening in every community around the country.  Every weekend in Minnesota, as many as 45 Minnesota girls are sold for  sex.   But there is good news. The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, a new  law which was passed with bipartisan support earlier this year to crack  down on websites that facilitate trafficking, is making a difference.  Backpage.com, the single largest online source of sex trafficking has  now been shut down by Federal law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, July 30 marks World Day against Trafficking in Persons.  It is another opportunity to raise awareness and also redouble our  efforts in the fight against traffickers and helping victims.                            ____________________
