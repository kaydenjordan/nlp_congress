 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize fallen Johnson  County Deputy Sheriff Tim Guyer, who passed away at Indiana Law  Enforcement Academy last month.   Deputy Guyer was training at the academy and set to graduate just 2  weeks after he passed. We will never forget his service and sacrifice  to our Indiana community, and I extend my deepest condolences to his  loved ones.                    Rural Healthcare in Rushville, Indiana     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about my recent visit  to Rush Memorial Hospital in Rushville, Indiana. During the visit, we  discussed the current state of rural healthcare and what can be done to  improve it.   I also got to meet and speak with the outstanding stat flight team,  who deliver timely and critical care to those in need throughout the  southern Indiana district.   I really enjoyed my visit to the hospital and thank the entire team  at Rush Memorial Hospital for all they do and for their hospitality.                        Put America's Interests First     Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concern  with President Biden's decision to hand over $6 billion to Iran, the  largest sponsor of terrorism, as part of a ransom deal on the  anniversary of 9/11.   September 11 is a day where we should be remembering the Americans  who lost their lives, honoring our first responders, and praying for  the families who lost a loved one. The Biden administration's decision  to broker a deal with terrorists on 9/11 is tone deaf, shameful, and  desecrates the day.   Additionally, this deal emboldens our enemies, puts our Nation's  safety and security at risk, and will ultimately fund anti-American  terrorist activities. It is time for President Biden to stand up to our  adversaries and put America's interests first.                      Serving Veterans in Shelby County     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the opening of  the new Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in Shelbyville, Indiana.   The clinic offers primary and mental health care, optometry services,  and physical therapy.   I thank the VA, the director of Veteran Health Indiana, Michael  Hershman; the dedicated onsite clinical team; and Shelbyville Mayor Tom  DeBaun for their efforts in getting this new facility open to serve  Hoosier veterans throughout Shelby County and beyond.                Slow Down Electrification-or-Nothing Approach     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about my takeaways  from a roundtable I attended with Hoosier stakeholders in Franklin,  Indiana.   At the roundtable, research universities such as Purdue University  and Vincennes University, along with the State of Indiana parking and  mobility experts, and EV charging station developers joined together in  Indiana's Sixth District to share lessons learned and best practices  for the electrification policy.   We also discussed why the current timelines and excessive regulations  of the Biden administration are far ahead of what is possible,  practical, and of course affordable. This roundtable just further  proved that it is time for the Biden administration to slow down their  electrification-or-nothing approach.                          Electric Grid Reliability     Madam Speaker, I rise today to share my concerns about our  Nation's electric grid reliability.   Our electric grid is on an unsustainable path, and if we do not  change our direction now, we could be heading toward a catastrophic  failure in the future. In fact, this month, for the first time ever,  NERC has identified certain energy policies as the major threat to our  grid's reliability. These policies include increased usage of electric  vehicles, as well as reliance on wind and solar energy.   Yet, the Biden administration and far-left Democrats continue to try  to push their rush-to-green energy agenda and force electrification of  everything from cars to stoves. It is past time for this administration  to face reality and put our Nation on a sustainable path forward to  ensure the American people are able to keep their lights on.  [[Page H4414]]                                    EPA's PM2.5 Rule     Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise my concerns about the  command and control regulations in EPA's PM2.5 rule. These regulations  will only hurt Indiana's electric reliability, raise costs on Hoosier  businesses, and hinder economic growth in our State.   Additionally, at a time when companies are looking to re-shore  domestic manufacturing, this rule serves as a detriment to new  investment. Overall, this rule is bad for Hoosiers and for all  Americans.                            ____________________
