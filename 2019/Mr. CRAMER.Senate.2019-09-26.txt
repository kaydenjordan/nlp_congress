 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  legacy of Wimmer's Diamonds, which this month is celebrating a century  of doing business in Fargo.   Throughout these years, this fourth-generation jewelry store has been  a mainstay in downtown Fargo. It has grown along with the city, adding  a second location at West Acres Mall in 1985.   The business began as the Fargo Jewelry Manufacturing Company,  founded by Fred Wimmer, a Hungarian immigrant who arrived in New York  City in 1907. He began working in America at Tiffany & Co. as an  engraver. He moved West 3 years later, continuing his work in  Minneapolis and Owatonna, Minnesota, for 6 more years before arriving  in Fargo in 1919.   In the years since, the Wimmer family has designed, sold, and  serviced diamonds to customers throughout the region. The  responsibility for keeping the business going has been passed on from  Fred to his son, Art, then to grandson Andy, and on to the current  generation of owners, Brad Wimmer and his son, Aaron.   Likewise, Wimmer's Diamonds has been a destination for generations of  customers, who have looked to it as a trusted partner when occasions  call for a gift of diamonds and fine jewelry.   In a time when there are fewer family-owned businesses, Wimmer's has  been successful by adapting to the changes of retail management and  customer preferences. It has been long established as a valued member  of the community, giving back over the years in every way possible.   I congratulate the entire Wimmer family for a century of business in  Fargo. Wimmer's Diamonds is testament to the importance of small  businesses in communities of all sizes across the Nation and the impact  entrepreneurs have on our American economy.   You have enhanced the quality of life we treasure in North Dakota and  have set a very high bar for being a dedicated community partner. Thank  you for all you have done to enhance the happy occasions in the lives  of your customers, and I hope you will remain part of our celebrations  for many years to come.                            ____________________
