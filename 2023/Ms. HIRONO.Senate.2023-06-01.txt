 Mr. President, later this month, on June 14, we  will welcome Hawaii businesses to our Nation's Capital for the seventh  annual Hawaii on the Hill. These businesses will have an opportunity to  hear from government leaders, Federal officials, policy experts, and  others about the important issues facing small businesses and  entrepreneurs in the United States. The businesses will also have an  opportunity to showcase their products and share what we have to offer  from the Aloha State.   Since the inaugural event in July 2014, Hawaii on the Hill has been  very successful. But such success would not be possible without the  dedication, commitment, and hard work of business owners from our  State, who make this event possible every year. We are excited to  welcome them back to Washington, DC, for the first time since the  pandemic. Recognizing this dedication, I would like to acknowledge one  particular business owner who has been with us since the very  beginning: Mabel Hashisaka, of Kauai Kookie.   Mabel's story is pretty remarkable. Her father immigrated from Japan  to Hawaii in 1905. She was born in Lihue, Kauai, and graduated from  Waimea High School in 1946. At a time when many girls did not go to  college, Mabel attended the University of Hawaii, earning a bachelor's  degree in psychology, and then attended Indiana University, where she  graduated with a master's degree in education. She was then a school  teacher on Hawaii Island for many years.   In 1965, she decided Kauai needed more ``omiyage''--or gifts that  visitors could bring back to share with their family and friends--so  she started Kauai Kookie. She began by making chocolate macadamia nut  shortbread cookies and serving them on the side of plate lunches at the  Big Save grocery store that her father owned. The cookies gained  popularity, and soon, customers were coming in just for the cookies.  Mabel purchased a used stove and oven from another Hanapepe business  for $100 and hired a few employees. Kauai Kookie was born.   More than 50 years later, Kauai Kookie remains a Kauai community  staple. During the pandemic, the company delivered food to families in  need with their ``Souper Sundays'' program and provided ``Kookies for  Heroes'' to first responders on the front line.   Kauai Kookie now bakes over 50,000 cookies and other baked goods each  day and also offers salad dressings and marinades. It has two locations  on Kauai, the original factory in Hanapepe and the bakery and cafe in  Kalaheo. Kauai Kookie products can be found throughout Hawaii, in  specialty stores in the continental United States, and overseas. The  products are made with some of the finest ``Made-In-Hawaii'' products  like macadamia nuts, Kona coffee, and Kauai Makaweli poi. Kauai Kookies  originally came in eight island flavors--Kona Coffee Macadamia,  Chocolate Chip Macadamia, Peanut Butter, Guava Macadamia, Coconut  Krispies, Cornflake Crunch, Macadamia Nut Shortbread, and Almond--but  have since expanded to many more varieties and flavors.   Mabel claims that she is not a baker and that her philosophy has  always been to hire someone smarter than her to help with the business.  But despite her humble approach, it is clear she has built something  truly impressive that has an important place in the community. Today,  she still lives on Kauai with her husband Norman and her two daughters  Ann and Ruth, who lead the company. So even to this day, her legacy  continues.   Mahalo, Mabel, for your contributions to our State as a recognized  business leader. You continue to inspire all of us to ``just do  it.''                            ____________________
