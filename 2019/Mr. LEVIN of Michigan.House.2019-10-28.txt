 Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  the Dignity in Aging Act. As vice chair of the House Education and  Labor Committee, I am honored to be a part of this bipartisan effort to  respond to the challenges facing a generation of aging Americans.   I'm also proud that this package includes my bill, the Supporting  Family Caregivers Act, which will facilitate the assessment of in-home  caregivers' needs to determine what resources would help them provide  care. I want to thank Congresswoman Elise Stefanik for partnering on  this bipartisan legislation to support in-home caregivers.   Americans across the country rely on family caregivers, whose  contributions range from bathing and dressing their loved ones, to  coordinating care across multiple health care providers, to managing  the payment of household and medical bills, and more. Each year, this  adds up to roughly $470 billion in unpaid care provided by 40 million  family caregivers.   I believe one of the best ways to improve home health care is to  protect the health and wellbeing of the caregivers who provide it. The  Supporting Family Caregivers Act encourages the use of assessments to  identify caregivers' individual needs and challenges, thereby allowing  services to be targeted to each person more effectively and  efficiently. Although resources are currently available to family  caregivers, direct feedback through assessments would improve the  quality of the support they receive.   I am so pleased to see this body take a needed step towards more  person- and family-centered care. Again, I am grateful to my partner on  this bill, Congresswoman Stefanik, as well as Chairman Scott, Ranking  Member Foxx and Dignity in Aging Act sponsor Bonamici for their  support.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting America's seniors, and  to vote for the Dignity in Aging Act.
