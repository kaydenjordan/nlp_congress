 Mr. Speaker, this is truly an interesting time, which  takes me back to the alleged Chinese curse that may you live in  interesting times. Well, we are living in interesting times.   Growing up hearing the term ``pot calling the kettle black,'' it is a  colloquialism. Another term, and I brought this up years ago here on  the House floor, about gaslighting, we certainly seem to be  experiencing some of that these days and have for some time.   But to have the Secretary of Homeland Security, who seems to be an  intelligent person, come and testify under oath with a straight face  that the border is secure and not be satisfied with that but refer to  the Trump administration as having dismantled the immigration system,  the ability to secure the border, when exactly the opposite is what was  occurring and exactly the opposite of what is occurring now.   It is not secured. All you have to do is go look. I mean, it is  incredible, but it is said so often, including by people on the  committee of oversight for Border Patrol, the Judiciary Committee.   Having spent so much time down on the border, I like to be there late  at night when there is an awful lot of movement normally across the  border illegally, but I experienced under the most closed  administration, the least forthcoming administration since I have been  in Congress since January 2005. In fact, they zoomed up Border Patrol  cars to prevent me from getting to the border to see how bad it was.   I was able to go around one night and get back to the border through  the local park down south of McAllen, but that was no thanks to the  Border Patrol that, in the past, most of them knew that I was their  friend and asserted on their behalves because they were not being  treated fairly and properly, especially during the Obama  administration.   But it is important for any Member of Congress to be able to get to  the border unimpeded. Now Secretary Mayorkas says he looked into it and  couldn't find anyone who had ever directed that a Member of Congress,  me in particular, was not to be allowed to get to the border.   So, I look forward to using his testimony under oath and seeing who  now will try to prevent me from getting to the border.   They will let you go as long as you give them time to set up a dog- and-pony show and have time to restrict the area that they are going to  allow you to see, but that is not the way you do oversight.   When I was a judge, I would just show up at a prison, a jail, a  halfway house, different places. If I was going to send somebody to a  place, I wanted to be able to see how they were being treated without  warning.   I still think that is a good idea. Of course, we know the Washington,  D.C., jail out east of town where so many January 6 defendants were  being held, they wouldn't let us in, not to visit, not for any reason.  It really has been astounding.   Marjorie Taylor Greene and I were finally allowed to get in there,  and we hope to do that again soon because we are hearing more stories  of abuse.   I got a letter in response from the U.S. marshal whom I asked to go  do a health and safety visit regarding Ryan Nichols. As I understand  the letter, they called over and got information from people who had  deceived some of us before, and the U.S. marshal seemed quite satisfied  with that without bothering to see for himself.   It is rather unfortunate because the U.S. marshal did an inspection  last September or October, I believe it was October, and found that  hundreds of the inmates were not being properly treated and needed to  be transferred out. So, hopefully, the U.S. marshal will get back to  doing the job of the U.S. marshal.   The law, the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court for a  couple of centuries, has made clear you are not allowed to punish  people in pretrial confinement.   Just as the FISA court has shown no pride and no protection of their  court and authority, they have demonstrated that they don't mind being  lied to by lawyers. They don't mind having fraud upon the court because  it is a secret star chamber.   I had hoped that when FISA judges found out they had been manipulated  and lied to that they would have enough integrity that they would be  upset about being lied to. But, apparently, because of the lack of  contempt, the lack of show cause hearings as to why contempt was not  appropriate, the lack of prosecution by the Department of Justice going  after people within the justice system, I have come to the conclusion-- I hoped we could save the FISA court, but apparently, it does not  appear that that is going to be possible.   Our Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has not had enough concern  about lies being perpetuated, fraud being perpetuated on the FISA  court, that he, as far as we know, has not done anything about that  because certainly no one is punished, not even for perpetuating lies in  order to spy on the campaign and even the Presidency after the person  they were spying on and trying to prevent from winning the election won  the election.   It is a very disturbing time for those of us who have spent much of  our adult lives in the State and Federal justice system trying to see  that justice was done. It is a very disturbing time.   Going back to the term ``gaslighting,'' we are told that we are  crazy. We are making stuff up. I know with regard to the 2020 election,  people continued to repeat the untruth that  [[Page H4962]]  there was no fraud in the 2020 election when most every election that  has ever been did have fraud, did have improprieties. It is just a  question of how much.   But it is John Fund that wrote a book on election fraud, quite good,  some years back. As pointed out before, the biggest fraud about  elections is saying there is no fraud in elections.   When Congress made the inappropriate step of mandating electronic  voting back after the unfortunate situation in Florida, where even  though fifth graders were shown to be able to utilize the butterfly  ballots quite effectively, we had Democrat voters that were not able to  figure them out. Perhaps another visit to fifth grade might have helped  them before they voted.    That is why we were told we had to upend our election system in the  United States and go to electronic voting. Many of us are hoping we  will get back to paper ballots because we have seen, although people  were gaslighting and saying: ``Oh, no, no. These machines do not  connect to the internet.'' Then we find out that when there was a  problem with a voting machine, they would contact one of the hired guys  that would use their iPad, get on the internet, and fix a voting  machine without actually being in its presence.   That is using the internet. Yet, we were gaslighted and told even  though it was going on, it wasn't going on.   Just to remind people who are not familiar with the term  ``gaslighting,'' I thought the 1944 movie with Ingrid Bergman is a  great movie. I have watched it more than once. Her husband was making  her think she was going crazy or was crazy when she wasn't at all. He  was being evil. This from Medical News Today says: ``Gaslighting is a  form of psychological abuse where a person or group makes someone  question their sanity, perception of reality, or memories. People  experiencing gaslighting often feel confused, anxious, and unable to  trust themselves.''   ``The term `gaslighting' derives from the 1938 play and 1944 film  ``Gaslight,'' in which a husband manipulates his wife into thinking she  has a mental illness by dimming their gas-fueled lights and telling her  she is hallucinating.''                                time  1330    The article goes on to give different examples. It says that  gaslighting often develops gradually, making it difficult for a person  to detect.   According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, techniques a  person may use to gaslight someone include countering. Countering  describes a person questioning someone's memories. They may say things  such as: ``You never remember things accurately'' or ``Are you sure?  You have a bad memory.''   Another technique is withholding. When someone withholds, they refuse  to engage in a conversation. A person using this technique may pretend  not to understand someone so that they do not have to respond to them.  For example, they might say: ``I do not know what you are talking  about'' or ``You are just trying to confuse me.'' I would submit that  withholding can include when being asked for information, for evidence,  that being withheld and in return being told: ``No, there is nothing  there.''   It comes to mind back when Jeff Sessions was the Attorney General,  some of us had concerns about a matter that needed to be investigated,  and we knew that there was a person of integrity who had a notebook  full of documentation, many of which documents could quite easily  constitute an offense under Federal law. That was pointed out that,  gee, this needs to be investigated; this person needs to be talked to.   Eventually, this incredibly competent person was contacted by an FBI  agent, after the Secretary of the Department of Justice asked them to  take a look. The FBI contacted her and told her to come for a visit and  under no circumstances was she to bring her notebook that contained  valuable evidence of apparent wrongdoing. When she arrived, she was  grilled for 2 hours. She did as she was instructed by the FBI and  didn't bring her notebook of documents.   Then when Secretary Sessions asked about the matter, he was told:  ``Yeah, we looked into it. We talked to her. She didn't have  anything.'' Well, that is a form of gaslighting. You direct a witness  not to bring the documentation she has and then tell your boss: ``Yeah,  we talked to her. She didn't have anything.'' Well, you told her not to  bring the evidence.   So these kinds of things, unfortunately, still go on. I can't help  but suspect that when Bill Barr said there was no fraud in the  election, he was relying on people, like Jeff Sessions did, when he was  lied to, because obviously Bill Barr didn't go out and do an  investigation personally; he relied on people perhaps he should not  have relied on.   How do we know that anybody at the FBI would lie? Well, we found out  it was even done before a Federal judge or Federal judges. The other  shoe is yet to drop on all of that.   But something has got to be done. We can't have a star chamber system  where judges are lied to. Clearly, when the judges don't care--they  have got lifetime appointments--that is one thing. But then when their  adjudications, their hearings, are in secret, they have a layer of  anonymity that protects them from being judged and ridiculed for either  stupidity, naivety, or just dishonesty. Whatever it is, it is not  right. That is why our court system was required to be public  originally.   But as we see these fundamental foundational principles being removed  in the last decades, recent decades, it ought to be a warning, it ought  to be a red light flashing, bells going off, ``Danger, danger, Will  Robinson.'' This is serious stuff, and it needs to be looked into.   According to this article, trivializing is another technique. This  occurs when a person belittles or disregards the other person's  feelings. They may accuse them of being too sensitive or of  overreacting when they have valid concerns and feelings like, say,  about an election.   Some of us who in this Chamber objected to electors exactly--well,  almost exactly--like our Democrat friends did on January 6, 2001,  January 6 of 2005, and 11 times on January 6 of 2017, so some of us  felt like our Democrat friends understand there is nothing  unconstitutional or criminal or illegal about coming into this Chamber  and objecting.   Now, the difference was, the Democrats in 2017, January 6, 2017, as I  recall, they didn't have a Senator to join the objection, which made  them illegitimate. On some objections in 2021, we did have Senators;  some we didn't. At least we had Senators join on some.   But we thought surely the Democrats, since they objected every time a  Republican won since 2000, they would understand or would believe the  legitimacy of raising an objection, yet they convinced so much of the  American public that anybody that objected was guilty of sedition,  treason, all kinds of crimes, which often is a mark--I have been a  prosecutor and a felony judge. A lot of times when somebody who has  done some activity accuses somebody else of having criminal intent when  they do the same activity, it is evidence that they had criminal intent  when they did that action.   Interestingly, I am still amazed that there are still people in this  body that want to accuse those who objected--as Democrats have, like I  say, in 2017, 11 times--accuse them of criminality. That is amazing.  Perhaps that lends itself to being a form of gaslighting. We are crazy,  we are criminal, because we did what they have done every time a  Republican won in the last 20 years.   Another technique is denial. Denial involves a person pretending to  forget events or how they occurred. Like when somebody says: ``No, we  never do that; we never did that.'' Well, do you think we are crazy? It  is in the Record. There is video. You can go online and find the video  of it occurring.   There were objections by Democrats, which sure sounded to be  spurious. But the meme that was going around was saying, What is the  difference between criminal conspiracy and truth? The answer was: About  6 months. Well, that is inaccurate, because it has been about 18  months, and we are still discovering truth on some things that we are  alleged to have been just crazy--a form of gaslighting--crazy,  insurrectionist, criminal conspiracies. These people are insane that  think there were any problems with the 2020 election.    The movie that Dinesh D'Souza and Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg had  put together, worked on, ``2000 Mules,'' that is one technique of fraud  that was utilized in the 2020 election. These are  [[Page H4963]]  things that ought to cause bipartisan research and effort to try to  prevent if anybody is truly interested in having free and fair  elections.   Another technique, according to this psychological article, is  diverting. With this technique, a person changes the focus of a  discussion and questions the other person's credibility instead. For  example, they might say: ``That is just another crazy idea you got from  your crazy friends.''   I keep hearing people making allegations against Clarence Thomas. I  was speaking at an event where John Yoo also spoke. He clerked, as I  understand, for Justice Clarence Thomas. I was quite pleased to hear  him say what I believe is absolutely true, for anybody that cares to do  their research, that Justice Clarence Thomas is one of the most  intelligent judges to ever sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. Yet, he is  demeaned.   We had a hearing going on. A man named Mark Paoletta was testifying,  and he mentioned that he believed the attacks on Justice Thomas were  racist, because he is a Black person, an originalist regarding the  Constitution, who appears to be conservative.   One of the Democrat members on the committee asked for any evidence  whatsoever of any racist attacks on Clarence Thomas. The response was:  ``Well, you just had a chairman call him an Uncle Tom. That is number  one, but I have got tons more, even from this hearing.'' And he did,  but he was cut off and not allowed to give further evidence of the  racism being utilized against such a brilliant Justice on the Supreme  Court because he happens to be Black and he happens to think for  himself.   I mentioned this in our hearing, because I don't think people know  his background. I was greatly intrigued and found it extremely  interesting reading Clarence Thomas's autobiographical book ``My  Grandfather's Son.''   He has been accused--I have heard him be accused many times of not  being Black by people who don't know what it is to be poor and Black.  Justice Thomas does. He lived with his mother, as I understood, I  recall from the book, about 6 months in Atlanta, a horrendous time. But  basically, he and his little brother were raised by their grandparents  in Pin Point, Georgia, right on the coast.   Because they were on the coast, he pointed out, they had food, they  could get greens that were called poke sallet. I don't like them, but  they could always go out and pick poke sallet growing wild. Because  they were right there on the coast, they could get fish or different  type things, whether it was mussels or clams or fish, whatever, they  were able to get a lot of food.   He was so smart, so intelligent, he got a scholarship to Holy Cross  and then ultimately decided he wanted to go to law school, applied to  Harvard. But I think it was half a day he was at Harvard, and as he  thinks of himself, he was an angry, Black, radical, liberal, and he  felt like Harvard was too conservative.                                time  1345    He felt like Harvard was too conservative, so he left and applied for  Yale, and he liked Yale better because it was much more liberal, he  felt like.   But he began to notice that liberals seemed to look down on him, that  they didn't want to talk to him about anything but sports or oppression  of Blacks in America, and he noticed that the two or three  conservatives in the school were interested in his opinions on all  kinds of things and would talk to him about things, and he began to  notice and appreciate that.   In a discussion with one of the few conservatives that were talking  about seatbelts, helmets, whether they should or shouldn't be  mandatory, and he expressed the opinion that, gee, he felt like they  just ought to have a law passed that required everybody to wear a  seatbelt and everybody on a motorcycle to wear a helmet.   And the conservative, giving a more libertarian question, said, in  effect, you have seen government used to oppress Blacks in America, why  in the world would you ever want to give the government any more  control over your life? That set him thinking. Eventually he began to  realize, you know what, it is not a good idea to continue to give the  government more and more power because it can be abused.   This is a man who thought for himself. But he also knew how  intelligent he was, and it had to be a bit insulting to have people act  like, gee, if it weren't for us liberals, you, as a much less  intelligent Black, would never have even gotten to be in the school  with me, whereas he knew the truth. He was there because he was a  brilliant person, and he has not gotten credit for his consistency, for  his intellect, for his integrity. It is constantly being demeaned, and  they try to gaslight him. It hasn't worked.   Another technique is stereotyping. An article in American  Sociological Review states that ``a person using gaslighting techniques  may intentionally use negative stereotypes of a person's gender, race,  ethnicity, sexuality, nationality, or age to manipulate them. For  example, they may tell a female that people will think she is  irrational or crazy if she seeks help for abuse.''   As an assistant DA, I saw that, and it was amazing to me. I was a bit  naive, but to see a woman bruised and battered, clearly beat up, we  wanted to see her husband put in jail. Nobody should ever treat  anybody--male, female, anybody--the way that some of these battered  women got treated. And yet they would be gaslighted to the point that  after the bruises and the abrasions went away, they would come back and  say, ``I don't want to press charges.''   In one particular case, I said, ``This is not your choice. Under the  law, we have the right to go after your husband because he clearly  abused you, and it is going to keep continuing. We asked you when you  came in, you know, do you promise you will not back off this time, you  will let us go after your husband for this kind of abuse?'' And she had  said, ``Absolutely,'' with her face all swollen, black and blue,  scraped. It was horrendous.   And yet he worked on her psychologically. She eventually comes back  and says, ``I want to withdraw the charges.'' We said, ``We have got  the pictures. We are going to go ahead and press charges this time.''  ``Well, if you do, I am going to say that I was trying to kill him and  he was just defending himself.'' The psychological abuse had worked,  and it was just so heartbreaking. Usually they had been gaslighted to  the point they thought they deserved it. Nobody deserved that. But we  are seeing these same techniques being used today.   At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  my friend, for such time as she may utilize.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Arizona so  much. I miss her on the Judiciary Committee because of the very type of  insights that we just heard from her. I am grateful for her service,  her intellect, her insights, and especially her pugnacious nature that  did not cause her to back down, that caused her to stand up after being  a victim herself.    I was approached by a lady in a store in Longview, Texas, an  adjoining county to where I was a district judge, and she asked if I  remembered her. I didn't. She never testified in court, but she said  she was there in the courtroom when I sentenced her husband. She said  she and her daughter had been abused year after year, and her husband  had been arrested different times, but he was such a smooth salesman  that he always convinced judges to give him a slap on the wrist and  probation and be on his way. She said that I was the first judge in all  those years to be able to see through her husband's great salesmanship  and send him to prison.   There are a lot of things that aren't pleasant about being a judge or  a justice, been that, too, but to have somebody say, ``You gave my  daughter and me our lives, and we are doing great, and she is doing  great, and she is going to go to a great college now,'' but you have  got to be able to see through gaslighting. You have got to be able to  see through lies and get to the facts.   Now, we are being told about what a terrible shortage of baby formula  there is in this country; and there is. You go in the stores, the  shelves have a tremendous shortage. We hear different excuses. But if  you had a businessman like President Trump in the White House, when he  would see a shortage of something that was needed, he would find out  where the problem is. He would call the people that could do something  about it, ``Hey, we have got to do something about this,'' and they  would figure out a way to get something done about it, find out where  the holdup was, where the problem was.   But, instead, when there seems to be a shortage or a problem,  Republicans say, ``Hey, why aren't we doing something about the baby  formula?'' This gaslighting technique is used. And then we find out not  only is there a shortage in the store, but you just shipped truckloads  of baby formula to the border, which acts as a draw to more illegal  immigration, especially women with babies or parents with babies to  come across and get the baby formula that is not being allowed to go to  Americans and American citizens or people who are legally here.   The thought comes of the flights. Every week we are in session,  flight up here, flight back, we sit through the same presentation over  and over again by the flight attendants. Sometimes they do it live,  sometimes they are just going through the motions and there is a tape  playing, but they make very clear, if we have a problem like the  fuselage depressurizing, the oxygen mask will drop down, and adults are  to put the mask on themselves before they put it on the child, and the  reason is rather simple, because if you are trying to put your child's  mask on and you don't have oxygen, there is a good chance you will pass  out, and then both you and your child will die. You get that on  yourself, and then you will have the oxygen you need to think clearly,  to make sure your child or children or those dependent upon you can get  what they need.                                time  1400    When someone is determined not to provide help to Americans that you  are sending all over the world, or you are sending as a lure to people  to come in illegally--which we heard during our committee hearing: Yes,  we do want to make these people into voters that are flooding in  illegally. That was quite a revelation; although, we had suspected that  for some time. But there are consequences to not taking care of the  greatest, most philanthropic country in the history of the world that  has done more for other people, other nations.   Yes, we have had our own problems, but no one has fought racism like  was fought here. The most loss of life ever in any war was in the Civil  War; over half a million people died over this issue of slavery. There  is no country that has ever fought to end slavery, to end racism the  way this country has. I thought we had made tremendous progress.   That was one of the things about the United States Army--I was at the  Home of the Infantry--you just wanted to make sure that the person next  to you was going to be helpful. You weren't concerned about their race  or anything like that, you just wanted to make sure that you were going  to work together. It was quite a good microcosm. Even though the 4  years I was in, it was not a pleasant time to be in the military. We  were sometimes ordered not to wear our uniform off-post because there  were people that hated us for wearing a uniform. That was post-Vietnam.   With regard to the baby formula, if you keep drawing people into this  country--and now we are told we need to pay people to have abortions-- you keep taking those actions, you will destroy this Nation. And once  this most philanthropic country in the history of the world is  destroyed or converted into some dictatorial Orwellian society, all  these countries that we have been able to help, since particularly 1789  when the Constitution was ratified, that help is not going to be there.   Having heard from people and countries, especially legislatures and  parliamentarians in other countries that we consider to be free, they  privately will say--and have--you have got to protect America's  freedom. We see you losing it. And when you lose your freedom in  America, there will be no place else to go to have freedom. You are the  one that has secured it for the places that have it. This is so  important.   So when our judiciary and our executive Department of Justice abuses  people and abuses the system, and uses lies instead of truth, and uses  technology to spy on its citizens, we are in big trouble.   I know when I first got here in January of 2005, Republicans were in  the majority but when it came to civil rights, we had a lot of friends  on the other side of the aisle that felt the same way. There were some  on our side who wanted to protect all the power we could give to the  Department of Justice, but again, there were people on both sides of  the aisle that said this is a threat to our democratic Republic. We  can't give them this much power.   Over the years, after Democrats took the majority in January of 2007  through January of 2011 and then got it back, we are not getting the  kind of help we did those first 2 years with dealing with the abuses  within our own ministry of truth. Because the DOJ really, using  Orwellian terms from 1984, and as I have said before, what we are  seeing is, the only thing Orwell got wrong was the year. It wasn't  1984, it's now. And it's not called the ministry of truth or the  ministry of love.   The ministry of love, of course in 1984, people will remember, that  was the entity that took people into custody, knocked down doors. They  used techniques like our current DOJ does to intimidate people, to use  much more power than they ever need just to intimidate--like 1984, like  a totalitarian government.   I bring that up because I remember in the 1980s--and I had so much  respect for the FBI agents I knew, and I had seen numerous times. I  didn't do a lot of criminal work during the 10 years that I was a civil  trial lawyer, but they would contact a soon-to-be defendant saying, we  got an indictment, we got a warrant. You can either report to the jail  at 10 a.m. tomorrow or we will come get you, and you would much rather  come in on your own. If they had a lawyer, they would call the lawyer:  Have your client come in at 9 or 10 a.m.   Not now. Oh, no. Oh, no. The Justice Department wants to come in and  knock down your door because it is a lot more fun. They have got the  battering ram. And it is a lot more fun to get people in their  underwear or maybe  [[Page H4965]]  in their pajamas that are in bed, because you get to scare them. It is  easier to intimidate them.   What happened to those days when it didn't matter whether the  assistant U.S. attorney or the FBI agents voted Democrat or Republican?  They were going to make sure they didn't abuse their power. I am not  seeing that kind of concern like I used to see from people in the  Department of Justice.   I know there are some that feel that way but, yet they are being  gaslit if they try to report or be whistleblowers, and their careers  are destroyed. Kind of like Director Mueller destroyed the career of  the FBI agent that was the whistleblower and reported the unethical  and, I would say, illegal conduct by the FBI in trying to persecute  during the prosecution of Ted Stevens when they abused the system and  convicted an innocent man.   Yeah, the Mueller way. You promote the one that engaged in the fraud,  and you punish the one who reported the fraud within the FBI.   We have just seen it grow worse and worse as Mueller's dear friend,  James Comey, took over. The abuses grew. And then Christopher Wray was  appointed to clean up the FBI. It appears to me his way of cleaning  things up is just to sweep it under the rug. If somebody lies to the  FISA court, commits a crime, whereas if it were a conservative, they  would put him under the prison rather than punish him, would just let  him go get a higher paying job somewhere else.   That is not punishment. It is not deterrent. And it is doing massive  damage to this country.   So we have the ministry of truth now called the disinformation board  that has been created. This is being led and created by people who have  been champions of disinformation, champions of gaslighting, who want to  convince America: If you think there is a problem, if you think there  is abuse in the FISA court, if you think there was any impropriety in  elections, then we need to come after you and charge you with  disinformation.    For those who have not read 1984, or don't remember, the ministry of  truth, in this case now called the disinformation board, they were  charged with rewriting history every day. As Orwell pointed out  through, I believe his name was Winston, one day they might say, well,  this government did not invent the airplane but all of the good changes  that have made it more effective, more efficient, faster, those came by  our great, Big Brother Government.   Then eventually, you would get to the point where you would just  forget all of that and say, Big Brother Government created the  airplane, has had everything to do with making it effective, and just  take credit for everything good and then blame anybody else for  anything bad.   So that seems like where we are going. We could call it the  gaslighting board, but it is called the disinformation board. And it is  headed by a person who, herself, has been quite guilty of  disinformation, yet she is going to be in charge of coming up with  disinformation for the future, apparently. We can expect problems ahead  for sure.   Now, this article from yesterday, May 12, from the New York Post,  Nina Jankowicz says, ``Verified Twitter users should edit others'  tweets.''   I mean, we are right out of 1984, going back to the days of the 1950s  when some songwriter wrote, If your mommy is a commie, well you gotta  turn her in.   This is where it appears the disinformation board wants to go. Yeah,  kids, turn in your parents if you find out that they have said anything  privately at home that is inconsistent with the new truth that the  disinformation board has come up with.   This is dangerous stuff. It cannot be overstated. We have got to stop  the disinformation board. The solution to misinformation is more  freedom so that people that have accurate information can come out with  it. But when the government puts its finger on the scales of justice,  on the balance, then you can be assured you are going to get less truth  and less justice because it is not going to be fair.   I mentioned before that I was an exchange student for the summer to  the old Soviet Union. From what I understood, it was the Soviet  government, it was the Communist Party that put out all this  misinformation. They would lie about things. They would cover up. I  still wonder how many cosmonauts may have died during their space  program, but they never came out truthfully with what all happened.   I was with a couple of Soviet college students, who I liked a great  deal; they were wonderful people. We were looking at an exhibit about  some of the space program things. Gagarin was the first human ever in  space, and there were some entries about Gagarin and the world hero  that he was. Up to that point, I felt like, well, these are college  students who would be the most likely to get upset if they were lied  to. And it said something about Gagarin being killed by testing a new  experimental plane. My Soviet male, college friend, who spoke terrific  English, said, Yeah, well, we know that is not true. I was intrigued. I  never heard them indicate that they knew they were being lied to by the  Soviet government.   The other Soviet college student said, Yeah, there is no way that  happened. And I said, You don't believe he was killed testing a plane  as a test pilot?                                time  1415    They both chimed in that, no, there is no way. He was the greatest  hero in the history of the world, the first man in space. There is no  way the Soviet government would allow him to get into a plane by  himself that wasn't safe. That didn't happen. It was too important. He  was too important as a hero, as someone that made us admire our  government. They wouldn't let him die like that.   Well, I don't know whether he died as a test pilot or not, but I was  intrigued that they believed to their core that the Soviet government  lied to them. Why? Because the Soviet government constantly lied to  them.   They wouldn't make up lies. In fact, remember, this was 1973. I found  it interesting, in Pravda, they were reporting some things about  Watergate emerging back in the U.S., and because it really was like a  disinformation board or ministry of truth, whichever one you want to  call it, they made everything about the Soviet Union. Everything was  centered on the Soviet Union.   So their take on Watergate was that because Richard Nixon came to the  Soviet Union, the first President ever to do so, that is why the  Democrats came after him and were wanting to throw him out of office or  put him in jail, because he made friends with the Soviets.   That was their take in order to make it all about the Soviet Union.  Of course, we know crimes were committed, and the coverup was the worst  of it.   But this is where we are headed, and it is a very dangerous time. We  do not need a disinformation board. We need people being able to stand  up and speak up without intimidation because they are conservative  Black or because they are abused or whatever. They need to be able to  speak up and bring evidence forward, or at least have an investigation  to get to the bottom of things without being belittled, without being  gaslit. That will do more to secure our freedom for the future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
