 Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I joined my colleagues  from the Kentucky delegation here on the House floor to lead a moment  of silence for the victims of a tragic school shooting at Marshall  County High School in my district in Kentucky on January 23.   Today I am proud to rise in support of the STOP School Violence Act,  which I believe will be a critical step forward in preventing future  school shootings like the tragedies we witnessed in Marshall County,  Kentucky, and, of course, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in  Parkland, Florida.                                time  1330    In the wake of the Marshall County shooting, I heard from the  families of victims and other members of the community that their top  priority was enhancing physical security, whether that means installing  metal detectors, hiring school resource officers, or making other  evidence-based improvements to prevent and mitigate school violence.   This bill will provide resources to schools so that they can do just  that while also supporting training for students, teachers, and local  law enforcement to identify and prevent violence in our schools.   The Marshall County community is resilient. As we continue to mourn  the loss of two young lives in our community along with those in  Parkland, we will also fight to protect our students, educators, and  communities. I believe the STOP School Violence Act will help defend  our schools from those who wish to inflict harm on others, and I urge  my colleagues to support this important and bipartisan bill.
