 Madam President, now, President Trump is right about one  thing. There is a crisis in America, and I want the President to know I  agree with him, but I would note it is not fictitious hordes of illegal  immigrants crashing into our southern border. That is nothing more than  the imaginary invasion of a President obsessed with constructing a  wasteful monument to himself; the obsession of a President who, long  before the Trump shutdown, began resorting to misinformation and  stoking fear among the American people for political gain.  [[Page S116]]    There is a crisis in America, but it is not the crisis the President  wants us to believe. It is a crisis at the kitchen table of Americans.   Hundreds of thousands of American families are preparing to miss  their first paycheck through no fault of their own. These families are  trying to figure out how they are going to make ends meet, how they  will pay their mortgage or heating bills or, God forbid, whether they  can afford both food for their table and medicine for their children  next week. That is not fiction. That is a real choice in America today.  That is the crisis in America.   These are the adjustments President Trump has glibly said our  country's public servants are ``willing'' to make on behalf of his  wasteful border wall; incidentally, a wall the President repeatedly  promised--gave his word--that Mexico would pay for.   I have been privileged to be here for a long time, but in my 44 years  in the U.S. Senate, I have never seen something so tone deaf from a  President of the United States of either party. Even during his address  to the Nation on Tuesday night--which was more of an exercise in data- distorting demagoguery than informing the American people--President  Trump refused to acknowledge the real pain the Trump shutdown is  causing.   Dozens of Vermonters have contacted my office to share how they are  suffering under the Trump shutdown. These Vermonters are urging the  President and my Republican colleagues in the Senate to stop playing  politics with their lives and reopen the Federal Government. These are  not just people who are Federal employees; these are people who have  contracts with the Federal Government. These are people who have to  rely on the Federal Government being open.   I will give you one example. Like many Americans affected by the  Trump shutdown, one of the Vermonters who contacted my office is a  veteran. He spent more than two decades serving his country in the  Navy. He is now a Federal employee in charge of more than a dozen  people who are coming to him with questions he cannot answer.   He writes:         I have run out of words to tell the 15 employees who work       for me when asked how they are supposed to provide food,       heat, and electricity for their families here in Vermont.    Keep in mind, the weather in Vermont is projected to drop well below  zero this weekend with enough snow to close down all of Washington.   This Navy veteran continues:         We are real people, with real families, and real bills.       Creditors do not ``understand'' [as the President claimed       they would]. They want their money.    Try to explain to the bank why you cannot pay your mortgage this  month. Go to the bank and say: Well, the President of the United States  is throwing a tantrum, and he is holding my paycheck hostage. Try  explaining that to the bank. Try explaining that to your children.   Another Vermonter wrote to me expressing concern for his 88-year-old  aunt. She recently moved to a new nursing home to be closer to the  family. Because the phones at the Treasury Department are going  unanswered, approval for the transfer of his aunt's benefits from one  facility to another has been delayed. Thankfully, we heard that the  transfer had been approved just this morning, but that doesn't detract  from the uncertainty and the anxiety caused for this family.   The new home allowed her to stay while we in Washington were sorting  out this mess caused by President Trump, but the bills are piling up,  and the delays are placing a burden on what is a small local nursing  home that has to pay its bills, including when it is 5 below zero.   The Vermonter said in his letter: ``To be sure, we do not believe  that capitulation to the Republican demand for the Wall is the answer;  yet, the toll on the people of holding the government hostage to such  outrageous demands must not be ignored.''   Finally, today, let me share the story of a Vermonter who wrote to me  about her sister. Her sister joined the U.S. Forest Service. In the  wake of the recent hurricanes and typhoons, she used a government  credit card issued in her name, following orders to travel with the  service to assist in the aftermath of these disasters. But now the  bills for her official travel--travel she was ordered to take by the  Federal Government--are due. Guess what. There is no one at the Forest  Service to pay them. She is now stuck with more than $5,500 in  government bills in her name for carrying out her duties for the  Federal Government. Now she has to pay them or risk damaging her own  financial record.   In her letter to me, she writes:         This, though, is one very small story in a flood of credit       disasters, unpaid mortgages, Christmas debts, anxieties, and       uncertainties among government employees affected by the       shutdown.        I'm writing you to suggest that this kind of government       shutdown should not be on the negotiation table, because it       holds out the possibility that the suffering of the American       people can be used as political leverage. There are other       ways.    I agree. This is just a handful of stories from my small State of  Vermont. Think of the fear and anxiety today of American families as  they sit around the kitchen table trying to figure out what to do when  the check does not arrive tomorrow. Think about the impact this has on  the talented young student who is thinking about taking a pay cut to  work for their government out of a sense of duty. Think about the  morale of the American people who serve this country when the President  of the United States says that their livelihoods are worth risking over  his border wall--and I say ``border wall'' on purpose. If this were  about border security, the men and women who protect our borders and  patrol our coastlines would be receiving their paychecks, not forced to  be pawns in the President's political game.   Think about that. If this were really about border security, these  people protecting us would be paid. The great irony of the Trump  shutdown is that it has made our borders less safe, not more safe.  Today, 88 percent of the Department of Homeland Security, including  54,000 Customs and Border Patrol agents are working without pay. At our  airports, where the overwhelming majority of the ``suspected  terrorists'' President Trump's wall is meant to stop are actually  intercepted--keep that in mind. He keeps talking about all of the  suspected terrorists. They are not coming across the border. They are  being stopped at the airports. So what has happened at our airports?  More than 51,000 TSA agents at our airports are working without pay.  Morale is so low that many just stopped showing up for work, leading to  longer wait times and straining security measures.   (Mr. SULLIVAN assumed the Chair.)   Take another area. More than 42,000 members of our Coast Guard--and  the Coast Guard is an effective investment in securing our borders and  stopping the flow of drugs. But 42,000 members of our Coast Guard are  working without pay as I stand here today. The Coast Guard are deployed  along the coasts of the distinguished Presiding Officer's State and are  deployed in my State.   What does President Trump say to all of this? Nothing. It has been  widely reported that instead of sitting down and negotiating with  Democrats, President Trump simply stood up and walked out of the room  like a bully yesterday, tweeting shortly afterwards, ``bye-bye.''   Does anybody think he hadn't planned to do this before he went there?  This is what you do on so-called reality TV. Well, this is not reality  TV; this is reality. He should try to act Presidential.   There is a real crisis in our country. It is a crisis at the kitchen  table as families struggle over how they will make it through the next  week. It is a crisis of morale as dedicated men and women who serve our  country debate whether to stop serving our country and look instead for  a career where they cannot be used as a political pawn. It is a crisis  of confidence in the young men and women, doubting a career in public  service, and it is a crisis of leadership when the President simply  walks away so that he can send another tweet. This is a crisis created  by one man, President Trump.   We have bipartisan bills before us that could reopen the government.  We have passed them in this body before by an overwhelming veto-proof  majority. Well, I would call upon our Republican leader to bring up  these bipartisan bills to reopen the government. It  [[Page S117]]  is time for Republicans and Democrats to join together to tell the  President to put a stop to this self-inflicted wound on this great  country, and he needs to hear it from both Democrats and Republicans. I  implore Leader McConnell: Bring up H.R. 21 and H.J. Res. 1. Send them  to the President. Send them to the President. Show the rest of the  world that the United States is a great country and can act like a  great country, not act like a pawn in a temper tantrum.   I yield the floor.
