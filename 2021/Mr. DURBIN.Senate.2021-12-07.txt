Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue of  vital importance involving the U.S. attorneys.   Each of the 93 U.S. attorneys serves as the chief Federal law  enforcement officer within his or her jurisdiction. U.S. attorneys  prosecute the full spectrum of criminal cases brought on behalf of the  United States, from hate crimes to human trafficking, to gang violence,  to cyber crime, to narcotics, to financial fraud, to terrorism. The  list is long, and the violations of the law that are alleged are  serious.   The position of the U.S. attorney is nearly as old as the Nation  itself. In fact, the position has existed since the First Congress.  President George Washington signed into law the law that created these  attorneys in the Judiciary Act of 1789.   Given the critical role that these U.S. attorneys play in bringing  justice to those who violate Federal criminal laws, it is hard to  imagine that any Member of this body would obstruct efforts to confirm  these law enforcement officials. Doing so could threaten public safety  and puts at risk millions of Americans' security.   It is also a stark departure from what has happened before. The last  time the Senate required a rollcall vote on a U.S. attorney nominee was  1975. Forty-six years have passed without the request for a rollcall  vote on a U.S. attorney. For decades, the Senate has confirmed U.S.  attorneys by a voice vote or unanimous consent after they have been  considered in the Judiciary Committee.   Listen to this: During the Trump administration, 85 of President  Trump's U.S. attorney nominees moved through the Judiciary Committee in  the Senate. Of those 85, the Senate confirmed every single Trump  nominee by unanimous consent without even requesting a record vote. I  might add just for the record, I believe one nominee was held for 1  week so that a question could be answered about his background. That is  the only thing that I can recall where they even slowed down the  process during the Trump administration. Certainly, it was within our  power as Democrats to stop and require a vote, but we didn't. Yet now  there is a Republican objection to holding a voice vote on five U.S.  attorney nominees: Greg Harris for the Central District of Illinois,  Clare Connors for Hawaii, Zachary Cunha for Rhode Island, Nikolas  Kerest for Vermont, and Philip Sellinger for New Jersey.   Several of these nominees have been held up for weeks--weeks--by this  objection. Why, you ask, is there an objection to these five nominees?  There must be something wrong with their records. Well, let's take a  look.   Greg Harris is a personal friend of mine. I practiced law with him in  Springfield, IL. He spent nearly three decades as assistant U.S.  attorney in the Central District of Illinois. That includes my  hometown. He has tried over 50 cases to verdict and held a number of  leadership positions in the U.S. Attorney's Office. He serves on the  Central Illinois Human Trafficking Task Force and the Bankruptcy Fraud  Working Group.   His nomination is historic. He will be the first African-American  U.S. attorney in the Central District of Illinois, which, of course, is  located in Mr. Lincoln's hometown of Springfield--the first.   Clare Connors is currently the attorney general of Hawaii. Ms.  Connors previously served as criminal prosecutor in the Justice  Department's Tax Division, special assistant U.S. attorney in the  Eastern District of Virginia, and for nearly 7 years an assistant U.S.  attorney in Hawaii.   Zachary Cunha, currently an assistant U.S. attorney in the District  of Rhode Island in the same office he will lead upon confirmation--he  has worked there for 8 years, following time as an assistant U.S.  attorney in both the Eastern District of New York and the District of  Massachusetts.   Nikolas Kerest, also an assistant U.S. attorney, served in the  District of Vermont since 2010, following time in private legal  practice in Maine and Massachusetts and a clerkship on the Second  Circuit Court of Appeals.   Philip Sellinger has had a long and distinguished legal career in New  Jersey. He began his legal career as a law clerk for Judge Anne  Thompson of the District of New Jersey before joining the U.S.  Attorney's Office in Newark. For the past two decades, Mr. Sellinger  has been a litigator in a prominent law firm and even served as the  firm's cochair of global litigation.   Listen to these biographies. All five of these nominees are eminently  qualified to hold the office of U.S. attorney, to prosecute crimes and  bring civil actions on behalf of the government, and to help safeguard  our communities across America.   There is one thing that all of these U.S. attorney nominees have in  common, though. They are all from States with two Democratic Senators.  That seems to be the only thing that they might have in common. The  objections to these nominees are not that they aren't qualified or that  the job is not important; the objection seems to be that they are from  States with two Democratic Senators.   So when it comes to critical issues we expect, in the Department of  Justice, to be taken care of by U.S. attorneys--issues involving  terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics, public corruption, gun  violence, the safety of our communities--is the fact that they happen  to hail from States with two Democratic Senators enough to disqualify  them or to leave these positions vacant?   It is time to end the Republican delay and get these well-qualified  prosecutors confirmed and on the job.   We never once during the Trump administration's 4 years held up a  U.S. attorney when it came to a voice vote, a unanimous voice vote, to  give them the opportunity to serve this country. It is unthinkable that  we are going to do this to these fine men and women today. So, today, I  will ask unanimous consent for a vote on these nominees.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the following  nominations: Calendar Nos. 534, 535, 536, 581, and 582; that the  nominations be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that  no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any related  statements be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I have been trying to understand the  Republican objection to these well-qualified U.S. attorney nominees,  and the Senator from Arkansas has made it clear. It has nothing to do  with them; it is about me.   He, obviously, doesn't approve of what happened one day in the  committee. And the price to be paid is not by me but by the U.S.  attorneys, well-qualified, who have important jobs to fill.   One member of the Republican caucus is upset with the fact that back  in March--this happened in March--the Judiciary Committee moved to vote  on the nomination of Vanita Gupta to be Associate Attorney General when  Republican members of the committee had not finished speaking on her  nomination.   He correctly remembers that he was speaking at approximately 10  minutes to 12 p.m., when I interrupted him, took a rollcall vote, and  went back to him if he wished to speak again.   I will be the first to acknowledge that I moved forward with the vote  on Ms. Gupta's nomination over the objections of committee Republicans.  But put simply, the Republicans forced my hand that day.   The Senator from Arkansas talks about courtesy in this body. I will  tell him I think that it should be a hallmark of what we all do at all  times. I am fortunate, truly blessed, in my mind, to have, as the  ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a real friend in  Chuck Grassley, the Republican Senator of Iowa.   I asked him that day what was going on. I had informed the committee  in writing that we would proceed with a vote on Ms. Gupta that day. I  then allowed committee Republicans to speak for 94 minutes on Ms.  Gupta's nomination, even though much of what was said was repetitive-- some false and some really unwarranted.   I was, in fact, prepared to allow committee Republicans to speak for  as long as they wished. I turned to Senator Grassley and said: ``What's  the plan here?'' And he said: ``Well, Senator Tillis may return and  speak, and we just have these members speaking.''   I had received assurances that the Republicans would not use an  obscure Senate rule, the 2-hour rule, to cut off the markup before we  voted on Ms. Gupta's nomination. But at 11:55 a.m., I was surprised, as  was Senator Grassley, to be informed that despite their earlier  assurances, a Republican Senator had, in fact, invoked the 2-hour rule  in an effort to prevent Ms. Gupta's nomination from being considered  that day and to close down the markup in the committee.   My hand was forced by this action. It was a surprise move, a tactical  move, surely within the rules for them to make, but I did exactly what  previous Republican chairs of the Judiciary Committee did in similar  situations. I ended the debate and called for the vote on the  nomination.   If you are listening to this and wondering what these arcane  committee procedures have to do with U.S. attorney nominations, you are  not alone. The Senator is pleading that we should stand by the  traditions of the Senate. And by the traditions of the Senate, these  U.S. attorney nominees would go through by unanimous consent. That is a  tradition of the Senate as well.   The simple answer is, what happened with the markup debate more than  8 months ago has nothing to do with these five fine individuals or with  any other U.S. attorney nominee who may come before the Senate.   If the Senator from Arkansas wants me to publicly express my regret  for this occurrence, I express that regret. But I want to make it  clear, I relied on my friend Senator Grassley. We were both surprised  to know that someone had invoked the 2-hour rule. Caught by surprise, I  did what other Republican chairs of the committee have done.   I don't believe we should play politics with critical law enforcement  nominations. They are putting our communities at risk and politicizing  law enforcement in a way that threatens public safety.   If we are going to truly stand up for law and order, let these men  and women go to work across America representing the Department of  Justice.    Responding through the Chair, as long as there is  openness and honesty about what is happening in the procedure, I will  assure you that I will do everything I can to extend that courtesy  forward.   That particular day, you may or may not be aware of the fact that  while you were speaking, we learned--Senator Grassley and I both  learned that someone had raised the 2-hour rule, and it came as a  surprise to both of us.   When we are open and honest about what we are trying to achieve in a  committee, there is no reason why we can't abide by basic courtesy in  the tradition of the Senate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 534, No. 535,  No. 536, No. 581, and No. 582; that the Senate vote on the nominations  en bloc without intervening action or debate; that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, a famous chef once said that ``a plate of  food was a plate of hope.'' At Yoshi's Cafe in Chicago, the meals were  that--and so much more. Every meal--every bite--at Yoshi's was a  celebration and a discovery of new tastes and new combinations of  tastes.   When Yoshi's Cafe opened 39 years ago, it was on the vanguard of  ``fusion cuisine,'' cooking that combines the best of different  cultures. In Yoshi's case, it was an exquisite mix of classical French  and Japanese cooking traditions. Over the years, Yoshi's also  incorporated bits of cuisines, such as hint of Mexican cooking, into  their dishes. But the true signature ingredients of any meal at Yoshi's  Cafe were pride and love.   Every meal was a chance for founder Yoshi Katsumura to share his  impeccable culinary skill and imagination. And every customer was  treated like a friend. If you went often enough, as my wife Loretta and  I have, you became part of the family. That combination of personal  warmth and impeccable food has made Yoshi's Cafe one of Chicago's truly  great neighborhood restaurants.   This weekend, Yoshi's Cafe will serve its last meal--and Loretta and  I plan to be there. We wouldn't miss the chance to eat one last time at  one of our favorite restaurants.   Chicagoans feared this day might come sooner. When founder Yoshi  Katsumura died in 2015, we wondered if that might be the end of Yoshi's  Cafe as well. But Yoshi asked his wife Nobuko to try to preserve his  legacy and the business they had built together. And she did.   With the help of her son, chef Ken Katsumura, Nobuko kept Yoshi's  Cafe open, even through a lethal pandemic that devastated the  restaurant industry. Her daughter, Mari, has made a name for herself as  a top-ranked pastry chef in Chicago.   After some soul-searching, however, Nobuko has decided that it's time  for a new chapter--time to spend a little more time with her  grandchildren and enjoying life.   Like countless other Chicagoans, Loretta and I feel a touch of  sadness about the closing of Yoshi's Cafe. But we also feel  tremendously grateful for the memorable meals we have enjoyed there and  for the gift of Yoshi and Nobuko's friendship over the years.   I once showed up at the restaurant on a Monday evening, forgetting  that it was closed. I stood for a moment on the sidewalk of North  Halsted Street, stranded and hungry, trying to decide where to eat.  Just as I was about to leave, I heard someone call my name.   It was Yoshi, who lived above the restaurant, calling down to me and  offering to fix me a meal on his day off. That was the moment I came to  see the goodness of this man. And Nobuko is just as kind and giving.   Yoshi's Cafe brought together the foods of Tokyo, Paris, Lyon, and  Chicago. Yoshi was born in Japan. At the age of 20, he apprenticed  under another legendary chef, Hiroyuki Sakai in Tokyo, where he first  learned the intricacies of fine French cooking.   In 1973, he moved to Chicago, where he studied under one of Chicago'  first  [[Page S8959]]  celebrity chefs, Jean Banchet, at Le Francais. Further study in Paris  and Lyon added to his skills. He returned to Chicago as chef and  partner in the city's premier French fusion restaurant, Jimmy's Place.   In 1982, he and Nobuko opened their own place. For nearly 40 years,  Yoshi's has earned the love and loyalty of generation of Chicagoans. It  has been featured on the Food Network and listed among ``America's Top  Tables'' by the Conde Nast Gourmet magazine.   I want to thank Nobuko Katsumura and her gracious and loyal staff for  the great gift Yoshi's has been to Chicago.   Loretta and I will miss our friends at Yoshi's and the incredible  meals we enjoyed there. We will treasure our memories of this Chicago  icon and the great family that created it for years to come.                            ____________________
