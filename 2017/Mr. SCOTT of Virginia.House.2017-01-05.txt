The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Section 804(4) of title 5, United States Code, as proposed       to be amended to read by section 3 of the bill, is amended in       subparagraph (B), by striking ``or'' at the end.        Section 804(4) of title 5, United States Code, as proposed       to be amended to read by section 3 of the bill, is amended in       subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; or''.        Section 804(4) of title 5, United States Code, as proposed       to be amended to read by section 3 of the bill, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(D) any rule that pertains to workplace health and safety       made by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or       the Mine Safety and Health Administration that is necessary       to prevent or reduce the incidence of traumatic injury,       cancer or irreversible lung disease.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  [[Page H144]]    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from  coverage under the REINS Act any rule which pertains to workplace  health and safety made by the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, OSHA, or the Mine Safety and Health Administration,  MSHA, that is necessary to prevent or reduce the incidence of traumatic  injury, cancer or irreversible lung disease.   I am offering the amendment because we should not be creating  obstacles to the protection of life and limb. We should be concerned  about repealing such workplace rules. Actually, this concern is not  theoretical. There was a report from the chairman of the Freedom Caucus  that actually calls for the repeal of multiple safety and health rules.                                time  1700    One OSHA rule, for example, will reduce slip, trip, and fall hazards,  which are actually a leading cause of worker deaths and lost workday  injuries. We found that this rule had not been updated since 1971, and  OSHA has calculated that over 10 years the rule will prevent nearly 300  worker deaths and more than 58,000 lost-time injuries. The net benefit,  cash benefit, of the rule is projected to be over $3 billion over 10  years.   Another rule at risk is the modernization of OSHA's beryllium  exposure limit, a 70-year-old standard that was obsolete even before it  was issued. Workers who inhaled beryllium can develop debilitating,  incurable, and frequently fatal illnesses. One known as chronic  beryllium disease also increased lung cancer.   In the 1940s, workers at the Atomic Energy Commission plants were  contracting acute beryllium poisoning. To deal with the problem, two  scientists agreed to set the exposure limit at 2 micrograms per cubic  meter of air while sitting in the back of a taxicab on their way to a  meeting. This discredited standard is often called the taxicab standard  because there was no data to support it, and there is now significant  scientific evidence that show that it has failed to protect workers.   One cost of keeping the so-called taxicab standard is estimated at  the loss of nearly 100 lives a year. So we need to make sure that this  rule is updated. It is in final stages after 18 years of development.  The finalized rule is expected to come out soon. Other rules involve  mine safety and other safety and health concerns.   The REINS Act would make it harder to protect workers' health and  safety. The bill would create more bureaucracy by requiring that any  major rule receive bicameral resolution of support within 70  legislative days prior to the rule taking effect.   This bill even provides for a reach back to consider rules issued  last spring. Under this bill, a single House of Congress could block a  rule. That raises significant constitutional concerns. By allowing a  one-House veto, the bill violates the presentment clause of the  Constitution of the United States.   My amendment ensures essential workplace safety protections are not  jeopardized by this flawed legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia  will be postponed.                 Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12  printed in House Report 115-1.
