 Mr. President, I would like to express the sentiments of  all of us who were stunned and saddened to learn first thing this  morning of the attack on our colleagues and their staff on the House  side as they practiced for the Republican team for the annual  Congressional Baseball Game.   Senator Rand Paul, who was present, told us at lunch about what  happened. He emphasized time and again the absolutely heroic behavior,  the extraordinary bravery of the Capitol police officers who were part  of Representative Scalise's detail. He said that, without these two  police officers, he has no doubt that many more people would have been  injured and likely killed.   So I think it is important for us to pause and express our gratitude  to the men and women of the Capitol Police Force, and, indeed, to the  first responders and law enforcement officers everywhere, who, day  after day, put their lives on the line for our country. Without their  help today, the terrible attack would have been far, far worse. So I  thank them.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.    Mr. President, for centuries, families and communities  throughout Maine were sustained by healthy working forests. During his  32 years with Pingree Associates, including 28 as president, Stephen  Schley has exemplified the stewardship that defines Maine's forest  products industry. His retirement provides an opportunity to celebrate  his many contributions to the economy, environment, and the communities  that make up the great State of Maine.   It can truly be said that Steve's commitment to Maine and our forests  is in his DNA. In 1820, the year Maine became a State, Massachusetts  shipping businessman David Pingree began investing in Maine  forestlands. Nearly two centuries later, as a descendant of that  visionary leader, Steve has helped to make Pingree Associates a model  of sustainable forestry, environmental responsibility, economic  development, and public access.   Today Pingree Associates' lands in Maine approach 1 million acres.  Steve has always recognized that with those great holdings comes great  responsibility, and he has always measured every initiative by its  benefit to the communities and people of Maine. He has devoted time and  effort to engaging with organizations statewide that seek to provide  support for these communities and their development, both inside and  outside his role in forest management.   Just a few examples from a long career demonstrate his commitment. In  the 1990s, under Steve's leadership, the Pingree lands in Maine became  the largest forest in North America to earn certification for  sustainable forestry practices. In 2001, he guided the agreement that  established a 750,000-acre conservation easement, also the largest on  our continent, to ensure continued public recreational access to  undeveloped woodlands. In recent years, as the industry has sought to  address the challenges of a changing economy, Steve has been a leader  in supporting research into forest bioproducts and developing new  economic opportunities for the entire forest products industry. He has  always recognized the value in engaging with all stakeholders and has  worked in cooperation with the University of Maine to foster the next  generation of foresters. Indeed, he worked to establish the endowment  of the University's Forestry School, recognizing the unique perspective  and unparalleled training that comes with working in the forests of  Maine.   The people of Maine have always been faithful stewards of our forests  because we appreciate their tremendous value to our way of life. As  president of Pingree Associates, Steve Schley has honored our heritage  and helped to shape the economic, environmental, and recreational  future of our entire State. I commend him for his dedication to Maine's  natural treasures and our way of life and thank him for his years of  stewardship.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the  Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act, which Senator Cantwell and I are  reintroducing today.   Few issues are as important to the American people as the  availability of good jobs in our communities. It is crucial that we  continue to improve job training initiatives to help people find jobs  in fields with open positions. Many business owners in Maine have told  me that they do, in fact, have jobs available, but they cannot find  qualified workers to fill these highly skilled vacant positions. In  fact, I cannot visit a machine shop in the State of Maine, no matter  where it is located, and find that they are not looking for skilled  machinists. There is such a shortage. And those are good jobs. They are  jobs with good benefits and job security.    One way for employees to acquire the skills needed to succeed in  these in-demand fields is through apprenticeship programs. Apprentices  gain hands-on experience that is invaluable to them and to their  employers. These programs help workers secure good-paying jobs.   According to the Department of Labor's Employment and Training  Administration, more than 49,000 participants graduated from an  apprenticeship program in fiscal year 2016. In Maine, we have some  innovative job-training apprenticeship programs at places like Bath  Iron Works, which builds naval destroyers, and the Portsmouth Naval  Ship Yard, which has an extraordinary program. Partnering with  employers like these and others, more than 2,220 individuals in Maine  worked actively on industry-recognized skill certifications in just the  last year. That number--impressive as it is--remains insufficient to  meet the needs of employers statewide.   We must do all we can to ensure that an adequate pool of skilled  workers is available. Our legislation would help achieve this goal by  giving a $5,000 tax credit to businesses that hire apprentices full  time in high-demand mechanical, technical, healthcare, or technology  professions. In order for a business to claim the credit, the  apprentice must be employed for at least 7 months. What we find is that  the people who go through these apprenticeship programs stay in these  jobs, thus benefiting both the worker and the employer.   Our bill also provides incentives for experienced workers who spend  at least 20 percent of their time passing their hard-earned knowledge  on to the next generation. These workers would be allowed to receive  some retirement income early without facing tax penalties. That is a  way we can ensure that the experienced older worker is passing  knowledge on to the next generation.   Finally, our bill would ensure that the brave men and women who  defend our country are given credit for the skills they learned in the  military while wearing our Nation's uniform. Training received while  serving in the Armed Forces would count toward an apprentice's training  requirement.   This bill would help to better align the needs of our Nation's  employers with potential employees. It would promote hiring and the  creation of new jobs. It would enhance the skills that the people of  our country need to obtain good-paying, secure employment. The  Presiding Officer and I were talking about this very issue at lunch  today and the need to bridge that skills gap.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support our bill, and I want to  salute Senator Cantwell for her leadership over many years in working  on this issue. This is something that should unite us all--Democrats,  Republicans, Independents. It is not a partisan issue; it is looking at  ways that we can help more Americans secure good-paying jobs that will  last them for a lifetime.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Durbin):   S. 1353. A bill to require States to automatically register eligible  voters to vote in elections for Federal offices, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.
