 Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment to exempt rules  under the Clean Air Act from this bill.   According to a 2011 study by the Environmental Protection Agency, the  central benefits of the Clean Air Act exceed costs by a factor of more  than 30 to 1, and the high benefits exceed costs by 90 times. Cleaner  air provides exceptional economic benefits because it results in the  improved health and productivity of Americans and reduces medical  expenses for air pollution-related health problems.   The Clean Air Act will prevent thousands of early deaths; and its air  quality and health benefits, including the prevention of heart attacks  and the reduction of pulmonary diseases like chronic bronchitis, will  grow over time.   Representative Raskin's amendment, which would exempt all rules that  relate to the Clean Air Act, is based on common sense. Cleaner air  benefits every man, woman, and child in the country. If the  Environmental Protection Agency is prevented or delayed from  promulgating new regulations relating to the Clean Water Act because of  cost, the children of this country will pay a very heavy price.   I hope that all Members will understand the need for exempting rules  that result in cleaner air for our children and support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 31, after line 24, add the following new title (and       update the table of contents accordingly):                            TITLE VI--EXEMPTIONS       SEC. 601. EXEMPTION RELATING TO PROTECTIONS FOR                     WHISTLEBLOWERS.         The provisions of this Act do not apply to any rule or set       of rules relating to--        (1) protections for whistleblowers; or        (2) penalties for retaliation against whistleblowers.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from this bill  any rule that protects whistleblowers or that imposes penalties on  individuals who retaliate against whistleblowers. This bill would  jeopardize all agency rulemakings--no matter how important--even rules  that protect whistleblowers.   The Department of Energy issued a ruling in December that would  authorize the department to impose civil penalties on Federal nuclear  contractors who retaliate against whistleblowers who report information  concerning nuclear safety. On January 31, 2017, DOE put a moratorium on  that rule in response to President Trump's mandated freeze on  rulemakings.   This is exactly the kind of rule that could become a casualty of this  bill. We must ensure that agencies can issue rules that protect  individuals who blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as  safety issues that can be a matter of life and death.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Project on  Government Oversight supporting my amendment. That letter states:  ``Whistleblowers are the first and best line of defense against  significant problems on federal projects and must be protected from  retribution for the act of reporting wrongdoing. Regulations to protect  those whistleblowers should be exempt from the SCRUB Act 2017.''                                                          Project on                                            Government Oversight,                                  Washington, DC, February 28, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington           DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the Project On Government Oversight (POGO), I would like to       voice my support for the whistleblower protection amendment       to the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are       Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2017 (SCRUB Act) introduced       by Ranking Member Elijah Cummings of the House Oversight and       Government Reform Committee.        POGO is an independent nonprofit that has, for 35 years,       investigated and exposed corruption and misconduct in order       to achieve a more accountable federal government. As such,       our organization is deeply committed to protecting       whistleblowers within the federal government and its       contractors. This amendment will explicitly protect any       agency-promulgated regulations that protect whistleblowers or       that lay out penalties for those who retaliate against       whistleblowers from being targeted as ``unnecessarily       burdensome'' under the SCRUB Act.        These regulations, like a Department of Energy (DOE) rule       that would have allowed the Department to impose civil       penalties against contractors who retaliate against       whistleblowers, are already being disrupted by the current       regulatory freeze. Whistleblowers are the first and best line       of defense against significant problems on federal projects       and must be protected from retribution for the act of       reporting wrongdoing. Regulations to protect those       whistleblowers should be exempt from the SCRUB Act of 2017.        We are happy to champion this amendment and hope it will       receive the bipartisan support it deserves.            Sincerely,                                                    Danielle Brian,                                                Executive Director.     Let me say that whistleblowers have played a very  significant role in our committee, the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee. As a matter of fact, many of the reforms that have come have  come because people were bold enough to stand up and come forward and  provide information that we would not have gotten. One of the things,  Mr. Chairman, that we have said over and over again on a bipartisan  basis is that we will protect whistleblowers.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.  [[Page H1414]]         Let me say this, Mr. Chairman, I have, as the ranking  member of our committee, had many opportunities to sit and listen to  whistleblowers who were shaking in their shoes. They were worried. But  there was something that they wanted to do that was far more important  to them than just that moment. They were trying to make sure that they  did the right thing, and they brought it to the attention of people  that they thought would listen to them and would do something about  their concerns when they felt they had got to the point where, in many  instances, they felt that they had nobody to go to.   This administration has been very interesting. If there is any time  that we need to be protecting whistleblowers, it is right now because  there are so many people in our government who feel that they are under  threat. They see things changing, and many of them are in fear.   I appreciate what the gentleman said, but I don't care how you look  at this. If somebody has the nerve to come up and say, I want my  government to be better--some people have told me, I want to preserve  my democracy. I want it to be a democracy for my children so they can  have the democracy that I had when I was born--and they have the nerve  to come up, then we have to do everything in our power. We have to send  that message, and the message needs to come from here. It may not come  from the White House, but it has got to come from here.   That is why this concerns me so much. Any message other than that  says to those people that they have got to keep hiding, they have got  to keep shaking in their boots, and they have got to keep silent when,  deep in their souls, they want to make a difference.   We are better than that.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland  will be postponed.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings  will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 115-20 on  which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:   Amendment No. 8 by Ms. Bonamici of Oregon.
