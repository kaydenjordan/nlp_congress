 Madam Speaker, no one should need permission from a judge  or a Governor to make a personal choice for their family and for their  health.   This week, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that 31-year-old mother of  two, Kate Cox, was not entitled to a medically necessary abortion  despite her doctor's concerns for her health. She had to make the  decision to leave her State to access the care she needed and deserved,  a choice that is not available to everyone.   Ms. Cox is not the first woman to be denied lifesaving care, and she  will certainly not be the last.   Women across this country in States like Texas, Kentucky,  Mississippi, Idaho, and others have been stripped of their most basic  rights.   It is disturbing. It is dangerous.   We know that these extreme laws are going to cost lives, and they  disproportionately impact women of color and low-income women.  Republicans are literally denying women the lifesaving care they need.   The Dobbs decision did exactly what it was intended to do: to strip  women of their bodily autonomy. It is inhumane, it is cruel, and it is  clearly against the will of the American people.   We cannot let them win.                            ____________________
