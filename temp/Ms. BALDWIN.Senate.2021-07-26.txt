 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  installation of a historical marker in the Good Hope Missionary Baptist  Church yard on August 1, 2021, that will memorialize the life and death  of three citizens who were lynched in 1908. This month, my constituent,  Ms. Joyce Salter Johnson, will travel with friends and family from  Wisconsin to Mississippi to honor her relative Frank Johnson, as one of  those three men who were violently murdered in Hickory, MS.   This historical marker is part of the important work being done by  the Equal Justice Initiative in honoring and memorializing lives lost  to racial violence in this country through its Community Remembrance  Project. With its mission to end mass incarceration and excessive  punishment in the United States, challenge racial and economic  injustice, and protect basic human rights for the most vulnerable, the  Equal Justice Initiative has been working to expose the truth, advocate  for change, and create hope for historically marginalized communities.  Lawyer and author Bryan Stevenson founded Equal Justice Initiative in  1989, and since then, it has grown to an organization of robust  projects, hands-on education, and publically accessible museums and  memorials. In April of 2018, following in the footsteps of the late Dr.  James Cameron of Milwaukee's Black Holocaust Museum in my home State of  Wisconsin, the Equal Justice Initiative--EJI--opened America's first  national memorial dedicated to victims of racial terror lynching and a  new museum dedicated to slavery and its legacy was opened in  Montgomery, AL.   EJI's Community Remembrance Project partners with community  coalitions to do extensive research of documented victims of racial  violence. EJI fosters critical conversations about our history and race  and justice today. The Community Remembrance Project memorializes  documented victims of racial violence and its Community Soil Collection  Project gathers soil at lynching sites for display in powerful exhibits  honoring these victims. Narrative historical markers are erected in  public locations where violence took place.   My constituent, Wisconsin resident Joyce Salter Johnson, is a  historian whose third book provides a well-researched history of the  Freedmen Settlement of Good Hope, MS, where she lived until the age of  10. Thus, prior to EJI's documentation, she knew the terrible sequence  of events that led to the October 10, 1908, lynching of her relative,  Mr. Frank Johnson, and the two others. Given her knowledge, research  skills, and inclinations, she was well-suited to take leadership among  the coalition members working on the Community Remembrance Project for  these men, and for that, I am thankful.   I commend the work of the Equal Justice Initiative and all who help  further the Community Remembrance Project's mission of confronting the  legacy of slavery, lynching, and segregation and charting a better  future. And I extend my solidarity to Ms. Johnson and her family and  friends on their personal journey of remembrance and memorial.                            ____________________
