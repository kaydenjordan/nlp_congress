 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson) for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, President Biden's plan to tame escalating inflation  passes the buck to Americans once again. Costs for driving to work,  feeding families, housing, and utilities are under unimaginable  increases and strain on my constituents, thanks to the disastrous  policies.   President Biden largely puts responsibility on the Federal Reserve to  stabilize inflation. However, the shocks that the Biden administration  has brought to our economy are out of the Fed's control. Sure, they  play a role here. A majority of the inflation, however, has been caused  by the assault on domestic energy, excessive government spending, and  incentivizing a lack of American productivity.    President Biden then wonders why we don't embrace his plan to reduce  inflation by tapping the emergency energy reserves. Somehow that is  going to lower gas prices. Well, it hasn't. It is a bad idea, and it  hasn't made a dent.   Shockingly, against every fundamental of economics that we are even  taught back in the seventh grade, Madam Speaker, he wants to raise  taxes on American businesses, which, according to the Biden  administration, will reduce the deficit, slow inflation, and create  jobs. I am surprised it wouldn't put food on the table as well.   Americans, in their opinion, need relief right now, not in some far  off, far out way. Small businesses are rightfully concerned about  surviving after having to absorb huge new costs since the Biden  administration came into office. And this is factual. The data is  there, and the graphs are there.   Bidenomics has greatly worsened what was and is a challenging time  for our economy. But digging a hole much deeper than necessary and  exacerbating pain for Americans who are struggling to cope with one  economic hardship after another is certainly not the answer.   There is no doubt the Federal Reserve's delay in acting did make  inflation worse, and America's overreliance on goods made in China also  contributed to inflation, along with the COVID supply chain setbacks.  However, we would be nowhere near the position we are in now if it were  not for the terrible Bidenomics that they put in place. These reckless  actions have turned economic challenges into a full-blown, as some  describe, hurricane of an economic crisis.   These policies have spearheaded an assault, an absolute assault, on  our domestic energy--this is unforgivable--over the last 18 months.   President Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline. That was just the  start of it. He halted issuance of other pipeline and drilling  permits--far less were issued than were ever issued during the Obama  years; mitigated LNG exports; threatened domestic banks and investment  companies against investing in carbon fuels.   Our domestic energy went from a state of independence and surplus to  a high level of dependency. After these Biden administration policies  kicked in, the U.S. became at the mercy, once again, to the energy  players like OPEC and Russia, meaning any geopolitical disruption would  spike gas prices, leading to cascades of issues for Americans,  consumers, and businesses.   Madam Speaker, we have seen this before. This is a rerun. This is why  U.S. domestic energy independence is so crucial.   However, the administration, and many in this Chamber, have a ``go  green now or else'' mentality, which has generated $5-plus gasoline  prices and caused natural gas to go so far high up in price that  fertilizer costs have caused farmers' prices and costs to skyrocket. Of  course, food on everybody's table soon followed.                                time  1715    Biden and the Democrats--and it is far too many Democrats, frankly-- in Congress continued spending trillions which exacerbated inflation,  leading to predictable inflation where even Democrats such as Larry  Summers, an economist, stated, look out for a rapid rise and a  sustained inflationary period.   Many others said, Oh, no, Larry's wrong this time. Well, Larry was  not wrong. Now, with the threat of tax increases and a laundry list of  every regulatory antigrowth measure imaginable, this woke, go-broke  economy is going to continue to fail American families.   Madam Speaker, we must encourage responsible domestic energy  production. We must lower taxes to rev up our economy. The United  States must have the most competitive economy in the world, job  creation machine and perhaps a job creation tax credit.   We must support production of items made in America. We must do our  very best to buy American, and we need to pivot from this awful path  that we continue to be on.   I will wrap up by simply stating that we must recognize where the  problem started, what the problem is, have a plan for solutions, and  that means having the courage to change course now.
