 Mr. Speaker, this month marks the end of the school  year for students. And, of course, that means graduation and promotion  celebrations.   I want to congratulate all of our students on their achievements and  their proud family members.   To our teachers, faculty, and staff, we thank you for your continued  commitment to educating our children. We know that there are many  challenges in today's learning environment, but amid the challenges we  face, you stand strong. We appreciate all of your work.   As a representative in Congress for the Virgin Islands, I pledge to  continue to support legislation and initiatives that make our children,  teachers, and administrators a priority.   To the students of the U.S. Virgin Islands, I have a message for you:  During these summer months, please take this time to continue to learn,  participate in the Governor's reading challenge, find a new hobby,  work, and please explore the natural wonder of our home, the Virgin  Islands of the United States. Be safe, and best wishes to you all as  you continue a productive educational journey. Have a safe and fun- filled summer.                            ____________________
