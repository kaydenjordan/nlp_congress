 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, this vote is not  one man, one party, or even one day. It is about protecting our Nation,  preserving democracy and the rule of law.   The facts are clear and undisputed: President Trump used a litany of  lies about a stolen election and willfully incited an armed  insurrection with the intent of stopping the peaceful transfer of  power. He attacked not just the Capitol, not just Congress, he even  attacked democracy itself. That is why he must be impeached.
