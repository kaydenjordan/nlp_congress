 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to congratulate the  House for passing the NDAA, National Defense Authorization Act.   It is a win for Pennsylvania, and it is a win for civil defense  workers all over this country.   Namely, Tobyhanna Army Depot in my district is a winner here, because  this fixes a problem.   There is a wage and salary disparity between the maps. There is a map  mismatch that has been going on that I have been fighting ever since I  got to Congress.   This year, my bill, the Locality Pay Equity Act, got in the NDAA.  [[Page H3843]]    Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to Chairman Smith of the Armed Services  Committee and the entire Armed Services Committee and the overwhelming  vote on a bipartisan basis of the U.S. House to pass this.   At long last, wage-grade workers in the civil defense industry in  these particular districts will be paid fairly and equally alongside  the salaried people they work side by side with.   This is a great day for Tobyhanna and a great day for the people who  have the backs of the people who are our warfighters all over the  world.                            ____________________
