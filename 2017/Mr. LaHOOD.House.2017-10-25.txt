 Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago, I had the privilege of  presenting a Purple Heart to Mr. Anthony Smith of Warsaw, Illinois, in  my congressional district.   During the Vietnam war, Anthony served in the Army's 1st Cavalry  Division. In 1968, on a particular bad day for our troops, Anthony was  able to single-handedly take out several enemy machine gun units,  protecting his fellow soldiers from harm and death.   Anthony's bravery on that day was rewarded with a Bronze Star with  Valor, and with a Purple Heart, although he was not given a physical  Purple Heart medal at the time. Almost 50 years later, our office  worked to help correct this, and it was one of the highest honors of my  time in office to present Anthony Smith with this well-deserved medal  in front of a crowd of his friends and family in Warsaw last Tuesday,  October 17.   I want to thank Anthony Smith for his bravery and service to our  country, his dedication and commitment to our military, and to the  entire Warsaw community for coming out to support this true American  hero. We are indebted to his service, and we honor him today.                            ____________________
