 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 379, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2372) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  clarify the rules relating to veteran health insurance and eligibility  for the premium tax credit, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include in the Record any extraneous material on the  bill currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would first like to thank Chairman Brady for his strong support of  this bill, the Veterans Equal Treatment Ensures Relief and Access Now  Act, the VETERAN Act. This important legislation, which was reported  out of the Ways and Means Committee on a bipartisan basis, will ensure  all eligible veterans have access to quality, affordable private health  insurance.   Mr. Speaker, this Chamber cannot underscore enough the sacrifices of  our veterans and the sacrifices they have made to protect the freedom  and individual liberty of each American. In return for their faithful  service, these brave men and women are promised that, when they return  home, they will have access to affordable healthcare through the  Veterans Administration.   However, some veterans decide to forego their VA benefits and,  instead,  [[Page H4926]]  choose an alternative healthcare. Veterans should have the opportunity  to choose the best healthcare option available to fit their needs. It  is only right that our veterans are given the same opportunity as our  other citizens have and the citizens that they defend.   There have been conflicting reports about the eligibility of certain  veterans to receive tax credits for all health insurance under the  American Health Care Act. Make no mistake about it, no veteran would  see a change in their eligibility status as a result of the AHCA.   In fact, despite the Democrat's claims about veterans' eligibility  for tax credits under the AHCA, when they voted for and signed  ObamaCare into law, they failed to include this very same clarification  in statute. Rather, they left it to the Department of the Treasury to  issue a regulation clarifying that veterans are still eligible for a  credit unless they are enrolled in a VA healthcare benefit plan.   So today this legislation, authorized by my friend and a veteran, Mr.  Sam Johnson, should put into law current practice confirming that  veterans can, without question, get a tax credit to purchase health  insurance in the individual market if they choose not to enroll in VA  coverage.   It is important to note that AHCA initially proposed to put into law  this current practice, but that provision had to be removed due to  Senate guidance about their Chamber's unique reconciliation rules.  While I am disappointed that this happened, I am glad that this body is  acting on this item today.   I would note that this legislation has received the support of  several veterans' organizations, including the Paralyzed Veterans of  America, the Association of the United States Navy, and The Retired  Enlisted Association.   I think that something we can all agree on is that our veterans  should have the choice in where they receive their healthcare, just  like the American citizens they defended. In that spirit, this bill is  something we can all get behind.   To our veterans and their families, I thank them for their service.  To my friend Sam Johnson, I thank him for his leadership and the  authoring of this important bill.   I ask my colleagues for their support of the VETERAN Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with Ranking Member Neal that this  is just a difference of opinion. It is a difference of policy opinion.  There is no animosity on either side of this debate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.  [[Page H4927]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to express my  gratitude to Ranking Member Neal and his hard work on the Ways and  Means Committee and his keeping the issue before us.   But the AHCA makes no changes to veterans' healthcare. Under this  bill, unless vets decide to enroll in VA coverage, they are eligible  for financial support. Veterans should have the opportunity to choose  the best healthcare option to meet their needs. It is only right that  our veterans are given the same opportunities as the citizens that they  defended.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the VETERAN Act. I ask  for its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.
