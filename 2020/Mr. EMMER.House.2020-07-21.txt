 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank Judge Richard Leo  Kelly for a lifetime of distinction and service to this Nation.   Born in Marshall, Minnesota, Judge Kelly is a veteran of the Navy and  served on the USS Noa and USS Willard Keith.   Judge Kelly attended St. John's University in Collegeville,  Minnesota, where his role as the football team starting quarterback  earned him the nickname Golden Arm. He went on to graduate in the top  five of his class from the St. Paul College of Law.   After practicing law for over two decades in Saint Paul and  Springfield, Minnesota, he was elected to the Fifth District judgeship.  He held that office for 17 years and was elected chief judge twice.   Throughout his tenure on the bench, Judge Kelly was known for his  fairness, consistency, and courteous nature, in keeping with the  highest ideals of public service.   In 1998, Governor Arne Carlson declared June 27 to be Judge Richard  L. Kelly Day, a time to practice and honor the principles that Judge  Kelly embodies.   Judge Kelly and his wife are residents of Minnesota's Sixth  Congressional District. It is an honor to serve them in Congress. They  serve as a testament of dedication to service and honor, a mission that  their seven children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren  have carried on because of Judge Kelly and Mary's exemplary lives.   Madam Speaker, I thank Judge Kelly for a lifetime of work to our  State and Nation.                            ____________________
