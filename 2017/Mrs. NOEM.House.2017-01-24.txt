 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7, the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure  Act.   Specifically, this bill says directly that Federal taxpayer dollars  could not be used to provide abortions. It does not do more than that.  What it does is it puts into statute a permanency to legislation that  has annually been renewed.   Becoming a parent was something that my husband and I always dreamed  about. And when we did realize that we were having our first child, we  prayed for her and we prayed for our future children, recognizing that  they were a gift from God and that that life was to be protected even  from the moment of conception.   That is the belief that I have, and my hope and my dream for everyone  here in America is that we would recognize that those children are a  gift from God to us to protect, to keep, and to make sure that they are  brought into this world safely and helped from thereon. My perspective  and my profound commitment to protecting unborn children is why I am  standing here today.   Time and again, Congress has risen with bipartisan support to oppose  taxpayer-funded abortions. Annual provisions, including the Hyde  amendment, have been passed repeatedly; and they have been estimated to  save over 2 million innocent lives. Our goal here is to save even more.  We need to make these provisions permanent.   ObamaCare has allowed the tax dollars of hardworking Americans to  flow to over 1,000 abortion-covering health plans. This has made  today's bipartisan legislation more important than ever.   H.R. 7 would create a permanent governmentwide prohibition against  Federal dollars to fund abortive procedures. It would also ensure the  Affordable Care Act complies with the Hyde amendment until it is  repealed and replaced. That is the right thing to do.                                time  1430    Today we stand to make sure that every single life is valued, not  just the ones that we pick and choose for political reasons; that every  single one that God has created has an opportunity to live out their  dreams here in the United States of America.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).
