 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for the  way that, on a nightly basis, he comes down to the well and helps  inform people. Jefferson, in the writings of our Founding Fathers,  talked about how important it was to have an informed electorate.   I just really appreciate the way the gentleman gives people clarity  and information that they can then digest and make their decisions  with. That process of informing is, I think, a vital part of the  politic. He does it on the daily basis, and I appreciate it. His doing  so matters to me and to the people that I represent.   I appreciate so much the gentleman's yielding because I want to talk  just a couple of minutes about a bill that I introduced today entitled  the REAL ID Privacy Protection Act.   It is a bipartisan bill. It is supported from the Republican side by  people like Mark Meadows. It is supported on the Democratic side by  Democrats like Chellie Pingree from Maine. I think they do so because  it is a commonsense bill that gets at some of the deficiencies that one  can find in REAL ID.   Quite specifically, what it does is eliminate the requirement that  your personal documentation and documents be held and archived, in  essence,  [[Page H807]]  in warehouses for 10 years. It will not require your stuff to be out in  government databases for 10 years. Secondly, it eliminates the  requirement that the DMV databases be co-linked. Thirdly, it creates  uniformity with regard to the way in which extensions are granted.    So the bottom line is your driver's license could still be used to  get you in the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort or it could be used to  go into Joint Base Charleston or a whole host of other facilities  around this country. More significantly, for the average flying public,  you could still use your driver's license next year to be able to get  on a plane in the United States of America.   Why is all this important?   It is important because individual privacy matters. It is important  because equal treatment under the law matters. It is important because  the 10th Amendment really matters. States have a role in which the  Founding Fathers intended the Federal Government to fit with the State  government, to fit with local government, and to fit with individual  prerogative.   Now let's examine each one of those couple of things. One, if you  look at South Carolina driver's licenses, just as an example, they are  secure. We have holograms. We have barcodes. We have a whole host of  different things that create security.   Yet, in the wake of 9/11, what the Federal Government, Homeland  Security, and others decided at that time was that, in essence, what  they wanted was a de facto national ID card and for the Federal  Government to, in essence, federalize what had previously been a State  function, with State's issuing driver's licenses.   There is not a Federal driver's license. Texas has driver's licenses,  South Carolina has driver's licenses, Florida has driver's licenses.  Each State may have a little bit different way of doing so, but it was  a state prerogative.   In the wake of that Federal requirement--I was wearing a different  hat at the time; I was wearing a Governor's hat--I joined with, for  instance, Governor Schweitzer from Montana in saying: Wait, this  doesn't make sense. The States still have a vital role here. This role  does not need to be federalized. We pushed back and, long story short,  we were successful with many others in that effort. Yet, what is  happening is many of those deadline requirements are now reemerging and  approaching.   The question we have to ask ourselves in Congress is: What are we  going to do about it? Are we going to push back again? Or are we going  to try and slow this again? Or are we just going to let the Federal  Government come in and steamroll what has been a State function?   I think it is important that we act, and that is why we introduced  this bill. It, again, gets at three important things. One, privacy  matters. Quite simply, if government doesn't need your stuff, they  don't get your stuff. I think that is a simple premise. Again, let me  say it again. If government really doesn't need your stuff, it  shouldn't get your stuff.   What do I mean by that?   What I mean is, if the requirement, as is now the case, is that the  Federal Government take your personal information and they archive it  for the next 10 years, do you really feel that you are more secure?   I would argue that is not at all the case. I would argue that it is  much better to have a system that, when you take your birth  certificate, you take your marriage license, you take your divorce  papers, you take your citizenship papers, whatever it is that you have,  take it all, let folks at the government level decide whether you are  who you are or whether you are not who you are, and then give your  stuff back to you. They don't need to house it for the next 10 years.   That is all this bill does. If you house it for the next 10 years, in  fact, there is a considerable cost. The unfunded mandate to States is  $17 billion.   So what we are saying is make the determination. Take, again, all  your stuff, look at it, but then give it back, rather than requiring  States to archive this stuff for the next 10 years.   It also matters because, again, of individual human privacy. Whether  it is a divorce decree, whether it is a marriage license, whether it is  citizenship papers, whatever it is, we have been in hearings over the  last couple of weeks where it was proven that the Russians were quite  involved in hacking of American databases.   Why do we want to open that up to Chinese hackers, Russian hackers,  to whoever it is, if it isn't required and necessary from the  standpoint of security?   Two, this bill simply gets at the notion that States matter. The 10th  Amendment matters. Patton was once attributed with saying that, if you  tell a soldier to take a hill, tell them to take the hill. Don't tell  them how to attack the hill.   The same is true of the Federal Government as it relates to States.  Give us a secured requirement, but then allow Texas to go about their  way of taking the hill and South Carolina to come with its way of  attacking the hill, as long as we take the hill, which is the necessary  security requirement.   I think it is also important from the standpoint of security that one  thing we have learned over time is that centralization of data does not  make data more secure. We have a host of different breaches that have  occurred at the Federal level that prove this point.   I think that one of the things that is interesting about Pearl Harbor  is that the boats were in one spot and it was one-stop shopping for the  Japanese. So, in fact, what we have seen in terms of military strategy  going forward is people spread assets out. They don't want them  congregated all in one spot so that an attacker would be able to take  down a multitude of different assets with one particular raid. I think  the same is true in the information age, as it relates to databases.   Finally, this bill is about equal treatment under the law. I think  that what many States--South Carolina would be among them--are  concerned about is: Is this too subjective? If you happen to be a blue  State versus a red State, does that have some degree of determination  in the way in which you get an extension or you don't get an extension?                                time  1830    Eighteen States and territories have been granted extensions. Seven  States have been granted very limited extensions. All this bill does is  say, Let's make that process transparent so that States can look one to  the other and say, How was it that you got an extension but I didn't? I  think that that level of uniformity would make sure that nobody  suspects this system of being arbitrary or capricious by nature.   That is in simple form what the bill does. Again, it is about your  privacy. We have had a long debate over the course of our country on  security versus freedom, and what we don't want to do is give up  certain, in essence, soul conditions, if you will, for freedom,  including this notion of federalism, in our efforts to be secure. It is  about recognizing that States are not wards of the Federal government,  that a $7 billion unfunded liability really does matter to the  taxpayers of different States. Finally, it is about equal treatment  under the law.   Again, the bill is called the REAL ID Privacy Protection Act. I would  ask Members to join us on that bill. I would ask folks out there  listening to talk to their House Member about that bill because I think  it is one that makes a whole lot of sense.   I would say, again, how much I appreciate the gentleman from Texas  yielding. Most of all, I thank him for the way he comes down to the  well on such a regular basis to inform the American public.
