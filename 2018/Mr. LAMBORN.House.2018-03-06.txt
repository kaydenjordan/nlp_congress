 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman King for his endless  and tireless leadership in reminding us of the humanity of the unborn.  I am a proud cosponsor of the Heartbeat Protection Act. I am one of  those 170 who have stepped forward to support this much-needed piece of  legislation.   The development of an unborn baby is truly miraculous. Around 6 to 8  weeks, you can detect, through ultrasound, the heartbeat of the little  child inside the mother's womb; 6 to 8 weeks. So I don't see how people  can deny that an abortion is the taking of a human life.   How many lives would we save if we remembered that simple fact?   What if instead of rushing to abortion, which some people think is  their only option, we instead turned our attention to addressing  practical needs, the needs of a woman facing a pregnancy decision?   What if we empowered women to carry and raise their child?   Or what if we did everything we could to promote a stable and happy  life for the child through adoption?   America was built on the principle that life is a God-given gift.  Here, in Congress, it is our duty to protect  [[Page H1436]]  human life at all stages. I will continue to do so, and I know  Representative King will continue to do so. I thank him for his  leadership. I am glad that I can support him with this wonderful piece  of legislation.
