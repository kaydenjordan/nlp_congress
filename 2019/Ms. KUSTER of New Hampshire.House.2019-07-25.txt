 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the  House for passing H.R. 3239 to provide humanitarian standards for  migrants and refugees in Customs and Border Protection custody at our  border.   Having visited the U.S.-Mexico border now twice in the past 12  months, I know how desperately this bill was needed.   We have good news and bad news. The good news is that the children,  the young children, are no longer being separated from their biological  parents, although we did see 310 children separated from aunts, uncles,  and grandparents.   But the worst news was the migrants who we saw held in overcrowded  conditions for up to 40 to 60 days without any access to basic  services, like a hot meal or a shower or being able to brush their  teeth.   These are inhumane conditions and a human rights violation.   That is why I was proud to cosponsor the bill sponsored by Dr. Raul  Ruiz to enact critical safety, nutrition, and hygiene standards for  migrants in custody. I was pleased that the House accepted my  amendments to protect women from sexual assault at the border.                            ____________________
