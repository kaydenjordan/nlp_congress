 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding and  certainly for the work that we have all done, particularly under his  leadership, to bring this to the floor.   Mr. Chair, this bill continues that long tradition of transparent and  bipartisan work by the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee to  support the development and delivery of capabilities that make  America's land forces the best in the world.   Mr. Chair, I would like to thank our subcommittee ranking member,  Mrs. Hartzler, for her collaboration and contribution to the bill. Both  she and her staff have been helpful during this entire process. It is  certainly what works well here in Congress. And I appreciate her  commitment to the bipartisan tradition we proudly uphold on our  subcommittee.   The subcommittee mark was adopted by unanimous voice vote, which is  indicative of how important it was to both Democrats and Republicans,  but most importantly, Americans.   This cooperation helped us focus on what is important: that we  deliver a defense authorization act that meets the modernization and  readiness requirements of our Nation's air and land forces.   The committee used the $733 billion as a top line based on sworn  testimony from military officials, and the $733 billion is the amount  that would give our forces a competitive advantage, based on the  capabilities of Russia and China, by 2025.   In fact, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dunford,  said that $733 billion:         Is completely informed by the analysis conducted by the       military, for the path of capability development.    This goes to the heart of the conversation that we are having here:  Are we doing what is right? Certainly the military spelled that out in  the number that they provided for the research, development, and  acquisition of modern defense systems recommended by our military  leaders.   At the same time, this bill includes bipartisan provisions that  increase our oversight of the Department's largest, most complex, and  expensive programs to protect the taxpayers, support our troops, and  boost American industry.    Overall, this is a thoughtful, carefully constructed bill that  emphasizes aggressive, effective oversight for the development of our  country.
