 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Republicans unveiled their vision  for tax reform, and it is not pretty.   The proposal raises taxes on the middle class and showers the  wealthiest 1 percent of our country with 80 percent of the benefits, at  a total cost of $1.5 trillion charged to our Nation's credit card.   The plan should be called ``Hurt the Middle Class Act.''   It eliminates personal deductions for medical expenses; it eliminates  the deductibility of interest paid on student loans; it eliminates the  deductibility of State and local income taxes, again, raising taxes on  the middle class; and to add insult to injury, the proposal eliminates  the deduction for personal property losses from one natural disaster  fire.   Now, in California, we just experienced the worst fires in  California's history. Over 14,000 people lost their homes, at a cost of  at least $3 billion. The heck with them.   When policies weaken the middle class, the backbone of our country,  they weaken our entire country. The President said tax reform will be  the best Christmas present of all, but, for the middle class, this bill  will be one lump of coal.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this bill, the so-called  CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. First of all, we are a month late and  many dollars short. It was the majority that brought it up late. We  didn't have anything to do with being late.   Secondly, we are playing political games with the lives of 14 percent  of the children in my congressional district who receive their health  insurance through the Children's Health Insurance Program and the five  federally qualified health centers in my congressional district. They  provide medical, dental, and mental health services to almost 55,000 of  my constituents every year.   Reauthorizing these historically bipartisan programs is critical to  the health and safety of not only my constituents but millions of  others across our country.   Today, the Republican majority is holding them hostage by insisting  to fund these programs by means-testing Medicare beneficiaries, kicking  individuals who purchase their health coverage on the marketplaces off  their insurance, and gutting the Public Health Prevention Fund  established in the Affordable Care Act.   Remember, the Republicans have set their budget based on eliminating  the Affordable Care Act. My State of California will run out of funding  for CHIP sometime between now and December. This has never happened  before in the history of this program.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, the community health centers in my district  have told me about the difficult decisions they have to make because  Congress has not reauthorized their funding, including layoffs of  physicians and closing clinics' doors. We are playing with people's  lives here.   If we can't find the funding for these important bipartisan programs,  then we don't deserve to be Members of Congress. I cannot support a  bill that hurts people instead of helping them.
