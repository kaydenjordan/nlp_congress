 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  putting on this very, very Special Order so we can address a very  serious issue that is plaguing our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, a  standard of unparalleled violence against an innocent population in  this country. The biggest casualty caused by Roe v. Wade are the 62  million children killed before they had a chance.   Our forefathers believed that every man, woman, and child has a God- given right to life. Our Constitution makes no caveat for only those  who can walk, talk, and speak.   Because of my children and my faith, protecting life is a very  personal responsibility to me. As a Catholic, I can testify how faith  encourages strength of character, urges truthfulness, and prioritizes  the sanctity of life.   The sad truth is that you will find many of the politicians claiming  to be religious actively rejecting each of these faith-founded  principles. The most basic way to exercise faith is by adhering to the  Ten Commandants, including thou shalt not kill.   I appreciate all of my friends and colleagues in Congress who are  standing up and speaking up for those who cannot today. I am grateful  to know that there are Americans who will speak and fight alongside me  on behalf of millions of unborn babies who cannot defend themselves.
