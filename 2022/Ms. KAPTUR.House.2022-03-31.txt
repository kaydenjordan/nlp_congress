 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with considerable anticipation  as Great Lakes Members introduce legislation to create the Great Lakes  Authority.   The Great Lakes Authority is an instrumentality that will unlock our  freshwater, industrial heartland's full potential for the century  ahead.  [[Page H4012]]    The Midwest communities our Members represent are home to people who  make, build, and grow that which makes, builds, and grows America.   For decades, however, our region has borne the brunt of job losses  associated with disastrous trade policies, underinvestment, and  deindustrialization.   Since the passage of NAFTA in 1993, China's entrance into the World  Trade Organization in 2001, and CAFTA's passage in 2005, over 91,000  factories have closed across our country.   Nearly 5 million good-paying jobs have been lost, and our region has  been very hard hit and is clawing its way back.   But our workers and their families in Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York, in the Great  Lakes watershed have suffered enormously as middle class jobs  evaporated.    The tragedy does not end there. Local governments have been left to  scramble as declining revenues led to the collapse of their budgets and  the accrual of crushing bonded indebtedness.   The size and scope of these accumulated economic challenges are too  much for any one city or county or, indeed, State to overcome alone.  Places like Toledo, Ohio, Lorain, Detroit, Buffalo, Flint, Rochester,  all the towns along the old Erie Canal struggle to recover from the  outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to penny-wage countries.   Chicago, Cleveland, and Erie, Pennsylvania, alone are limited in  their ability to halt climate change and reverse its increasing effects  on their shorelines and neighborhoods.   The Great Lakes region needs a boost through accelerated investments  and strategic and coordinated support to get back on track.   Last year, President Biden and congressional Democrats accomplished  what many had tried but failed to do, and that is pass an historic  investment in jobs and infrastructure. That is step one.   This support will help empower our communities to begin planning the  necessary steps to rebuilding roads and bridges, improve ports, rail  lines and airports, modernize energy and water infrastructure, and  protect all of our lakes, the freshwater kingdom on this continent.   But to maximize the impact and turbocharge revitalization, our region  really needs a strategic plan to coordinate these resources along,  importantly, with private investment to reboot our future.   The Great Lakes region is the only major economic region in our  country that lacks a Federal entity dedicated to supporting its long- term coordinated economic development and conserving its natural  environment.   The West's water is served by the Bureau of Reclamation, or if you  look at the Delta Regional Authority, it helps 10 million people in the  Delta Region. And more than 400 counties from Mississippi to West  Virginia are served by the Appalachian Regional Commission.   The Great Lakes deserves no less. The Great Lakes Authority Act is  long overdue and will create an instrumentality to serve the Great  Lakes fresh watershed which will become even more important in the  decades to come with each passing day.   The Great Lakes Authority will be a Federal/State instrumentality  like the others to spur job creation and world-class worker education,  training, and adjustment in communities left behind.   It will foster innovation to build forward the struggling core U.S.  manufacturing and industrial base. And it will promote new advances in  renewable energy technologies like solar, wind and hydrogen while  conserving and stewarding our precious environmental assets.   It will allow us an efficient multi-modal transportation shared  network with our closest neighbor, Canada, that connects people and  goods with where they need to go. Indeed, Canada is our largest trading  partner.   For America to compete in this century, we simply need a Great Lakes  Authority, and I urge my colleagues to join us in this important  effort. Please help us help the Great Lakes region.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the passage of the  Affordable Insulin Now Act and urge the other body to swiftly take up  the bill.   Millions of Americans depend upon insulin every single day, but too  many are forced to ration or cut back on their other essential needs  just to pay for the medication that keeps them alive.   In Ohio, the cost of insulin can cost hundreds of dollars a month,  and the pens that are used can cost between $45 and $600. It is simply  unaffordable. Capping the price of insulin at $35 a month means no  longer will families have to choose between grocery and rent or their  own lives. No longer should a diabetic be forced to ration out their  injections just to ensure they have enough until next month.   Congress must act to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act. Let's save  people real money, improve their lives, and afford them the dignity  that they deserve.                            ____________________
