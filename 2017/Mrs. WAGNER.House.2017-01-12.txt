 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Hensarling, the gentleman  from Texas, for his leadership on this issue and on so many regulatory  reform issues that we will be addressing this week and in the future.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to sponsor and bring to the floor H.R. 78, the  SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. This legislation fits perfectly with  the theme of the week here in the House to advance key regulatory  reform ideas as a change of pace from the outgoing administration.   For the past 8 years, the amount of regulatory burden that has been  placed on Americans and small businesses has been crushing. In 2015,  Federal regulation cost almost $1.9 trillion. That is nearly $15,000  per household in a hidden compliance tax.   The Obama administration issued over 600 economically significant  rules, which are those that have an economic impact of over $100  million. As a result of this wave of regulations, we have been part of  the slowest economic recovery in our lifetimes.   We now have an opportunity to enact policy that ensures smart  regulation going forward so that we are doing things in the best and  most efficient way. The people have spoken, Mr. Chair. Business as  usual in Washington is over and it is time to do things differently.  There is, indeed, a better way.   This legislation is really about what everyday Americans do when they  are making major life decisions in weighing the costs and the benefits,  the pros and the cons. Whether it is buying a car, buying a home,  deciding whether to take out a loan to go to school, everyone must  consider the core economic factors when making important life  decisions.   The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act places statutory requirements  on the SEC when issuing rulemaking that ensures that, first, they  identify the problem that regulation is trying to address; second, they  weigh the cost and benefits to ensure that the benefits justify costs  of compliance; and thirdly, they identify and assess whether there are  any available alternatives to rulemaking.   Additionally, this bill contains a provision that requires the SEC to  review its existing regulations every 5 years, at the minimum, to  determine whether any such regulations are outdated, ineffective, or  excessively burdensome, as well as requiring the SEC to modify,  streamline, repeal, or even to expand regulations based on that review.   As a regulator of our capital markets, the SEC has an immeasurable  influence on our economy and the ability of small business and  entrepreneurs to be able to access capital in order to innovate, grow,  and most of all, create jobs.   I strongly believe that this legislation is nonpartisan and common  sense and what our government regulators should have been doing in the  first place. The American people deserve a break from the irresponsible  regulation they have grown accustom to over the past 8 years. There is  a better way.   I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense piece of legislation  and urge passage of it through the House.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez), a new member of the Financial  Services Committee.
