 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4111, the Sovereign  Debt Contract Capacity Act, an important piece of legislation sponsored  by our chairwoman and cosponsored by our committee's lead Republican.   China has now become the world's largest official creditor, but the  details of its lending remain notoriously opaque.   At a hearing in May, the Financial Services Committee examined how  China has been using strict confidentiality arrangements, cross-default  provisions, and other tools to hide the details of its loans and  potentially influence borrowers' domestic and foreign policies.   A recent analysis by the research group AidData has also shown that  42 countries now have public debt exposure to China in excess of 10  percent of their GDP, which is largely hidden from conventional  reporting to the World Bank.   H.R. 4111 would address this problem by supporting technical  assistance from the International Monetary Fund to help developing  countries better assess these debt contracts.   This legislation builds on a bipartisan law authored by our  colleague, Congressman Hill from Arkansas, that requires the Treasury  Department to push for greater Chinese debt transparency at the  international financial institutions.   Together, these two bills are a clear statement that our committee  wants the Treasury Department to prioritize the threat of China's  hidden debt and give countries the necessary technical assistance to  push back on Beijing.    H.R. 4111 is especially timely since the IMF is confronting serious  difficulties carrying out new programs since China has been so slow  negotiating its loans to IMF borrowers.   If the International Monetary Fund can't accurately assess borrowers'  liabilities to Beijing, it will have trouble providing its own  financing. In other words, China's opaque lending practices are not  just a threat to borrowing countries; it puts at risk the operations of  the IMF, World Bank, and other multilateral lenders. This is  unacceptable.   I commend the chairwoman for sponsoring this legislation and hope  that our committee can continue to work in such a bipartisan manner to  address  [[Page H5840]]  China's exploitation of countries around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4111, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, again, for her  strong legislation. I would urge all my colleagues to support H.R.  4111, the Sovereign Debt Contract Capacity Act, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Representative Maloney and Ranking  Member McHenry's bipartisan legislation, H.R. 2989, the Financial  Transparency Act of 2021.   Our securities and banking laws require financial regulatory agencies  to collect countless pieces of data from regulated entities each year.  Yet, there is no consistency in the manner in which they collect this  data. As a result, data is often difficult to find and to understand.   This commonsense legislation ensures our regulatory agencies are  working together to adopt consistent data fields and formats for the  information they collect.   The bill will require our banking and securities regulators to better  organize data and make this information available in open-source  formats. This, in turn, benefits investors, businesses, and even the  Federal Government.   Setting data standards will foster more transparency and increase the  efficiency for everyone who generates, collects, and uses the  information.   This bill will make financial data more easily available. It will  also reduce overhead costs and streamline workloads.   I applaud Congresswoman Maloney and Ranking Member McHenry for their  commitment to this issue.   Reforming our information management practices and establishing  uniform data standards for regulatory reporting is critical to ensuring  an efficient and effective regulatory framework.   I urge Members to support this commonsense piece of legislation and  vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2989, the Financial Transparency Act of 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2989,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 2265, the Financial  Exploitation Prevention Act, a bipartisan bill  [[Page H5850]]  that will help us combat the financial exploitation of seniors and  other vulnerable adults.   I thank Congressman McHenry and Chairwoman Waters for supporting this  important legislation.   Financial exploitation of seniors and other vulnerable adults is a  serious and growing problem.   The number of Americans ages 65 and older is projected to nearly  double, from 52 million in 2018 to 95 million by 2060. This represents  an increase from 16 to 23 percent of the U.S. population being 65 years  old and older.   Right now, approximately 44 percent of households headed by a baby  boomer and 30 percent of silent generation households own mutual funds.   As more investors age into retirement, the risk of financial  exploitation for elderly households only increases. Roughly one in five  senior investors are victimized by financial fraud, and those investors  lose an estimated $2.9 billion annually in reported cases and,  unfortunately, some estimates indicate that only 1 in 44 cases of  financial abuse is ever reported.                                time  1730    My bill proposes a solution to fight elder abuse in the context of  mutual funds.   Since some mutual fund shareholder accounts are held directly with a  mutual fund and serviced by the fund's transfer agent, or ``direct-at- fund'' accounts as they are known, the transfer agent is typically  responsible for opening and servicing the accounts, maintaining account  records, and serving as the fund's point of contact with those  shareholders.   Under current law, when a fund's transfer agent suspects financial  exploitation in a direct-at-fund account, it cannot lawfully delay the  disbursement of redemption proceeds while an investigation occurs.   My legislation codifies a SEC-issued no-action letter from 2018 that  permits a mutual fund and its transfer agents to delay the redemption  period of a security if it is reasonably believed that a request was  made by exploiting seniors or other vulnerable adults.   This will provide our potentially vulnerable investors with an  important layer of investor protection to help make sure that they  receive the hard-earned savings that they have built up over the years.   Additionally, and importantly, my bill also requires the SEC to  report to Congress on additional potential legislative solutions on how  to further combat financial exploitation of seniors and vulnerable  adults.   This legislation, Mr. Speaker, is needed to provide certainty to  protect our seniors, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support the  Financial Exploitation Prevention Act.   I am grateful to the chairwoman and to the ranking member and all of  the committee that has worked on this in such a bipartisan fashion, Mr.  Speaker, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I again, thank the chairwoman and her team  for making this very important piece of legislation that is so  important to our seniors and to our vulnerable adults happen.   Again, in 2018, the SEC put this together as something we should be  strongly looking at as we move forward. I am pleased we were able to  bring it to the floor today in a bipartisan fashion.   I urge all of my colleagues to support my bill, H.R. 2265, the  Financial Exploitation Act of 2021, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5142, a bill to posthumously  award Congressional Gold Medals in commemoration to the servicemembers  who perished in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021.   Mr. Speaker, during the 20-year war in Afghanistan, we lost over  2,000 brave men and women. More than 20,000 servicemembers returned  home wounded in action.   I believe in my heart that every single soldier we lost in  Afghanistan was a tragedy. We must remember their sacrifice.   In the waning days of this war, the Biden administration made  decisions that put U.S. servicemembers in harm's way, and,  unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, on August 26, we lost 13 more  servicemembers, and more than 20 were injured.   Eleven marines, one Navy corpsman, and one soldier were killed by an  ISIS-K bomber outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport on this  terrible day in August.   Mr. Speaker, I represent the people of Missouri's Second  Congressional District; and on August 26, my State lost a hero, Lance  Corporal Jared Schmitz.   This courageous young man had been stationed in Jordan on his first  deployment when he was called into Afghanistan to defend the civilians  fleeing the Taliban's advance. He was eager to be one of the brave men  and women on the front lines, making a real difference for the  Americans and allies trapped in a terrifying and dangerous situation.   Lance Corporal Schmitz was totally committed to his military service,  and he felt a calling to be a United States marine. So much so that he  had gotten his parents' permission to enlist at just 17 years old.   Lance Corporal Schmitz was just 20 years old when he lost his life in  the terrorist attack at the airport in Kabul.   Lance Corporal Schmitz and the 12 other servicemembers we lost in  August went above and beyond the call of duty to protect those stranded  in Afghanistan.   I sadly don't believe we will truly understand why Lance Corporal  Schmitz and his fellow soldiers died. Nevertheless, his family, their  families, and all Americans deserve answers, Mr. Speaker.   And I hope one day those who made the decisions that resulted in  these senseless deaths will be held accountable.   In the meantime, I am grateful that their service and their sacrifice  is being commemorated by this legislation. The bravery and valor shown  by these servicemembers is unquestionable.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill, and I look  forward to standing next to the family of Lance Corporal Schmitz as  they are presented a Congressional Gold Medal commemorating their son's  service and valor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. McClain), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on  my side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Waltz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Weber), my friend and colleague, a classmate of mine.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I simply urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5142 to  award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal in commemoration of the  servicemembers who perished in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
