 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my  friend, Mike Myer of Wheeling, who passed away earlier this year.   Besides being a loving husband and father, Mike was an incredibly  gifted editor at the Ogden newspaper chain and was a personal friend.  Over the years, Mike and I had lively discussions on politics, the  fossil fuel industry, and what would make West Virginia better. He was  both a pragmatic and authentic editor, and he cared deeply for the  livelihoods of men and women in the coal and natural gas fields of our  valley.   Out of frustration, Mike would repeatedly ask why Members of Congress  would intentionally inflict harm on so many of these families. His  passion was his community and the people who lived there.   Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Connie, and their two  children and two grandchildren as we all mourn Mike's passing.   Mike, you made a difference. You are already missed.                            ____________________
