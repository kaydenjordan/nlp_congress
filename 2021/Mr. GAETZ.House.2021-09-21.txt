 Madam Speaker, on behalf of the tens of thousands of  military families in northwest Florida, I rise in strong support of  this year's National Defense Authorization Act.   This bill does right by military families by ensuring that we upgrade  training systems, increasing their proficiency, and ensuring that our  servicemembers are safe when they go down range.   The bill enhances platforms and equipment survivability to ensure  that our troops are in the best possible position to prevail in every  battle and vanquish any foe.   The 2.7 percent pay raise is vastly needed and is a small debt of  gratitude for the elite level of patriotism that our servicemembers  show each and every day.   The bill does right by the mission by investing in research,  development test and evaluation by increasing our investment in cyber,  by ensuring that we have a military construction budget that allows us  to meet ambitious goals to be able to grow strategic mission in  particular areas, and our investment in the space force ensures that  America will always hold the high ground.   With this legislation, America wins the future by focusing on great  power competition, and by ensuring that we win that great power  competition with great focus and great competence.   I thank the bipartisan leadership of the committee, and I would note  that that bipartisan leadership has been necessary because President  Biden's initial budget did not meet the needs of the country to the  same degree that this House will. It is a testament to Chairman Smith  and Ranking Member Rogers that brighter minds have prevailed.
