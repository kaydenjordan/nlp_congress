 Madam Speaker, the Democrats' proposed changes to the  House rules will disenfranchise rural America, plain and simple.   In addition to throwing out budget rules to make way for socialist  packages like the Green New Deal, Democrats are gutting the motion to  recommit, which is an important tool for the minority to make  substantive amendments to legislation.   Past Republican motions to recommit have included things such as  restoring funding for critical rural broadband programs or allowing for  effective wildfire mitigation and increased funding for hazardous fuel  reduction in our Nation's forests, also, an MTR to protect our farmers  and agricultural employers from being sued out of businesses.   Eliminating this opportunity to amend legislation further diminishes  the voices of rural communities, and, frankly, Madam Speaker, it is a  slap in the face to rural Americans. It is clear Speaker Pelosi's  Democratic majority, albeit a heck of a lot slimmer than it once was,  is threatened by our reinvigorated Republican Conference.   Rural Americans deserve better.
