 Madam Speaker, while chaos reigns on the border, we have  another Democrat jam job before us today.   I would turn to the committee ranking member, the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock), for a colloquy.   Did the gentleman see these bills in the committee?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time.   These bills did not come before this committee. For someone like  myself, who has just joined the committee, I did not even have a chance  to be able to partake in this bill.   I wanted to express concerns especially about the H-2A provision in  this bill because I am familiar--there is a parallel to the J-1 visas  that we use in northern Wisconsin in the resort area. They are  temporary visas. And what we found over the years as employers is that  people would figure out how to use the J-1 visa to get into the  country, and then go job shopping from there.   The H-2A is susceptible to the same thing. And due to lax  enforcement, we could all live with it if there was good enforcement in  America, but there is not good enforcement of our laws here in the  United States.   So let's cut to the chase here. The gentleman from California touched  on this very well. These bills devalue American workers' labor.   In 2019, the greatest increase in wages for people who are in the  lower income brackets happened, the greatest increases in decades.   I just say to all of those working-class Americans out there: Make no  mistake, these bills today are another clear message that you are  viewed as replaceable.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
