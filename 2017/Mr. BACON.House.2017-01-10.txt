 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying bill which provides for H.R. 5, the Regulatory  Accountability Act of 2017.   I promised my district in eastern Nebraska that I would work my  hardest to rein in an out-of-control bureaucracy that is burdening our  Nation with over 3,000 new regulations each year. The cumulative cost  of all of these regulations passed each year cost approximately $2  trillion, almost 10 percent of our GDP. That is a tremendous burden,  and it largely falls on our small businesses, farmers, and community  banks.   I meet often with our local, small business owners. The top concern  that I hear, and they are loud and clear, and I hear it over and over,  is that regulations and ObamaCare are preventing them from growing,  and, in some cases, making it very difficult for them to stay afloat.  There is anger that the health of our businesses are not being  undermined by competition or new technology, but they are being  undermined by their own government, and they are angry about it.   I have promised my district that I will be aware and push back on  these regulations and on a bureaucracy that is on steroids. That is  what we are doing today by passing H.R. 5 and by passing these rules.   I think one of the Members of the very first Congress and the writer  of our Constitution would be proud to see H.R. 5 passed. James Madison  thought the separation of powers was vital to the safeguarding of our  Republic. In recent years, we have seen that separation of powers  undermined by an overzealous bureaucracy that creates laws, then  executes those laws, and then acts as their own appeal authority.  Madison said the accumulation of powers--legislative, executive, and  judiciary--in the same hands is the very definition of tyranny. Today,  we move toward the right balance, toward restoring the separation of  powers and lifting the burden that has been put on our small businesses  and farmers.   I urge support for the rule and the underlying bill.
