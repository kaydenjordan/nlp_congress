 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor New Mexico's first  radio station, KKOB, which this year celebrates their 100th anniversary  in broadcasting.   KKOB was founded in 1922 by Ralph Goddard and has remained in the  Land of Enchantment.   KKOB has won four Marconi Awards from the National Association of  Broadcasters and, since 2000, has received ``Station of the Year'' 12  times from the New Mexico Broadcasters Association.   To celebrate their 50th birthday, in 1972, the radio station invited  an adventurous bunch of hot air balloon operators to the Coronado Mall  parking lot, creating a tradition that has now become known as the  Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.   KKOB is the leading voice for southwest New Mexico, sharing news,  sports, traffic, weather, opinions, and the occasional joke--some good,  some bad, some just dad jokes. They have loved our community for over  100 years.   I commend KKOB's dedication to New Mexico, and I look forward to  their next century of broadcasting.                            ____________________
