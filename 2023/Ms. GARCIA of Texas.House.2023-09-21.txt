 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Hispanic Heritage Month. Hispanic Heritage Month is about recognizing  the countless contributions of Latinos across the Nation.   We celebrate the Latino entrepreneurs who have built thriving  businesses, the doctors and nurses who provide essential healthcare,  the teachers who inspire future generations, and the activists who  tirelessly advocate for justice and equality.   As we honor Hispanic Heritage Month, let us all commit to fostering  an inclusive society where everyone, regardless of their background,  can thrive and contribute to the American Dream.   Let's embrace the diversity that makes our Nation stronger and more  vibrant and continue celebrating our heritage that enriches us all.  Let's put diversity over hate, people over politics.   ``Yes, we can. Long live the people''; ``Si se puede y que viva la  gente.''                            ____________________
