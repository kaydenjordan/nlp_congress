 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as millions of Israeli  citizens are reeling from a barrage of more than 1,500 rockets fired  throughout the country by the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza.   In case there was any confusion, Hamas is a terrorist organization  designated by the United States, dedicated to the destruction of  Israel, in which Congress has and must condemn for killing innocent  civilians and using women and children as human shields.   No one here should make excuses for a terrorist organization.   Who is the next target of their sympathy?   ISIS? Al-Qaida? Hezbollah?   Even though we may not always agree about Israel's policies, we  should be very clear that nothing, nothing justifies a terrorist  organization firing rockets at our ally. And between terrorists and a  democracy, we should always choose the democracy.   Our commitment to Israel's security and its right to defend itself  from terrorists is ironclad. I am glad President Biden, the Secretary  of State, and the Secretary of Defense have stood with our key  democratic ally, insisted that Hamas stop firing rockets, and engaged  regional partners to end this crisis.   No matter our disagreements, there should be no false equivalences or  excuses made by anyone on behalf of a foreign terrorist organization.   As we stand together with our historic ally, Israel, we continue to  call for an end to the violence and for calm in the region for the sake  of our children and families and for the sake of peace.                            ____________________
