 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this bill  forward and also for granting me time to speak on an issue that I am  passionate about, which is Right to Try.   I support the underlying bill and hope that we have a chance, soon,  to consider the Right to Try bill, which has been worked on by myself,  Senator Johnson, and Representative Fitzpatrick.   As many know, Right to Try would allow terminally ill patients who  have no other options left to receive drugs that have passed the Food  and Drug Administration's basic safety testing but which have not been  fully approved.   In 2014, my home State of Arizona passed a similar Right to Try law  with nearly 80 percent of the vote, due in large part to the heroic  efforts of my late friend, Laura Knaperek, who was battling incurable  cancer at the time.   Today, nearly 40 States have enacted Right to Try legislation. This  is a bipartisan cause and one that has received strong support from the  White House. I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman to  find a path forward for Right to Try.
