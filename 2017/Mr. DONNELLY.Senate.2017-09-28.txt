 Mr. President, yesterday, September 27, 2017, I was in  Indiana with the President of the United States and was unable to vote.  Had I been present, I would have voted in support of Mr. Heath  Tarbert's nomination to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and  in support of Mr. Makan Delrahim's nomination to be an Assistant  Attorney General.                            ____________________
