 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of S. 3201 to extend  the emergency scheduling of fentanyl and its analogues.   Fentanyl is a synthetic, which means man-made, opioid. It is 50 times  more potent than heroin, and 100 times more potent than morphine.   And while fentanyl is a schedule II drug, traffickers have been able  to make small changes to the drug as a way around DEA enforcement.  These fentanyl-like substances can be just as dangerous, if not more  deadly, than traditional opioids. And the pain they have caused  communities across the country is immeasurable.   To combat these drugs, DEA used its authority to temporarily ban  these products, but that extension expires next week. The fact that we  are just now addressing this issue with 1 week to go, has been flirting  with disaster. That is why I am so thankful that we are here passing  this bill to protect our communities from deadly fentanyl products.   This administration has put fighting back against the opioid crisis  front and center from day one. And in the past several years under  Republican leadership, the House passed a series of comprehensive,  bipartisan legislative packages to help American communities combat  addiction.   We must all keep up that fight. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  James Gregorius, the associate director for training at the Federal Law  Enforcement Training Center, FLETC, who will be retiring this week  after more than 40 years of public service.   Mr. Gregorius began his career in law enforcement as a police officer  with the Montgomery County, Maryland, Police Department. From there, he  transitioned to Federal policing, where he served as a special agent  within both the Drug Enforcement Administration as well as the National  Security Agency.  [[Page H704]]    This experience and this expertise positioned him perfectly for a  high-level career with the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center,  which is headquartered in the First Congressional District of Georgia.  During James' time there, he did an exceptional job of managing  training operations in Georgia, New Mexico, South Carolina, and the  D.C. metropolitan area.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gregorius for his service to our country  and congratulate him on his retirement.   James' presence, leadership, and expertise will all be missed.                            ____________________
