 Mr. Speaker, water is life. Growing up in Hawaii, we  have a unique appreciation for the protection of our resources, from  our mountains all the way down to our oceans. It is something that we  grow up with, that we have a responsibility to take care of our home,  to keep it clean, not only for us, but for future generations.  [[Page H5005]]    Today is World Oceans Day, and we have the opportunity to celebrate  the beauty of our world's oceans and also commit to keeping them clean.   Right now we see all over the world that our oceans are under siege.  Temperatures are rising, pollution riddles our waters and beaches,  coral reefs are dying off, and marine life are being killed.   So as you recognize World Oceans Day, we can think about how, in our  own lives--individually, as a family, as communities--we can do our  part to take care of our planet by changing things like making sure we  are not using toxic sunscreens that kill off our coral reef or the  single-use plastics that pollute our waters.   We cannot wait for the tide to change. We have got to take action to  make sure that our oceans and our planet are safe and clean for all  life for generations to come.                            ____________________
