 Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 46th anniversary of Roe  v. Wade, bringing us close to 50 years since unborn children have not  had legal protection.   Since then, there have been an estimated 60.9 million abortions in  America. In 2018, an unborn child was aborted every 34 seconds, on  average.   These aren't new statistics, but they are still shocking and  horrifying to those of us who believe that all life is sacred.   The country is split nearly in half when it comes to being pro-life  or pro-choice, but a majority of Americans don't believe their tax  dollars should be used to fund abortions.   The largest provider of abortions in the United States, Planned  Parenthood, is taxpayer subsidized, despite reporting over $1.4 billion  in revenue for 2016-2017.   It is big business. Planned Parenthood makes millions each year  providing over one-third of the Nation's abortions.   It is unconscionable that millions of Americans are forced to  contribute tax dollars to create profit for an industry they are  fundamentally or morally opposed to.   If only they understood the whole truth on the abortion industry and  how much it hurts women and the unborn.                            ____________________
