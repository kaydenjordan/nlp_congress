 Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago, Willie O'Ree broke the color  barrier in professional hockey, all while overcoming racial slurs,  doubt, and blindness in his right eye.   Often referred to as the Jackie Robinson of hockey, Willie has been a  trusted champion for diversity, a proponent of inclusion, and an  inspiration for so many young players both off and on the ice.   Each February, we celebrate Black History Month as well as Hockey is  for Everyone Month, and no one embodies both of those tributes as  profoundly as living legend Willie O'Ree.   He is as humble as he is inspiring, often reminding fans that he only  played in the NHL for 45 games, and while that may be true, he changed  the game forever.   There are few players worthier of being inducted into the Hockey Hall  of Fame, and it is long overdue that Willie's name be added to that  list.   As the Hockey Hall of Fame continues to accept and review nominee  submissions before the March 15 deadline, I want to remind everyone of  the countless ways Willie strengthened and supported this sport.   I thank him for his continued efforts to increase access for all  people of all backgrounds to get out on the ice and play the greatest  game.                            ____________________
