 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as we mark nearly 2 months since the bombing that killed  more than 116 innocent Afghanis and American military personnel at the  Hamid Karzai International Airport, I rise in strong support of this  legislation to award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal to the 13  U.S. servicemembers who gave their lives that day.   Those individuals are Sergeant Johanny Rosario Pichardo, Sergeant  Nicole Gee, Staff Sergeant Darin Taylor Hoover, Corporal Hunter Lopez,  Corporal Daegan Page, Corporal Humberto Sanchez, Lance Corporal David  Espinoza, Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz, Lance Corporal Rylee McCollum,  Lance Corporal Dylan Merola, Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, Navy  Corpsman Maxton Soviak, and Staff Sergeant Ryan C. Knauss.   Mr. Speaker, as we recognize these extraordinary heroes and also  understand that this honor cannot come close to filling the void left  by their loss, I cannot think of anyone more deserving of such a  distinction.   These brave servicemembers represent the very best of America,  knowingly putting themselves in harm's way to help evacuate thousands  from the region, a true embodiment of the American spirit.   Their legacies live on in the thousands of Afghan refugees they  saved, who now have an opportunity to live lives free of violence and  persecution.   And so as we remember these extraordinary American heroes and  recognize them with the Congressional Gold Medal, let us all live lives  worthy of their sacrifice and service to our great Nation.   I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and to join me in honoring  these great American heroes.
