 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, our country lost a great  statesman, and many in this Chamber lost a dear former colleague.   Senator Bob Dole, who represented Kansas in the Senate for 27 years  and who served 3 years as Senate majority leader, passed away yesterday  morning at the age of 98.   Throughout his life, Bob Dole redefined and elevated what it meant to  be a public servant. He was born not to wealth but in poverty, a son of  the Kansas heartland, who grew up beneath the shadow of the Great  Depression. As a young man, Bob unblinkingly answered the call to serve  by enlisting in the Army during World War II, where he earned two  Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star.   After his election to the Senate, Senator Dole quickly won the  admiration of his colleagues with his candor, his sharp wit, and his  penchant for good-natured ribbing, but beneath all that was an  unquenchable desire to get things done in this Chamber.   While he frequently sparred with Democrats, some of his greatest  achievements were bipartisan endeavors, including his work to pass the  Americans with Disabilities Act, legislation to strengthen Social  Security, and revamping Federal nutrition programs. Despite rising to  the top ranks of his party, Senator Dole always kept close  relationships with those on the other side of the aisle.   Senator Dole exemplified the ``greatest generation.'' While I never  had the pleasure of serving in the Senate with him, I always admired  his steadfast advocacy for veterans, for Americans with disabilities,  and his love for his country.   For the information of all, Senator Dole will lie in state this  Thursday, under the Capitol Rotunda, where we will pay tribute to his  life and to his legacy.   I thank the Speaker and Leader McConnell in helping make this event's  ceremonies possible.   For today, I join all my colleagues in mourning the loss of this  great public servant, and I wish all of Senator Dole's family my  deepest condolences.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  starts after the remarks that Senator Cantwell is giving and Senator  Markey.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Executive Calendar No. 585.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.
