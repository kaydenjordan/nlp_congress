 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative  Schakowsky for yielding.   I want to say to Representative Long that I am so sorry for his loss,  and, again, it is appropriate to be with him on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, more than 20 years ago, Cheryl and Todd Burt experienced  an unimaginable tragedy when their two sons, Zachary and Nicholas, died  as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. Zachary was 4 years old;  Nicholas was only 16 months old. Cheryl, Todd, and their eldest son,  Ryan, barely made it out of the home alive on that cold January  evening.   Today, the House is considering H.R. 1618, the Zachary and Nicholas  Burt Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act.   This legislation is named in honor of Zachary and Nicholas, but it is  truly for the over 400 Americans who die each year and more than 20,000  who are hospitalized as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. Among  them are two of my constituents, John and April Courtney from Lyman,  New Hampshire, who lost their lives to carbon monoxide poisoning just  last February of this year.  [[Page H7725]]    While it happens most frequently in cold winter months, carbon  monoxide poisoning actually happens throughout this country.   As a mother and an aunt, I know there is nothing more important than  keeping our children and our loved ones safe, and that is why I am so  proud today that the House is preparing to vote on my bipartisan  legislation with my colleague Buddy Carter, which provides funding for  States to prevent future carbon monoxide-related deaths by educating  the public about the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning and the  importance of properly installing alarms in their home.   It also supports the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in  housing for the elderly and low-income individuals and high-traffic  public buildings like schools. This bipartisan legislation will truly  save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my distinguished colleague, Buddy  Carter, for working on this bill with me and helping to build a  consensus for its unanimous passage in the Energy and Commerce  Committee. I also want to thank Chairman Pallone and Congresswoman  Schakowsky for making this piece of legislation a priority and  including it in the package of bills today.   At a time when Congress so often seems divided, this legislation is  proof positive that we can work together on our committee to find  common ground and get things done to help our constituents.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and thank Anna Yu and  Alex Chasick from the Energy and Commerce Committee staff and Hart  Thompson and Nick Schemmel from Congressman Carter's office for  collaborating with my team, Will Pisano and Travis Krogman, to move  this legislation forward.   I am proud that this bill is supported by a diverse coalition of  public safety and industry groups, and I include in the Record five  letters of support.   The first is a letter from 15 national organizations representing  consumers throughout the United States. The second is a letter of  support from the National Association of State Fire Marshals.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding. I will be quick.   The third letter of support is from the National Association of Home  Builders, which will demonstrate the bipartisan support. The fourth is  from Consumer Reports, and finally one from the National Electrical  Manufacturers Association.                                                 September 16, 2019.        Dear Representative: As organizations dedicated to       improving consumer protections, we write to express our       support for two consumer product safety bills as they move to       the House floor this week. These bills would enhance       protections to prevent deaths from portable fuel cans and       injuries and deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning. We urge       you to support these bills to protect children and all       consumers from preventable injuries and deaths.        The Nicholas and Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide Poisoning       Prevention Act of 2019 (H.R. 1618) would establish a grant       program, administered by the CPSC, that would encourage       states to require the installation of residential carbon       monoxide detectors, including for vulnerable populations.       According to the CDC, during 2010-2015, a total of 2,244       deaths resulted from unintentional carbon monoxide (CO)       poisoning, with 393 of those deaths occurring in 2015. This       bill seeks to reduce carbon monoxide poisonings.        The Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2019 (H.R. 806)       would help prevent flame-jetting incidents through       establishing a binding and enforceable standard that would       require flame mitigation devices, or flame arrestors, on       portable fuel containers to prevent flames from entering       these containers and igniting the gases inside. According to       National Fire Protection Association estimates, fire       departments responded to an average of 160,910 fires per year       between 2007 and 2011 that started with ignition of a       flammable or combustible liquid, resulting in an estimated       454 civilian deaths, 3,910 civilian injuries, and $1.5       billion in direct property damage per year.        These bills offer a critical opportunity to protect       children and all consumers from preventable injuries and       deaths. We urge you to support these child health and safety       bills, and to vote ``yes'' on them as they move to the House       floor this week.            Sincerely,        Alaska Public Interest Research Group (AkPIRG), Center for       Justice & Democracy, Chicago Consumer Coalition, Child Injury       Prevention Alliance, Consumer Assistance Council, Inc.,       Consumer Federation of America, Kids In Danger, National       Consumers League, OHSU/Doernbecher Tom Sargent Safety Center,       Parents for Window Blind Safety, Public Citizen, Safe Kids       Worldwide, Safe States Alliance, The Society for Advancement       of Violence and Injury Research (SAVIR), Virginia Citizens       Consumer Council.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                             State Fire Marshals,                                   Maitland, FL, September 16, 2019.      Hon. Ann Kuster,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Kuster: The National Association of       State Fire Marshals (NASFM) thanks you for your continued       leadership in consumer product safety issues, and       specifically in protecting Americans from carbon monoxide       (CO) poisoning. NASFM strongly endorses H.R. 1618, the       Nicholas and Zachary Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide Poisoning       Prevention Act of 2019.        The National Association of State Fire Marshals membership       comprises the most senior fire officials in the United       States. NASFM's mission is to protect human life, property       and the environment from fire and related hazards. As such,       we are extremely supportive of your legislation, which will       amend the Consumer Product Safety Act to require residential       carbon monoxide alarms to meet the applicable ANSI/UL       standards by treating that standard as a consumer product       safety rule, to encourage States to require the installation       of such detectors in homes, and in an overall effort to       prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.        Carbon Monoxide poisoning is a proven dangerous threat,       claiming approximately 450 lives annually, with another       21,000 Americans sent to emergency rooms due to unintentional       poisonings, according to Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention (CDC). Per the CDC, CO poisoning is the leading       cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America, and because       CO is an odorless, tasteless and colorless gas, many people       are initially unaware they are even being poisoned.        ``The National Association of State Fire Marshals       enthusiastically supports H.R. 1618, the Carbon Monoxide       Poisoning Prevention Act of 2019,'' said NASFM Executive       Director Jim Narva, ``It's important we all strive to       mitigate the potentially fatal effects of CO Poisoning. With       States focusing on low-income families, the elderly and       children, the enactment of this Bill and its grant program       will save countless lives.''        Thank you again for your leadership on the carbon monoxide       alarm issue and we look forward to working to enact into law       this important public safety prevention legislation.            Sincerely,                                                      Jim Narva,                                                 Executive Director,      National Association of State Fire Marshals.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                                   Home Builders,                                                 September 16, 2019.      Hon. Ann Kuster,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Buddy Carter,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Kuster and Carter: On behalf of the       approximately 140,000 members of the National Association of       Home Builders (NAHB), I am writing to express my support for       H.R. 1618, Nicholas and Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide       Poisoning Prevention Act of 2019. We appreciate your       willingness to work with us on this important issue.        The Nicholas and Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide Poisoning       Prevention Act of 2019 would create a grant program to       encourage states to install carbon monoxide detectors in       public facilities. NAHB members are involved in land       development and building single-family and multi-family       housing, remodeling, and other aspects of residential and       light commercial construction. While our members are       typically not involved in building schools, hospitals,       airports, and other public buildings, we recognize the       importance of requiring carbon monoxide detectors.        According to the Center of Disease Control, at least 430       people die in the United States from accidental carbon       monoxide poisoning. As a response, majority of the states       have adopted statues, via building codes or state law, that       requires carbon monoxide detectors in all residential       buildings. NAHB supports legislation like this that promotes       the safety of occupants in a cost-effective way.        NAHB appreciates your leadership on this life saving       legislation and we look forward to working with you on future       legislation.            Sincerely,      James W. Tobin III.                                   ____                                                 Consumer Reports,                                                 September 17, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: Consumer Reports, the independent,       non-profit member organization, urges you to vote yes on H.R.       2211, H.R. 1618, and H.R. 806, three bills that would  [[Page H7726]]       help protect consumers from product safety hazards in their       homes. CR testified before the House Energy and Commerce       Committee in support of these bills in June, and urges their       passage today for the reasons below.                          H.R. 2211, the STURDY Act         Consumer Reports strongly supports H.R. 2211, the ``Stop       Tip-overs of Unstable, Risky Dressers on Youth Act,'' or the       STURDY Act, and urges its swift passage. The bill would       require the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to       establish a strong mandatory safety standard to improve the       stability of dressers and similar clothing storage furniture       and help prevent deaths and injuries resulting from when they       tip over onto children. Long a hidden hazard in the home,       tip-overs send thousands of people to the emergency room       annually. Dressers and other clothing storage units are       particularly lethal, accounting for at least 206 reported       deaths since the year 2000, with most of the victims being       children younger than age 6.        CR has found that the most effective and most widely touted       tip-over prevention strategy available today--anchoring a       dresser to the wall using brackets and straps--is not an easy       fix for the majority of consumers. Our nationally       representative survey last year of 1,502 U.S. adults found       that only 27 percent of Americans had anchored furniture in       their homes, and among Americans with kids under age 6 at       home, 40 percent anchored their furniture. Fundamentally,       because a child's life should not rely on consumer skill at       anchoring a dresser to a wall, CR has called on the furniture       industry to consistently produce dressers and other clothing       storage units that are designed to be more stable and that       better resist tipping over onto children.        Over the past two years, CR has conducted extensive       research, analysis of incident and injury data, and       comparative testing of a cross-section of dressers in the       marketplace. Based on our investigation, we found that the       industry's voluntary standard leaves too many children at       risk. Our results demonstrated that it is feasible for       dressers at all price points to pass a more rigorous test. CR       bought 42 dressers for evaluation, and put them through a       series of three progressively tougher stability tests. While       13 dressers failed all but the first of the tests, 20       dressers passed all the testing, underscoring that       manufacturers are capable of successfully designing more       stable dressers. The failures reinforce why a stronger       standard is necessary to protect consumers. The 20 dressers       that passed all our tests cost various amounts, and were       representative of all price points in the market.        In light of the unreasonable risk of death or injury to       children and the findings of our investigation, CR and others       have been advocating for the CPSC to develop and implement a       strong mandatory safety standard with performance       requirements for the stability of dressers and other clothing       storage units. While both Republican and Democratic CPSC       commissioners have expressed support for measures to       strengthen the current safety framework around furniture tip-      overs, the agency has so far failed to act, and commissioners       have recognized that CPSC rulemaking under its Consumer       Product Safety Act Section 7 and 9 authority is likely to       take several years, if not a full decade, to complete. To       account for the weight of children under age 6 and the       feasibility demonstrated by CR's test results, CR has said       the standard should, at a minimum, include a loaded stability       test of 60 pounds. We also have said that it is critical for       the standard to be mandatory, not voluntary, for several       reasons, including because:        Under the current system of safety oversight, consumers       essentially must place their trust in manufacturers that they       will produce a reasonably stable dresser;        Wall anchors and other tip-over restraint devices, while       important, are no substitute for adequate stability       performance testing;        A mandatory standard is justified under the Consumer       Product Safety Act--with the CPSC able to find that such a       rule is reasonably necessary and in the public interest;        CR's testing shows that manufacturers are capable of       incorporating appropriate design changes to their products       that yield adequate stability, and of offering units for sale       to consumers that are affordable and do not sacrifice       utility; and        Such a standard would allow the CPSC to enforce       requirements, including performance standards, and more       readily gain industry cooperation for recalls; historically,       companies have not carried out tip-over-related dresser       recalls unless they face overwhelming CPSC and public       pressure, or their product is linked to a death or failed       CPSC stability test.        Enactment of the STURDY Act would help ensure the fastest       possible implementation of a strong stability standard, and       the reduced delay could save children's lives. In addition to       CR, the bill has the support of Parents Against Tip-Overs and       a broad coalition of 75 pediatrician, safety, and consumer       groups. A bipartisan majority of CPSC commissioners also has       expressed support for the STURDY Act and enactment of a       legislative solution that would permit the CPSC to take       faster action to help prevent tip-overs than the promulgation       of a rule under its traditional rulemaking authority and       procedures.        The hazard to children of furniture tip-overs has been       insufficiently addressed by both the furniture industry and       the CPSC for years. Congress, today, has the chance to       finally force a more protective stability standard to take       effect. We urge members to seize this opportunity for       leadership on behalf of child safety and pass H.R. 2211, the       STURDY Act, without delay.     H.R. 1618, the Nicholas and Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide Poisoning                               Prevention Act         Consumer Reports supports H.R. 1618, the Nicholas and       Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act of       2019. According to the CDC, during 2010-2015, a total of       2,244 deaths resulted from unintentional carbon monoxide (CO)       poisoning, with 393 of those deaths occurring in 2015. CR       often stresses the importance of installing and maintaining       CO detectors, and offers a buying guide and ratings to give       consumers comparative information about different products       that CR has tested. To help keep consumers safe, CR also has       published stories about how to ensure that smoke and carbon       monoxide detectors function properly.        H.R. 1618 would establish a grant program for CO poisoning       prevention, administered by the CPSC. The grants would help       push states to require that up-to-date carbon monoxide       detectors be installed in all dwelling units and numerous       other facilities with the capacity to hold a large number of       people, and encourage states to develop a strategy to protect       vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, or low-      income households. With hundreds of people dying each year       from carbon monoxide poisoning, it is appropriate to       establish a modest CPSC-administered grant program to promote       the installation of CO detectors, especially for vulnerable       populations. This grant program can be an important part of a       broader, multi-pronged strategy to significantly reduce       injuries and deaths associated with carbon monoxide       poisoning, and Congress should pass the bill.               H.R. 806, the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act         Consumer Reports supports H.R. 806, the Portable Fuel       Container Safety Act of 2019. According to National Fire       Protection Association estimates, fire departments responded       to an average of 160,910 fires per year in the 2007-2011       period that started with ignition of a flammable or       combustible liquid, resulting in an estimated 454 civilian       deaths, 3,910 civilian injuries, and $1.5 billion in direct       property damage per year. Manufacturers and safety experts       have identified a portion of the death and injury toll to       address through product design: incidents involving flame       jetting from portable fuel containers intended for reuse by       consumers.        Despite the fact that people should never pour fuel such as       gasoline, kerosene, or diesel over a flame or use such fuel       for fire-starting purposes, people do--creating a foreseeable       scenario that this Act would help address. The Portable Fuel       Container Safety Act would require flame mitigation devices,       or flame arrestors, to prevent flame from entering these       containers and igniting the gases inside. This requirement is       consistent with a new voluntary standard recently finalized       by ASTM International that the CPSC could decide to treat as       a mandatory standard under the bill if the agency determines       that it meets the bill's minimum conditions.        The new ASTM standard represents a step forward for safety,       and all portable fuel containers intended for reuse by       consumers should conform to its provisions. Congress should       pass H.R. 806 to ensure this standard or a similar standard       becomes mandatory. Consumers should have assurance that any       new portable fuel container they may buy--which they or       someone else may use or misuse--will contain an effective       flame mitigation device, and that the CPSC can readily take       action if a manufacturer fails to follow the law.                                  Conclusion         Consumer Reports thanks all members of the House of       Representatives for their consideration of these important       bills to improve safety around the home for millions of       people nationwide. We urge you to vote yes on H.R. 2211, H.R.       1618, and H.R. 806, and look forward to working together in       the future to ensure a safe marketplace for all consumers.            Sincerely,                                                   William Wallace,      Manager, Home and Safety Policy.                                   ____                                                 National Electrical                                       Manufacturers Association,                                                  September 9, 2019.      Re NEMA Support for H.R. 1618--Nicholas and Zachary Burt           Memorial Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act.       Hon. Ann M. Kuster,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Kuster: The National Electrical       Manufacturers Association (NEMA) is the principal trade group       representing U.S.-based manufacturers of electrical products       and systems and medical imaging technology. On behalf of       NEMA's Fire, Life Safety, Security & Emergency Communications       product section, I am writing to express support for H.R.       1618, which promotes the purchase and installation of carbon       monoxide (CO) alarms in residential homes and dwelling units       nationwide. This measure is overdue and NEMA commends you for       your leadership on this important health & safety issue.        Carbon monoxide is a silent killer. Undetectable by human       senses--you cannot see it, smell it or taste it--CO is the       leading cause of accidental poisoning death in the  [[Page H7727]]       United States. Often misdiagnosed or under-detected, CO       poisoning induces symptoms that mimic those of the flu, with       headache, nausea and dizziness being the most common. A CO       alarm or detector is an inexpensive, effective way to warn       that a dangerous concentration of CO is present, which can       occur whenever a fuel-burning appliance such as a furnace,       water heater, stove, or generator malfunctions or is used       improperly. Other common household sources of CO include       fireplaces and vehicles left running in attached garages.        According to the Centers for Disease Control, each year       more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning       not linked to fires, more than 20,000 visit the emergency       room, and more than 4,000 are hospitalized. Regrettably, many       of these incidents could be prevented by properly installed       and maintained alarm systems.        The need for detection and alarms is especially acute in       homes, where people sleep and typically spend most of their       time. Any residence that contains a potential source of CO       emissions should be equipped with protection from this       insidious life-safety hazard.        Most states (as well as Puerto Rico and Guam) have enacted       laws requiring CO detection in residential dwellings, and it       is likely that more will adopt similar legislation or codes       in the coming years. These measures--along with education       efforts--have proven successful in reducing CO-related       injuries and deaths, but laws alone do not guarantee that       protection is in place wherever it is needed.        The Nicholas and Zachary Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide       Poisoning Prevention Act will help states and local       governments implement these programs and provide greater       assurance that families are protecting themselves and their       loved ones from CO. NEMA particularly supports the bill's       emphasis on facilities that serve children and the elderly,       since they are especially susceptible to the effects of CO       exposure. All schools should have proper CO detection systems       in place and NEMA welcomes federal support in this regard.        NEMA's Fire, Life Safety, Security & Emergency       Communications product section includes the world's leading       manufacturers of systems and devices that guard against not       only CO but other commonplace life safety hazards such as       fire and smoke. These companies strongly endorse measures       that help to reduce these hazards in more spaces and       environments where people gather. H.R. 1618 is an important       step in that regard and NEMA is pleased to support its       enactment.            Very truly yours,                                                     Philip Squair,                              Vice President--Government Relations.     So, again, Mr. Speaker, this bill has  strong bipartisan support, and I encourage all my colleagues to support  it.
