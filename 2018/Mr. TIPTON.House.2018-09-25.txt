 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from West  Virginia for the time.   The Department of Energy's Cheney disposal cell in Mesa, Colorado, is  a critical component of DOE legacy management's mission to be able to  protect public health and the environment. The cell receives  radioactive waste materials that were produced decades ago during the  uranium milling process. The waste materials continue to be uncovered  during road construction, bridge replacement, home foundation  excavation, and other construction activities in several towns in  western Colorado. Once the waste materials are discovered, they must be  properly disposed of at the Cheney cell.   The authorization for the Cheney disposal cell expires at the end of  2023 or when the site is filled to capacity. Currently, the remaining  capacity in the cell is approximately 234,000 cubic yards, and,  therefore, an extended authorization is required. H.R. 2278 would  extend that authorization until 2030.   The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment supports  extending the reauthorization for the Cheney cell and will remain a  strong partner in DOE's legacy management program.   I would like to thank my colleague from Colorado, Ms. Diana DeGette,  for her support on this legislation. I would also like to thank the  Energy and Commerce Environment Subcommittee chairman,  John Shimkus,  and Ranking Member Paul Tonko, as well as the full committee chairman,   Greg Walden, and Ranking Member Pallone for recognizing the importance  of the Cheney disposal cell and working to bring this bill to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
