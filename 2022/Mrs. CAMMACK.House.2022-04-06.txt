 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I am here today to rise in support of  ordering the previous question on Congresswoman Herrell's bill, the  SHIELD Act, that would stop the Biden administration from ending title  42, the very necessary public health order used by CBP officials at the  southwest border.   Since President Biden took office in January of last year, Customs  and Border Protection have encountered over 2 million illegal  immigrants at the southern border. This number is more than at any  other time during the Trump administration and still continues to  astonish those of us who have actually visited the border to see what  is happening there.   Unlike the trafficker in chief, who would rather retreat to his beach  house in Delaware than face the American people, or the so-called  border czar, who visited El Paso once and figured that that was good  enough, I myself have been to the border three times to see this crisis  for myself. In fact, over 70 percent of my Republican colleagues have  been to see the tragic crisis unfolding there.   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I have followed this  issue from the very beginning and have feared the very day when title  42 would be rescinded for political purposes.   Speaking of political purposes, I find it exceptionally hypocritical  that this very Chamber is still utilizing proxy voting under the guise  of a public health concern. In fact, on March 29, the Speaker extended  proxy voting through May 14 of this year because of ``the ongoing  public health crisis.''   It is curious that the Speaker doesn't seem to think that our own  border being overrun by 2 million undocumented people has no bearing on  the safety of the general American public, but a Congress of 435  Members with an 80 percent vaccination rate seems to qualify for an  ``ongoing public health crisis.'' That, to me, screams hypocrisy.   Furthermore, there are Members of this Chamber who have been voting  ``present'' via proxy. The hypocrisy and the irony are not lost on me  nor the American people, Mr. Speaker.   Additionally, every single one of my colleagues who decided to show  up here today had to wear a mask to get on a plane. That mandate is  still in place due to the ongoing public health crisis.   Mr. Speaker, we have two very clear instances here in this Chamber  where the ``ongoing public health crisis'' is used as a justification  for policy decisions. Why not the safety, then, for all Americans and  our communities across this country by securing the border? Why not  uphold and keep title 42 in place?   If you have ever spoken to a CBP officer or a Border Patrol agent,  they will tell you that title 42 is necessary, that ending it will send  even more people to the southern border. It is a magnet.   Ending it will prolong the crisis. It will grow the crisis. It will  once and for all put an end to national security as we know it.   Take it from the wife of a first responder who deals with this crisis  every single day. I have had dozens of Border Patrol agents text and  call me the last few days, begging for help to hold the line on title  42. They have said: Please, Congress, hold the line on title 42. It  must be protected because it is the only policy in place currently  that, in the slightest, will slow this surge that we have watched grow  before our eyes.   If you stand with our Border Patrol agents, if you stand with the  American people, if you give a damn about our communities, then you  will support the SHIELD Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from the  great State of Minnesota for yielding.   I rise today to defeat the previous question so that we may  immediately consider H.R. 6858, Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers' bill,  that would strengthen United States energy security, encourage and  promote domestic production of crude oil and natural gas, and help  return to and solidify American energy independence.   You know, I get asked all the time, why? Why will Congress do nothing  to lower the cost of fuel? Why do they continue to talk and do  absolutely nothing?   Well, right here--right here is your answer. Today, Republicans  stand, for the fifth time, legislation Today, Republicans stand, for  the fifth time, legislation in hand, to bring gas prices down and to  restart our energy production right here at home; legislation that  would make us energy independent, once again, and that would get  thousands of Americans back to work; legislation that would be a  collective sigh of relief for our seniors, and those on fixed incomes,  who are making the decision between gas or groceries. This legislation  is the answer, and it is ready to go.    But you know what? My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  already been given vote recommendations by the Speaker of the House to  shoot this legislation down. They haven't even read it. They haven't  even read it, and they are so blind to and beholden to their radical  agenda that they won't consider a commonsense solution to one of the  most pressing issues facing all of our collective constituents, these  fuel prices.   Again, this is the fifth time that this legislation has been  presented, and it is the fifth time that my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have put Russia first and America last.   The average price of gas today is $4.56 and climbing. For our  truckers and farmers who fuel up on diesel, like many in my district,  it is costing them well over $5 a gallon at the pump. In fact, it is  $5.19 today for a gallon of diesel.   All across our country, Americans, regardless of party, are making  decisions, again, between gas in the tank or groceries in the fridge.  Folks are canceling their first road trip with their family in 2 years,  or visits to grandparents, because Biden has decided that Americans who  put fuel in their own gas tanks and shop for their own groceries, they  are not the priority.                                time  1615    In fact, just 17 hours ago, the Biden administration was more  concerned with presenting former President Barack Obama with a  ceremonial pen than talking about how we are going to bring down fuel  prices in this country. You want to talk about out of touch. There it  is in a nutshell.   This is the Biden energy policy: soaring prices that hurt hardworking  Americans and increasing reliance on foreign countries to meet our  energy needs.   We know that America's future will not be realized by sunshine and  pinwheels. We will realize it by boosting domestic production and  ending our dependence on countries that don't have our best interests  in mind. Heck, they don't even like us.   I have spoken to foresters and farmers in my district who have told  me that energy costs alone are driving them out of operation and out of  business. To illustrate this, one of the top timber producers in my own  district said he is spending $18,000 more a week on fuel costs alone.  If this continues, he will be suspending operations, all because this  administration has issued our domestic energy industry a death  sentence. That happened even before they took office.   This Biden energy plan, or lack thereof, is ruining the financial  hopes and dreams of hardworking Americans and destroying farmers,  foresters, families, ranchers, and small businesses.   We know that we can put an end to this energy crisis. We know we can,  but instead, we are focused on ceremonial pens and issues that do not  matter to the American people.   It is long past time that we end this energy crisis and put American  energy security and independence at the top of the priority list. I  stand before this body and the American people to say that we, too,  have had enough.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  we can immediately bring Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers' legislation to  the floor.
