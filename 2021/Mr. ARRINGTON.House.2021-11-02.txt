 Mr. Speaker, before my commentary on this disastrous  border self-inflicted by this administration, I want to speak on behalf  of my fellow Texans.   I think I can say this with confidence: They welcome the immigrant,  the God-fearing, freedom-loving immigrant that wants to make this  country their home, pledge allegiance to our flag, embrace our ideals  and improve even our way of life.   Mr. Speaker, we welcome the immigrant, but only if they respect our  laws, our sovereignty, and the safety of our fellow Americans.   Since January, this administration has created an unprecedented and  unmitigated crisis at our southern border. They have repealed every  effective measure that was in place to stop the flow of illegal  Americans and to secure the border. They have willfully disregarded the  Constitution and its mandate on the people's government to provide for  the common defense.   Our President has failed to faithfully uphold the law, to fulfill the  sacred duty to enforce the laws of the land. They have completely ceded  control of our border and the sovereignty of this great country to  paramilitary drug cartels. They have enriched, empowered, these narco  terrorists at the expense of the vulnerable migrants who take this  dangerous trek and, most importantly, at the expense of the American  people, our families, our children.  [[Page H6076]]    Mr. Speaker, this administration has intentionally opened up our  border to a flood of human trafficking, unprecedented drug smuggling,  and a record amount of crime and gang activity. There is no apology for  it. There is no recognition of it. There seems to be no sign of  changing the posture and policies of this administration. There is no  accountability. They are not committed to detaining and deporting.   Mr. Speaker, they are catching and releasing, there is lawlessness,  chaos, and a border beyond recognition. This central tenet of catch and  release has not only rewarded illegal immigration, but it has dispersed  this crisis beyond our border to every State in the United States,  making every State a border State.   Since March, 160,000 illegal immigrants have been released into the  United States. This, in addition to almost a half a million got-aways.   Mr. Speaker, I recently learned that folks who were being detained,  illegal immigrants, were being released into neighborhoods in  communities in my district. They couldn't tell me how many. They  couldn't tell me where they came from. They couldn't tell me who was  going to follow up, when they would show up for court. They had  nothing. They could confirm, however, that there were people being  released, illegal immigrants, into our communities who were COVID  positive, and some who had criminal records. Nobody notified. Not me,  not our governor, no local officials--just releasing folks.   Meanwhile, this administration is mandating and insisting on vaccines  and public health protocols, but letting folks just stream into our  country. They say one of every five illegal immigrants crossing is  COVID positive, and so there is this public safety threat of another  surge inundating our hospitals while they force their policies on the  American people in this regard. Shameful.   And there has been an exponential increase in criminal aliens  apprehended at the border. These are folks who have committed a crime  on our soil who have crossed back over--four times as much  criminal activity, criminal aliens.    Mr. Speaker, the numbers are startling: 348 percent increase in  criminal aliens convicted of DUIs coming back to the United States; 454  percent increase in criminal aliens convicted of drug possession; 477  percent increase in robbery, theft, burglary; over 200 percent increase  in sex offenses, and over 1600 percent increase in criminal aliens who  have come over to our country and committed murder.                            ____________________
