 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to remind my colleague that her vote today to repeal the  Affordable Care Act will result in 266,000 people from her State of  Tennessee losing their healthcare coverage, 57,000 workers losing their  jobs, and an economic loss of $34.2 billion in gross State product for  the State of Tennessee over 5 years.   The so-called budget before us was drafted by Republicans for the  sole purpose of repealing the Affordable Care Act and defunding Planned  Parenthood by a simple majority in the Senate. It squanders the  opportunity to start this new Congress working together to address the  concerns and priorities of the American people in a constructive and  bipartisan manner.   The Affordable Care Act is making an incredible difference across my  home State of Kentucky, as in many other places. With our expansion of  Medicaid and the success of our State marketplace, Kynect, more than  half a million Kentuckians in a State of 4 million have gained quality,  affordable coverage. In Louisville alone, the uninsured rate dropped 81  percent.   In a State with tremendous health needs, we are a national model of  ACA success. Even our Republican Senator, Rand Paul, and our Republican  Governor, Matt Bevin, who are vehemently opposed to the law, know we  can't go back to where we were before the ACA. They now acknowledge  that Republicans in Congress should not repeal the Affordable Care Act  without immediately replacing it.   Much of the debate about the ACA focuses on the 20 million newly  insured individuals, but the law has done much more than that. Millions  of seniors on Medicare have saved on prescription drug coverage. For  people on their employer's plan, out-of-pocket costs are capped, and  lifetime limits are gone. If you are one of the 129 million Americans  with a preexisting condition, you currently have the peace of mind of  knowing that you can always get coverage if you lose your job, change  your job, or start your own business.   Let me tell you about Steve Riggert, my constituent who recently  wrote to me. When Steve's daughter Anna was 12, she was diagnosed with  chronic pancreatitis, a rare disease for a child. This is Anna. Over  the next 3 years, she was hospitalized 15 times. Despite their best  efforts and prayers, transplant surgery did not achieve success. She  has struggled with diabetes and complications. At age 22, she has been  hospitalized 26 times for various reasons.   From the beginning, Steve knew that Anna's preexisting condition  would make getting medical coverage difficult. So far, he has been able  to cover her medical bills through his employer plan. When the ACA was  passed, he was immensely relieved that Anna could always get coverage  even though she has had a serious preexisting medical condition.   But the Republican plan to repeal the ACA has now left Steve  feeling--and these are his words--helpless, petrified, and, literally,  losing sleep. At age 64 and recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer,  he fears for how much he can support her. To quote his letter: ``Repeal  of all aspects of the Affordable Care Act would place everything I have  worked for and those I care about in jeopardy.''   Mr. Chairman, I am here today to fight for Steve, for Anna, and for  all the Americans across the country who are begging you not to take  away their health care. Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a  replacement will cause chaos. Nearly 30 million people would lose  coverage, including more than 4 million kids. Any consumers left in the  individual market are likely to face higher premiums and fewer choices  as insurers exit the system.   It has been nearly 7 years since the Affordable Care Act was signed  into law, and Republicans still do not have a viable plan to replace  it, period. Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers said  this week that the Republican replacement plan will guarantee ``no one  who has coverage today because of ObamaCare will lose that coverage.''   We are waiting for that plan because none of the bills Republicans  will wave from that podium today meet that standard or has the support  of the majority of their Conference. Democrats offered a number of  amendments to this budget to protect the ACA and make it reflect the  priorities of American families. We owe the millions of people who are  deeply concerned about this process nothing less. Unfortunately,  Republicans refuse to allow a vote on a single one.   Putting American families and our Nation's healthcare system at risk  is irresponsible. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose the  Republican budget. The American people deserve better. Anna deserves  better. Her father and her family deserve better.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague for the  shout-out to Kentucky. He neglected to mention that our Governor,  Republican Governor, who was elected in 2015 has done virtually  everything he could over the last year to sabotage the Affordable Care  Act, including dismantling our incredibly successful Kynect exchange,  and that is one of the reasons why some of the enrollments declined,  because he has made it harder for people to enroll.   I would remind my friend, also, that his vote today to repeal the  Affordable Care Act will result in 339,000 people from his State of  Indiana losing their healthcare coverage, 55,000 workers losing their  jobs, and an economic loss of $30.4 billion in gross State product over  5 years in Indiana.   I now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) for a  unanimous consent request.   (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)

Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of the Committee on  Small Business.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Chairman, everybody in this room wants the same thing. We want  the best quality of care available to the most people at the lowest  price. That is what every American wants. That is what Republicans and  Democrats alike want.   We have put our plan to do that on the table. We recognize that there  are ways it could be improved. But the idea that there is a plan  competing on the other side is just hilarious.                                time  1330    Last night, I testified at the Rules Committee before Chairman  Sessions. Chairman Sessions introduced a bill last year. He had one  cosponsor. That gentleman is no longer in the House, so he has no  cosponsors as of now. His plan is called the World's Greatest  Healthcare Act. I like the name, but I don't know how that relates to  any of those other plans. I know that probably some of the elements are  similar.   This is the problem with the exercise we are going through. We are  heading down a road with no final determination or destination. We are  going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, eliminating all the  protections that we have provided for 300 million Americans--expanded  coverage, expanded guarantees, benefits, and quality--and we don't know  what the alternative is.   Waiving around a bunch of papers does not mean there is a plan. It  does not mean that the Republicans can say to the American public:  ``Here is what your health care is going to look like when we get  finished with our repeal and replace.'' They just can't do that.   That is why only 18 percent of the American people, according to a  Kaiser survey, want this course of action, want a repeal without a  replacement.   All I have to say is, if we go down this path, we won't have repeal  and replace. What we will have is repeal and repent because we are  going to owe a huge apology to the American people for the damage that  we have caused.   I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment in the nature of a  substitute.    Mr. Chairman, the Republican rush to eliminate the  Affordable Care Act, to take health insurance from 30 million  Americans, introduce chaos into the health insurance market, and give  millionaires and billionaires a giant tax cut is misguided and does not  reflect the values of the American people. On top of that, it can  significantly damage our economy.   Repeal will upend our Nation's healthcare system. Hospitals will see  a spike in uncompensated care, leading to reduced services, job cuts,  or higher prices for every one. It will cost the Nation 2.6 million  jobs in 2019 alone, including 44,000 jobs in Kentucky. The hit to the  economy will be in the trillions of dollars, and it will give  corporations and the wealthy hundreds of billions of dollars of tax  cuts.   Repeal isn't about what is best for the American people. It is solely  about politics and what is in the financial interest of the well-off  and the well-connected. There is absolutely no logic to this.   That said, if Republicans are determined to rush something through  Congress right now using the budget process, we would suggest a totally  different approach. Let's look at areas where this Congress and this  incoming administration can work together to address a pressing  challenge facing the country.   Members of both parties and the President-elect have expressed  support for repairing our Nation's failing infrastructure, investing in  our roads, bridges, ports, and other transportation needs to create  jobs and build a stronger economic future. The substitute I have  offered today provides the budget procedures needed for such a bill to  be considered.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this alternative budget so  we can move our Nation forward together.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a new member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, as I said in my closing to the debate on  the resolution itself, it would be wonderful if the Republicans had a  plan that they could describe to the American people so that American  families would know what would be in their healthcare future. It would  also be nice if they would wait to repeal the Affordable Care Act until  they could do that. I think the American people expect it. The poll I  mentioned from Kaiser, 82 percent of the people preferred to go in that  direction. Let's find out if there is a better way.   I have said many times in public the reason there has been no  Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act is because there  really are only two alternatives: one is to go back to the era in which  insurance companies decided who lived and died, and the other one is to  go to single payer, something like Medicare for everyone. I would love  to discuss that option. I think it would be immensely popular in this  country. But, instead, Republicans come up with ideas that are drifting  in the other direction, again, back to not patient-centered care but  back to insurance company-centered care.   The important thing today is that we have an alternative here through  which we can actually do something constructive for the American  people, something that will help the economy, something that will make  vital investments in our Nation and the future economy instead of  putting the country's healthcare system at risk. That is what this  amendment does. That is why I introduced it, and that is why I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
