 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss how my fellow  Democrats and I are putting people over politics.   We are lowering the cost of lifesaving prescription medication such  as insulin to $35 for all Americans, and we have capped that for  seniors, as well.   We are increasing the American middle class with more than 13.5  million jobs created since President Biden took office and supporting  policies that help American families.   We are providing clean drinking water and high-speed internet to more  American homes every single day, and we are fighting to protect a  woman's right to make her own health choices.   In addition, we are working to make communities safer and defend our  freedoms across the world. For example, my Safer Neighborhoods Gun  Buyback Act would use Federal grants to buy guns back from gun owners  and get them off the streets.   I am proud to belong to the Democratic Party because it supports the  American people.                            ____________________
