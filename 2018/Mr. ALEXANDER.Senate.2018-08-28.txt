 Mr. President, I join with Senator Murray in  recognizing Dr. Marcia Crosse. In recognition of her achievements, she  has been honored within GAO through meritorious and distinguished  service awards for her technical excellence and dedication to client  service, as well as across government as a 2014 finalist for a Samuel  J. Heyman Service to America Medal for Citizen Services. Both within  GAO and in Congress, Dr. Crosse is recognized as a consummate  professional and an independent and creative thinker who understands  the issues, gets to the bottom of problems, and communicates those  issues clearly to Members of Congress, our staff, and to the agencies  she works with. Thanks to the dedication and expertise of Dr. Crosse,  not only are vital parts of our government working better, but  Americans are better off as well.                            ____________________
