 Madam Speaker, I rise today to give honor to a great  public servant, Judge Damon Keith. Judge Damon Keith was a judge of the  United States Court of Appeals.   He was born on July 4, 1922, a fitting day for someone who so  believed in American democracy.   He attended Howard and was mentored by the future Supreme Court  Justice, Thurgood Marshall.   In 1967, he was nominated to a seat on the United States District  Court for the Eastern District of Michigan by President Johnson. This  nomination came at the suggestion of Michigan Senator Phil Hart, the  remarkable namesake of the Hart Senate Office Building.   Judge Keith's career was spent fighting for civil rights and civil  liberties, particularly for communities within the 14th District. He  stood for transparency in government.   Judge Keith will be sorely missed, but his years of tireless service  as a champion for civil rights will never be forgotten.   In 2002, he issued an opinion on the secret hearings for alleged  terrorists after the 9/11 attacks. He famously wrote: ``Democracies die  behind closed doors.''                            ____________________
