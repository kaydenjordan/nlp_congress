 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of this amendment. I appreciate the chairman's  inclusion of amendments from Democratic Members. I am particularly  pleased to see amendments increasing funds for small-business programs  that support investments directly into our communities.   Specifically, this amendment boosts funding by a total of $20 million  for entrepreneurial development grants. In addition, this package  provides increased funding for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly  program at the IRS, ensuring that more elderly taxpayers receive  efficient and quality tax assistance. It also boosts funding for the  Community Development Financial Institution Fund for Native Communities  programs.   Another especially effective and much-needed program in this bill is  the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Act. This amendment provides an  additional $15 million to the amount provided in the underlying bill.   The Drug-Free Communities program, also critically important,  benefits from a funding increase.   These are Federal investments that matter, and I support them all.   I would be remiss, however, if I did not point out that some of the  offsets relied upon in this en bloc give me pause. Due to the  irresponsibly low funding level allocated in the Financial Services  bill, it is, frankly, not possible to find pay-fors that will not cause  damage elsewhere in the bill. So I look forward to working with my  colleagues to find a way to increase the total resources available for  this bill as we move forward in the process.

Mr. Chairman, ideological riders have no place on the  appropriations bill. The substance of the amendment should be debated  as a stand-alone piece of legislation and under the proper committee of  jurisdiction.   Unfortunately, the fiscal 2018 Financial Services appropriations bill  before us today is already loaded full of policy riders that don't  belong on spending bills.   Furthermore, this amendment would block the ability of Boeing to  complete the $30 billion worth of aircraft sales to Iran, resulting in  the loss of U.S. jobs. It would put U.S. in breach of JCPOA.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey, I  move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5  minutes.    This is an interesting debate, Mr. Chairman. Normally it  would be heard for the would-be candidates for the District of Columbia  City Council, but the issues remain far more important.   This amendment would, once again, overreach by prohibiting funds for  D.C.'s Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Amendment Act of 2014.  That law prohibits discrimination based on reproductive health  decisions. The Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Amendment Act  protects workers in D.C. from workplace discrimination if the employer  disagrees with the employee's use of contraception, in vitro  fertilization, and even perhaps a medically necessary abortion. The law  prohibits employers from making employment decisions based on  reproductive health decisions of employees, their spouses, and  children.   Without RHNDA, employers could fire a woman for having an abortion  due to rape, fire a man for using a condom, reduce the pay for a parent  buying birth control for their child, and decline to hire a woman for  using in vitro fertilization. D.C. is protecting workers from losing  their jobs if their supervisors do not agree with their most personal  decisions. This amendment would strip those protections from D.C.  workers.   For those who thought this bill infringed on employers' religious  beliefs, D.C. passed a statutory clarification that no employer was  required to provide insurance coverage related to reproductive health  decisions.   During the congressional review period, the Republican-controlled  House passed a resolution disapproving this bill, but the Republican- controlled Senate did not. The Congress had time to act on this issue,  and it failed to do so.   D.C. residents should not be subject to endless efforts to overturn  their laws. People should be judged at work based on their performance  and not on their personal, private reproductive healthcare decisions.  That is why D.C. passed this law.   To my friends across the aisle, I understand they see this as a  constitutional challenge, but, with all due respect, they are anti- Federalist and Federalist when it is convenient--and not just because  of D.C. It has to do more with issues they don't agree with. They are  very much for States' rights and local control unless it has something  to do with issues like gun violence or a woman's right to choose. This  is inconsistent and, frankly, with all due respect, somewhat  hypocritical.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is intended to cut the pay of the IRS  Commissioner to zero. It is nothing more than a gratuitous, partisan  cheap shot, an amendment offered last year that failed. I know and I am  sure there are plenty of people out there who think that Members of  Congress should be paid nothing or have their salary reduced to next to  nothing because they disagree with them or they don't like their  actions.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, there have been extraordinary attacks on  the IRS Commissioner in a wide variety of ranges, but an amendment  similar to this failed last year, which meant there were Republicans  who opposed it as well as Democrats. There were attempts to offer  impeachment on this matter, and those were partisan efforts in a  nonconstructive way. This is just one more element toward that end. It  is unnecessary.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will  be postponed.  [[Page H7345]]                        Amendment No. 196 Offered by Ms. Norton    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 196  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Before Dodd-Frank, consumer protection laws were enforced by a  patchwork of different regulations, each focused on their own issues.  The CFPB enhanced and simplified consumer regulation, consolidating  enforcement into a single authority devoted to all aspects of consumer  protection ranging from oversight over mortgages and credit cards to  unregulated products previously, like payday and student loans.   The Wells Fargo fake account scandal, which CFPB played a key role in  exposing, and the more recent Equifax data breach show precisely why we  need a well-resourced and functional CFPB.   By subjecting the CFPB to the appropriations process, the goal is not  to provide necessary oversight. Considerable accountability measures  already exist. It is to starve them of funding and weaken their ability  to do their job. We have seen this before with other financial  regulators like the FCC and CFTC, who are still struggling to carry out  Dodd-Frank rulemaking.   Therefore, I ask my colleagues to preserve the independence, stand on  the side of consumers, and vote ``yes'' on the Ellison amendment.                                time  1515     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this type of amendment bluntly imposes  cuts to government function without regard to merit or consequence.  Indiscriminate cuts to the administration accounts in this bill would  lead to weakened cybersecurity and increased threat of cyberattacks to  the Department of the Treasury systems, poor administration of grants  to small businesses, longer wait times for citizens seeking assistance  from Federal agencies, longer processing times for issuing Federal  payments, reducing the ability of the IRS to detect and deter tax  cheats, costly short-term spending decisions, and widespread delays in  civil and bankruptcy cases, just as a few examples.   The underlying bill is already dangerously underfunded, having been  cut by 6 percent below current levels. Furthermore, the administrative  accounts were a large source of this reduction to total funding, and  this amendment blindly strips nearly $600 million more out of these  offices.   This amendment would not encourage the agencies to do more with less.  Simply put, it would force the agencies and our constituents to do less  with less.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, just across-the-board cuts are an abdication  of responsibility. It is up to us as appropriators to determine exactly  what needs funding and at what levels. For those reasons, I ask my  colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan  will be postponed.          Amendment No. 205 Offered by Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 205  printed in House Report 115-297.   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 360, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $6,000,000)''.        Page 384, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $6,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, HIDTA, the High Intensity  Drug Trafficking Area, is a critically important program that brings  together Federal, State, and local law enforcement, and it is making a  difference in my home State and in many parts of the country.  [[Page H7352]]    HIDTA is a flexible program that has helped law enforcement afford  critical overtime and equipment that they would struggle to afford.  This program is tackling our most challenging public health and safety  issue of our time: the drug opioid epidemic.   HIDTA is needed. The opioid epidemic is getting worse, and this is  not a time to hold back on funding programs that work.   At Thomas Health System in South Charleston, West Virginia, the  number of infants born exposed to opioids and other drugs increased  from 95 babies in 2013 to 189 babies in 2016. That is an increase of 99  percent in just 4 years.   Overdose death rates continue to climb as well. In my home town in  Huntington, overdoses in 2017 have already surpassed the number in  2016. In 2017, there have been 1,250 overdoses, an increase of--get  this--450 percent since 2014, a 450 percent increase in 4 years.   Just last year, West Virginia added two new HIDTA counties and  another county's application is pending review.   HIDTA works. It is evident, with counties across this country  applying to become HIDTA counties, there is demand. We must increase  funding for this critical program.   I urge adoption of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr).    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey, I  move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR.
