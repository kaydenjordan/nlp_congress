 Madam President, I rise to commend Paul Bianchi,  whose leadership in education has helped thousands of children to  flourish, improved our world, and built a Georgia legacy that will  endure.   After 52 years as head of school for The Paideia School, Mr. Bianchi  will retire on June 30, 2023. At Paideia, Mr. Bianchi has built an  institution to nourish the minds and hearts of children in Georgia.   After earning an undergraduate degree and a M.A. in teaching at  Harvard University, Mr. Bianchi was offered an opportunity to teach at  The Galloway School in Atlanta. After 1 year at Galloway, Mr. Bianchi  was approached by a group of Atlanta parents who asked him to establish  a new school that would emphasize individualized instruction,  academics, and the arts. Mr. Bianchi agreed to lead that effort, and in  1971, helped open The Paideia School. Under Mr. Bianchi's decades of  leadership, Paideia has grown to serve a student body of 1,020  students. Mr. Bianchi added a high school in 1973 and has managed the  growth of a thriving campus with gyms, theaters, science labs, and  maker studios.   Mr. Bianchi's leadership has lifted thousands of young people to  understand their world and their potential. His work has instilled in  generations of students the knowledge, curiosity, and compassion to  pursue their dreams and to make a positive difference for our State,  our Nation, and the world.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, like so many whose lives Paul has shaped,  I am deeply grateful for his service to education, to Georgia, to the  United States, and to the world.                            ____________________
