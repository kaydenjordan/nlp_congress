 Madam Speaker, our sacred right to vote is in jeopardy. Led  by the divisive voice of a twice-impeached, failed, former President,  17 States across this Nation have enacted 28 laws to make it harder for  Americans to vote.   Tomorrow, the Senate has the opportunity to pass the Freedom to Vote  Act. The pandemic has shown us we can adapt and modernize our elections  to reflect the 21st century and our electorate through same-day  registration, making election day a national holiday, transparency on  dark money, and more.   Legislators must be the voice of the people and give voice to the  people, and our voices are strongest at the ballot box. That is why we  must do all we can to ensure equal access for all Americans.   I urge the Senators to vote ``yes'' on the Freedom to Vote Act. Our  Republic can't afford anything less.   We are voted for by the people and for the people, and we must  protect the right to vote for the people.                            ____________________
