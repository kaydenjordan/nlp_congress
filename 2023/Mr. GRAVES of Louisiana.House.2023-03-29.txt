 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford) for his leadership on this amendment. I also  want to thank Chairman Westerman who has been absolutely incredible on  H.R. 1, ensuring that we bring down the cost of energy, ensuring that  we bring American energy security back to the table, and ensuring that  we actually begin reducing emissions because we know that this  administration has actually increased emissions.   What this amendment does is it actually, somewhat comically, is  modeled exactly after what my friend, the ranking member of the Natural  Resources Committee, just objected to. It does exactly what he actually  voted for in the infrastructure bill. That is all this does.   To hear somebody suggest that this is actually contrary to the  environment is remarkable, and, in fact, it defies logic. There is  study after study  [[Page H1604]]  that shows that by putting energy in a pipeline, by putting carbon  dioxide for sequestration in a pipeline, it is safer. It is safer than  the alternative of putting it on a truck, a barge, a rail where you  have a better chance of leaking, and it has higher emissions.   To hear somebody object to this under the auspices of being concerned  about the environment, I don't know if it is uninformed, if it is  ignorant, or if it is just not telling the truth. I don't know. This  amendment is a bipartisan amendment.   I am going to say it again: It is an amendment that Democrats in this  body voted for months ago in the infrastructure bill. That is what this  does. If you care about the environment, you should support this  amendment.   Again, I thank my friend from Arkansas for his leadership.
