 Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying killing a baby is  not healthcare if it is done in an elective abortion. Clearly, the Hyde  amendment gives exceptions for life of the mother, rape, and incest.   Mr. Speaker, we shouldn't really have to be here talking about this  issue today, but we are. The amendment we are speaking in support of  today would repeal the Department of Defense's policy that facilitates  elective abortion at taxpayers' expense. Whether those funds are for  travel or any other purpose related to abortion, they are illegal.   Mr. Speaker, it seems pretty cut and dry to me and many of my  colleagues that what the Department of Defense is doing now is not in  line with longstanding and current law, according to the Hyde  amendment.   While the administration might disagree with the Supreme Court's  decision with respect to Dobbs, that does not give them the right to  circumvent the law. Taxpayer funds should not be spent on elective  abortion, period.   Republicans are not the ones polarizing this country or injecting  wokeness and politics into the institutions entrusted with our defense.  It is quite the contrary.    Mr. Speaker, what we are trying to do is strip those  things out of the Department of Defense and return them to their sacred  duty of defending the country.   I voted in support of this amendment during the House consideration  of the NDAA because it was the right thing to do.   As the House just agreed to proceed in conference, I strongly  encourage House conferees to advocate for its inclusion in the final  product in conference.   This is an issue about the rule of law and pushing back on an  administration that has demonstrated its appetite to ignore it.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for  his leadership as we head into conference.
