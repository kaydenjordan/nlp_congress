 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the  time.   Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues in support of this rule. It will  continue urgent support for our small businesses, hospitals, and  healthcare providers on the front line.   Madam Speaker, I want to commend the House leadership for ensuring  that this agreement, which includes the agreement that we will pass  later on today, includes $120 million more in small business relief  that the Senate initially wanted to provide.   I am pleased to see that we will include SBA disaster loan programs  and other provisions for extra support for small businesses.   The dynamic work of the members of the House leadership have been  hard fought for those forgotten, and I have a great concern that  without the select committee, the implementation of the incredible work  will not be done.   Reporting requirements holding this administration to task are  important for those that have been forgotten, for people like those in  the Virgin Islands and for those who have been disproportionately  affected by this law.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the rule.                                time  1115
