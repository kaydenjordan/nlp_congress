 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H. Res. 296 that commemorates the Armenian genocide through  official recognition and remembrance.   More than 100 years ago, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were  massacred by the Ottoman Empire. There is no argument that this  undeniable crime against humanity occurred. It is not an opinion or an  interpretation of events. It is fact.   Yet, despite the overwhelming consensus of historians and scholars,  there are those who would deny the awful truth that this was a  genocide. To those, I would say if you do not recognize the darkest  pages of history, you will never fully learn the lessons they hold.   Today, I stand with my constituents from across my district, but  particularly from Watertown, Massachusetts, home to a thriving Armenian  diaspora community, to urge this House to pass H. Res. 296 and  recognize this crime against humanity for what it was, a genocide.                            ____________________
