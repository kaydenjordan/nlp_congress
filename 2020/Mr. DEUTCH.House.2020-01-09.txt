 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this War Powers  Resolution, and I thank my colleague from Michigan, Representative  Slotkin, for leading this effort today to assert Congress' rightful  authority and to defend our solemn constitutional duty.   None of us want to see our brave men and women sent into another war.   To be clear, this vote is not about telling the administration that  the President can't defend this country. My colleagues know that. They  understand it. I strongly reject any implication that somehow, by  supporting this resolution, we don't take our national security and the  safety of our servicemembers seriously.   To the contrary, nothing we do today limits the ability to respond to  a real and imminent threat or defend this country and our interests. To  assert so is simply false and it is reckless.   Today, we are telling the President that, if there is a serious  threat to the United States, our national security requires that a  solemn decision is made to engage U.S. Forces, and the elected  representatives of this body, of the American people, need to have that  case made to them.    Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to have a robust debate about  any authorization for the use of military force.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I urge my colleagues to uphold  the Constitution.
