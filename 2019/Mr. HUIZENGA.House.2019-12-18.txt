 Madam Speaker, in her own words, Speaker Pelosi said  impeachment must be compelling, overwhelming, and bipartisan. These  Articles of Impeachment being considered today by the House fail to  meet Speaker Pelosi's own standards.   Process matters, folks. Representing a good chunk of Gerald Ford's  old district and being a staffer during the Clinton administration, I  have an intimate understanding of the effects of impeachment on this  Nation. I am stunned to see my Democratic colleagues whitewash, or  maybe I should say ``Whitewater,'' Bill Clinton's cooperation with the  House of Representatives. That is not exactly what was going on.   This is the most partisan impeachment that we have seen in our  Nation's history.
