 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  105th birthday of Lieutenant Colonel Bill Wheeler, which was on March  24.   Mr. Wheeler joined the U.S. Army in April 1941, during the buildup to  U.S. involvement in World War II. He was eventually selected to be a  member of the Army Air Corps, where he was commissioned as a second  lieutenant.   Mr. Wheeler then went on to earn his pilot's wings in 1942, 1 year  after the attacks on Pearl Harbor.   After serving in World War II, Lieutenant Colonel Wheeler left Active  Duty to serve with a Reserve unit at Scott Field, Illinois, but his  stay was short-lived as he commissioned back into the U.S. Army Air  Forces a year later.   Mr. Wheeler continued to serve in the Air Force up until his  retirement in 1970. Throughout his career, he flew multiple planes,  such as the B-47, PT-19, and AT-6.   Mr. Wheeler's commitment to his country and his community serves as a  testament to his character and the type of American we should all  strive to be.   Again, I congratulate Lieutenant Colonel Bill Wheeler on his 105th  birthday, and I wish him many, many more.                            ____________________
