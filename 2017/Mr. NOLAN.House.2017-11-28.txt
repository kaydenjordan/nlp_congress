 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3115, the land  exchange between PolyMet Mining Corporation and the Superior National  Forest of the U.S. Forest Service.   Let me begin by saying that what the exchange involves is PolyMet  giving up approximately 6,550 acres of forestland that is surrounded by  old mining sites, with no public access. In return, they are giving us  6,690 acres, or an additional 40 acres, which is a wonderfully good  deal for the taxpayers and the concerns of the environment, if people  just look at the exchange.   At the end of the day, the taxpayers get more land and more value-- $425,000, to be exact. There is no cost to the taxpayers. The public  gets more access to the land. They get more lakeshore property, more  timberland, more wild rice land, and more wetlands.   If approved and if the PolyMet Mining project should ultimately go  forward--by the way, it has received the highest marks that any mining  project has ever received from the EPA, after almost 12 years of  review--the simple truth is that this is a good bill for the public.    Let me say it is important to note that there are some things that  this bill does not do. I need to say that because there is some  terrible misinformation floating around out there.   Number one, it does not authorize a mining project. Let's make that  very clear.   Number two, it does not interfere with the State and Federal  environmental review processes, procedures, and permitting process.   Most importantly, the preponderance of the information coming into my  office is concern for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, and  rightfully so. I was an original sponsor of that legislation back in  the day before I took my little 32-year hiatus. There is no more  precious, pristine area in this country--perhaps, the world--that needs  to be protected.   Let me show you something. For those of you who weren't paying  attention in science class, there is the Continental Divide. The water  north of that flows north and water to the south of that flows south.   This project is south of the Continental Divide, so there is  physically no way possible, short of a nuclear bomb or getting hit by a  planet or something, that that water can flow into and in any way harm  or damage the Boundary Waters.   To be specific, right here, there already is a 60-year-old mining  project, Northshore Mining. They have been mining there 60 years.   And by the way, there is sulfur in that soil, as well. It has never  caused any damage to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.   This is a good bill for the environment, good for jobs, and it is  good for the community. In no way can it harm or damage the Boundary  Waters or I wouldn't be standing here today advocating for its  purchase.   I urge my colleagues to adopt this important piece of legislation. I  remind them that it has good bipartisan support from our Minnesota  Senators and the Governor, bipartisan support from our congressional  delegation, chambers of commerce, and the trade unions.   It is a good bill, and I urge its adoption.                                time  1700
