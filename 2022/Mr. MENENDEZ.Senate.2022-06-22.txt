 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision  [[Page S3067]]  stipulates that, in the Senate, the notification of proposed sales  shall be sent to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                   Australia--AGM-88E2 AARGM E2 Missiles         The Government of Australia has requested to buy up to       fifteen (15) AGM-88E2 Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile       (AARGM) Guidance Sections; up to fifteen (15) AARGM Control       Sections; up to fifteen (15) High Speed Anti-Radiation       Missiles (HARM) Rocket Motors; up to fifteen (15) HARM       Warheads; and up to fifteen (15) HARM Control Sections. Also       included are AGM-88E2 AARGM All Up Round (AUR) tactical       missiles; AGM-88E2 AARGM Captive Air Training Missile (CATM);       HARM G-Code AUR; HARM G-Code CATM; M-Code GPS receivers;       containers; support and test equipment; EA-18G Growler test       support; spare and repair parts; software (Classified and       Unclassified); U.S. Government and contractor engineering       support; and other related elements of logistical and program       support. The estimated total value is $94 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve Australia's capability to       meet current and future threats by suppressing and destroying       land- or sea-based radar emitters associated with enemy air       defenses. Destruction or suppression of enemy radar denies       the adversary the use of air defense systems, thereby       improving the survivability of its tactical aircraft.       Australia will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Northrop Grumman       Information Systems (NGIS), Ridgecrest, CA. There are no       known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of the proposed sale will require U.S.       Government and contractor representatives to visit Australia       on a temporary basis in conjunction with program technical       oversight and support requirements, including program and       technical reviews.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-27       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AGM-88E2 Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile       (AARGM) weapon system is an air-to-ground missile intended       for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Destruction       of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) missions. The AARGM E2 provides       suppression or destruction of enemy radar and denies the       enemy the use of air defense systems, thereby improving the       survivability of tactical aircraft. The AGM-88E2 AARGM       Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM) is used by pilots when       training for SEAD/DEAD missions.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Australia.                            ____________________
