 Madam Speaker, this past week I had the  privilege to join Speaker Pelosi and several of my colleagues at the  2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Madrid,  commonly known as COP25.   Our visit sent a message: No matter what the current President says  or does, the American people stand behind the international fight to  combat climate change. We are still in.   Our only chance to stop the climate crisis is for the entire world to  come together on solutions to stop pollution, protect public health,  and build a clean energy economy. I was greatly encouraged and  reinvigorated by the world leaders I met in Madrid who were deeply  passionate and understand the urgency in finding ways forward on this  global crisis.   I pledge to bring that passion back to the House as a member of the  Select Committee on the Climate Crisis as we continue our work to put  together an action plan for both Congress and our country.                            ____________________
