 Mr. Speaker, this so-called Equality Act is the  culmination of a 50-year effort by the radical left to attack our  values, our families, our children, and our religious freedoms.   I ran for office as a Biblical and constitutional Conservative  because I believe in our Nation's founding Judeo-Christian principles  and the importance of faith and family to this unique American form of  government.   John Adams confirmed that this was the intent of the Founders when he  stated: ``Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious  people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.''   I don't think he could have envisioned we would be here today  defending the right to life for the unborn, what our children are  taught in school regarding their own gender, the protection for people  to practice their faith without fear of government, and the importance  of the traditional family.   This bill is one of the most dangerous and consequential bills that  we will ever consider. It will have a terribly negative impact on every  area of our lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject it.                                time  1530
