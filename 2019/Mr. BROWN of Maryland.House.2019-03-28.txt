 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my vehement  opposition to banning service in the Armed Forces by openly transgender  individuals because the Trump administration considers transgender  identity to be some medically disqualifying condition. Gender identity  is not a medical condition; it is who we are as individuals.   Since President Truman desegregated the military, we have torn down  barriers to the equal treatment and opportunity of every American to  serve. Women now serve in combat roles defending our Nation as Rangers,  infantrymen and submariners. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans serve  our country openly and with distinction.   In 2016, the Pentagon lifted the ban on transgender Americans,  allowing them to serve without having to hide their true identity. The  fact that thousands of transgender servicemembers are currently  serving, meeting, and exceeding standards and are deployed worldwide  speaks volumes about their dedication and contributions to our Nation.  We need their skills, their experience, their courage, and their  patriotism.   In 1948, many Americans agreed that racial segregation in the Armed  Forces was right, but history shows all of us today that they were  wrong. Former Defense Secretary Gates said: ``No aspect of Black  Americans' quest for justice and equality under the law has been nobler  than what has been called the `fight for the right to fight.'''   My 30 years in the Army leads me to believe that all Americans who  want to serve and who can meet our standards should be given the right  to fight. My deep belief is shared by General Dunford, Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, who reiterated that very belief to me just 2  days ago.   We have an obligation to allow transgender Americans the right to  [[Page H2896]]  fight for our Nation. We cannot, Mr. Speaker, settle for this  discriminatory policy.
