 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Intercountry Adoption Information Act. As co-chair of the Congressional  Coalition on Adoption and an original cosponsor with Congressman  Collins, I am pleased to see the House take up this bill on suspension.   There are an estimated 140 million orphaned children worldwide and  many families waiting to provide a permanent, loving home.   However, in recent years, countries have carried out policy changes  that have reduced our intercountry adoptions altogether. Many of these  changes are suddenly implemented, leading to confusion for families in  the middle of the adoption process.   H.R. 5626 adds reporting requirements to the act of 2000 to track  foreign countries that have made changes to their adoption policies.   This bill is a simple fix that allows families to access accurate,  updated information. It gives clarity to prospective families and the  millions of children who are in need of a permanent, loving home.   Again, I want to say thank you to my ranking member and to  Representative Collins, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
