 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Women's History  Month.   It is important to celebrate the contributions women have made to our  country.   For example, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson  helped put a man on the Moon.   Mary McLeod Bethune was an educator and served as an adviser to three  U.S. Presidents.   Dorothy Height was considered the godmother of the women's movement  for her work to advance gender equality.   Charlotte Ray was the first female, African-American lawyer in the  United States.   Ida Wells was born into slavery and became an outspoken advocate for  women's issues.   Dr. Rebecca Lee Crumpler dedicated her life to caring for low-income  women across the East Coast.   These women are a few of the many talented ones who have benefited  our country, and I get the honor of seeing their legacy in the work of  the many brilliant women making history in the U.S. Congress today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for the  opportunity to speak here tonight.   As I knew before, I have just learned again, you should not follow  any speaker with the last name Jackson.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 58th anniversary of the  march from Selma to Montgomery, and support the need to pass critical  legislation to protect the right to vote for all Americans.   In 1964, our Nation passed the Civil Rights Act. It established  clearly that the rights described in the U.S. Constitution applied to  all Americans, regardless of color.   The question I have, though, and I will raise in the future is: Why  do we have to continually ask for that right every 25 years?   That right should have been given in 1964 and been a permanent right.   So as we get through this piece of legislation, I will start to raise  that question: Why is it we have to come every 25 years and ask for a  right that we deserve?   But there were still political structures in place that denied  African Americans the right to vote. So African Americans mobilized and  promoted voter registration throughout the country, especially in the  southern U.S. States.   Few places in the country were as segregated as the State of Alabama.  In some Alabama counties, African Americans represented half of the  population, but they only represented 2 percent of registered voters.   At the time, activists engaged in peaceful protests to attack the Jim  Crow laws that kept African Americans off the voter rolls. They were  arrested and beaten for their efforts.   When famed civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was  arrested during one of these protests, he said that there were more  African Americans in jail than on the local voter rolls.   Finally, 600 brave Americans, led by 25-year-old hero, John Lewis,  planned to march from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery. They wanted to  discuss voter segregation with the Alabama Governor and renowned  racist, George Wallace.   They marched across the now famous Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, in  the hopes that they could find justice. Instead, they were beaten by  White state troopers and sheriff's deputies in a day known as ``Bloody  Sunday.''   We have come a long way in this country from the evils of that era,  but there are some people that are looking to set the clock back. The  forces of racism and prejudice have found new voices these days, and  they are trying to undo the work that we have done to create an equal  society.   In 2022, there were 11 laws passed in 8 States to restrict voting  rights, and another 408 bills to restrict voting rights were considered  in 39 States.   In Georgia, you are not even allowed to provide water to hot and  tired voters waiting in line.   Right now, there is a battle to secure voting rights for every  citizen in our country. There are still people who think all Americans  do not deserve the right to vote, and they target our African-American  communities directly.   It makes me furious that we have to go through this cycle every 15 to  20  [[Page H1137]]  years, as I stated, to keep our right to vote. That is why we must pass  the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   This bill puts people over politics to protect their voting rights.  It establishes Election Day as a national holiday. It allows voting to  be more accessible for all Americans, and it ends partisan  gerrymandering of congressional districts.                                time  2000    Even more important, States with a history of voter discrimination  and suppression would need Federal approval before they could change  their voting laws.   There has never been a more important time to pass this bill than  right now.   I am fighting to secure the right to vote for all Americans,  especially African Americans. That is why I helped pass the Freedom to  Vote: John R. Lewis bill in the previous Congress and why I am here  helping support this bill's passage in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, let us put people over politics and pass this bill now.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Carter).
