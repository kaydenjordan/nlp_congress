 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio very much.   Mr. Speaker, the Paycheck Protection Program, as we have been  hearing, has provided critical support to small businesses across the  country during this crisis.   The intent of the PPP was to prevent layoffs, maintain certainty for  workers, and help businesses weather the challenges posed by the  coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to President Trump's Treasury Department  and other leaders in this body, whom I commend, the program's results  were in line with the program's intent.   Thanks, as well, to the SBA and many community banks. Over 4.5  million small businesses have been approved for loans through the PPP,  and over $600 billion in loans have been processed.   The PPP has administered over 155,000 loans, totaling $25 billion in  Pennsylvania alone. Nationwide, nearly 65 percent of these loans have  been under $50,000--remarkable to see results of a bill in line with  its intent.   However, we all do know--and we have been hearing from our  constituents--that many businesses have not been able to reopen or  access the loans amidst many various State government-mandated  shutdowns, so additional time and flexibility to use the PPP funds will  help them meet payroll and remain in operation as we safely and  responsibly reopen our economy.   Today's Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act will enact  effective reforms which were created with input from small businesses.  Again, I strongly commend the bill's sponsors for engaging in this way.   Mr. Speaker, families are the heart of our communities. Small  businesses are the backbones of our economy. Our families and our small  businesses, with our support, will make it through this crisis and  drive the next great American comeback.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this very important  bill.
