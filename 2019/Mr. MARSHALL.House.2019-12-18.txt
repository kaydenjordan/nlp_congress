 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  impeachment of the legitimately elected President of the United States.   Enough. Madam Speaker, for the love of this country, enough. Enough  of this impeachment circus. Enough of these sham witch hunts.   I am voting ``no'' because the President has done nothing wrong. The  only thing that President Trump is guilty of is doing the things he  said he would do; and if my Democrat colleagues were honest, they would  tell us the only thing President Trump is guilty of is not being  Hillary Clinton.   The only party guilty of obstruction, abuse of power, or whatever  focus group terms they are using today is the party on the other side  of this aisle. They are obstructing the will of the American people.  They are obstructing the very foundations of our country.   By politically weaponizing impeachment, they have dangerously  shattered precedent and abused our Constitution. They, alone, will bear  this responsibility.   Madam Speaker, they will fail, and it is no wonder the American  people don't trust this body. It is past time to be done with this  circus and get to the work that matters, like securing our borders and  passing trade deals.   I will vote ``no'' and encourage this body to move on from this  heartbreaking, disgraceful day to things that actually matter.
