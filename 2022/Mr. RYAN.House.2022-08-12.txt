 Madam Speaker, this is an American bill--apple pie; mom;  baseball; and red, white, and blue. This is for the exhausted majority  of the people in this country: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents  versus the extremists.   Madam Speaker, if you think that this town has been spending too much  money and we need to reduce the deficit, we do that by hundreds of  billions of dollars. If you think seniors are taking it on the chin, we  help them with prescription drugs and $35 insulin payments. If you  think we need to increase the production of natural gas, that is in  this bill to create jobs here, lower costs here, and export to Europe  and the rest of the world to knock Putin's knees out from under him.   The most exciting thing in this bill is we double down on finally  having an industrial policy in this country to out-compete China. We  are going to build things. On top of the infrastructure bill and the  CHIPS Act, we are going to build electric vehicles, electric cars, and  electric tractors. With batteries, solar, and wind, we are going to  rebuild the middle class.   While the other side wants to defund the FBI, we want to fund our  kids' future here in the United States.
