 The leak of the Supreme Court's draft opinion on the  Dobbs case is a betrayal of confidence between the Justices, the  deliberative process, and the public.   No matter what side of the aisle you are on or what side of the  issue, everyone should find it reprehensible that such an assault on  our judicial system could even occur.   The leak breaks down the ability of our Nation's highest court to  objectively examine on all sides and come to clear answers on the  constitutionality of serious issues.   Justices consider very serious topics, such as the Dobbs case; they  should be allowed to freely debate amongst themselves and hypothesize  in their deliberations.   I expect a full investigation into this leak, and I condemn this  attempt to undermine the American judicial process. This leak has  caused protesters to now threaten the Justices' families at their homes  and where they go.   Yet, what do we get? Silence from the Biden administration. I guess  if it falls on the side of issues and topics they agree with, it isn't  violence, it is just merely protest and strong feelings. What  hypocrisy. We must put an end to this right now and have a full  investigation so they can do their judicial process in safety and  without any kind of false influence.                            ____________________
