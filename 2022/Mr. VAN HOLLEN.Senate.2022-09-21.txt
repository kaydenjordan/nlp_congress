 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following Senators be permitted to speak prior to the scheduled vote:  myself for up to 10 minutes, Senator Stabenow for up to 10 minutes,  Senator Cantwell for up to 5 minutes, and Senator Menendez for up to 5  minutes.    Madam President, I too want to thank the Senator from  Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, for his laser focus on the issue of  disclosure and transparency. And I want to thank my colleagues here on  the floor: Senator Wyden; Senator Stabenow; and Senator Merkley, who  was here before; and others within our caucus.   In fact, every member of our Democratic Caucus supports the DISCLOSE  Act. We support it because the stakes are so high for the future of our  democracy. Billions of dollars that have crept in and now are gushing  into our political system to influence our elections pose a grave  threat to our Republic and to the future of our democracy.   Make no mistake, these are corporations and very wealthy people who  are spending billions of dollars in secret money to influence people's  votes so that they can get their way at the expense of the public  interest. You have got a very few people with very deep bankrolls who  are using their funds to try to shape our democracy and bend our  democracy to suit their interests at the expense of everybody else.   And, as President Biden said in his remarks on this earlier this  week, even foreign entities--foreign entities that are not allowed to  contribute to political campaigns are engaged in these political  expenditures--under current law, use dark money, front groups, to try  to influence our elections and steer the course of our democracy here  in the United States from overseas. That, by itself, should scare the  hell out of every Senator and every American.   Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about how we got here.  How  [[Page S4905]]  did we get to a place where, in the United States of America, for  elections, special interests can spend billions of dollars to influence  people's votes without telling the voters who they are? And make no  mistake, they are not telling voters who they are because they don't  want voters to know who is behind these ads.   Well, the story begins with the infamous 5-4 decision in the Supreme  Court case of Citizens United. That decision opened the spigots and  then floodgates to corporate spending--corporate spending in Federal  elections. That is when the Supreme Court said: For spending in  elections, we are going to say corporations are people too.  Corporations can't go into the ballot box and push the lever, but for  purposes of influencing everybody else's vote, we are going to say  corporations are people too.   And that unleashed a huge amount of money into politics. The only way  to address that part of Citizens United is, of course, either to have a  Supreme Court that will reverse the terrible Citizens United decision  or through constitutional amendment. I support that, but that is not  happening anytime soon. But there is something that we can do right now  and which we are going to vote on tomorrow, and that is the issue of  secret, dark money because we can change that through our votes  tomorrow.   After Citizens United, what you began to see was not just more money,  not just a gusher of money from corporations and corporate entities  going into elections, but more and more secret money flowing into  elections. And you can see the pattern here of, back in 2006, about $5  million a year going into secret money in different ways; in 2020, $1  billion in that year alone. So the trajectory is increasing by the  year, and as my colleagues have said, we also have the situation where  one individual just contributed $1.6 billion that is going to flow in  subterranean ways through our election process--one individual, $1.6  billion.    Now, here is a point I want to emphasize. Even in that really  terrible Supreme Court decision, 5-4 decision, in Citizens United, the  Justices--eight of the nine Justices in that decision called for more  transparency in elections. Here is what Justice Kennedy wrote on behalf  of eight of the nine Justices: that the disclosure of political  expenditures ``provide shareholders and citizens with the information  needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their  positions and supporters.''   He went on to say that, with disclosure, ``citizens can see whether  elected officials are `in the pocket' of so-called moneyed interests.''   This is Justice Kennedy. He voted for the notorious Citizens United  decision, which opened the gushers of money, but he said, as this money  flows through our system, we have a public interest in making sure  voters know who is spending that money. And he says right here that it  is important for citizens to know whether their elected officials are  in the pockets of special interests.   So this vote is pretty clear in former Justice Kennedy's terms, which  is, if you want dark money, you don't want the public to know who is  supporting you in your campaigns, if you support continuing dark money.   So after that Citizens United decision, the alarm bells went off, as  they should, and many of us said: We have got to pass a law to require  disclosure. All this money is going to flow through the system. My God,  at the very least, let's make sure that voters know who is spending the  money.   So back in 2010--I served in the House of Representatives at the  time--I authored the original DISCLOSE Act. My chief cosponsor was a  Republican, Mike Castle from the State of Delaware, at the time. And we  passed it. We passed that in the House of Representatives back in 2010.  But when it came to the Senate, it hit a brick wall of Republican  opposition.   And I must say, given what Republicans had said before the Citizens  United decision about disclosure, it was a complete, 180-degree flip- flop and turnaround because the position that the Republican Senate  leader Senator McConnell had taken for decades was, We don't need all  these regulations to regulate political money, but we should have  disclosure; we should have disclosure.   In fact, when he was on ``Meet the Press'' back in the day, in the  year 2000, this was a hot issue because of McCain-Feingold. So he was  asked why he voted no on one of these campaign finance provisions, and  he said the following:         We need to have real disclosure. And so what we ought to do       is broaden the disclosure to include at least labor unions       and tax-exempt business associations . . . so you include the       major political players in America.    He went on to say--Senator McConnell:         Why would a little disclosure be better than a lot of       disclosure?    Well, I agreed with Senator McConnell in 2000. We want full  disclosure and full transparency. But what happened was, as soon as the  Citizens United decision came down and a gusher of money started  flowing through the system, including through corporations, all of a  sudden, all of a sudden: Hey, I didn't mean what I said about  disclosure. I can have my cake and eat it too--lots of money and nobody  knows where it comes from.   And, in a twist of history, when we passed the DISCLOSE bill out of  the House, it came to the Senate, and the Senate version of that bill  got 59 out of 100 votes. Every Democrat voted for it. It would have  been 60 except for a terrible twist in history, which is Senator  Kennedy passed away. And Senator Brown took his place, and Senator  Brown voted against cloture on the DISCLOSE Act.   But, my colleagues, here is the fact: 59 out of 100 Senators wanted  to move forward there, and but for the antidemocratic filibuster, we  wouldn't have secret money in politics today. But here we are, and we  have to deal with it in the here and now.   And it is interesting to hear the Republican leader. He said back in  2012, after we tried to move the DISCLOSE Act, on this Senate floor:  Dark money is a ``problem that doesn't exist.''   Then, to take things even further, he rallied Republicans, and so, in  the Republican national platform in 2012, it read: We ``oppose passage  of the DISCLOSE Act,'' by name. We don't want the American people to  know who is spending this money. We like dark money in politics.   So that brings us to today because what we saw since that vote in  2010 and then those comments by the Republican leader back in 2012 is  this huge gusher of secret money flowing. And, interestingly now, it  has also caught the attention of some of our Republican colleagues who  have been complaining about secret money in politics, complaining that  Democratic political organizations are spending secret money in  politics.   As we know, Senator McConnell distributed to reporters an email  entitled ``Democrats Let the Dark Money Flow and Like Its Power''--and  like its power. And Senator Hawley tweeted about dark money from  foreign groups, writing:         But who is funding this overseas dark money group--Big       Tech? billionaire activists? foreign governments? We have no       idea. Americans deserve to know what foreign interests are       attempting to influence American democracy.    This is Senator Hawley, the Senator from Missouri. And I don't say  this often on the Senate floor, but I agree with Senator Hawley's  question here. And tomorrow he and every Member of this body will have  a chance to vote to say that, yes, we should know about what foreign  entities and interests are spending money in our elections, because  there is all sorts of money--in fact, about $300 billion a year in  foreign money--being laundered through our whole economy, and we don't  know how much of that these days is flowing into elections. As  President Biden said, we need to pass this to do that.   And if you look at some of the titles of this bill that Senator  Whitehouse has put forward, they are pretty simple. There are whole  sections of the bill to get at the question of foreign money in our  elections. I don't know why anyone is going to oppose that.   Here we are, 12 years later, after that vote in 2010 that got 59 out  of 100 votes. It would have had 60, except that Senator Kennedy passed  away. And our Republican colleagues, who are now complaining about  secret money, have a chance to work with us and vote with us to get rid  of it. Whether it is Democratic money, Republican money, somebody  else's secret money, get rid  [[Page S4906]]  of it. Require transparency. That is what the DISCLOSE Act is all  about.   So this is another chance for every Member of the Senate to align  themselves with the overwhelming majority of the American people.  Eighty percent support transparency disclosure, and they do it because  they know how important it is to our democracy. Let's vote for this.   I yield the floor.
