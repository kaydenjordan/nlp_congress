 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record  two letters: one from the National Education Association and one from  the American Council on Education.                                                 November 15, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the three million members       of the National Education Association (NEA), and the 50       million  [[Page H9391]]       students they serve, we urge you to Vote No on the Tax Cuts       and Jobs Act (H.R. 1), a rewrite of the U.S. tax code being       voted on this week. This multi-trillion dollar plan is a tax       giveaway to the wealthiest and corporations paid for on the       backs of working families and students, and jeopardizes the       ability of states and local communities to adequately fund       public schools. Votes associated with this issue may be       included in NEA's Legislative Report Card for the 115th       Congress.        Tax plans reveal the priorities of a nation and in a number       of respects this one tells working and middle-class families,       students, and educators that they must sacrifice in order to       further enrich the wealthy and corporations. We oppose the       bill as currently crafted for several reasons outlined below.     A Giveaway to the Wealthy and Corporations sets up Drastic Cuts to                     Medicaid, Medicare, and Education         Analysis of the Joint Committee on Taxation's estimate of       H.R. 1's impact shows that the bill is overwhelmingly skewed       to the wealthy. Households with annual incomes over $1       million would receive 16 times the percentage increase in       after-tax income as other taxpayers. In addition, 45 percent       of the cost of the bill's tax cuts would go to households       with incomes above $500,000--less than one percent of filers.       Meanwhile, JCT estimates show that taxes would actually       increase for filers with incomes between $20,000 and $40,000       over the life of the bill.        For now, much of the tax cuts will be deficit-financed, but       the budget resolution that helped pave the way for this plan       previews the next phase: future legislation to cut the       growing deficit caused by tax cuts by demanding cuts to       critical services that help working people, children,       seniors, and others--Medicaid, Medicare, education, and more.       In fact, some of this impact will be immediate. According to       the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), without enacting       subsequent legislation, the tax bill will trigger automatic       spending cuts to pay for the tax changes under a ``paygo''       law. The CBO analysis concludes that Medicare would face an       FY18 reduction of $25 billion with a remaining $111 billion       to be sequestered from remaining mandatory programs.        Kansas provides a window into what this approach looks       like. In 2012, the state's former governor pushed through       similar massive tax cuts to individuals and businesses that       allegedly would boost the economy. In reality, Kansas' job       growth was anemic and the governor and legislature starved       state services. Kansas cut funding for public schools,       infrastructure, and other services, and scrambled to close a       $350-million budget deficit. After voters spoke at the ballot       box, lawmakers reversed course, raising taxes and       overriding--in a bipartisan manner--the governor's veto.       Rather than rushing forward with a partisan bill, Congress       would do well to heed the recent lesson from America's       heartland.       Eliminating SALT Deduction is a Tax Increase and Will Devastate                             Education Funding         H.R. 1 would eliminate most of the state and local tax       deduction (SALT)--taking money out of the pockets of as many       44 million middle-class families across the nation. While the       bill hammers middle-class families on this, it oddly       preserves the ability of businesses to deduct state and local       taxes--yet another example of how the bill takes from working       families to provide tax giveaways to those who are wealthier.        Eliminating any part of the state and local tax deduction       could lead to a tax increase on middle class families and       have a negative, ripple effect on the ability of states and       local communities to fund public services, like education.       That could translate into cuts to public schools, lost jobs       to educators, and overcrowded classrooms that deprive       students of one-on-one attention.        NEA conducted a detailed analysis of the plan to eliminate       most of SALT. In total, education funding could take a $250       billion cut over the next 10 years and put up to 250,000       education jobs at risk. It is no secret what is likely to       follow if Congress eliminates SALT. If there is any doubt,       one need only to listen to what far-right groups like ALEC       are saying right now. Their letter about the SALT deduction       lays out their plan--to lobby for lower taxes at the state       and local level. This means even fewer available funds for       students and public education.   Turning Popular 529 College Savings Plan into a Voucher-like scheme for                                the Wealthy         The tax plan distorts a popular education tax program for       middle-class families by creating a voucher scheme with no       income limits that is aimed at benefitting the wealthy to set       aside up to $10,000 annually in a tax-free account for       private school expenses. Both the Heritage Foundation and       Education Secretary Betsy DeVos agree, noting to the       Washington Post that the backdoor voucher plan is ``. . . a       good step forward . . .'' in allowing public dollars to       follow children to private school. Make no mistake. This       poorly veiled voucher program will only benefit the       wealthiest families who can already afford private school       tuition at the expense of our students, communities, and       taxpayers. In the end, no matter what form or name a voucher       program takes, the impact is the same. This risky voucher       program will hurt students and neighborhood schools--where 90       percent of children attend.               Elimination of the modest Educator Tax Deduction         While offering huge giveaways for wealthy individuals and       corporations, the plan inexplicably eliminates the popular       educator tax deduction that allows educators to deduct       eligible unreimbursed out-of-pocket classroom spending--      books, paper, pencils, and art supplies purchased to       supplement meager school budgets--up to $250 annually. The       popular plan made ``permanent'' by Congress just two years       ago, was claimed on 3.7 million tax returns in 2015. Almost       every educator pays out of pocket for school supplies. The       most recent study by the National School Supplies and       Equipment Association (NSSEA) estimated that public school       educators spent $1.6 billion of their own money during the       2012-2013 school year on classroom supplies. An estimated 99       percent of public school teachers spent some amount of money       out of pocket for their classrooms, with typical amounts       ranging from $500-$1,000.                 Making College Even More Costly for Families         The plan also eliminates the student loan interest       deduction. This is bad news for students and families. Under       current rules, borrowers paying off education loans can       annually deduct up to $2,500 of interest paid on student       loans. H.R. 1 essentially raises the long-term cost of       attending college by eliminating the deductions for interest       paid on student loans. According to the IRS, over 12 million       individuals claimed this deduction in 2015. Further, the bill       eliminates a provision that allows universities to waive       tuition for graduate students. Graduate students would be       taxed on the value of that tuition as if it were income,       making it almost impossible for many students to afford       graduate degrees. In a time of rising college costs and       skyrocketing student loan debt, it is unthinkable to take       away provisions that assists students and families struggling       to pay for college.           Eliminating Successful School Construction Bonds Program         The Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) Program has proven       to be an efficient and cost-effective way to help       disadvantaged communities address pressing renovation and       repair needs in schools. Investors receive a federal tax       credit equal to the amount of interest payable on the bonds,       thereby relieving local taxpayers and municipalities of the       interest burden. A school that is awarded a QZAB may use the       funds to renovate and repair buildings, invest in equipment,       and update technology which are all vital to student well-      being and success. Eliminating this program will only ensure       that more and more students will go to school in yesterday's       buildings with out-of-date technology and often unsafe,       crumbling infrastructures.           Putting State and Local Public Pensions Funding at Risk         Section 5001 of H.R. 1 could subject certain investment of       state and local government pension plans to the unrelated       business income tax (UBIT). Investment earnings pay for       approximately two-thirds of state and local government       pension benefits, which are taxed when distributed to       participants. In addition to the revenue lost from the tax       itself, subjecting these pension plans to UBIT could pose       significant and complex compliance costs that could       dramatically affect pension funds. Further, the UBIT will       result in a drag on these critically important investment       returns, sets a dangerous precedent for taxation of state       entities, and will ultimately increase costs to taxpayers.                 Rewriting the Tax Code Should Not be Rushed         In 1986, Congress undertook a yearlong, bipartisan effort       to deliberately and carefully rewrite the tax code. Measured       consideration should again be taken in understanding the       near-term and long-term impacts a tax code rewrite will have       on families, communities, and public services. Instead,       Congressional leadership is rushing the process and putting       forward a bill that further tilts the scale in favor of the       wealthy and corporations, and paid for by working families.       For all of the reasons outlined above, we urge you to Vote No       on H.R. 1.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,      National Education Association.                                   ____                                    American Council on Education,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.      Re Higher Education Provisions in H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and           Jobs Act.       Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Ways and Means Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Ways and Means Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal: On behalf of       the American Council on Education and the undersigned higher       education associations, we write to express grave concerns       with H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.        This legislation, taken in its entirety, would discourage       participation in postsecondary education, make college more       expensive for those who do enroll, and undermine the       financial stability of public and private, two-year and four-      year colleges and universities. According to the Committee on       Ways and Means summary, the bill's provisions would increase       the cost to students attending college by more than $65       billion between 2018 and 2027. This is not in America's       national interest.        It is possible to offer tax relief to hard-working middle-      class and lower-income  [[Page H9392]]       Americans in a way that does not increase college costs and       does not make a quality higher education less accessible. We       are eager to work with Congress to enact such legislation,       but this bill heads in the wrong direction.        Our main objections to the bill are listed below, in the       order in which they appear in the legislation. The order is       not meant to reflect prioritization:        Sec. 1002: Changes to the standardized deduction, which       will reduce charitable contributions to our institutions;        Sec. 1002: Repeal of Lifetime Learning Credit, while not       substantially increasing the American Opportunity Tax Credit       (AOTC);        Sec. 1204: Repeal of the Student Loan Interest Deduction       (SLID);        Sec. 117(d): Repeal of the qualified tuition reduction;        Sec. 127: Repeal of educational assistance program;        Sec. 1303: Changes to the state and local tax (SALT)       deduction, which will reduce state budgets and, in turn,       funding for public higher education;        Sec. 3601: Termination of private activity bonds; and,        Sec. 5103: Creation of a new excise tax on endowments at       private colleges and universities.        Colleges and universities also have a number of concerns       about other provisions that would negatively impact students       by lessening charitable giving, limiting university-industry       partnerships, and compromising educational quality.                    Title I--Tax Reform for Individuals   subtitle a--simplification and reform of rates, standard deduction, and                                 exemptions         Sec. 1002. Enhancement of the standard deduction        Colleges and universities are concerned that doubling the       standard deduction for individuals and couples will reduce       the number of taxpayers who itemize, significantly reducing       the value of the charitable deduction and leading to a drop       in donations to all nonprofits, including colleges and       universities. For private nonprofit and public colleges and       universities, the charitable deduction is vital for       generating private support to higher education institutions       to help achieve their educational missions of teaching,       research, and public service. While the bill preserves a       modest charitable giving incentive, its value would be       significantly curtailed and charitable giving would decline       to all nonprofits, which provide essential services to all       Americans. We are disappointed that the bill did not include       a proposal that would expand the charitable deduction to non-      itemizers, like the universal charitable deduction.        subtitle c--simplification and reform of education incentives         Sec. 1201. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)        H.R. 1 would repeal the Lifetime Learning Credit, while       only expanding AOTC to include a fifth year of reduced       support. This would be a large step backwards, not an       improvement, for many students and their families who benefit       under current law. We appreciate that the bill maintains the       expanded eligible expenses of the AOTC, which includes       required course materials, as well as the current income       thresholds. But we are extremely concerned that the       ``enhanced'' AOTC, as written, would preclude graduate       students, part-time students, lifelong learners (particularly       those seeking retraining), and any student taking longer than       five years to finish their education from accessing the AOTC,       adversely impacting their financial ability to pursue a       degree or lifelong learning. Indeed, under the changes       proposed in the bill, many non-traditional students--the       fastest growing segment of students in higher education--      would lose significant tax benefits they currently rely upon       to help finance their higher education.        Sec. 1204. Repeal of other provisions relating to education        The legislation as written would repeal the current Student       Loan Interest Deduction (SLID). Under current law, any       individual with income up to $80,000 (or $160,000 on a joint       return) repaying student loans can currently deduct up to       $2,500 in student loan interest paid. In 2014, 12 million       taxpayers benefited from SLID. Eliminating this provision       would mean that, over the next decade, the cost of student       loans for borrowers would increase by roughly $13 billion.        H.R. 1 would also repeal two important provisions meant to       exclude tuition waivers and tuition exemptions from income       for campus employees and graduate students.        Section 117(d) permits educational institutions to provide       their employees, spouses, or dependents with tuition       reductions that are excluded from taxable income, helping       them afford a college education and providing an important       benefit to many middle- and lower-income college employees.        Section 117(d)(5) is also an important provision that       reduces the cost of graduate education and mitigates the tax       liability of graduate students teaching and researching as       part of their academic programs. Roughly 145,000 graduate       students received a tuition reduction in 2011-2012. Repeal of       this provision would result in thousands of graduate students       being subjected to a major tax increase. The provision is       also critical to the research endeavor at major universities,       particularly in the crucial science, technology, engineering       and math (STEM) fields. According to data from the Department       of Education, 57 percent of tuition reductions went to       graduate students in STEM programs.        Section 127 allows employers to offer employees up to       $5,250 annually in tuition assistance, which is excluded from       taxable income. This provision has been an important means of       building and adding to the competencies of the workforce and       is a critical tool to help our nation accelerate its economic       growth.        For all of these reasons, we strongly believe that Sections       117(d) and 127 should be preserved.             subtitle d--simplification and reform of deductions         Sec. 1303. Repeal of deduction for certain taxes not paid       or accrued in a trade or business        Changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction will       have a significant negative effect on state budgets, forcing       state governments to make very difficult and harmful funding       decisions. The SALT deduction helps state and local       governments fund public services that provide widely shared       benefits. Limiting the deduction will almost certainly make       it harder for states and localities--many of which already       face serious budget strains--to raise sufficient revenues in       the coming years to fund higher education and other       priorities. There has been a long-term decline in state       support for higher education and cuts to SALT will exacerbate       this problem. Cuts in state support for public higher       education can lead to increased tuition and potentially cuts       to state student financial aid programs, raising the cost of       attending college for students and their families. History       has shown that when states need to make cuts, support for       higher education is often a primary target.                       Title III--Business Tax Reform                           subtitle g--bond reforms         Sec. 3601. Termination of private activity bonds        H.R. 1 would eliminate private activity bonds, which are       used by private nonprofit colleges and universities to       finance capital projects. This repeal would essentially       prevent institutions from using lower-cost tax-exempt bond       financing. Higher borrowing costs can result in diminished       investments in infrastructure, fewer jobs, reduced services,       and increased service charges and other fees to students.                       Title V--Exempt Organizations                           subtitle b--excise taxes         Sec. 5103. Excise tax based on investment income of private       colleges and universities        H.R. 1 fundamentally changes the way nonprofits are treated       by creating a new and unprecedented tax on endowments of some       private colleges and universities. This provision undermines       the very nature of the tax-exempt status of private colleges       and universities. While the new excise tax is currently       focused on private institutions, we strongly oppose this new       excise tax and the precedent it sets for all of higher       education.        Investment income from endowments is used every day to       support nearly every aspect of an institution's operations,       including all the components vital to its mission and the       delivery of a high-quality, affordable education, from       financial aid to research and student retention and success       programs. An endowment is not a single entity that can be       used for any purpose. Rather, it is a permanent investment       fund consisting of often thousands of separate accounts       designed for the needs of the present and the future. Under       H.R. 1 potentially large amounts of endowment dollars would       be redirected to the federal government, taking them away       from providing scholarships to our students and supporting       research and education. It also would effectively be a tax on       donors' contributions and shift money from the dedicated       purpose for the donation. Roughly 160 institutions will       likely be affected by this provision, and we strongly object       to it.        For all of these reasons, we cannot support H.R. 1 and       strongly oppose the proposed changes outlined above.            Sincerely,                                                      Ted Mitchell,                                                         President.

DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax bill  is a dangerous bill that raises taxes on 36 million middle class  households; takes healthcare from tens of millions of Americans;  skyrockets the cost of health insurance for all Americans, but  especially for those who are sick or have preexisting conditions; and  directly results in cuts to Medicare and safety net spending next  year--all to give corporate special interests immediate, permanent, and  monumental tax cuts.   Cut, cut, cut is all that I have heard this week: cut the safety net;  cut service for the needy; cut service for the physically challenged;  cut the poor; cut the homeless; cut Medicaid; cut education; cut out  low-income tax credits; cut out new market tax credits; cut out social  services; cut block grants; cut student loans.   Winter is here. Cut the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. If  you live in Chicago, Minneapolis, the Midwest, or the Northeast,  without any heat, you are subject to catch pneumonia and die. There is  no doubt about it.   I can imagine that college residents, hospital administrators, and  managers of programs are wringing their hands, wondering what they are  going to do.   I heard a minister last Sunday at one of the churches in my community  asking this, and he said: Pray, organize, vote.   Vote against this bill.
