 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I commend the chairman for bringing these bills  forward in committee. I also commend the Speaker of the House for  putting these bills on the agenda today, as well as the majority leader  and the minority leader. These are very important bills.   I rise today to support H.R. 2943, as amended.   This bill, which is sponsored by Representative Gil Cisneros of  California, would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to make  all fact sheets available in English, Spanish, and Tagalog.   During the markup of this bill, the committee adopted an amendment  that Ranking Member Roe offered to further require the VA to post all  fact sheets on a clearly identifiable, easily accessible location on  the VA's website and require the VA to report to Congress on the  Department's language-access plan to assist veterans with limited  English proficiency.   This would ensure that the entirety of our veteran population, as  well as their families and caregivers, are able to access and  comprehend important information about VA benefits easily. It would  also ensure that any barriers to care that might exist for veterans  with limited English skills, Madam Speaker, are identified and broken  down.   I am grateful to Representative Cisneros for introducing this bill,  and I am proud to support it today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, this is a very important bill. We were just overseas  and met with the troops, and we had quite a few servicemembers from  Puerto Rico. I would like to say that most of them spoke perfect  English, but they may not. They should have access to all the  information in their first language.   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2942, as amended, the  Helping Expand and Launch Transitional Health, or HEALTH, for Women  Veterans Act.   I thank and congratulate Representative Cisneros on this very good  bill,  [[Page H7207]]  and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this bill  forward.                                time  1715    Women are joining the armed services in record numbers, Madam  Speaker, and are an important part of the military and veteran  communities. In recognition of the brave services these women are  providing our country, it is incumbent on us to ensure that they are  aware of the many benefits afforded to them.   Unfortunately, far too many women veterans are unaware of the  healthcare services available for women through the Department of  Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration. That is why VA and the  Air Force partnered together to create a Women's Health Transition  Training pilot program.   The pilot program provides servicewomen who are on the verge of  leaving the military with information about the care they may be  eligible to receive from VA, how to enroll in VA, and how to  successfully transition to civilian life. In short, it empowers women  to make informed decisions about their healthcare by educating them  about the benefits available.   As of June 5, there have been 50 pilot sessions, Madam Speaker, and  the women who have attended those sessions have reported a 98 percent  satisfaction rate.   The Helping Expand and Launch Transitional Health for Women Veterans  Act would extend the Women's Health Transition Training pilot program  through fiscal year 2020 to ensure that women leaving the military  continue to benefit from it.   This bill is sponsored, again, by Representative Gil Cisneros from  California, and I thank the gentleman for his work. It is a very, very  important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   I want to say that this is an outstanding bill. I am glad we worked  on this bill because we have a lot of women veterans who need this, and  I want to make it permanent. So, again, let's pass this bill as soon as  possible and get it to the Senate.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  3504, as amended, the Ryan Kules Specially Adaptive Housing Improvement  Act of 2019.   Our highest calling as a committee is to empower those who have been  injured in defense of our country to live independent and productive  lives.   The Specially Adapted Housing program, or SAH grant program, is one  way we do that, and this bill makes several needed improvements to that  program.   SAH grants are awarded to certain severely injured servicemembers and  veterans to help them adapt their homes to increase their comfort and  independence. It is a quality of life issue, Madam Speaker.   SAH grants can be used to make all kinds of home adaptations,  including installing grab bars, wheelchair ramps and lifts, lowering  countertops, and widening hallways and doorways.   My bill would make needed improvements to this program and provide  prioritization when processing SAH grants for veterans with serious  illnesses like ALS.   It would also double the number of times a veteran can use an SAH  grant and increase the base amount of funding available to veterans by  15 percent.   Finally, this bill would authorize VA to provide additional funding  for veterans 10 years after they use their SAH grants to make  additional home improvements as they age. So, of course, they might  want to get into a bigger house because their families grow, and they  should have that opportunity to do so.   This bill also includes H.R. 3640, the Housing Access for Blind  Veterans Act, which was introduced last week by Representative Roe and  Representative Elaine Luria from Virginia, the chair of the  Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, to provide  additional SAH funding to veterans who are legally blind. It is so  important that we do this.   I am proud to have named this bill after my friend Ryan Kules, an  Army veteran, and I had the privilege of meeting him today and his  wonderful family. It is a beautiful family.   On November 29, 2005, while he was serving in Iraq, Ryan's vehicle  was struck by an improvised explosive device, an IED, and Ryan  sustained multiple injuries, including the loss of his leg and arm. He  is a true hero, Madam Speaker.   Those injuries made him eligible for the SAH grant program following  his separation from service. Many of the ideas in this bill came from  Ryan's own experiences with the SAH program.   I am grateful to Ryan for his service, for his continued advocacy,  and for allowing us to use his name for this important legislation.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Wounded Warriors Project and the  Paralyzed Veterans of America for their help with crafting this bill,  as well as my friend and chairman, Representative   Mike Levin from  California, who is the cosponsor of this bill and who does an  outstanding job in committee, where we work in a bipartisan fashion.                                time  1730    Madam Speaker, this bill also includes the text of H.R. 3535, the GI  Bill Work Study Improvement Act. This bill was introduced by my friend,  Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois, Representative Susie Lee of  Nevada, and Ranking Member Roe of Tennessee to improve VA's workstudy  program.   The idea for this bill came from the student veterans and school  officials who attended a GI Bill forum that Representative Davis had,  and Representative Roe was in attendance, of course. He is the ranking  member of the full committee.   I commend Representative Davis for taking the concerns of his student  veterans' constituents to heart and acting to address them by improving  the way that those payments are made to eligible GI beneficiaries. The  best ideas come from the people, Madam Speaker, as you know.   This would entail changes to the current process where the student  veterans are paid workstudy benefits by VA to a new process where  student veterans are paid directly by their school. This makes sense.  This will be done by block granting workstudy money to schools allowing  them to administer the payments to student veterans. This will improve  timeliness and accuracy of payments to student veterans.   Finally, H.R. 3504, as amended, also includes the text of my bill,  H.R. 2221, the Fry Scholarship Improvement Act, which would expand  eligibility for the Fry Scholarship to certain survivors of members of  the National Guard and Reserve. Representative   Andy Barr worked on  this bill as well, and he was a great advocate. Of course, he is an  advocate for the National Guard and Reserve, Madam Speaker. The current  Fry Scholarship provides post 9/11 GI Bill benefits to surviving  spouses and dependent children of servicemembers who have died while on  Active Duty.   I would like to thank the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors,  or TAPS, for bringing this idea to our attention and again Chairman  Levin for being an original cosponsor of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   This is a great bill named after a great American hero. We need to  pass this bill. I want to thank the leadership of the chairman and the  ranking member for bringing it to the floor.   Again, we have got to get this done for our heroes. We have got to  get it to the Senate and pass it as soon as possible because it is so  badly needed. I appreciate it very much. I thank the staff for their  support.   Madam Speaker, I encourage Members to vote positive on this  particular bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
