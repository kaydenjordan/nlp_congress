 Madam President, today, I am introducing legislation to  designate the General George C. Marshall House, also known as the  Dodona Manor, in Leesburg, VA as an affiliated area under the National  Park Service.   The legislation will be the final step in the year-long effort to  recognize the Dodona Manor as a unit of the National Park System. It  will also promote the public appreciation of the significant historic  contributions made by U.S. military leader and statesman George C.  Marshall.   George C. Marshall was an American hero, playing a significant role  in the Allied victory in World War II and serving as an architect of  one of the most significant foreign policy initiatives in our country's  history. He led a lifetime of public service, serving as Chief of Staff  to the Army during America's entry into World War II, as Secretary of  State, where he orchestrated the historic Marshall Plan to rebuild  Europe following the war and provided counsel to Presidents Roosevelt  and Truman, and as Secretary of Defense after the onset of the Korean  war. He acquired Dodona Manor while serving as the Chief of Staff of  the U.S. Army in 1941 and lived there until his death in 1959.   Today, the George C. Marshall House is dedicated to preserving and  advancing General Marshall's life's work and legacy by hosting  international exchanges, historical exhibits, and community events, and  supporting educational programming based on General Marshall's desire  to inspire future leaders. The legislation would bring greater  resources, including technical assistance, accessibility improvements,  and new programming, to this historical site and enable the Marshall  House to improve and expand its work.   I am hopeful that this designation will provide new resources to  preserve, honor, and celebrate General Marshall's legacy at this  historic site, and I am pleased that companion legislation is also  being introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by my colleague,  Representative Jennifer Wexton, who has led this effort for years.                            ____________________     Madam President, today, I am introducing legislation to  designate the General George C.
