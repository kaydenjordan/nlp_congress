 Mr. President, as a President pro tempore emeritus, I  would like to recognize the retirement of the Senate's current  President pro tempore, Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator Hatch and I have  both had the privilege of representing our constituents for more than  four decades. He has fought for the interests of Utah and his  constituents throughout his career.   Senator Hatch has shown a commitment to his beliefs. As both a  chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee during my  tenures in both posts, we have had more than one occasion to partner,  to spar, and to share a laugh. Once we even exchanged ties. I gave him  a Jerry Garcia one, and he gave me a Rush Limbaugh tie.   He will be remembered here in the Senate as a respected colleague.   I wish Senator Hatch, his wife, Elaine, their six children, and all  his family the best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Senator Nelson is the only Member of this  body to see the Earth from space. Perhaps that is why he has been a  champion of our environment, our climate, clean air and water, both  here in the United States, and for the entire planet.   Senator Nelson has said that seeing our little planet suspended in  the infinity of space imparted him ``with a profound sense of  obligation to become a better steward for our planet Earth.'' He has  never shirked that obligation. Whether urgently warning about the  dangers of a quickly warming planet or about the importance of  conserving wildlife and our natural spaces, Senator Nelson has long  understood that the health of our children and grandchildren depends on  our responsible stewardship of our planet today. What is more, Senator  Nelson understands that confronting climate change is not  [[Page S7980]]  only good for the planet but crucial for his constituents. Florida has  already begun to feel the effects of extreme weather made worse by  warmer temperatures, and Senator Nelson's work on the issue reflects  his deep commitment to Floridians.   In addition to his global outlook, Senator Nelson has shown his  willingness and ability to accomplish small changes that can have big  benefits for his constituents. In the aftermath of horrific shootings  in Florida, he didn't just offer condolences to the victims; he got to  work to call attention to gun violence, and he issued calls to action.  He partnered with me to introduce legislation that would give law  enforcement agencies the tools they need to modernize efforts to combat  gun violence. The small technical fix in this legislation--allowing the  ATF to digitize its records--would make a world of difference to police  trying to solve crimes across the country. I wish his calls to action,  like so many of ours, were heard by Congress.   Senator Nelson has devoted his career to public service, and his role  in elected office started back in the Florida House of Representatives  in 1972. Since then, he has faithfully represented the State of  Florida, and we have been fortunate to have him here in the Senate. I  am sad to see him go, and the Nation will miss his strong voice on  environmental issues. I wish Senator Nelson and his wife, Grace, the  best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Bob Corker is a businessman. He is a  husband, a father, and a grandfather. He is a U.S. Senator. But at his  heart, he is a Tennessean.   Senator Corker's success in business has translated into a successful  Senate career. In these uncertain times, where diplomacy sometimes  seems reduced to a tweet or a hashtag, Senator Corker has shown a  willingness to refuse to compromise American values for political  expediency. Most recently, I was proud to join him and other Senators  in sending a letter that triggered an investigation under the Global  Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to determine if Saudi  officials are responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.   Senator Corker also recognizes that reducing nuclear weapon  stockpiles is an important step to a more peaceful world, and he was  just one of 13 Republicans to vote for the New START treaty.   I thank Senator Corker for his service here in the Senate and wish  him and his wife, Elizabeth, well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Senator McCaskill has left an indelible  mark on the Senate. A former prosecutor in Missouri, she brought the  fight to protect the most vulnerable in her State and across the  country to her work here in the U.S. Senate.   Her work to preserve the Affordable Care Act and protect victims of  sexual harassment and violence speak to the depth of her convictions.  She has also shown great talent safeguarding our Nation and holding our  government accountable as a former chair of the Senate Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and as a member of the  Armed Services Committee.   Senator McCaskill has fought hard to protect college students from  sexual harassment and assault on campus. Senator McCaskill has even  spoken of the sexual harassment that she herself faced as a young woman  in the Missouri State Legislature. Long before the Nation began talking  openly about the extent of sexual harassment and assault across all  sectors of our society brought into the open by the #MeToo movement,  Senator McCaskill prepared a report on the extent of sexual harassment  and assault on college campuses. But Senator McCaskill has never been a  woman content with report-writing; she introduced a bill to help  address the issue. And when the Senate didn't move on that bill, she  worked directly with colleges, holding public roundtables to call  attention to the issue.   That is a just a glimpse of the determination that Senator McCaskill  brings to all of her work on behalf of her constituents. She is a  straight shooter. In the face of misinformation campaigns about the  Affordable Care Act, Senator McCaskill has always stepped up to promote  the truth. I have always admired her commitment to preserving that law  that helps so many of her rural constituents.   As a former chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee, and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  Senator McCaskill has dedicated much of her Senate service to keeping  our country safe. I greatly appreciated her support for my National  Guard Empowerment Act, which finally gave our National Guard the tools  it needs to protect our Nation and take care of its members.   I will miss Senator McCaskill's tenacity, and I am sure that Missouri  and the Nation will too. Missouri is losing a champion in the Senate.  Marcelle and I wish her, her husband, Joe, and her family the very best  in this new chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Senator Dean Heller may have been a  freshman Senator when he came to this body in 2011, but he was not  short on experience. First elected as a Nevada assemblyman in 1990,  Senator Heller has served in government ever since.   During his Senate tenure, Senator Heller has shown a great interest  in protecting American's data privacy, and he was an important partner  in our efforts to pass the USA FREEDOM Act. He was a staunch advocate  of that bill, even when many in the Senate were pushing for expanded  surveillance powers over Americans. Both of us recognized that though  the bill may not have included every provision we wanted, the best way  to offer privacy protections was through compromise.   While his tenure here was brief, I have appreciated getting to know  Senator Heller and working with him on issues of great importance. I  wish Senator Heller, his wonderful wife, Lynn, and their four children  the very best in this next chapter of their lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I know that Senator Jeff Flake believes, as  I do, that the Senate at its best can be the conscience of our Nation.  Lately, I believe the Senate has been less than that. In the closing  months of his tenure in the Senate, however, Senator Flake has spoken  about his hopes for this body and for our Nation. What is more,  throughout his tenure, he has on many occasions reached across the  aisle to bridge the partisan divide for the good of the Nation.   When I first approached Senator Flake about joining me in visiting  Cuba, he was willing to come with an open mind. He recognized the  failure of the continuing U.S. embargo, and his partnership helped us  create a new path forward that culminated in the release of Alan Gross,  an American long imprisoned in Cuba, and restored diplomatic relations  between our two countries. The few minutes on the tarmac in Cuba while  we waited to bring Mr. Gross back home after 5 years in captivity are  some of the most meaningful minutes of my life. Senator Flake's  partnership helped lead to that moment.   While the release of Alan Gross was the most dramatic event in U.S.- Cuban relations in a generation, Senator Flake has also partnered with  me on initiatives to encourage Cuban entrepreneurs, open Cuban markets  to American farmers and agriculture, and boost the Cuban Government's  respect for human rights. His assistance from across the aisle has been  helpful in shining light on the more than 50 years of failed policy  toward this small island neighbor.   I have also watched with admiration Jeff's commitment of the last  month in protecting one of the most pivotal national security  investigations in our Nation's history--the special counsel's  investigation into Russian interference in our elections. The security  and sanctity of our elections is a cornerstone of our democracy. As he  rounds out this chapter of his career, Senator Flake's stance and  insistence that the Senate act to protect the work of the special  counsel has been laudable.   I will be sad to see Senator Flake leave, and the Senate will be  losing an  [[Page S7981]]  independent voice willing to pursue bipartisan progress. That is a  voice that is needed now more than ever. I will miss working with my  friend here in the Senate, and Marcelle and I wish Jeff and Cheryl all  the best as they begin a new chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize  the career and service of Senator Joe Donnelly. Senator Donnelly has  spent more than a decade steadfastly representing the State of Indiana  in both Chambers of Congress. He has resisted labels and rigid  partisanship, consistently proving that he is open to any policy  solutions that benefit Hoosiers.   I have been particularly moved by Senator Donnelly's commitment to  defending fairness in the workplace. He has fought for sustainable  minimum wages and helped pass crucial protections for victims of pay  discrimination. His work in Congress has made the workplaces of Indiana  and the Nation fairer.   I was proud to work with Senator Donnelly in 2015 to expand the  resources available to victims under the Violence Against Women Act. We  have also worked together to pass legislation to ensure that law  enforcement have access to funds to purchase adequate body armor.   Senator Donnelly's presence and his desire to bridge partisan divides  will surely be missed in this Chamber. I know he will continue to do  all he can to serve Hoosiers and our Nation, and I wish him and his  wife, Jill, all the best.                            ____________________     Mr. Preident, you wouldn't guess it, but North Dakota and  Vermont are more alike than they are different. Both depend on  agriculture and small businesses to support rural communities.  Likewise, Senator Heitkamp and I are not all that different: We are  both natives of our States, and we both are committed to working across  the aisle to get things done.   Before running for the Senate, Senator Heitkamp served as North  Dakota's attorney general, where she worked to keep communities safe,  much as I did as State's attorney in Vermont before I first ran for the  Senate. One of her biggest achievements as State attorney general was  forcing the tobacco industry to tell the public the truth about the  health risks of smoking, and securing a settlement of $336 million in  damages for North Dakota taxpayers.   Senator Heitkamp was a strong cosponsor of the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2013. We worked together closely to include  provisions to protect Native American victims of domestic violence,  human trafficking, and sexual assault. These protections were sorely  needed, and it was an honor to fight with her for their inclusion. She  also introduced and helped usher into law the Alyce Spotted Bear and  Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children Act, which works to  ensure that Native children and families have access to critical  economic and educational resources.   North Dakota, like Vermont, struggles with affordable housing and a  rural housing shortage. As a member of the Senate Committee on Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator Heitkamp worked to help families  achieve stable housing. She sought housing finance reform and relief  for community banks and credit unions, giving more rural families  access to the economic tools they need to thrive.   Senator Heitkamp and I have served together on the Senate Committee  on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, working most recently to pass  a comprehensive and bipartisan farm bill to support the hard work of  our farmers, who are the backbone of our rural communities, and to  address nutrition and food insecurity challenges across the country and  abroad. Senator Heitkamp has been committed to ensuring we invest in  our rural infrastructure and business development, and North Dakota is  stronger for that.   Senator Heidi Heitkamp has been a tireless champion for the people of  North Dakota for longer than just her term in the Senate, and although  I will miss her, I know she will continue to serve her State in other  ways for years to come. Marcelle and I wish her and Darwin the very  best.                            ____________________
