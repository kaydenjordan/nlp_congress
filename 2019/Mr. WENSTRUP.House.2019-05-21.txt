 Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Roe for yielding. I  appreciate his leadership on the Veterans Affairs' Committee for the  many years that he has been here and has always been a leader.   As an Iraq war vet and an Army reservist, I know how important it is  to help our warfighters succeed in their transition from Active Duty to  civilian life. We should prepare our warfighters for success outside  the military from the day they take their oath of enlistment to the day  they begin their civilian careers. I think we have ignored this for too  long.   Leaving the military with a plan and a purpose is key to the long- term well-being of all of our servicemembers.   I know when I came back from Iraq as a reservist, they said, ``You  have 90 days before you have to go back to work.'' I said, ``I am going  next week. What am I going to do, sit around my house and just look at  the walls?''   You go from having a job in the military, where you have a purpose  and a meaning, and it is important that when you get out that you have  the same. That makes the transition and your life that much better.   Economic opportunity and transition programs are critical support for  veterans when they complete their service. The current structure of the  VA allows economic opportunity and transition programs for our veterans  to fall by the wayside. These programs should be treated with the same  importance as health, compensation, and other benefits.   The Veterans' Education, Transition, and Opportunity Prioritization  Plan Act, known as the VET OPP Act, aligns transition, education, and  employment programs in a fourth administration within the VA. This  ensures that these opportunity-focused programs get the high priority  they deserve and the oversight they need to better serve our veterans.   The VET OPP Act would streamline services and help the VA empower  veterans and set them on a path to a successful civilian life.
