 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  occur immediately following my remarks.    Mr. President, on PNTR, as President Biden begins the  most important foreign trip of his Presidency, the best thing the  Senate can do this week is pass PNTR legislation to land another  devastating blow on Putin's economy.   Over the past few weeks, Republicans have complained that President  Biden hasn't acted quickly enough against Putin. Yet for the past few  days, they have stymied swift action on PNTR, despite the fact that the  House approved it 424 to 8, with Leader McCarthy supporting it.   In particular, the senior Senator from Idaho has sought to amend the  bill to include an oil ban. We are willing to work with Senator Crapo  to address his concerns, but there are a few reasons we should move  quickly with PNTR.   First, President Biden has already implemented a ban on Russian oil  and gas. So passing this legislation is not a priority the way PNTR is.  Second, there remain serious questions about whether the proposal from  Republicans would delay the ban on buying Russian oil for a period of  time. This is a consequence no one wants. Senator Manchin brought this  up when he saw the language, and it is something that we have to make  certain that this proposal isn't weaker than what the President has put  into effect. Third, showing unity, particularly at this time when the  President is meeting with our European allies, is especially important.   Finally, the House is not in session. Any changes we make to the PNTR  legislation delays enactment by at least a week.   There is no reason--absolutely no reason--to change what the House  has already approved on PNTR and delay action by a week or more. Again,  Democrats are willing to work with Senator Crapo on this issue if he  can agree to let this process move forward.   So let me say it again. PNTR has already been approved overwhelmingly  by the House, and it is the most logical next step in the fight against  Putin's barbaric war, and the Senate should thus act. Republicans who  complain of  [[Page S1719]]  delay are the ones who are delaying. The Senate has been most effective  when working quickly and in unison to support the President and our  European allies against Vladimir Putin. Passing PNTR with overwhelming  bipartisan support is another chance to do just that.                                   Insulin    Mr. President, on insulin, yesterday I held a handful of  conversations with colleagues from both sides of the aisle on one of  the most confounding problems facing millions of Americans--the  skyrocketing cost of insulin. Making insulin more affordable is a top  priority to Democrats, so right now, there are bipartisan talks  underway by Senators Shaheen and Collins to cap insulin at $35 a month  and make changes to drive the cost down in a comprehensive way.   I intend to put a proposal on the floor as soon as we can after  Easter. There should be nothing remotely partisan about making sure  Americans don't go broke to manage their diabetes. So Democrats are  eager to work wherever we can on legislation that will cap insulin at  $35 a month and give millions a long-overdue break at the pharmacy.   It is reported that at least one in four insulin users has to ration  their use of insulin because they can't afford it. The exponential  spike in the cost of insulin is truly one of the most frustrating  trends of the past two decades. This is a drug with no patent on which  millions of Americans rely to manage their diabetes. Today, a 40-day  supply of insulin can exceed $600 a month--a prohibitive and downright  immoral price that makes no sense at all.   Over the past few weeks, a number of my colleagues, including Senator  Warnock, Senator Shaheen, Senator Murray, and Senator Collins, have  worked assiduously on proposals for bringing down the price of insulin,  bringing it back down, as part of our larger effort to lower costs for  American families. The latest bipartisan effort will combine elements  from Senator Warnock's and other proposals, and it has my enthusiastic  backing because lowering the cost of insulin is so important.   I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working on  this issue in good faith. Bipartisanship has been the kindling for a  number of recent Senate accomplishments, and insulin should be another  issue where we deliver.   In addition, incidentally, while we are talking about cost-cutting,  we are having hearings this week on a number of issues relating to high  cost. Senator Casey, in the Aging Committee, is leading a hearing on  home care and the high cost there today. Senator Carper is leading a  hearing on clean energy and national security and the high cost of  energy. In Agriculture, Senator Stabenow had a hearing yesterday on the  cost of rural childcare, rural elder care, and healthcare.                                  H.R. 4521    Mr. President, on the competition bill, today the Senate will take  another step to advance major, bipartisan legislation to increase  American jobs and lower costs for American families. For over a year,  both parties have worked on competitiveness legislation built around  two goals: Create more American jobs and lower costs for American  families. In the case of Senator Young and myself, the effort has  stretched back many years. The House and Senate passed legislation to  achieve these goals separately, so the best way now to send a final  product to the President's desk is by entering a conference committee  with the House. We are now working towards that end and jumping through  a number of procedural hoops to get that done.   The majority of us want to see this legislation reach the President's  desk. We want to see costs go down for families, see more manufacturing  jobs here at home, see greater relief for supply chains, and we want to  revive America's unparalleled innovation machine that fueled our  economy for so much of the 20th century.   The past month reminds us that our country is vulnerable when we  import too many goods from a single country--particularly, in this  case, semiconductors. The war in Ukraine is a perfect test case. Some  of the most important resources for making chips, like neon gas, come  precisely from Ukraine.   We need to make more of these products here in America instead of  overseas so we can lower costs, shore up our supply chains, and  preserve our national security. For that reason alone, the Senate is  moving ahead on this important competitive legislation.                     Nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson    Mr. President, finally, on SCOTUS, the Supreme Court, yesterday Judge  Ketanji Brown Jackson offered a 13-hour master class of why she  deserves to be the 116th Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. She was  simply impressive. It was clear to anyone watching that Judge Jackson's  brilliant legal mind was running in high gear. She remained measured  and poised and thoughtful as she worked through yesterday's grueling  series of questions.   Over the course of the day, Judge Jackson affirmed that she will  approach her role on the Supreme Court with prudence, a respect for  precedent, and by serving in the same mainstream fashion as the great  Justice whose seat she would fill.   At times, the judge also displayed one of her greatest strengths: her  grace and poise even during moments when a handful of Republicans asked  intentionally misleading questions--questions which even their fellow  Republicans found uncomfortable. Republicans tried to land a blow, but  Judge Jackson kept her cool. By the end of the day, it was obvious why  the judge's nomination has won the support of everyone from law  enforcement to conservative judges, to scores of peers throughout her  career. I expect she will reach final confirmation by the end of this  work period.   Now, even as the judge continues her testimony today, the Senate will  also be busy confirming scores of other judges to important positions  across the Federal bench. I am proud to say that last night, the Senate  confirmed its 50th judge under President Biden, and by the end of  tonight, we could reach as many as 58 total judges. But doing that is  going to take a lot of focus and patience, just as we required last  week. I will once again ask my colleagues that in order to move through  tonight's votes quickly, we should stay in our seats or as close to the  Senate floor as possible.   I yield the floor.                                Vote on Motion    The ACTING PRESIDNET pro tempore. Under the previous order, the  question is agreeing to the motion to proceed.    Madam President, I call up amendment No. 5002.    I ask to dispense with further reading of the amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.    I ask to dispense with further reading of the amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    I ask to dispense with further reading of the amendment.    Madam President, I have an amendment to the underlying  bill at the desk.    I ask to dispense with further reading of the amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I ask to dispense with further reading of the amendment.    Madam President, I move to commit H.R. 4521 to the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with instructions to  report back forthwith with an amendment.    The clerk will report.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] moves to commit       H.R. 4521 to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation with instructions to report back forthwith       with an amendment numbered 5007.     I ask to dispense with further reading.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I have an amendment to the instructions  at the desk.    I ask to dispense with further reading of the amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    I ask to dispense with further reading of the amendment.    Now, Madam President, as President Biden begins the most  important foreign trip of his Presidency, the best thing the Senate can  do this week is pass permanent normal trade relation legislation so we  can land another devastating blow on Putin's economy. In a few moments,  I will ask the Senate for consent to do just that.  [[Page S1721]]    Last week, the House passed legislation revoking Russia's normal  trade relations with the United States by 424 to 8--424 to 8. The vast  majority of House Republicans backed it, including Leader McCarthy and  the Republican leadership.   Here in the Senate, my friend, the senior Senator from Idaho,  sincerely believes that we should amend the bill by including an oil  ban. I don't believe we should do that. As I said earlier today, there  are four reasons why we should move forward quickly on PNTR and then  have a separate discussion on the oil ban.   First, President Biden has already implemented a ban on Russian oil  and gas, so passing something the President has already done is not  even remotely as urgent as passing the PNTR first, especially because  the President is leaving today and meeting with our European allies.  What could be better than a united Senate putting further sanctions on  Russia as the President meets with our European allies, where he has  done a very good job of bringing them together?   Second, there is still some disagreement, including with the  administration, about how to best draft an oil ban proposal. There are  some who worry that the proposal that my friend from Idaho is pushing  would actually delay the ban on Russian oil compared to the President's  proposal. This is a consequence no one wants.   Third, it is so important we show unity right now as President Biden  meets with our European allies. Swift Senate action, combining  Democrats and Republicans with one voice supporting PNTR, would do just  that.   Finally, the House is not in session. Any changes we would make to  the PNTR legislation by amendment delays enactment by at least a week.  There is no reason--absolutely no reason--to change the PNTR  legislation the House has already approved and delay action.   Now, again I repeat: I am, Senator Wyden is, and all we Senate  Democrats are willing to work with Senator Crapo on this issue, if he  can agree to let the process move forward.   So let me say again, PNTR has already been overwhelmingly passed by  the House. It is a very important and logical step in the fight against  Putin's barbaric war. We should move the House bill ASAP.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 7108    So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be  determined by the majority leader, following consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R.  7108, which is at the desk; that there be 4 hours of debate equally  divided; and that no amendments be in order; that upon the use or  yielding back of the time, the bill be considered read a third time and  the Senate vote on passage of the bill; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table without further  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, first, I thank my colleague from Idaho.  I know he sincerely wants to move forward. The best way to send a  message is pass the House bill, get it to the President, and have him  be able to sign it while the European allies and we are meeting.   But I am disappointed, though, that we were unable to take quick  action now, but I very much appreciate what Senator Crapo has said now.  And Senator Crapo and I had a good discussion this morning. We agree.  We want to get to a bipartisan resolution to this legislation.   So Senators Wyden, Crapo, and my staff are going to work throughout  the day on language related to the oil ban and the other issues that  Senator Crapo talked about that we could consider separately. We would  then move to pass PNTR separately, which we hope we can pass today or  certainly tomorrow.   So I am committed to getting this issue resolved and very much  appreciate my friend, the Senator from Idaho's willingness to discuss  it so we can work out something that both sides can accept.    I yield the floor.    OK. Folks, once again, it is Wednesday night. We are  going to try to repeat the same success we had the last few Wednesdays  and not drag this out for too long. So I urge Members to either sit in  their chairs or be around the Chamber. We have a whole bunch of votes.   I ask unanimous consent that any remaining votes tonight be 10-minute  votes.    So please stay nearby so we can get this done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  [[Page S1746]]  proceed to executive session and vote for the confirmation of Executive  Calendar No. 679, the nomination of John Chun, under the previous  order.
