 Mr. Speaker, the January 6 insurrection  may have been quelled, but the assault on our democracy is alive.   Across 19 States, Republican legislatures have enacted 33 voter  suppression laws. Here in Congress, we have witnessed unanimous  Republican obstruction against commonsense, prodemocracy voter  protections: early voting, vote by mail, election day as a Federal  holiday.   When did protecting the right to vote become partisan? When it became  about the powerful and not the people.   We can't sit on the sidelines while the most precious, sacred tool in  our democracy is eroded. The question before us is simple and yet  profound: Are you for the continuation of our democracy or are you not?
