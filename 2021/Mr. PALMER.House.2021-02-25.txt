 Mr. Speaker, I rise to comment on H.R. 803, specifically,  the debate I just heard.   This bill does not protect public lands, it turns them into economic  deserts off limits to public use and sensible management practices. At  some point we must recognize the damage that is done by these left-wing  land grabs, to our economy, our communities, and even to our national  security when we make critical resources off limits.   My Democratic colleagues are advocating land use and management  policies that are entirely misguided. As I listen to my Democratic  colleagues' speeches, I heard an almost religious devotion to the sites  covered by this legislation.   When I heard one Member talk about protecting the Grand Canyon from  mining, even though mining is already prohibited there, I couldn't help  wondering what my colleagues would think if it turned out the Grand  Canyon was the result of an ancient mining company. It would probably  be fine if it fit their agenda.                            ____________________
