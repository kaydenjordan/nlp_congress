 Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted ``no''  on rollcall No. 302.              Amendment No. 21 Offered by Ms. Greene of Georgia     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, and to  all of the amendments that have been added to this bill as a Christmas  tree and a mockery of the men and women who serve in our military. I am  opposed to making this bill into a vehicle for perpetuating the culture  wars of this extreme majority.   In particular, I am opposed to the amendment that would attempt to  enact an extreme, anti-choice agenda, to ban abortion nationwide, and  to interfere with the healthcare of women in our military who are  serving in a post-Dobbs era when their efforts to provide for their  family, to create a family, and to have the full range of reproductive  health will be compromised.    Mr. Chair, I am opposed to amendment No. 40. I am  speaking in opposition to all of the amendments that have been added.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley), my colleague.    Mr. Chair, I am opposed to the amendment that has been  offered, but I want to get back to the crux of the matter of the  Christmas tree of cultural war issues that has been added to this bill  to the detriment of our servicemembers.   My own father fought in World War II. He was a hero. He was shot down  in the Battle of the Bulge, and he served for 6 months in a German  prison camp. I have the utmost respect for those who are serving our  country and keeping us safe, but the amendments that have been passed  in this Chamber today are putting the lives of our servicemembers at  risk.   I have a very brief story from a constituent just this week who was  pregnant and very much wanted to carry to birth. She lost that baby at  20 weeks. It was tragic. What was even more tragic in a post-Dobbs era  was that she could not get the healthcare that she needed for herself,  for her family, and she was forced to travel out of State. She was  forced to get care that would save her life, and that is my point about  how horrific we are.   We are in a state in this country where my colleagues across the  aisle would put servicemembers at risk who could have been raped and  molested by members of the military, and we know that to be a very  significant risk.   Now, servicemembers would not be able to travel to get the healthcare  they need for a pregnancy that they very much wanted.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Sorensen).    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Sorensen).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
