 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of  all, let me say that I concur with the chairman of the committee on the  remarks he has made regarding his position. It is an important  position, and the points he makes about countering what China is doing  certainly is well-taken, and I completely agree with it.   I am going to object to this, but it is for process reasons, not  because the individual or because of the lack of importance of the  position it is.   In the past, we have always moved these together when we have a  partisan situation like this. When we discharge them from the  committee, they are discharged in pairs. On this particular one, we  haven't done that.   I know the chairman is going to say that that is our fault because we  haven't put a person up yet to move in tandem with this. To that, I  will concede. But having said that, again, the process is we have  always done this in pairs in the past.   I commit to the chairman--I have already talked to the chairman about  this--that we will do this. And before the end of January, we will have  such a person to move together with this.   If he asks after that, I will not object. But at this time, I have  been requested to object so that we can have the opportunity to put  that person up.   So at this point, I would object.
