 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1059, I  call up the conference report on the bill (H.R. 5895) making  appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies  for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present the conference report for H.R.  5895.   This conference report includes the Energy and Water Development,  Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch  Appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019. It is a product of months of  negotiations between the House and the Senate.   This conference report is a responsible compromise that addresses  shared priorities: funding for programs that benefit all Americans,  including national security, energy development programs and water  resources infrastructure, care for veterans, and operations of the  legislative branch. Critically, this conference report represents the  next step toward fully funding the Federal Government for fiscal year  2019.   This is the first time since fiscal year 2017 that Congress will have  passed any Appropriations bill before the end of the year and the first  time in over a decade--since fiscal year 2007--that Congress will be  sending more than one Appropriations bill to the President's desk  before September 30.   We have done our best to repair a broken appropriations process. This  is a welcome and long overdue return to regular order and fulfills our  promise to the American people to deliver results.   Passage of this legislation also provides certainty to the Federal  Government--most importantly, for our troops and their families, who  rely on military infrastructure to sustain their quality of life and  accomplish their missions, and for our veterans, who deserve full  access to their benefits and healthcare.   It is my sincere hope that we will continue this progress with the  consideration of additional conference reports.   The Energy and Water portion of the report provides $44.6 billion for  Department of Energy, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of  Defense's nuclear programs.   Investments in national security programs help our Nation maintain  its strongest possible nuclear deterrence posture, support our Navy's  nuclear-powered fleet, and keep nuclear materials out of the hands of  terrorists.   And the bill also targets an array of energy programs that support  our goal of energy independence and directs much-needed funds to water  resources infrastructure across the country.   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs portion of the report  totals $98 billion in discretionary funding. This includes the largest  dollar amount ever for the Department of Veterans Affairs, $86.5  billion, a substantial investment that will improve access to and  quality of care for veterans.   Importantly, this also includes additional funding for the VA MISSION  Act and will support ongoing care for our veterans through community  care centers, caregivers, and other medical services. This funding is  provided within the existing discretionary spending caps.   Also, the bill provides strong investments for our defense  infrastructure and military installations. This will support the  rebuilding of our Armed Forces, help counter threats and aggression  abroad, and support our troops and military families.   The third portion of this conference report includes the Legislative  Branch Appropriations bill. This legislation continues the operations  of Congress and its support agencies, ensuring that Members of Congress  are best able to serve the American people.   Within the total of $4.8 billion, provided for both the House and the  Senate, funding is prioritized for security and safety within the  Capitol complex, including increases for the Capitol Police.   The legislation helps the legislative branch improve its functions.  Of note, for the first time, we hav included dedicated funding for paid  internships, which will allow more young Americans and students from  all backgrounds to serve Congress.    I want to express my deep gratitude to the chairs and ranking members  of the three subcommittees who spearheaded this legislation--Energy and  Water Chairman Simpson of Idaho and Ranking Member Kaptur of Ohio;  Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Chairman Carter of Texas and  Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz of Florida; and Legislative Branch  Chairman Fortenberry of Nebraska and Ranking Member Ryan of Ohio--along  with all our conferees.   I also want to especially thank Ranking Member Lowey for her service,  support, and friendship throughout many years on the Appropriations  Committee.   Lastly, I would like to thank our committee's hardworking  professional and associate staff. Over the past months, they have been  working without a break to complete negotiations and get this  conference report and other reports to the floor. They are a  [[Page H8240]]  remarkable group of men and women, and I salute them.   Support for this conference report today indicates that Congress is  willing and able to get its work done on behalf of the American people  on time, under regular order, and within our set budget limits.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this conference report, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Idaho (Mr. Simpson), who is the chairman of the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), who is the chairman of the Legislative  Branch Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Carter), chairman of the Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I would like to thank Mrs. Lowey for our close working relationship  of well over 24 years.   I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the ranking members  who put this package together here, the remarkable men and women who  make up our professional staff on the Appropriations Committee, and our  personal staff who dedicated most of their August, part of July, and  certainly this part of September to doing the work of  [[Page H8244]]  the people. I am enormously grateful to all of them for their hard work  and their dedication.   Mr. Speaker, I salute my colleague, Mrs. Lowey, and all members and  staff for their work.   Particularly, I'd like to thank:   Nancy Fox, Maureen Holohan, Shannon O'Keefe, Jason Gray, Marta  Hernandez, Tammy Hughes, Rachel Kahler, Parker Van de Water, and Tom  Doelp in the Front Office; Angie Giancarlo, Loraine Heckenberg, Perry  Yates, and Amy Murphy on the Energy and Water Subcommittee; Sue  Quantius; Sarah Young; and Kiya Batmanglidj from the MilCon/VA  Subcommittee; Jenny Panone and Tim Monahan from the Legislative Branch  Subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from  the Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 46)  directing the Clerk of the House of Representatives to make a  correction in the enrollment of H.R. 5895, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 48 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  September 17, 2018, at 1 p.m.                            ____________________
