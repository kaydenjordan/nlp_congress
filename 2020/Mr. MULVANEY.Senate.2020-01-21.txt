 Again, I was involved with the process by       which the money was held up temporarily, okay?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The public reports confirm Mr. Mulvaney's own  account that he has information that goes to the heart of this inquiry,  specifically related to why the President ordered the hold on aid to  Ukraine and kept it in place, despite deep-seated concerns among Trump  administration officials.   This New York Times article on the screen summarizes an email  conversation between Mr. Mulvaney and Robert Blair, a senior  administration adviser, on June 27, when Mr. Mulvaney asked: ``Did we  ever find out about the money for Ukraine and whether we can hold it  back?''   What prompted that email? According to public reports, Mr. Mulvaney  was on Air Force One--Air Force One--with President Trump when he sent  it. What other conversations did Mr. Mulvaney have with the President  and White House officials about this unlawful freeze? The American  people deserve to know.   There is other significant evidence concerning Mr. Mulvaney's role in  implementing the scheme. According to multiple witnesses, the direction  to freeze the security assistance to Ukraine was delivered by Mick  Mulvaney himself.   Office of Management and Budget official Mark Sandy testified about a  July 12 email from Mr. Will Blair stating that President Trump ``is  directing a hold on military support funding for Ukraine.''   Was Mr. Blair acting at Mr. Mulvaney's express direction? The Members  of this distinguished body deserve to know.   On July 18, the hold was announced to the agencies in the  administration overseeing Ukraine policy matters. Those present were  blindsided by the announcement that the security aid appropriated by  this Congress on a bipartisan basis to Ukraine, which is still at war  with Russian-backed separatists in the east, were alarmed that that aid  had inexplicably been put on hold.   Meanwhile, officials at the Defense Department and within the Office  of Management and Budget became increasingly concerned that the hold  also violated the law. Their concerns turned out to be accurate.   Public reports have indicated that the White House is in possession  of early August emails, exchanges between Acting Chief of Staff Mick  Mulvaney and White House budget officials seeking to provide an  explanation for the funds--an explanation, I should note, that they  were trying to provide after the President had already ordered the  hold.   Mr. Mulvaney presumably has answers to these questions. We don't know  what those answers are, but he should provide them to this Senate and  to the American people.   Finally, on October 17, 2019, at a press briefing at the White House,  Mr. Mulvaney left no doubt that President Trump withheld the essential  military aid as leverage to try to extract phony political  investigations as part of his effort to solicit foreign interference in  the 2020 election.   This was an extraordinary press conference. Mr. Mulvaney made clear  that the President was, in fact, pressuring Ukraine to investigate the  conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, had interfered in  the 2016 election--a conspiracy theory promoted by none other than the  great purveyor of democracy, Vladimir Putin himself.   When White House reporters attempted to clarify this acknowledgement  of a quid pro quo related to security assistance, Mr. Mulvaney replied,  ``We do that all the time with foreign policy. I have news for  everybody: get over it.''   Let's listen to a portion of that stunning exchange.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Answer. Did he also mention to me in the past that the       corruption related to the DNC server, absolutely. No question       about that. But that's it. And that's why we held up the       money. Now there was a report--        Question. So the demand for an investigation into the       Democrats was part of the reason that he wanted to withhold       funding to Ukraine.        Answer. The look back to what happened in 2016--        Question. The investigation into Democrats--        Answer.--certainly was part of the thing he was worried       about in corruption with that nation. That is absolutely       appropriate.        Question. But to be clear, what you just described is a       quid pro quo. It is: Funding will not flow unless the       investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.        Answer. We do that all the time with foreign policy. We       were holding money at the same time for--what was it? The       Northern Triangle countries. We were holding up aid at the       Northern Tribal countries so that they would change their       policies on immigration. By the way--and this speaks to an       important point--I'm sorry? This speaks to an important       point, because I heard this yesterday and I can never       remember the gentleman who testified. Was it McKinney, the       guy--was that his name? I don't know him. He testified       yesterday. And if you go--and if you believe the news       reports--okay? Because we've not seen any transcripts of       this. The only transcript I've seen was Sondland's testimony       this morning. If you read the news reports and you believe       them--what did McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said       yesterday that he was really upset with the political       influence in foreign policy. That was one of the reasons he       was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody: Get       over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign       policy.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In this extraordinary press conference, Mr.  Mulvaney spoke with authority and conviction about why President Trump  withheld the aid. He did not mince his words. But then following the  press  [[Page S410]]  conference, he tried to walk back his statements, as if he had not said  them, or had not meant them. We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney  directly so he can clarify his true intentions.   Having gone through the need for the evidence, let's briefly address  the President's arguments that he can block this testimony. That  argument is not only wrong, it fundamentally undermines our system of  checks and balances.   Step back for a moment and consider the extraordinary position that  President Trump is trying to manufacture for himself.   The Department of Justice has already said that the President cannot  be indicted or prosecuted in office. As we sit here today, the  President has actually filed a brief in the Supreme Court saying he  cannot be criminally investigated while in the White House.   The Senate and the House are the only check that is left when the  President abuses his power, tries to cheat in the next election,  undermines our national security, breaks the law in doing so, and then  tries to cover it up. This is America. No one is above the law.   But if the President is allowed to determine whether he is even  investigated by Congress, if he is allowed to decide whether he should  comply with lawful subpoenas in connection with an impeachment inquiry  or trial, then he is the ultimate arbiter of whether he did anything  wrong. That cannot stand.   If he can't be indicted, and he can't be impeached, and he can't be  removed, then he can't be held accountable. That is inconsistent with  the U.S. Constitution.   You will no doubt hear that the reason the President blocked all of  these witnesses, including Mr. Mulvaney, from testifying is because of  some lofty concern for the Office of the Presidency and the  preservation of executive privilege.   Let's get real. How can blocking witnesses from telling the truth  about the President's misconduct help preserve the Office of the  Presidency? This type of blanket obstruction undermines the credibility  of the Office of the Presidency and deals the Constitution a  potentially mortal death blow.   To be clear, executive privilege does not provide a legally  justifiable basis for his complete and total blockage of evidence. In  fact, as you heard earlier today, President Trump never even invoked  executive privilege--not once. And without ever asserting this  privilege, how can you consider his argument in a serious fashion?   Instead, speaking through Mr. Cipollone, the distinguished White  House Counsel, in a letter dated October 8, 2019, President Trump  simply decided that he did not want to participate in the investigation  into his own wrongdoing.   It was a categorical decision not to cooperate, without consideration  of specific facts or legal arguments. In fact, even the words President  Trump used through his White House Counsel were made up.   In the letter, Mr. Cipollone referred to so-called ``executive branch  confidentiality interests.'' But that is not a recognized  jurisprudential shield, not a proper assertion of executive privilege.  To the extent that there are privilege issues to consider, those can be  resolved during their testimony, as they have been for decades.   And finally, the President claimed that Mr. Mulvaney could not be  compelled to testify because of so-called absolute immunity. But every  court to address this legal fiction has rejected it.   As the Supreme Court emphatically stated, in unanimous fashion, in  its decision on the Nixon tapes, confidentiality interests of the  President must yield to an impeachment inquiry when there is a  legitimate need for the information, as there is here today.   There can be no doubt that Mr. Mulvaney, as the President's Chief of  Staff and head of the Office of Management and Budget, is uniquely  situated to provide this distinguished body with relevant and important  information about the charges in the Articles of Impeachment.   The President's obstruction has no basis in law and should yield to  this body's coequal authority to investigate impeachable and corrupt  conduct.   One final point bears mentioning. If the President wanted to make  witnesses available, even while preserving the limited protections of  executive privilege, he can do so. In fact, President Trump expressed  his desire for witnesses to testify in the Senate just last month.   Let's go to the videotape.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. So, when it's fair, and it will be fair in       the Senate, I would love to have Mike Pompeo, I'd love to       have Mick, I'd love to have Rick Perry and many other people       testify.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. If President Trump had nothing to hide, as he  and his advisers repeatedly claim, they should all simply testify in  the Senate trial. What is President Donald John Trump hiding from the  American people?   The Constitution requires a fair trial. Our democracy needs a fair  trial.   The American people deserve a fair trial. A fair trial means  witnesses. A fair trial means documents. A fair trial means a  consideration of all of the available evidence. A fair trial means  testimony from Mick Mulvaney.   Mr. Chief Justice, the House managers reserve the balance of our  time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you.   Mr. Mike Purpura from the White House Counsel's Office, Deputy  Counsel to the President, will give the argument.   Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, good  evening. My name is Michael Purpura. I serve as Deputy Counsel to the  President.   We strongly oppose the amendments and support the resolution. There  is simply no need to alter the process on witnesses and documents from  that of the Clinton trial, which was supported by this body 100 to 0.   At its core, this case is very simple, and the key facts are  undisputed.   First, you have seen the transcripts which the President released-- transparent and unprecedented. There was no quid pro quo for anything.  Security assistance funds aren't even mentioned on the call.   Second, President Zelensky and the highest ranking officials in the  Ukrainian Government repeatedly have said there was no quid pro quo and  there was no pressure.   Third, the Ukrainians were not even aware of the pause in the aid at  the time of the call and weren't aware of it--they did not become aware  of it until more than a month later.   Fourth, the only witnesses in the House record who actually spoke to  the President about the aid--Ambassador Sondland and Senator Ron  Johnson--say the President was unequivocal in saying there was no quid  pro quo.   Fifth, and this one is pretty obvious, the aid flowed and President  Trump and President Zelensky met without any investigations started or  announced.   Finally--and I ask that you not lose sight of the big picture here-- by providing legal aid to Ukraine, President Trump has proven himself  to be a better friend and ally to Ukraine than his predecessor.   The time for the House managers to bring their case is now. They had  their chance to develop their evidence before they sent the Articles of  Impeachment to this Chamber. This Chamber's role is not to do the  House's job for it.   I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Just a couple of observations. First of all, as Mr. Purpura said,  what we are talking about is when this question is addressed. Under the  resolution, that will be next week. This resolution was accepted 100 to  0. Some of you were here then and thought it was great. If we keep  going like this, it will be next week. For those of you keeping score  at home, they haven't even started yet.   We are here today. We came hoping to have a trial. They spent the  entire day telling you and the American people that they can't prove  their case. I could have told you that in 5 minutes and saved us all a  lot of time.   They came here talking about the GAO. It is an organization that  works for Congress. Do you know who disagrees with the GAO? Don't take  it from me; they do. They sent you Articles of Impeachment that make no  claim of any violation of any law.   By the way, you can search high and low in the Articles of  Impeachment,  [[Page S411]]  and you know what it doesn't say? It doesn't say ``quid pro quo''  because there wasn't any. Only in Washington would someone say that it  is wrong when you don't spend taxpayer dollars fast enough even if you  spend them on time.   Let's talk about the Judiciary Committee for a second. They spent 2  days in the Judiciary Committee--2 days. The Judiciary Committee is  supposed to be in charge of impeachments. The delivery time for the  articles they have produced was 33 days. I think this might be the  first impeachment in history where the delivery time was longer than  the investigation in the Judiciary Committee.   They come here and falsely accuse people--by the way, they falsely  accused you. You are on trial now. They falsely accused people of phony  political investigations. Really. Since the House Democrats took over,  that is all we have had from them. They have used their office and all  the money that the taxpayers send to Washington to pay them to conduct  phony political investigations against the President, against his  family, against anyone who knew him. They started impeaching him the  minute he was elected. They weaponized the House of Representatives to  investigate incessantly their political opponent. And they come here  and make false allegations of phony political investigations. I think  the doctors call that projection. It is time for it to end. It is time  for someone--for the Senate to hold them accountable.   Think about what they are asking. I said it; they didn't deny it.  They are trying to remove President Trump's name from the ballot, and  they can't prove their case. They have told you that all day long.  Think about what they are asking some of you Senators to do. Some of  you are running for President. They are asking you to use your office  to remove your political opponent from the ballot. That is wrong. That  is not in the interest of our country. And to be honest with you, it is  not really a show of confidence.   I suppose we will have this debate again next week if we ever get  there. It is getting late. I would ask you, respectfully, if we could  simply start--maybe tomorrow we can start, and they can make their  argument, and they can, I guess, make a case that they once called  ``overwhelming.'' We will see.   But this resolution is right, it is fair, and it makes sense. You  have a right to hear what they have to say before you have to decide  these critical issues. That is all this is about. Is it now or is it a  week from now? Seriously, can we please start?   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, is your side complete?   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Yes, we are, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The House managers have 14 minutes remaining.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Counsel to the President indicated that we have  not charged President Trump with a crime. We have charged him with  crimes against the U.S. Constitution--high crimes and misdemeanors and  abuse of power. It strikes at the very heart of what the Framers of the  Constitution were concerned about--betrayal of one's oath of office for  personal gain and the corruption of our democracy. High crimes and  misdemeanors are what this trial is all about.   Counsel for the President again has declined to address the  substantive merits of the amendment that has been offered and tried to  suggest that House Democrats have only been focused on trying to oust  President Trump. Nothing could be further from the truth.   In the last year, we passed 400 bills and sent them to this Chamber,  and 275 of those bills are bipartisan in nature, addressing issues like  lowering healthcare costs and prescription drug prices, trying to deal  with the gun violence epidemic. We have worked with President Trump on  criminal justice reform. I personally worked with him, along with all  of you, on the First Step Act. We worked with him on the U.S.-Mexico- Canada trade agreement. We worked with him to fund the government. We  don't hate this President, but we love the Constitution. We love  America. We love our democracy. That is why we are here today.   The question was asked by Mr. Sekulow as he opened before this  distinguished body: Why? Why are we here?   Let me see if I can just posit an answer to that question. We are  here, sir, because President Trump pressured a foreign government to  target an American citizen for political and personal gain. We are  here, sir, because President Trump solicited foreign interference in  the 2020 election and corrupted our democracy. We are here, sir,  because President Trump withheld $391 million in military aid from a  vulnerable Ukraine without justification in a manner that has been  deemed unlawful. We are here, sir, because President Donald Trump  elevated his personal political interests and subordinated the national  security interests of the United States of America. We are here, sir,  because President Trump corruptly abused his power, and then he tried  to cover it up. And we are here, sir, to follow the facts, apply the  law, be guided by the Constitution, and present the truth to the  American people. That is why we are here, Mr. Sekulow. And if you don't  know, now you know.   I yield to my distinguished colleague, Chairman Schiff.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding and just want  to provide a couple of quick fact checks to my colleagues at the other  table.   First, Mr. Purpura said that security assistance funds were not  mentioned at all in the July 25 call between President Trump and  President Zelensky. Let's think back to what was discussed in that  call. You might remember from that call that President Zelensky thanks  President Trump for the Javelin anti-tank weapons and says they are  ready to order some more.   And what is President Trump's immediate response?   I have a favor to ask, though.   What was it about the President of Ukraine's bringing up military  assistance that triggered the President to go immediately to the favor  that he wanted? I think that it is telling that it takes place in that  part of the conversation.   So, yes, security assistance, military assistance did come up in that  call. It came up immediately preceding the ask. What kind of message do  you think that sends to Ukraine? They are not stupid. The people  watching this aren't stupid.   Now, Mr. Purpura said: Well, they never found out about it--or they  didn't find out about the freeze of the aid until a month later. Mr.  Purpura needs to be a little more careful with his facts. Let me tell  you about some of the testimony you are going to hear, and you will  only hear it because it took place in the House. These were other  witnesses from whom you wouldn't be able to hear it.   You had Catherine Croft, a witness from the State Department, a  career official at the State Department, who talked about how quickly,  actually, after the freeze went into place that the Ukrainians found  out about it, and she started getting contacts from the Ukrainian  Embassy here in Washington. She said she was really impressed with her  diplomatic tradecraft. What does that mean? It means she was really  impressed with how quickly the Ukrainians found out about something  that the administration was trying to hide from the American people.   Ukraine found out about it. In fact, Laura Cooper, a career official  at the Defense Department, said that her office started getting  inquiries from Ukraine about the issues with the aid on July 25--the  very day of the call. So much for Ukraine's not finding out about this  until a month later.   I thought this was very telling, too: The New York Times disclosed  that by July 30--so within a week of the call between President Trump  and President Zelensky--Ukraine's Foreign Ministry received a  diplomatic cable from its Embassy, indicating that Trump had frozen the  military aid. Within a week, that cable is reported to have gone from  the Ukrainian Embassy to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry.   Former Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Olena Zerkal said:         We had this information. It was definitely mentioned that       there were some issues.    She went on to say that the cable was simultaneously provided to  President Zelensky's office, but Andrii Derkach, whom you will hear  more about later--a top aide to President  [[Page S412]]  Zelensky--reportedly directed her to keep silent and not discuss the  hold with reporters or Congress.   Now, we heard testimony about why the Ukrainians wanted to keep it  secret that they knew about the hold. You can imagine why Zelensky  didn't want his own people to know that the President of the United  States was holding back aid from him. What does that look like for a  new President of Ukraine who is trying to make the case that he is  going to be able to defend his own country because he has such a great  relationship with the great patron, the United States? He didn't want  the Ukrainians to know about it. But do you know? Even more than that,  he didn't want the Russians to know about it for the reasons we talked  about earlier. So, yes, the Ukrainians kept it close to the vest.   Mr. Purpura also went on to say: Well, the Ukrainians say they don't  feel any pressure.   That is what they say now. Of course, we know that it is not true.   We have had testimony that they didn't want to be used as a political  pawn in U.S. domestic politics. They resisted it. You will hear more  testimony about that, about the efforts to push back on this public  statement--how they tried to water it down and how they tried to leave  out the specifics of how Giuliani, at the President's behest, forced  them: You know, no, this isn't going to be credible if you don't add in  Burisma and if you don't add in 2016.   You will hear about the pressure. They felt it. So why isn't  President Zelensky now saying he was pressured? Well, can you imagine  the impact of that? Can you imagine the impact if President Zelensky  were to acknowledge today: Hell, yes, we felt pressured. You would,  too. We are at war with Russia for crying out loud. Yes, we felt  pressured. We needed those hundreds of millions in military aid. Do you  think I am going to say that now? I still can't get in the White House  door. They let Lavrov in, the Russian Foreign Minister. They let him  in, but I can't even get in the White House door. Do you think I am  going to go out now and admit to this scheme?   I mean, anyone who has watched this President in the last 3 years  knows how vindictive he can be. Do you think it would be smart for the  President of Ukraine to contradict the President of the United States  so directly on an issue he is being impeached for? That would be the  worst form of malpractice for the new President of Ukraine. We  shouldn't be surprised he would deny it. We should be surprised if he  were to admit it.   Let me just end with a couple of observations about Mr. Cipollone's  comments.   He says: This is no big deal. We are not talking about when we are  going to have witnesses--or if we are going to have witnesses. We are  just talking about when. We are just talking about when, as if, well,  later, they are going to say: Oh, yes, well, we are happy to have the  witnesses now. It is just a question of when.   OK. As my colleague said, let's be real. There will be no ``when.''  Do you think they are going to have an epiphany a few days from now and  say: OK, we are ready for witnesses? No. No, their goal is to get you  to say no now, to get you to have the trial, and then argue to ``make  it go away.'' Let's dismiss the whole thing.   That is the plan. A vote to delay is a vote to deny. Let's make no  mistake about that. They are not going to have an epiphany a few days  from now and suddenly say: OK, the American people do deserve the  answers. Their whole goal is that you will never get to that point. You  will never get to that point. When they say when, they mean never.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                               Motion to Table
