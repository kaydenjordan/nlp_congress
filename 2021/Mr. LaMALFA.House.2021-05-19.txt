 Madam Speaker, I want to speak a little while today on  the issue going on with the Klamath Basin, which straddles Northern  California and Southern Oregon, and the water supply that has been a  long-time issue and dispute up there for many purposes, agriculture,  hydroelectric power, and endangered fish species, and how these are  going to be shared, adjudicated, et cetera.   Currently, the battle in the basin there is how waters can be  delivered to agriculture. Last year, in 2020, the situation was very  dire where, initially, 140,000 acre-feet was promised to the growers up  there. And then they went ahead and started their planning process.  They had their crops in the field based on that number. The Bureau of  Reclamation decided they were going to pull that back and not deliver  that water.   We were able to work with the Department of the Interior and restore  that water so that the crops that are already in the field planted  would not die, that massive investment and massive loss to the farmers  and to the community would not happen.   This year, we have a similar path. In March, the Bureau estimated  they would deliver 130,000 acre-feet of water, 10,000 acre-feet less  than last year. This of a water right that belongs in the basin of  390,000 acre-feet when fully delivered.   And that is where we need to really discuss this today, is that we  are talking about the elevation of the lake here. We have, at the full  mark, 4,143.3 elevation is a maximum lake. The project goes as low as  4,136 right down here. So that represents a heck of a lot of water. The  farmer's share of this, the 561 is the 390,000 I had mentioned.  Currently, the lake sits at 4,140.4 feet of elevation, so that  represents availability of 307,000 acre-feet of water supply.   Now, the species of fish that we are talking about here are the  longnose sucker fish that is in the lake. It lives in the lower part,  the brown area of the lake there. And that is where it is best-suited.  It is a bottom-feeding fish.   So the problem is that the Bureau of Reclamation, taking the cue from  U.S. Fish and Wildlife, has decided that the water that belongs to the  farmers has been adjudicated over time. The Oregon courts have held  that these water rights do belong to agriculture. This is after NEPA  and the ESA went into effect in the Endangered Species Act Oregon Water  Resources Department began the process of detailing and adjudicating  these rights.   So in reviewing the water rights of all the users in the basin, they  noted that the Bureau claimed the reserved water rights apply only to  the primary purpose of that water right, which is determined by a 1978  case, U.S. vs. New Mexico.   The Ninth Circuit determined in a 1983 case, the U.S. vs. Adair, that  this land's reservation was for the purpose of agriculture. So as we  apply that to the Klamath Irrigation area, the KID took the Bureau of  Reclamation to court over its decisions to increase downstream flows to  salmon, as well as the retention of water for the sucker fish.   So they want to retain this portion here for the sucker fish even  though this portion of water does not belong to the Bureau or Fish and  Wildlife to use for that purpose.   This project was created over 100 years ago for agriculture, to  deliver water down this A Canal through a whole entire system there.  This dam was completed, the Link River Dam, in 1921, to help regulate  that source.   So in the process of Klamath Irrigation District having taken them to  court, the State ultimately agreed with KID that the Bureau has the  right to store the water and administer the  [[Page H2555]]  water in Upper Lake, but the Bureau of Reclamation does not have the  permit, the license, the right to use the water themselves for salmon  in the river or for the sucker fish that stay in the lake.   Going further, Section 8 of the Reclamation Act clearly states that  the Federal Government cannot interfere with the laws of States  relating to the control or distribution of water used in irrigation.   So in 1978, California vs. the U.S. certified that a State can impose  requirements under distribution of water through a Federal reclamation  project as long as they are consistent with clear Congressional  directives as Congress set this back up over 100 years ago and ongoing.  The Congress has made it clear multiple times that the Klamath Project  was designed and established for irrigation.   So if you want to concede just for a moment, playing along with Fish  and Wildlife, that the current level at 4,140.4, and you take it down  to 4,138, there is 173,000 acre-feet of water available for farmers  right now that should not be taken, even if you concede the sucker fish  total.   So we have got giant problems in the basin.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great concern over the  Biden administration's foreign policy. The world has watched with  growing concern as Hamas rockets have pummeled the Israeli people,  forcing Israel to take retaliatory steps to protect its own citizens.  This escalation occurs as the Biden administration has pivoted away  from anything useful in the Middle East, neglecting Israel, which is  one of our strongest allies.   Just recently, we have learned that over $15 million in foreign aid  from this year's phony Democrat coronavirus package went to the  Palestinians, who take their orders from the terrorist group Hamas,  which is a proxy state for Iran, who wishes the total eradication of  Israel. What message does this send to our allies, sending money to  both sides?   Similarly, President Biden is looking to restart the Obama-Biden Iran  nuclear deal that President Trump smartly left. That naive accord had  broad bipartisan opposition, including from now-Senate Majority Leader  Chuck Schumer, and was strongly opposed by Israel. It is astounding  that President Biden would take the word of the Iranian Government,  whose leaders call us their sworn enemy, and spurn our strongest ally  in the region, Israel.   We have got to do better.                            ____________________
