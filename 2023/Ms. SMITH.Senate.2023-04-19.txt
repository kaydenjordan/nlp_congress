 Madam President.    Madam President, I rise today in strong opposition to the  resolution before us today. This resolution would overturn the VA's  rule protecting veterans' access to abortion counseling and care in  cases of rape, incest, or when the life of a woman or her health is in  danger; and, unfortunately, it is just the latest attack on women's  freedom to make their own healthcare decisions without interference  from politicians.   Today, veterans, their spouses, and dependents are protected and have  the freedom to receive essential healthcare in the most devastating of  circumstances.   By voting yes today, the Senate would take that freedom away. So  let's be clear about what this means. A ``yes'' vote means you would be  saying to women who are entrusted to protect our national security that  they can't be trusted to make their own medical decisions. You would be  saying that the person who has been raped or the victim of incest  should not have the freedom to get an abortion. You are saying, in  effect, sitting in this Chamber that those of you sitting in this  Chamber should have the power to decide what healthcare a veteran can  receive if she faces a serious or even life-threatening health threat  if she continues a pregnancy.   So if you are considering a ``yes'' vote, I ask you, what makes you  think that you know better? What makes you think that you should have  the power over another person and their body?   This is an insult to the dignity of people, to veterans, and to their  families. These are people who have given so much; and yet this body  would deprive them of their right to freedom and self-determination,  the very rights that they sacrificed and fought to defend.   Colleagues, I understand that people have differing views on  abortion. And I  [[Page S1236]]  respect that. But I cannot understand why anyone would think that they  should have the power to impose their own views on others in such  extreme ways, because this resolution is extreme. And everyone who  votes for it is saying that when it comes to our Nation's veterans who  get their healthcare through the VA, that there should be no exceptions  for abortion, even if that veteran has been the victim of rape or  incest, even when continuing the pregnancy would endanger the veteran's  life or health. That is not just extreme; that is cruel.   Here in this Chamber, some are also going after current  servicemembers. There is currently an unprecedented and reckless  campaign in this Chamber to hold up the promotions of career military  personnel in order to force the Department of Defense to deprive  servicemembers of their legal right to seek abortion care.   Let that sink in. They are willing to compromise our national  security and leave 187 important military leadership posts vacant in  order to enact their dangerous and unpopular anti-abortion agenda.   And they are not doing this because of what Americans want. It is the  opposite, in fact. According to a Pew Research Center poll, over 60  percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.   Before I was in the Senate, I worked at Planned Parenthood, and I saw  there, firsthand, the capacity of people to make good decisions--moral  decisions--for themselves and their families about how and when or if  to start a family. So I ask my Republican colleagues to reject this  extreme proposal. Ask yourself: Why do you think that you know better  than these women, these veterans, whose lives and stories, whose health  and family situations you will never know?   And I can tell you: For women, this is personal. They don't want any  of us making these decisions about their bodies and their health and  their families for them. They are perfectly capable of making these  decisions for themselves. So I urge my colleagues to stand with our  veterans and vote to protect their rights after they fought so hard to  defend ours.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
