 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford), our distinguished representative from Florida, my good  friend, for yielding some time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6580,  the Kerrie Orozco First Responders Act.   This legislation, named after a fallen Omaha police officer, Kerrie  Orozco, is a first responders bill that will give our heroes peace of  mind every day when they leave their home for work to keep us safe.  This legislation is simple, common sense, and compassionate.   Under current law, the surviving family members of first responders  who have pending immigration applications face delays in the  naturalization process. This could weigh heavily on our  [[Page H8848]]  first responders because of the undue burden upon them as they protect  our communities.   Should they be killed, would their family members who are not U.S.  citizens lose their ability to remain in the country?   This legislation would allow the immediate relatives of first  responders who die in the line of duty to continue to process their  immigration application in a timely manner despite the death of their  loved one.   We owe it to our first responders to ensure their family is taken  care of should they pay the ultimate sacrifice of keeping our citizens  safe. Supporting this bill will protect those who protect us and it  will give them peace of mind.   This legislation will extend the same privileges to our first  responders that are currently afforded to our military servicemembers.  This bill honors our first responders, it values family.   This bill is for Hector Orozco and all of the widows and widowers of  our fallen first responders. This bill tells our law enforcement  officers, our firefighters that we have your back.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 6580.
