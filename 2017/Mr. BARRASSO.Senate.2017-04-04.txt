 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about bipartisan  legislation that I have introduced to promote innovative solutions to  better manage invasive species, conserve wildlife, and eliminate  poaching. I have introduced this in a bipartisan way as the chairman of  the Environment and Public Works Committee, along with Senator Tom  Carper, who is the ranking member of that committee, and along with  Senator Jim Inhofe, who is a former chairman of that committee.   This legislation is called the Wildlife Innovation and Longevity  Driver Act, WILD for short. I am a supporter of both conserving  wildlife and technological innovation that we have before us.   My home State of Wyoming is truly one of the most beautiful places in  the world. The people of Wyoming have an incredible appreciation for  our wildlife. We applaud the efforts of innovators to help us conserve  and manage species much more effectively and at a lower cost. Our State  wildlife managers grapple with many challenges that innovators can help  us solve.   For example, poaching has been a major issue in Wyoming. Hundreds of  animals are taken illegally in the State. That is what I hear from the  Wyoming Game & Fish Department. Poaching is a problem across the  country. It is not just the case in Wyoming; it has become pandemic  overseas. International poachers seeking to cash in on the ivory trade  have reduced the population of African elephants by 75 percent over the  last 10 years. It is tragic.   Invasive species also present a threat to native wildlife, to water  resources, and to our landscape. Invasive species clog pipes and fuel  catastrophic fires. In fact, invasive species have a role in 42 percent  of the listings under the Endangered Species Act. It is invasive  species that are causing other species to become endangered.   We need creative solutions to these threats to our wildlife. Our  Nation's innovators are developing cutting-edge technologies to help us  more effectively fight poaching, manage wildlife, and control invasive  species.   A 2015 National Geographic article outlined a number of innovative  technologies that are being used today to promote conservation of many  of the world's most endangered species. That includes DNA analysis to  identify the origin of illicit ivory supplies, using thermal imaging  around protected areas to notify authorities of poachers, and using  apps to assist wildlife enforcement in carrying out their duties.   In December, the National Invasive Species Council cohosted a summit,  which highlighted innovations that combat invasive species. A few  examples are a fish passage that automatically extracts invasive fish  from streams, DNA technologies to provide early detection of invasive  species, and the use of drones to gain spatially accurate, high  resolution images that could be used to detect and monitor specific  invasive species. Innovations like these are why we have introduced in  a bipartisan way the WILD Act.   This act provides technological and financial assistance to private  landowners to improve fish and wildlife habitats. The legislation does  this by reauthorizing the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. The  WILD Act requires Federal agencies to implement strategic programs to  control invasive species. It also reauthorizes important laws to  protect endangered and valuable species around the world, such as the  African elephant, the Asian elephant, the rhinoceros, the great ape,  and the marine turtle.   Finally, this act creates incentives for new conservation innovation.  The legislation establishes four separate cash prizes for technological  innovation in the prevention of wildlife poaching and trafficking, in  the promotion of wildlife conservation, in the management of invasive  species, and in the protection of endangered species. The Department of  the Interior will administer the prizes, and a panel of relevant  experts will award each prize.   Innovation is one of the best tools in conserving endangered species  and keeping invasive species under control. The WILD Act will help  stimulate that innovation.   I thank Senator Carper and Senator Inhofe for cosponsoring this  important piece of legislation.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak about bipartisan  legislation that I have introduced to promote innovative solutions to  better manage invasive species, conserve wildlife, and eliminate  poaching.

Thank you.                            ____________________    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today because we are  at a decisive and consequential moment in the Senate. We are here to  consider the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice of the  U.S. Supreme Court.   Will Democrat Senators vote to have a well-qualified, mainstream  Justice who stands for the rule of law, or will the extreme leftwing of  that party continue to try to call the shots? That is a decision  Members are going to have to make.   America needs judges who can follow the law, apply the law, have the  highest ethical standards, and value the independence of our courts. To  me, that is a description of Judge Gorsuch. That is him in a nutshell.  We saw it throughout his career, and we saw it again at his  confirmation hearings in the Judiciary Committee.   Democrats on the committee asked him to answer hypothetical  questions. They asked about issues that are probably going to be coming  before the Supreme Court of the land. There are ethics rules that say  that judges and nominees cannot answer those kinds of questions and, of  course, Judge Gorsuch followed the rules. That is exactly what other  nominees have done in the past who were nominated by Republican  Presidents and Democratic Presidents.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg did so in her confirmation hearing in 1993. She  said: ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no  hints.'' She said this would display disdain for the entire judicial  process. Of course, she was confirmed and sits on the Court today. It  has been known as the Ginsburg standard, and every nominee since her  nomination hearing has followed that same standard. That is what  Justice Gorsuch did.   The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee tried to criticize Judge  Gorsuch for some of his opinions that they didn't like. They talked  about a couple of cases where the person who was on the losing side in  the case was sympathetic. They suggested that the Court should have  ignored the law and sided with ``the little guy'' in the involved  cases. Judge Gorsuch pointed out that judges are absolutely not  supposed to consider what they think is sympathetic. They are supposed  to rule on the law. Federal judges actually swear an oath ``to  administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to  the poor and to the rich.''    Most Senators recognize that judges should be impartial. The minority  leader, Senator Schumer, has actually spoken about how important this  is. At the confirmation hearing for Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009,  nominated by President Obama, Senator Schumer praised the way she put  the ``rule of law above everything else.'' He said that she followed  the texts of statutes, ``even when doing so results in rulings that go  against so-called sympathetic litigants.'' That was in 2009. Now it is  2017, and that is the identical standard Judge Gorsuch has continued to  follow.   Judge Gorsuch pointed out that it is his job to apply the law, not to  write the law. Writing laws is the job of Congress. We are not here to  select the 101st Senator; we are here to select a Justice for the  Supreme Court. We are selecting a Justice for the most important Court  in the land, and it is important and imperative that we take this  decision seriously and that we set aside any partisan grudges.   Democrats who want to filibuster this judge are not arguing any  principle here. Reasonable individuals know this nominee deserves to be  confirmed.   One lawyer wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post on March 8, a board  member of the very liberal American Constitution Society. He wrote that  ``there is no principled reason'' to vote against Judge Gorsuch. Well,  he is exactly right.   I listened to the arguments Democrats made in the confirmation  hearing. I was not convinced. If any of my colleagues on the Democratic  side of the aisle are undecided about how to vote, I suggest they go  back and look and listen to the hearings as well and look at what other  people have said about this nominee.   A Chicago Tribune editorial said that confirmation hearing revealed  ``unassailable assurances by Gorsuch that he would decide each case on  the merits, based on the law as written, applied to the world as it is  today.''   The Detroit news agreed. It said that Judge Gorsuch showed that he is  a ``deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the  Senate.''   On Monday, USA TODAY had their own headline. It said, ``On the  Merits, Gorsuch Merits Confirmation.''   The American Bar Association surveyed 5,000 people who have worked  with Judge Gorsuch over the years. These people described him using  words like ``brilliant,'' ``thoughtful,'' and ``really, really, really  smart.''   The Bar Association also found that ``Judge Gorsuch believes strongly  in the independence'' of the judiciary. This is the Bar Association.  The American Bar Association predicted that ``he will be a strong but  respectful voice in protecting it.'' The group ended up giving him its  highest possible rating. Interestingly, Senator Schumer once called  this group ``the gold standard'' for evaluating judges--``the gold  standard,'' he called it--and they have given him their highest  possible rating. So why does the minority  [[Page S2306]]  leader think the gold standard is not good enough anymore?   Judge Gorsuch was even introduced at his confirmation hearing by a  former top lawyer for the Obama administration. Neal Katyal is a  Democrat. He served as Solicitor General of the United States under  President Obama. He called Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and  brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.'' Let  me repeat. This is someone who served as Solicitor General of the  United States under President Obama calling Judge Gorsuch ``one of the  most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the  last century.'' He even wrote an op-ed in the New York Times that  predicted that Judge Gorsuch would ``help to restore confidence in the  rule of law.'' Help to restore confidence. Isn't that what we want as a  nation--confidence in the rule of law?   I think that any Democrat who has looked at this nominee's record  will find it is an easy decision to confirm him. If there is a Democrat  who reaches the opposite conclusion, I say come to the floor of the  Senate and explain why you think our judges should go into a case  favoring one side over another because one side is more sympathetic  than the other. If there is a Member who thinks that a judge should  make promises about how they will rule just to win a confirmation vote  of a given Senator, I say come to the floor and make your case. If  there is a Member who thinks a Justice on the Supreme Court should rule  based on that Justice's own preferences and not based on the law, I  would say please come to the floor of the Senate and say so.   I don't think that is what the American people want. The American  people do want Justices who are smart. They want Justices who are  principled, who are fair, and who know that their job is to follow the  law, not to write the law and not to legislate from the bench. The  American people know that Neil Gorsuch is exactly that kind of judge.  He is the kind of judge we should have on the Supreme Court, we need on  the Supreme Court, and we need on every court in the land. That is why  I am committed to vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
