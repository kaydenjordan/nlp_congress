 Mr. Speaker, on December 28, 2019, the  Jewish community in Monsey, New York, gathered together to celebrate  Hanukkah. That celebration was cut short due to a vile, anti-Semitic  attack leaving five people wounded and an entire nation in shock.   Anti-Semitism is on the rise, and it is important that younger  generations understand where this hate stems from and why we need to  combat it. H. Res. 782 does just that.   This important resolution encourages schools to teach the history of  anti-Semitism and the Holocaust and calls on law enforcement to bring  the perpetrators of these attacks to justice.   We must stop these senseless acts of hate, and I encourage my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank my colleagues, Congressmen Ted Budd  and Lee Zeldin, for their leadership in introducing this vital  legislation with me.                            ____________________
