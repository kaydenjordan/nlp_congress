 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, America's Federal Government should be of the people, by  the people, and for the people. But with H.R. 51, America's government  will become of the Democrats, by the Democrats, and for the Democrats.   Let's be clear what H.R. 51 is all about. It is about Democrats  adding two new progressive U.S. Senators to push a radical agenda  championed by the squad to reshape America into the socialist utopia  they always talk about.   If you doubt me, just listen to what our colleague, Congressman Jamie  Raskin, recently told The Washington Post. He said:         There is a national political logic for D.C. statehood too,       because the Senate has become the principal obstacle to       social progress across a whole range of issues.    So there we have it. H.R. 51 is not really about voting  representation. It is about Democrats consolidating their power in  Washington.   There are numerous problems with H.R. 51. Mainly, it is flatly  unconstitutional. Every Justice Department from President Kennedy's to  President Obama's has been consistent that a constitutional amendment  is needed to grant the District statehood.   Robert F. Kennedy said that granting D.C. statehood without a  constitutional amendment was inconceivable. He also said granting D.C.  statehood, as attempted by H.R. 51, would produce an absurdity. This  absurdity is the 23rd Amendment which acknowledges the existence of a  Federal District warranting three electoral college votes.   While H.R. 51 includes an expedited process for the 23rd Amendment's  repeal in Congress, the problem is this would not happen until after  D.C. becomes a State. This would create mass confusion as H.R. 51 is  reviewed by the courts for years.   The Constitution is the foundational document upon which all laws of  our country rest, and Congress cannot simply dismiss it with sham  legislation. But that is what H.R. 51 attempts to do. Democrats want to  rewrite the Constitution without going through the proper process of  doing so.   During our committee's markup of H.R. 51, I offered an amendment that  would assure the 23rd Amendment's repeal prior to statehood being  granted, but Democrats opposed this amendment.   Why are Democrats pushing such a problematic bill through the House?   Why are they working so hard to advance D.C. statehood instead of  pursuing a constitutional amendment that  [[Page H2072]]  would engage the entire country through a process intended by our  Founding Fathers?    Because they know Americans have firmly rejected D.C. statehood.   I urge my colleagues to vote with the vast majority of Americans and  reject this unconstitutional and impractical bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Hice), the Republican leader of the Government Operations  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, if this bill is about race, I wonder why your  majority leader, Steny Hoyer, voted against this very bill in 1993.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  South Carolina (Ms. Mace).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Fallon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I must admit, I am a little disappointed in the remarks of the  majority leader. When I saw him approach the podium, I thought he was  going to give us a detailed explanation as to why he voted against this  very bill in 1993. Instead, he lectures us on having the exact same  position today that he had in 1993. Hypocrisy runs deep.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Sessions).   (Mr. SESSIONS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South  Dakota (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Griffith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, listening to the debate, I wonder if our friends on the  other side of the aisle would be so passionate if Washington, D.C.,  were 90 percent Republican as 90 percent Democrat.   H.R. 51 goes against the Founding Fathers' intent. It is  unconstitutional, impractical, and a blatant power grab.   The Founding Fathers created the Federal city--this Federal city--to  be separate and apart from the States which it would serve as the seat  of government. They designed it this way so there would be no super  State that could unduly influence Federal affairs and international  relations.   Now, I understand the people of the District's desire for  representation in Congress. I think that is a legitimate concern, and  it is not a new one.   If Democrats truly wanted to grant the wishes of D.C. residents, then  they would address the constitutional issues with H.R. 51 since it does  not stand a chance in court. We all know that. This does not stand one  chance in court.   Additionally, Democrats could explore other options other than  statehood, but they are not interested in any of them since they don't  add two new progressive Senators to the U.S. Senate.   Serious policy proposals like retrocession, allowing D.C. residents  to vote in Maryland Federal elections, and most obviously, the passage  of the constitutional amendment have been called for by many of my  Republican colleagues.   No State has required a constitutional amendment to be admitted to  the Union; not one. But D.C. is unique. The 23rd Amendment guarantees  the District three electoral college votes. There is no precedent for  granting statehood to a territory with electoral college votes or such  a special place in our Constitution. H.R. 51 is an unconstitutional  bill.   D.C. is also massively unprepared to assume the costs of the programs  and benefits it receives by being the Federal seat of government. The  new State will very likely levy a commuter tax to make up the funding  gaps currently backed by the Federal taxpayers. H.R. 51 provides no  guarantee to the American people that they will not be on the hook  funding the new State for years, if not decades.   This bill is nothing more than an attempt to ignore the  constitutional process and gain an advantage in the U.S. Senate, all to  advance a radical agenda that continues to come out of this House and  stalls in the Senate.   Democrats know a constitutional amendment granting D.C. statehood  would be rejected, just as it has been in the past. H.R. 51 is  intentionally designed to circumvent the Constitution and the will of  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this unconstitutional and  impractical legislation. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
