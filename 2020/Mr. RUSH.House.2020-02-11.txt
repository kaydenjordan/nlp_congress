 Madam Speaker, I inadvertently missed a vote on H. Res.  844. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 58.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate an important  milestone in our Nation's fight for environmental justice.   On February 11, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898,  making it the Federal Government's first major action on this issue.   Today, I have introduced a resolution to honor Chicago native Mrs.  Hazel M. Johnson, whose contributions were the necessary keys to this  order.  [[Page H1039]]    Madam Speaker, Mrs. Johnson worked as the ``mother of the  environmental justice movement'' to address racial injustices and  improve environmental protections fundamental to this action.   Therefore, I take pride in introducing legislation to celebrate the  month of April as Hazel M. Johnson Environmental Justice Month.                            ____________________
