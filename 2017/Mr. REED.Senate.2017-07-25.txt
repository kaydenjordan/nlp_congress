 Mr. President, today I am introducing the DEPSCoR  Reauthorization Act of 2017 along with Senators Rounds, Brown, Collins,  Carper, Coons, Whitehouse, Shaheen, Cortez Masto, and Hirono.   The purpose of this bill is to ensure that we have universities in  all 50 States capable of working with the Department of Defense on  advanced research topics. A truly National network of university  researchers who understand the needs of the Department of Defense puts  us in the best possible position to respond to the ever-changing  threats our armed forces face. This network will also meet the  workforce needs of our defense laboratories by training graduate  students in defense-relevant research. This bill reauthorizes the  DEPSCoR program, which is modeled on the NSF's successful EPSCoR  program for States that receive relatively low amounts of Federal  science funding. The bill will focus the DEPSCoR program on defense  research, while allowing the scientists and engineers of our defense  laboratories to work directly with university researchers from DEPSCoR- eligible States.   Seven years ago, Congress asked the National Academy of Sciences to  study the EPSCoR programs. The study concluded that it was in the  National interest to engage scientific talent in all 50 States, and  that EPSCoR programs were a valuable part of a National strategy to  maintain global scientific leadership. The report emphasized that  successfully engaging all 50 States required the involvement of  technology-driven agencies, including the Department of Defense, to  complement the basic science focus of the NSF.   Until 2009, the Department of Defense managed an EPSCoR-like program,  known as DEPSCoR. An independent evaluation of DEPSCoR, conducted by  the Institute for Defense Analyses, showed that DEPSCoR research  contributed to the DoD mission, producing high-quality research and new  technologies that were operationally deployed in areas such as missile  guidance and communications.   DEPSCoR also successfully developed defense research capabilities in  States historically underserved by Federal research and development  (R&D) funding. Since DEPSCoR stopped receiving Congressional support,  defense research in DEPSCoR-eligible States has plummeted, with the  decreases far larger than the relatively modest amounts going to  DEPSCoR awards. This shows that DEPSCoR was doing what Congress  intended the program to do: develop competitive defense researchers in  all 50 States.   The impact of cancelling DEPSCoR went far beyond research grants.  Developing university research capabilities in all 50 States is  critical to meeting DoD workforce needs. The Defense Laboratory  Enterprise is more national in scope than NASA or the Department of  Energy's National Laboratory system, with facilities in 24 States,  including DEPSCoR-eligible States. The 2016 review of DoD laboratories  by the Defense Science Board reported that these laboratories depend on  locally trained scientists and engineers. Without relevant training  provided through DoD-supported research projects at nearby  universities, these facilities may struggle to find highly qualified  scientists and engineers.   Because of these concerns, I have been working with my colleague on  the Armed Services Committee, Senator Rounds of South Dakota, to revive  this program. This reauthorization uses the lessons learned from the  previous iteration of DEPSCoR to improve the program, making it more  responsive to Department of Defense needs.   I invite our colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the DEPSCoR  Reauthorization Act of 2017 along with Senators Rounds, Brown, Collins,  Carper, Coons, Whitehouse, Shaheen, Cortez Masto, and Hirono.
