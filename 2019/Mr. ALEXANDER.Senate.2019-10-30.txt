 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, at 12:15 p.m., the Senate will vote on  a Democratic proposal to overturn a Trump administration guidance from  the Department of Health and Human Services that would lower insurance  rates all across America. Seems like a strange thing to do, but to  justify that, the Democrats have come up with a scary fairytale that  has no basis in truth, that suggests that somehow this effort to lower  insurance rates would jeopardize the protection for preexisting  conditions that all Americans have according to the law. Of course,  that can't happen because the law doesn't permit it. So I want to talk  about that a little bit today.   What the Senate Democrats want to overturn is a Trump administration  guidance regarding what is called a section 1332 waiver. Now, a 1332  waiver was part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 that Democrats  passed. No Republican voted for it. So you had the Affordable Care Act,  which says, among other things, that every American who has a  preexisting health condition is protected. That means that if I have a  preexisting health condition, and I want to buy insurance, I have a  right to buy it. I can't be charged any more for it because of my  preexisting health condition, and I am covered if I get sick. That is  what we mean by protection for preexisting conditions. That is in the  Federal law. No American can be denied that protection.   In the very same law, the Affordable Care Act, Democrats wrote  another provision to give States more flexibility in how they spend  ObamaCare money with the hope that they might be able to lower rates  for Americans who have health insurance. That would be a good thing  because in Tennessee, and across the country, really, since ObamaCare  passed, rates have gone up 163 percent. Those rate increases especially  hurt people who make a little bit more than $50,000--say a songwriter  in Nashville or a farmer like Marty, whom I ran into in the Chick-fil-A  outside Nashville, who said: I can't afford health insurance. I have to  pay $15,000 or $20,000 because I don't get any ObamaCare subsidy.   States are trying to take advantage of this provision of the  Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--that says States may have some  flexibility in how they spend Obamacare money. The law also says states  cannot jeopardize preexisting conditions protections for anybody.   Now, the best evidence that what we are talking about is a scary  fairytale is that 12 States already have used a 1332 waiver. Remember,  this is the provision in the Federal law that was designed to give  States more flexibility in how they spend Federal dollars. Twelve  States have already used that provision in law to lower rates. There  are 12 waivers from States that have been approved by the Trump  administration, and premiums have gone down in all 12 States as a  result of this action. This is what the Democrats want to stop. They  want to stop States from using this provision which the Democrats  invented in 2010 to lower insurance rates. That is why it is a scary  fairytale that only on Halloween anybody could imagine could come up  with.   Now, 7 of the 12 waivers that were approved by the Trump  administration were under an Obama definition of Section 1332, and 5  have been approved since the new guidance that is the subject of the  vote today. For any State to get a 1332 waiver, the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services has to approve it. Seema Verma is the  Administrator of that agency. She has made it very clear, No. 1, that  none of the 12 waivers that have been approved jeopardize preexisting  health condition protections for anybody. In other words, the waivers  did lower rates for some people, but they didn't hurt anyone's ability  to buy insurance who had a preexisting condition. Just because it  helped some people didn't mean it hurt other people.   Seema Verma went on to say very clearly:         To be very clear, the 2018 guidance--    The one we are talking about today--         does nothing to erode ObamaCare's preexisting condition       provisions, which cannot be waived under Section 1332.    In other words, the law the Democrats wrote in 2010 does not allow  States to waive the preexisting condition. Seema Verma goes on to say:         ``Section 1332 does not permit States to waive Public       Health Services Act requirements such as guaranteed       availability and renewability of health insurance, the       prohibition on using health status to vary premiums, and the       prohibition on preexisting conditions exclusions.       Furthermore, a section 1332 waiver cannot be approved that       might otherwise undermine these requirements. This       administration stands committed to protecting people with       preexisting conditions.''    The bottom line is, 12 States have already used section 1332 waivers  to reduce premiums. More States want to come up with other ideas to do  the same. In none of the 12 States were preexisting condition  protections jeopardized for one single person. Seema Verma says it  cannot be, under the law, and if any of the other States have some sort  of new proposal--she wouldn't approve it.   There is no doubt there is a good reason why so many Governors may  want 1332 waivers. In fact, many of the States that have already been  granted waivers have Democratic Senators as well as Democratic  Governors. Many States are trying to reduce health insurance rates  because ObamaCare has driven those rates so high. In the four  [[Page S6266]]  bipartisan Health Committee hearings I chaired in September of 2017,  virtually, every witness told our committee that the process of  applying for a 1332 waiver was too cumbersome, too inflexible, and  expensive for States to use.   In the fall of 2017, provisions to improve that waiver application  process were included in bipartisan legislation that was proposed by 12  Republican Senators and 12 Democratic Senators. At one point, the  distinguished Senator from New York, the minority leader, Senator  Schumer, said it was such good policy that every Democrat ought to vote  for it.   In 2018, Senate Democrats blocked that bipartisan legislation, which  would have, by the way, lowered insurance premiums by 40 percent over 3  years, and it became clear Democrats were refusing to change even a  word of ObamaCare.   I encouraged Secretary Azar and the administration to take a look at  the section 1332 waiver and, within the current law, do whatever they  could to give States more flexibility. Fourteen Governors wrote the  Secretary seeking help to make 1332 waivers work so they could start  lowering premiums in their State.   In October of 2018, the Trump administration issued new guidance with  much needed flexibility so States can use 1332 waivers. Democrats who  vote at 12:15 to overturn this guidance are taking a tool away from  their States, a tool that many States want, to lower health insurance  rates and, in every single case, without jeopardizing protection for  preexisting conditions.    That was the whole purpose of the 1332 waiver. That is why Democrats  put it in the Affordable Care Act. That is why 13 States have approved  those waivers and 12 have been approved just for one type of solution  called reinsurance. That is when States take some money and put it in a  reinsurance pool. A State can take the sickest people in that State and  put them there. When the sickest people are out of the other pool, it  lowers rates for the people who are left. States can do reinsurance  with Obamacare money. States lower health insurance rates for these  people in the pool. You make sure the people who are sickest have  insurance, and you don't take away anyone's right to buy insurance who  has a preexisting condition.   In each of the States, health insurance premiums have gone down as  much as 43 percent in some cases. North Dakota has seen the average  ObamaCare premium decrease 20 percent; Colorado, 16 percent; Delaware,  13 percent; Montana, 8 percent; Rhode Island, 6 percent. You want to  overturn a guidance that attempts to give States more of that same kind  of flexibility to lower insurance premiums without affecting the  ability of any American to buy insurance with preexisting condition  protections? There is no reason States shouldn't be able to have that  flexibility.   Let me give you an example of what this guidance that we are talking  about today would mean. In 2017, Iowa submitted a waiver application  that would have restructured the premium subsidies. That is the money  Iowa gets from Washington under ObamaCare. According to Iowa Governor  Kim Reynolds, Iowa's waiver would have given 18,000 to 22,000 Iowans  access to more affordable insurance. These were Iowans who made too  much to qualify for Federal subsidies and were left behind by  ObamaCare's skyrocketing profits. This might be a farmer in Iowa making  $55,000 a year and, with no subsidy, paying $15,000 or $20,000 for an  insurance policy. The rates would be lower under Iowa's proposal.   Under the old guidance, Iowa's innovative waiver couldn't be  approved. Now, with the new guidance--the one you seek to overturn  today--Iowa can work with Administrator Verma to get the kind of  creative waiver so 18,000-22,000 more Iowans can afford health  insurance. To be clear--to emphasize--just as with the other 12  examples that have been approved, no new waiver can be approved that  would take away the right of any Iowan who has a preexisting health  condition to buy insurance at the same price as if that person didn't  have a preexisting health condition and to keep insurance coverage when  that Iowan gets sick.   It is simply a scary Halloween fairytale drummed up by the other  side--for reasons I can't imagine since so many of their States are  benefiting from 1332 waivers--to take away from States the ability to  reduce health insurance costs. As I said earlier, any waiver that is  approved--as 12 already have been--to help some people get lower cost  health insurance cannot hurt another person in that State by taking  away their right to buy insurance at the same price that covers their  preexisting condition. States with 1332 waivers include these States  with Democratic Senators who will be voting today: Hawaii, Maryland,  Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Wisconsin. Do they really want to take  away from their State the ability to lower health insurance premiums in  a way that doesn't jeopardize preexisting conditions? That is pretty  strange. Then there is Colorado, Montana, Delaware, Rhode Island,  Alaska, North Dakota--the same.   I think this just gets back to the point that Democrats have elevated  ObamaCare to the 67th book of the Bible, and they can't change a word  of it, even though they wrote the 1332 waiver in the Affordable Care  Act to give States the flexibility to reduce healthcare premiums, which  12 States now have done. Democrats also wrote, in the Affordable Care  Act, that you cannot take away from any American the right to buy  insurance at the same price if you have a preexisting health condition.  That has been reaffirmed by the Trump administration. It is in the law.  To suggest otherwise, as I said earlier, is a scary fairytale dreamed  up for Halloween.   I hope that all Senators--especially from those States who have seen  the 1332 waiver work so well--will vote not to overturn the guidance  that gives more Americans a chance to pay lower healthcare premiums.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, the  Senator from Wisconsin is exactly correct. Every Senate Democrat has  voted to take away a low-cost insurance option from what the Urban  Institute says is 1.7 million Americans. These people can't afford  other kinds of insurance. That is what they want to take away, and she  is attempting to do that once again. I have plenty of constituents who  have a right to get their insurance but who can't afford it. This is  the only kind of insurance they can buy.   This kind of insurance was good enough for the George W. Bush  administration. It was good enough for the Clinton administration. It  was good enough for the Obama administration right up until the last  few days, and it should be good enough under the Trump administration.   According to the Urban Institute, all the Trump short term plan rule  does is give 1.7 million Americans an opportunity to buy short-term  insurance while they move from one job to another or while they look  for a different situation. According to the Urban Institute, those 1.7  million Americans would otherwise go uninsured, and that is what the  Democrats are for.   I object.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, in  2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that  navigators were not cost-effective in enrolling people in health  insurance.   During the 2017 open enrollment period, navigators received over  $62.5 million in Federal grants while enrolling 81,426 individuals.  That is less than 1 percent of those enrolled in the Federal exchanges,  which comes out to a cost of $767 per enrollee. In other words, the  taxpayer is paying $767 per enrollee for each person enrolled. The CMS  also found that nearly 80 percent of the navigators failed to reach  their enrollment goals.   I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.    Mr. President, I know it is Halloween, and it is time  for trick or treat, but I urge my colleagues not to be tricked by this  scary fairytale dreamed up by the Democrats that would suggest that the  section 1332 waiver that give States more flexibility, which they  wrote, somehow jeopardizes protections for people with preexisting  health conditions, which they also wrote. Both are in the 2010  ObamaCare law.   Preexisting health conditions are protected. The law says so. The law  does not allow any 1332 waiver, which is the subject of what we are  voting on in a few minutes, to change that.   Twelve States have had their 1332 waivers approved by the Trump  administration, and in no case did it affect preexisting conditions.   Seema Verma, who has to approve all of these waiver applications from  the Department of Health and Human Services, says the law doesn't  permit any change in preexisting condition protections, and if somehow  a waiver asked for it, she would not approve it.   What my Democratic friends are voting for today is to take away a  tool from States that has been used to reduce rates by 43 percent in  Maryland, 20 percent in Minnesota, and 15 percent in New Jersey. It has  been used in Hawaii, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, Delaware, Rhode  Island, Alaska, and North Dakota.   Why would you take away a flexibility option that you wrote to give  your own voters lower health insurance rates?   I know it is Halloween, but don't be tricked. Don't believe this  scary fairytale. Protection for preexisting conditions when you buy  health insurance is the law. Nothing in the 1332 waiver guidance  changes that.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.     I ask for the yeas and nays.
