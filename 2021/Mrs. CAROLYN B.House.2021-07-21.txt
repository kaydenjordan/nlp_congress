 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend  and colleague, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, and the Congressional  Progressive Caucus for bringing us together today to highlight the  importance of the Green New Deal.   Madam Speaker, climate change is one of the single most pressing  threats facing this country and the global community, and our most  vulnerable communities are bearing the brunt of the consequences. That  is why today, as chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform,  I held a hearing on President Biden's Justice40 Initiative.   During this hearing, we heard from experts about the need to swiftly  and effectively implement this initiative to ensure that the  communities hardest hit by pollution, poverty, and public health risks  receive a fair share of our Nation's climate and infrastructure  investments.                                time  1545    As chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, I am committed  to ensuring that the administration and all Federal agencies have the  tools they need to implement the Justice40 Initiative. This is crucial  to ensuring that our climate investments advance racial and economic  justice.   Beyond the Justice40 Initiative, we need to prioritize policy  solutions here in Congress that really focus on climate justice. For  New York City, that means investing in a green future for public  housing and for our public schools.   This past Earth Day, I reintroduced the Public Housing Solar Equity  Act, which would guarantee that any solar energy generated on public  housing land benefits the residents of those developments first.   Looking beyond solar energy, all public housing repairs and  modernization projects should be green, which is exactly what the Green  New Deal for Public Housing does. This bill will provide funding to  electrify all buildings, add solar panels, and secure renewable energy  sources for all public housing energy needs. In short, it will make  Federal housing cleaner, safer, and greener.   Housing is a human right that no New Yorker, no American, should go  without. As we work to make sure everyone has access to the clean  affordable housing they need and deserve, let's expand our goals to  make these communities green, too.   For the health of our residents and for our environment, we cannot  afford to do anything less.   For the health of our students, we need a Green New Deal for Public  Schools, a transformative and unprecedented investment that will not  only make our schools greener but also expand services for our  students. My colleague, Jamaal Bowman, is a former educator and has  authored this important bill, of which I am a cosponsor.   We are in a state of emergency. The West is burning; cities are  flooding; and extreme weather events are becoming all too common. We  need to act now, and we need to act boldly.   For the health and safety of all Americans, for environmental and  social justice, let's make a Green New Deal. We can't afford to do  anything less.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Bowman) for  focusing on education and our environment and putting both of them  together creatively with the Green New Deal for Public Schools.
