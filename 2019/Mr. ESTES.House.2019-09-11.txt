 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, throughout our district work period, I  visited farms, ranches, manufacturing plants, and small businesses  where people all said the same thing: It is time to pass the USMCA now.  Farmers, ranchers, and workers in Kansas understand how important this  monumental trade deal is, and they want it done now.   On November 30, 2018, the United States, Mexico, and Canada signed a  monumental free and fair trade agreement for our countries. Since then,  Mexico has made significant labor reforms and adopted the USMCA, while  Canada is not far behind.   Unfortunately, here at home, the USMCA is stuck in purgatory.  Congress failed to bring the USMCA to a vote over the summer, while  some of  [[Page H7659]]  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to slow walk and  delay a vote to ratify the USMCA.    While my colleagues may want to deny, or at least delay, any victory  for President Trump, the only people hurt by delaying the USMCA are  hardworking American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families.   Currently, more than 12 million American jobs depend on trade with  Canada and Mexico. As is the case for 45 other States, Canada and  Mexico are Kansas' top two trading partners, worth $4.9 billion every  year, while supporting 110,000 jobs in my State alone. This impact  underscores just how important the USMCA is for our country.   According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, the USMCA will  create 176,000 new jobs and increase U.S. GDP by $68 billion. Exports  to USMCA partners will grow by $33.3 billion, and imports from the  USMCA partners will grow by $31.5 billion.   Overall, the update to NAFTA will create jobs, boost wages, and open  up new markets for American agriculture and manufacturing. It also sets  unprecedented standards for areas like intellectual property, small  businesses, and the environment.   This is a significant improvement over NAFTA, which was actually  beneficial to my district in Kansas, especially for our farmers,  ranchers, and aerospace manufacturers. However, the 25-year-old NAFTA  agreement was outdated and badly in need of reform and modernization.   Consider that, when NAFTA was first negotiated in 1992, Motorola cell  phones were carried around in a bag, and just one in five households  had a home computer. Even fewer than that could connect to a dial-up  internet in order to access the world wide web, which had just been  unveiled in 1991.   Clearly, a lot has changed in the last 25 years, and our laws and  trade deals should change as well.   As Representative of the Air Capital of the World and the breadbasket  of America, I know that USMCA is critical for manufacturers, farmers,  and ranchers throughout Kansas and our country. That is why I am proud  to serve today on the whip team, led by Whip   Steve Scalise, to help  get the USMCA finalized in Congress.   Earlier today, our team met with Ambassador Lighthizer to receive an  update on negotiations, and I want to take a moment to again thank him  and the entire administration for the work they did to draft the USMCA.  Now it is time for Congress to do its part to secure this free and fair  trade deal that farmers, ranchers, workers, and families in the  heartland and throughout the country deserve.   As a fierce advocate for free and fair trade, I believe a trade  agreement with Canada and Mexico is crucial for Kansas and our country.  However, President Trump is right to insist that trade deals both be  fair and free.   Free trade allows us to export our quality agriculture and  manufactured goods around the globe, while fair trade enables us to do  so at a fair price without intellectual property infringement. The  USMCA accomplishes both of these goals.   I have several Members here with me tonight who also want to talk. I  want to talk some more about some of the other benefits that are out  there from the USMCA, but right now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Perry said a lot of things that are  really valid there and important to us.   I have several other Members who want to talk about how important  things are. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Balderson), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Representative Balderson's  efforts and involvement in this.   I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's time and  participation in this very important topic tonight.   Now I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his  comments. The gentleman pointed out so much about how important it is  to get that economic growth so that we have got the value in the  economy and how much effort that Mexico has made, already changing the  laws in their country to make sure that it is a much more viable  process for them, and it is more productive for them as well.    Mr. Speaker, I come from Kansas, and specifically in my district, we  have a lot of agriculture and a lot of issues there. And the USMCA is a  great improvement for the agriculture area. It sets some unprecedented  standards for agriculture, regulation, and biotechnology.   It maintains duty-free access for American farmers in Mexico, and  provides new access for U.S. wheat, eggs, dairy, and poultry. In fact,  the International Trade Commission estimates an additional $277 million  in increased dairy sales to our North American partners under USMCA.  That is a 44 percent increase that will bring a much-needed lift to the  U.S. dairy industry.   Another area is manufacturing. USMCA maintains a duty-free access for  U.S. manufactured goods and removes some of the existing barriers for  remanufactured goods, opening up a lot of new markets for American  products.   It encourages U.S. manufacturing by requiring 75 percent of auto  content to be produced in North America. The Office of the United  States Trade Representative estimates that USMCA will add $34 billion  in automotive investment and create 76,000 new American jobs.   It also incentivizes higher wages, requiring 40 to 50 percent of auto  content to be made by workers making at least $16 an hour, helping to  boost wages across many manufacturing sectors.   It requires Mexico to pass some sweeping labor reforms to improve  standards there and create an even more even playing field for American  labor. Mexico has already followed through and enacted these reforms  which are already benefiting U.S. manufacturing.   Canada and Mexico buy more products manufactured in America than our  next 10 trading partners. Exports of manufactured goods to Canada and  Mexico account for more than 2 million jobs across our country.   As a representative of Wichita, I have seen firsthand how important  it is that our manufacturers have access to global markets.  Transportation equipment exports account for $2.7 billion last year,  and the growth in manufactured goods, exports from Kansas, grew 8.5  percent from 2010 to 2018.   In addition, Kansas aerospace exports to Canada and Mexico have  increased by more than 20 percent over the last decade, helping grow  the total value of manufactured goods exported from Kansas to Canada  and Mexico to $3.2 billion in 2018. These numbers underscore the  importance of USMCA for American manufacturing.   I wanted to mention that I have got some other representatives here  who also have a big impact and a lot of value to add to that. Right now  I would like to call on my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania.  [[Page H7661]]    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's time and  involvement in this.   I would also now like to call on a friend of mine and colleague from  the great State of Indiana.   I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Steube), who is my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall). Representative Roger Marshall is my fellow Kansan and  colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank all the Members who have joined us  tonight.   As President Trump has often pointed out, many of our trade deals  have not always created the best outcomes for American workers and  products, but by approving the USMCA, we can take one giant step in  overhauling one of the most fundamental trade deals with our closest  neighbors. We can also create a great template for success, especially  if we turn our focus to improving trade relations with China and other  countries.   As we stated tonight, there is no time like the present to get  started moving this process forward, making sure that every provision  of the deal is enforceable so we can get the USMCA across the finish  line. The cost of delay is too great for our farmers, ranchers,  manufacturers, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and families.   Again, I thank my colleagues for joining me tonight, and I ask this  body to pass the USMCA now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 20 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, September 12, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
