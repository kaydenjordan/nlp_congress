 Mr. Speaker, just 2 weeks ago, I spoke on the floor and  said we needed to end partisan politics and deliver results for the  American people, but just this week, Speaker Pelosi and my Democrat  colleagues announced their plan to move forward with an impeachment  inquiry into President Trump.   Their agenda to constantly undermine President Trump comes at a  serious cost to the American people: ignoring the pressing issues at  hand.   One of the best examples is Congress' lack of action to tackle the  undeniable crisis at our southern border. Both Democrats and  Republicans agree this crisis must be addressed, which should make this  a bipartisan issue.   But, once again, Democrats continue to put forward partisan bills.  This week, they brought to the floor the illegal immigrant customer  service act, and we just voted on the improving healthcare for every  illegal immigrant act.   These bills will do nothing to solve the problems at our southern  border and would only obstruct border enforcement and impede law  enforcement's ability to protect this country.   Why are Democrats prioritizing illegal immigrants over American  citizens?   Let's end this partisan political game and get to work for the  American people.                            ____________________
