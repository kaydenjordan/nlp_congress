 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  members of the Lions Clubs, the Rotary Club, the Kiwanis Club, and the  Optimist organizations who are on Capitol Hill today.   Volunteer service is the cornerstone of a successful, strong, and  healthy community. It is also an important staple of American life.   I have been a member of my hometown organization, the Howard Area  Lions Club, so I know firsthand the good this club does around the  world.   To share the impactful work of service clubs and their volunteers, I  founded the Congressional Service Organization Caucus in 2019 with  Congressman   Jimmy Panetta of California, a past Rotarian.   Earlier today, the Congressional Service Organization Caucus hosted a  Member and staff briefing. Speakers from Lions, Rotary, Kiwanis, and  Optimist clubs shared how their members strive to make the world a  better place one community at a time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join the Congressional Service  Organization Caucus to ensure service to others remains a viable part  of American life for generations to come.                            ____________________
