 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Verification  Alignment and Service-Disabled Business Adjustment Act, or the VA-SBA  Act.   I start by thanking my friend and colleague from Mississippi (Mr.  Kelly)--or, as a former Army captain myself, I like to call him General  Kelly--for his leadership and friendship and hard work on this bill as  well.   Veterans are uniquely qualified and have a valuable perspective as  they start and manage small businesses.   In my home State of Colorado, there are over 52,000 small businesses  owned by veterans that continue to give back to the country, the  community, and our economy every single day. These veteran-owned  businesses have also proven to go above and beyond to hire other  veterans, including those who have been injured in the line of duty.   Currently, service-disabled veterans who want to start a business  have to go through a complicated, confusing, and redundant application  process through both the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Small  Business Administration.   The VA-SBA Act removes duplication in regulation and cuts red tape to  ensure the Federal Government can provide the support and resources  that our veterans deserve. It also ensures that data on service- disabled veteran-owned businesses and veteran-owned small businesses is  located at the Small Business Administration, which is uniquely  equipped to serve veterans who want to start small businesses.   This bill will greatly ease the burden on our veteran-owned small  businesses by cutting unnecessary red tape.   I thank Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Chabot, as well as  Mr. Schneider and all my colleagues on the Committee on Small Business.  This truly is an example of bipartisan cooperation, as we have all come  together to do the right thing by our veterans and our small  businesses, a true win-win for the country and for our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
