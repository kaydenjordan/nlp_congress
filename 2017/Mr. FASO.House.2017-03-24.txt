 Mr. Speaker, I wanted to point out to my colleagues that a  fundamental change is being made with the new health law we have before  us, and that is, we are, for the first time, equalizing the treatment  of people who do not have employer-provided health care.   Those of us who have employer-provided health care, 170 million  Americans, that is not a taxable event for them. It is not a taxable  event where they have to pay tax at the end of the year on the value of  that employer-provided health care.   And yet, if you are the person who does not have employer-provided  health care, if you are the husband and wife with two kids making 45 or  $50,000, and your employer does not provide health care, you receive  absolutely no tax subsidy through the Tax Code.   This bill, through the advance refundable tax credits, will, for the  first time, give someone the choice to buy health care and give them  the opportunity and the means to buy health care that they previously  have not had. It is not a markedly important distinction, frankly, from  the Affordable Care Act, where you only could buy the health care  through an exchange-approved policy.   This policy, under this legislation today, will allow someone the  flexibility and the freedom to buy a policy of their choosing, not one  dictated by Washington. So that is a fundamental important distinction  between the status quo and what this legislation would offer.   Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues, I urge support for the bill. It is  not perfect, as we all know, but it is something that is long overdue.   I would also point out that the numbers that my colleague from  Kentucky uses are really based upon fantasy. Those numbers are simply  incorrect, and the people of our State and our country will have health  care under the provisions of this bill, and we will work hard to ensure  that they do.
