 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following Senators be permitted to speak prior to the scheduled vote:  Senator Lankford, myself, up to 5 minutes; Senator Marshall for 2  minutes; Senator Schumer, up to 5 minutes.    Mr. President, we are about to vote on an issue dealing  with the national emergency here in the United States dealing with the  pandemic.   There has been no great shock that we have functioned under a lot of  additional authorities that are happening, but I want to provide a bit  of clarity into this conversation as well.   The measure that we are dealing with right now dealing with COVID and  the pandemic that is here, we also know there is a global pandemic; and  improving the medical situation here doesn't necessarily mean improving  the medical situation everywhere, nor should it change what is called  title 42.   A quick explanation on this. The Surgeon General, the CDC, and HHS  all work together with the President to be able to recommend that,  based on the public health crisis that we are currently under, title 42  states this:         Whenever the Surgeon General determines that by reason of       the existence of any communicable disease in a foreign       country there is a serious danger of the introduction of such       disease in the United States, and that this danger is so       increased by the introduction of persons or property from       such country that a suspension of the right to introduce such       persons and property is required in the interest of the       public health, the Surgeon General, in accordance with the       regulations approved by the President, shall have the power       to prohibit . . . the introduction  [[Page S981]]       of persons and property from such countries or places [they]       shall designate.    That is title 42.   Why that does matter to us? Because in the last 2 years, our country  along our border has been managing much of the border based on title  42. Now, it is no secret to anyone in this room--I would assume  everyone in this room knows--we had the highest number of border  encounters--that is people illegally crossing our borders--last year in  the history of our country. Over 2 million people illegally crossed our  borders. What some may not know is, last year, 900,000 of those were  brought into the system in the United States; 1.1 million of those were  turned around at the border with title 42 authority; meaning, because  of the pandemic, because of the risk and the crisis, the introduction  of additional individuals who are likely to have COVID, they were  turned around at the border.    The concern is--and I have raised this concern over and over with  CBP--what is your plan postpandemic for the title 42 authority?   Now, I want everyone to think about last summer--last summer what was  happening in Donna, TX, last summer what was happening in multiple  places along the border where our facilities were overrun with people  and not manageable. That was when we were introducing 900,000 people  into the country. What does that look like this summer if there are 2  million people in that group coming across?   That is why I want to make it very clear that what we are voting on  now has no effect on title 42 authority. We continue to have serious  health concerns, as title 42 states, in many other countries; and I  have continued to encourage DHS to have a plan in place. Currently,  they do not. It appears that their plan is, once title 42 goes away,  all 2 million will get into the country. I think that is a serious  problem, and I think it is something we should address.   In the meantime, we should not relieve title 42, and this vote does  not change anything with the Surgeon General's decision on title 42. By  the way, it is a Surgeon General position that has been in two  administrations in a row to be able to be maintained on this.   So just to clarify, for this body, this vote has nothing to do with  title 42; that is a Surgeon General responsibility; but this body needs  to do additional oversight to make sure DHS is paying attention to what  is happening at our southern border because we could very well have 1.1  million additional people illegally cross into the country, not just  across the border and be returned but actually into the country in the  days ahead.   I yield the floor.
