 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of our international  institutions that allow us to get along with one another; the WTO, the  United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, NAFTA, CAFTA, all of our great  international institutions that allow us to amicably resolve our  differences.   Let me tell you something, Mr. Speaker, with all the misbehavior and  problems of the current occupant of the White House, what I am most  worried about is this rise of nationalism. We have seen this play out  before throughout our history.   While no one is as proud to be as American as many of us who have the  privilege to serve in this body, the world is more interconnected than  ever before. And it is more important than ever before that Republicans  and Democrats in this body show our commitment to resolving our  legitimate disputes and differences amicably through the rule of  international law and our international institutions, rather than  resorting to violence and warfare.   I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to renew our  commitment to pursuing peaceful, diplomatic ways of resolving our  international disputes through international legal bodies.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest honors that I have had as a Member  of Congress has been the opportunity to serve on the Education and the  Workforce Committee and on the conference committee that put the Every  Student Succeeds Act together in its final form.   Before coming to Congress, I chaired the Colorado State Board of  Education; I founded two charter schools, the New America School and  the Academy of Urban Learning; and I worked closely with educators,  school board members, and parents across our State to improve the  quality of our schools in Colorado.   I know firsthand the impact that Federal education policy has on  States, on school districts, on schools, and on the families that they  serve. So when I arrived in Congress, I was excited to roll up my  sleeves and get to work on education policy.   One of the top issues in education when I arrived has always been the  desire to replace No Child Left Behind, an outdated and inflexible law  that, in many ways, set schools up for failure, with a new and better  way of making sure that every student has the opportunity to succeed.   I heard from so many of my constituents that, under No Child Left  Behind, schools were testing too much, districts lacked the flexibility  they needed, and the Colorado Department of Education--like so many  other State departments of education--was effectively at the whim of  the U.S. Department of Education with regard to their State plans,  effectively living waiver to waiver. That is no way to go about Federal  education policy. It is why the Every Student Succeeds Act was so badly  needed.   Now, early on, the work on the Every Student Succeeds Act wasn't as  collegial as it should have been. Republicans introduced a  hyperpartisan bill. It passed this Chamber with no Democrat votes and  many Republicans voting against it as well. But throughout the process,  one thing remained the same: Members were committed to moving past No  Child Left Behind and replacing it with a bill that put the interests  of students first. Finally that happened last Congress, 15 years after  the passage of No Child Left Behind and almost 6 years after the  expiration of the authorizing statute; but, finally, Congress did its  job.   I am proud to say that everyone on the Education and the Workforce  Committee has shown that we believe that every child deserves a great  education. We may have different ideas at times about how to achieve  that goal, and that is okay, but we all value the result of ensuring  opportunity for every child in our country.   It was that very commitment and value, as well as our willingness to  work together, that produced the Every Student Succeeds Act. The bill  passed overwhelmingly in the majority Republican House and Senate, and  was signed by our then-Democratic President. It was and continues to be  a bright spot of the last Congress, and what too often seems a Congress  that is overwhelmed by partisanship.   Unfortunately, the bipartisanship under ESSA potentially ends with  this bill. House Republicans have filed the resolution using the  Congressional Review Act to overturn a key regulation consistent with  the law that was finalized by the Obama administration in December.  Now, before diving into the details of this particular Congressional  Review Act that is considered under this rule, I want to say a little  bit about the process.   We should look no further than the U.S. Constitution in learning how  separation of powers works. There are three branches of government: the  legislative, executive, and judicial. Each branch is separate,  independent, and coequal, and different in how they function. That is  an important background and a critical context in evaluating this  legislation.   When Congress passed and the President signed the Every Student  Succeeds Act in December of 2015, the process didn't end. Many bills,  especially one as extensive as ESSA, require clarification from the  Department of Education, the agency charged with executing the law. The  text of the ESSA anticipated that. In fact, the law describes in detail  how the Department of Education should and shouldn't write regulations.  Frankly, that had been some of the problem under No Child Left Behind,  is it lacked sufficient congressional direction with regard to the  waiver process which was used effectively at the full discretion of  then-Secretary of Education Duncan and President Obama.   It took the Department a year and a multistakeholder process,  ensuring every voice was heard. Sure enough, a year after the  legislation was passed, the Department of Education finalized its rules  on accountability.   Last week, House Republicans took the first step towards taking a  sledgehammer to that entire implementation. Rules that have extensive  buy-in from stakeholders and are the blueprint for States in developing  our State education plans would be thrown out  [[Page H1025]]  under this rule, effectively throwing public education into chaos  across all 50 States and completely disregarding the hard work of  educators, parents, school board members, superintendents, and  principals over the last year.   The two education-related CRAs we are considering on the floor were  introduced last Wednesday night. That is four legislative days between  introduction and action. Once more, the CRAs weren't treated through  the committee process. We did not consider them in the Education and  the Workforce Committee. There were no hearings, no markups. In fact,  the full Education and the Workforce Committee hasn't even had a markup  yet with regard to a K-12 bill.   I am honored to be the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Early  Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, which has jurisdiction  over one of these three CRAs under this bill. We had no hearings or  markups on this bill. It is really a disservice to the over 50 new  Members of this Congress--no imprint on this bill--as well as the  Members at large, that this committee avoids the regular process.   It is also counter to promises that were made by Republican  leadership about returning to regular order. The actions today couldn't  be further from regular order because Republicans have chosen to  utilize the Congressional Review Act to move bills from introduction to  the floor without going through committee.   Unfortunately, the Congressional Review Act not only overturns  regulations, but it prevents the Department of Education from writing a  new regulation that is similar to the regulation that was overturned.   Now, Mr. Byrne mentioned that there can be subsequent legislation  that allows it. Let me point out that Every Student Succeeds Act was  over 5 years overdue. It took Congress 5 years after the initial  expiration of No Child Left Behind to even replace the authorizing  statute. So if that is Congress' intent, we are putting the cart before  the horse. We should alter or change the authorizing statute in a way  that Democrats and Republicans agree, rather than throw out the work  that has already occurred.   This statute would effectively tie the hands of the recently  confirmed Secretary of Education DeVos and prevent her from  implementing the will of this body through the Every Student Succeeds  Act.   Over the past few weeks, my office has received hundreds of pieces of  mail regarding education, largely in opposition to Secretary DeVos; but  I think the issue is that Secretary DeVos, who was recently confirmed-- this CRA would prevent her from doing her job and implementing the  Every Student Succeeds Act.   Let me just say that this guidance on accountability isn't just for  show. It is at the very heart of the Every Student Succeeds Act, which  Democrats and Republicans supported. It has real impact.   I want to close my opening remarks with a story about that real  impact from Christina in Pennsylvania, whose son has a learning  disability. Christina's son has always had a tough time in school due  to diagnosed dyslexia, dysgraphia, and ADHD. While he is a smart and  personable kid, when it came time to read and write, he could be  thought of as the ``bad'' kid too often, and he acted out.   It would have been easy for the school to write him off without the  protections that are offered under IDEA, but, luckily, he was required  to participate in assessments. That accountability encouraged the  school to work harder and to stick with it and to figure out why this  otherwise smart student couldn't read simple words in different places  on a page or demonstrate his achievement of knowledge.                                time  1245    If his school wasn't required to show student progress, there  wouldn't have been the incentive for them to invest their time and  money in helping his special needs. Without accountability, Christina's  son's school would have had little incentive to set appropriate  educational goals for him and offer the support necessary to reach  them.   Accountability requirements inform school administrators, teachers,  parents, students, and the community at large that all students have a  learning goal and make sure that all students have the tools to get  there.   Today, Christina's son is a college freshman majoring in biology with  a 3.2 GPA. The accountability in this CRA that would be thrown out  would undermine the very accountability that allowed not only  Christina's son to succeed but so many other children across our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am seeing a lot of feigned indignation about the  accountability provisions of this bill. It wasn't that long ago when we  passed the Every Student Succeeds Act when Democrats and Republicans  came down here and said we are giving the Secretary specific authority  around accountability for preventing Secretaries from doing rogue  things that both sides have perceived previous Secretaries had done,  and the authorizing statute was passed by Democrats and Republicans.   Now, all of a sudden, we have Republicans coming down here gutting  the very accountability provisions that they themselves lauded under  the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act, which passed in this body  overwhelmingly, as well as in the U.S. Senate.   It is a little hard to understand how Republicans are upset with the  very authority around specific parameters around that authority that  they specifically gave to the Secretary of Education. Again, if there  are particular quibbles, there is a different Secretary of Education  now. Those rules can be changed through a stakeholder process--and they  may very well be--but now Republicans are seeking to tie the hands of  the new Secretary of Education and throwing out all of the hard work  that I got to see people in Colorado working on, and I know occurred in  many other States, to come up with thoughtful, sensible accountability  plans that met the legislative intent of Democrats and Republicans in  this body.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Crowley), the chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Holocaust was an unspeakable atrocity resulting in  the murder of more than 6 million Jews. As a Jewish American, it is  very difficult to talk about. But, of course, in my own family, I can  only imagine the grief that my grandparents and great grandparents had  not knowing, not hearing from their relatives in the old country. And,  of course, finding out the very worst--that they had disappeared.                                time  1300    I know my Uncle Henry, who lives in New York with his wife, Arlene,  my dad's sister, who was able to escape Vienna on a Kindertransport,  one of the very last ones, as a young man, effectively growing up as an  orphan in Switzerland during the war and escaping the mass slaughter  that killed most of  [[Page H1027]]  his family targeted, of course, merely because they were Jews.   The Holocaust was a deliberate and planned act of slaughter and  genocide against the Jewish people; and the fact that it was targeted  against the Jewish people, resulting in over 6 million deaths, cannot  be delinked from our remembrance of one of the greatest horrors of  modern history.   It is especially troubling in the current environment, where we have  seen an increase in anti-Semitism and racism, generally, since the  election of President Trump. Just last week, the Jewish Community  Center in my district in Boulder, Colorado, had to close because of a  bomb threat, the families and children sent home. We have seen  swastikas on New York City subways and in our schools.   Frankly, I think many Jewish Americans are fearful about what the  intentions are of the occupant of the White House and his top advisers  and what we can do as a country to combat this; and it is exactly the  wrong message to send on Holocaust Remembrance Day, to leave out the  obvious truth that continues to be denied by anti-Semitic leaders  around the world, including former Presidents of Iran and Supreme  Leaders of Iran and others, that the Holocaust was a deliberate effort  of terror and genocide directed against the Jewish people by the Nazi  regime.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Mr. Crowley's resolution which would  reiterate the fact that the Nazi regime targeted the Jewish people and  calls on the executive branch to affirm this fact.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, over the last few years, one complaint I have  heard over and over is how inconsistent education policy has been.  States have been using waivers at the discretion of the Department of  Education. Finally, educators, school board members, families, hope  that ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act, could provide more  stability. Unfortunately for States, undoing the accountability CRA  would only reenergize that uncertainty.   For months, States have been working on their State plans, and I have  had the opportunity to join our Colorado group that has been working on  that plan as required under the Every Student Succeeds Act. We have had  guidance from the Department of Education since last November, and we  have been writing our State plans with that in mind. Now, if this  regulation is overturned, it would pull the rug out from States that  have been working diligently to enact their plans.   Likewise, H.J. Res. 58, another education-related bill that would  occur under this rule, would effectively unravel the Department of  Education's teacher preparation regulations. In the Higher Education  Act, States are required to assess the effectiveness of teacher prep  programs, and this regulation simply provides guidance for how States  can do that, making sure our teacher training programs work, making  sure that we are improving the quality of our public educators.   This provision also requires that TEACH grant recipients attend high- performing teacher prep programs. It is not a matter of picking winners  and losers; it is making sure that our taxpayer dollars are used  effectively to train high-quality educators.   If money is going to be invested in future teachers at high-needs  schools, we want to make sure that teachers are attending the highest  quality programs available. At the end of the day, a great education  starts with a great teacher in the classroom, and this requirement  ensures that even the neediest students have access to a great teacher.  Taken together, these two bills represent a strategic attempt by  Republicans to undermine public education.   The other CRA, which is completely unrelated to the two education- related CRAs, is actually related to a land management issue. I want to  describe why that is a bad idea as well.   I come from a Western State. My district that I represent is over 60  percent public lands, so this BLM plan will actually affect my  district, and that is why I am so impassioned to speak here today and  listen to others in my State about this rule.   A revision of this BLM plan is long overdue. Few plans or rules can  remain relevant for decades, and BLM's planning was last drafted in  1983. Needing a new planning system may not sound like the most  exciting thing in the world, but it is actually critical because it can  impact everything from cultural to environmental resources, to jobs in  the economy in our district which relate to our use of public lands.  That is why I have been contacted by groups of sportsmen, county  commissioners, outdoor recreation groups, and conservationists asking  how Congress can be wasting their time repealing something that makes  BLM's process more transparent and conclusive.   Local control and constituent input are top priorities for those of  us who live in and around public land, particularly in the West, so it  makes sense that many counties and groups in Colorado who have worked  with BLM offices on land use are pleading with Congress not to use a  CRA to repeal this commonsense rule and join their voices with ours in  opposition to this rule and this bill. The kinds of groups opposed to  this bill include the International Mountain Bicycling Association  because they know that, even though the planning process isn't perfect  and, of course, can be refined, it would be a huge mistake to throw out  the whole thing and bar the BLM from making necessary modernizations  moving forward, especially when the Republicans are in the driver's  seat.    Hunting and fishing groups and outdoor industry businesses, like the  Outdoor Industry Association, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and the  Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, know that this planning  process will give them the voice they need in the planning process  without diminishing anyone else's role. I believe that those who have  actually experienced and been part of the process are the voices that  need to be heeded when we are determining if the planning has been a  success.   Here are a few of the quotes from some counties in Western States  that have been part of the process and support the new planning system.  From Lewis and Clark County in Idaho:         A great example of the potential of Planning 2.0 can be       found in eastern and central Idaho, where the BLM is       preparing to engage in a land use planning process for public       lands from the big desert to the benches of the Salmon River.       At the behest of local BLM leadership, which has already been       operating under the spirit of Planning 2.0, a number of       sporting groups, conservation organizations, and Salmon       Valley stewardship have reached out to a wide-ranging       constituency of ranchers, loggers, motorized users,       sportsmen, and other groups. The benefit of this early       conversation can be very valuable to sportsmen. Take the       Donkey Hills at the headwaters of the Pahsimeroi River as an       example. There has been near unanimous agreement that the       critical elk calving area in the Donkey Hills needs       thoughtful consideration as a critical wildlife area.         From Missoula County, Montana:         Western Montana, where the Missoula BLM field offices       engaged in a land-use planning revision process for public       lands from the John Long Range to Joshua Park all the way to       the Garnet Range, through this process, BLM has piloted the       steps in Planning 2.0 to further engage the public in land       management decisions.    I include in the Record letters from both of these counties, as well  as a letter from a group of outdoor industries asking for this body to  oppose the CRA.                                               Lewis & Clark County,                                   Board of County Commissioners,                                                    Helena, Montana.      Re the Bureau of Land Management's Proposed Resource           Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed. Reg. 8674 (February           25, 2016).       Neil Kornze,      Director, Bureau of Land Management,      Washington, DC.        Dear Director Kornze: The Lewis and Clark County Board of       County Commissioners offer this letter of support for       provisions of the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM's)       Proposed Resource Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed. Reg.       8674 (Feb. 25. 2016) (the Proposed Rules). We appreciate the       effort to improve opportunities for public involvement       earlier in the planning processes, including the chance to       review preliminary resource management alternatives and       preliminary rationales for those alternatives.        We value our relationship with our federal partners, and       our constituents are impacted  [[Page H1028]]       greatly by actions taken by your agency. Increasing access to       the planning process and targeting your efforts towards       greater public involvement enhances the relationship between       the people and their government, and we support your       initiative.        Additionally, we note that the Proposed Rules also expand       opportunities for states and local governments to have       meaningful involvement in the development of BLM's land use       decisions. The Proposed Rules continue to provide for       coordination with state and local representatives in order to       ensure, to the extent available under federal law, that RMPs       are consistent with state and local land use plans, as       provided in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of       1976.            Sincerely.      Michael Murray,        Chairman      Susan Good Geise,        Vice Chair      Andy Hunthausen,        Member                                   ____                                    Board of County Commissioners,                                         Missoula, MT, May 23, 2016.      Re Proposed Resource Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed, Reg.           8674.       Director Neil Kornze,      Bureau of Land Management,      Washington, DC.        Dear Director Kornze: We are writing you to commend you and       the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for your efforts to       improve BLM's planning process (Planning 2.0) and better       address the diverse interests found in Missoula County and       other communities across the western United States.        Missoula County is approximately 2,600 square miles in       size, and federal management in the county accounts for 52       percent of the land ownership. The BLM manages roughly 23,000       acres for the public in Missoula County and the sustainable       management of these public lands is vitally important to the       residents we represent Our citizens and local economies       depend on state and federal lands for water quality and       quantity, as well as for multiple sustainable uses ranging       from outdoor recreation to livestock grazing to mineral       exploration and development. Consequently, we wish to thank       the BLM for proposing to address their land management       options from a landscape perspective. This approach       recognizes that the management of federal lands has a direct       impact on other properties well beyond those close to or       adjacent to BLM managed land.        We support the provisions of the BLM's Proposed Resource       Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed. Reg, 8674 (Feb. 25, 2016).       These rules provide additional opportunities for public       involvement earlier in the planning process, including the       chance to review preliminary resource management alternatives       and preliminary rationales for those alternatives. This early       public involvement will help resolve conflicts and produce a       Resource Management Plan that better reflect the needs of our       citizens as well as others who use the public lands and have       a stake in their future. Equally important is the improved       openness and transparency the rules bring to the process,       allowing any local government to actively participate and       share information on issues critical to local residents and       their elected representatives.        The proposed rules continue to provide for coordination       with state and local representatives in order to ensure, to       the extent allowable under federal law, that Resource       Management Plans are consistent with state and local land use       plans, as provided in the Federal Land Policy and Management       Act of 1976.        Thank you for considering our comments. If you or your       staff have any questions, please feel free to contact us or       our Chief Planning Officer, Patrick O'Herren.            Sincerely,      Nicole Rowley,        Chair.      Jean Curtiss,        Commissioner.      Stacy Rye,        Commissioner.                                   ____                                                   February 3, 2017.      Re H.J. Res. 44 to disapprove BLM's Planning 2.0 rulemaking.       Rep. Liz Cheney,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Cheney: As representatives of the outdoor       recreation community and industry, we write to express our       support for the Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0       initiative and our opposition to its disapproval through the       Congressional Review Act. Collectively, our members recreate       on BLM lands across the country and have a deep and personal       interest in the management of these areas, and these public       lands are also essential to supporting our businesses. While       Planning 2.0 may require improvements, those necessary       targeted changes would be foreclosed by a CRA disapproval,       drastically setting back the ability of BLM to deliver much       needed modernizations to the agency's planning process.        In our experience with land management planning across       agencies, a modern approach to planning built on robust       public engagement from the earliest stages of the planning       process is a tremendous benefit to land use management. It is       an essential step toward alleviating conflicts, ensuring       appropriately balanced and ordered uses, and stewarding our       country's public lands. Although there are aspects of BLM's       Planning 2.0 rulemaking that could be improved, this effort       has produced a strong step forward for the agency's planning       process, and we believe strongly that throwing this       rulemaking out in its entirety would be a costly and       unproductive decision.        During the Planning 2.0 development process, BLM engaged in       impressive public outreach and worked in an open and       collaborative fashion with a full spectrum of public lands       stakeholders. We believe the outcome is a process that       provides greatly improved opportunities for public input in       land use planning, in particular in helping the agency better       understand the values Americans ascribe to their public       lands, including where people go, why people go there, and       the experiences that these landscapes enable that are an       essential part of their inherent value. It also does a much       better job of recognizing the importance of recreation,       including for local economies, and greatly improves the       agency's ability to handle data.        Our feedback on this rulemaking is in part based on our       experience with the Forest Service's 2012 revisions to its       planning rule, which made similar changes to the Forest       Service's planning process. As that rule is being       implemented, we are seeing a significantly more transparent       process, with better up-front data collection and more       opportunities for collaboration. In North Carolina, for       example, where we have been engaged in Forest Planning on the       Nantahala-Pisgah Forests, loggers and hunters, kayakers and       off-road enthusiasts have been working side-by-side to       develop consensus recommendations for the Forest Service. Far       from circumventing local input, these modern planning       processes reward long-term, local engagement, and empower       local communities to develop visions for their public lands       in concert with a full array of stakeholders.        Planning 2.0 has been a valuable step in helping BLM       modernize its planning process, and we believe strongly       that--while targeted improvements to the rulemaking may be       possible--this rulemaking should not be thrown out through       the Congressional Review Act. Congress is well positioned to       pursue necessary changes or improvements with the new       administration, whereas CRA disapproval would not only block       these changes, but stymie future agency efforts at       modernization.        Thank you for considering our perspective on maintaining       this important step in modernizing BLM planning.            Best regards,      Adam Cramer,        Executive Director, Outdoor Alliance.      John Sterling,        Executive Director, The Conservation Alliance.      Amy Roberts,        Executive Director, Outdoor Industry Association.      Tim Blumenthal,        President, PeopleForBikes.     Finally, in my home State of Colorado, a great example of  stakeholders who know the new process is working is Park County, which  I have the honor of representing part of. As part of revising the  Eastern Colorado Resource Management Plan, the Royal Gorge Field Office  in Colorado has already embraced and implemented some of the ideas for  Planning 2.0, including recent envisioning sessions that involve  multiple stakeholders.   I include in the Record a letter from Park County, Colorado.                                                     County of Park,                                   Board of County Commissioners,                                                       May 12, 2016.      Re the Bureau of Land Management's Proposed Resource           Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed. Reg. 8674 (February           25, 2016).       Neil Kornze,      Director, Bureau of Land Management,      Washington, DC.        Dear Director Kornze: The undersigned representatives of       local government are writing to share their support for       provisions of the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM's)       Proposed Resource Management Planning Rules, 81 Fed. Reg.       8674 (Feb. 25, 2016) (the Proposed Rules). In particular, we       support the provisions of the Proposed Rules that provide       additional opportunities for public involvement earlier in       the planning process, including the chance to review       preliminary resource management alternatives and preliminary       rationales for those alternatives.        Each of undersigned representatives come from local       jurisdictions whose land bases include substantial amounts of       public lands managed by BLM. The management of these public       lands is vitally important to the citizens we represent Our       citizens and local economies depend on these lands for       sustainable multiple uses, from outdoor recreation to       livestock grazing to mineral exploration and development.        The current BLM planning methodology lacks adequate       opportunities for public involvement, particularly early in       the process. It also lacks transparency. It often results in       a range of alternatives that fails to address the concerns of       all stakeholders. The proposed changes would provide the       public with  [[Page H1029]]       an opportunity to raise concerns and review potential       management alternatives before these alternatives become       solidified in a draft Resource Management Plan (RMP). This       early public involvement will hopefully help resolve       conflicts and produce RMPs that better reflect the needs of       our citizens as well as others who use the public lands and       have a stake in their future.        In addition, we note that the Proposed Rules also expand       opportunities for states and local governments to have       meaningful involvement in the development of BLM's land use       decisions. The Proposed Rules continue to provide for       coordination with state and local representatives in order to       ensure, to the extent available under federal law, that RMPs       are consistent with state and local land use plans, as       provided in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of       1976.            Sincerely,                                                      Mike Brazell,                                          Chairman, County of Park.     It reads, in part: ``The current BLM planning methodology  lacks adequate opportunities for public involvement, particularly early  in the process.''   This rule that the CRA would invalidate addresses some of the  shortcomings in the current rule. This last point is especially  important, that changes would provide the public with an opportunity to  raise concerns and review potential management alternatives before  those alternatives become solidified. By having an opportunity for  early involvement, BLM can actually avoid expensive litigation after a  plan is complete.   This legislation is not only good for transparency, public  involvement, and environmental and wildlife protections, but it saves  taxpayer dollars. I don't know how anyone can oppose that. The process  has widespread support from those of us who live in and around public  land, from people who are on the ground, including landowners, farmers,  ranchers, sportsmen, and conservationists.   In a hearing in the Committee on Natural Resources, one of our  witnesses was a rancher from my home State of Colorado, who eloquently  spoke about how the old system was not working and how this desperately  needed new system had worked well in its limited implementation.   BLM Planning 2.0 is working, and a CRA that will never allow the BLM  to modernize its process, the process that has been locked in place  since 1983, is simply thoughtless legislating for cheap political  points.   Mr. Speaker, the resolutions before us today represent everything  that is wrong with Washington. When our constituents sent us here to  Washington, D.C., they weren't asking us to engage in partisan  bickering and using brutal techniques to undo thoughtful, nuanced  regulation. If Members of this body have problems with rules that have  been promulgated, change the authorizing statutes; don't simply prevent  the agencies from enacting the very things that this body has told them  to do. It doesn't make sense.   We have not engaged in regular order. We have avoided a thoughtful,  deliberative process, and, unfortunately, the resolutions before us are  yet another example of that. These resolutions undermine the basic  responsibility of the Department of Education and the Bureau of Land  Management. They are a shortsighted strategy for governing that will  have long-term negative consequences for our public lands and our use  thereof, as well as for children in our schools and educators.   We should fix accountability and make it work in education rather  than throw it out. We should make sure that our teacher training  programs and those whom we support with your taxpayer money are the  best possible teacher training programs; and, of course, we should have  a multistakeholder process around use of our public lands, including  recreationists, residents, county commissioners, and others.   For that reason, I strongly oppose the rules before us. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.'' I also urge my colleagues to defeat the  previous question so we can bring up Mr. Crowley's bill, which I think  is a bill that would receive, hopefully, unanimous support in this body  with regard to the remembrances of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution before us, which  would overturn the accountability regulations in the Every Student  Succeeds Act, our Nation's most important K-12 education law.   These accountability guidelines promulgated by the Department are not  only allowed under the Every Student Succeeds Act, but they are  essentially required. This legislative body last session put language  into the Every Student Succeeds Act calling upon the Department and the  Secretary to clarify this. It is a very different perspective on what  that legislative intent was.   There are items in the Every Student Succeeds Act that we agreed-- Democrats and Republicans--the Secretary and the Department would be  prohibited from promulgating rules regarding. For instance, one of  those is the promulgation of rules in support of the Common Core  curriculum.                                time  1545    Democrats and Republicans agree that the Federal Government should  [[Page H1048]]  not be setting curriculum. That is a matter for the States. We prohibit  it, specifically, in language in ESSA. We prohibit the Federal  Government from promulgating rules that require, in any way, shape, or  form, the adoption of the common core standards at the State level.   What is not prohibited is rules regarding State accountability  systems. Quite to the contrary, it is important work. In fact, it is  the core work under the Every Student Succeeds Act, that very core  commitment to civil rights that so many Democrats and Republicans feel  passionate about that is contained through these rules.   When the Elementary and Secondary Education Act first passed in 1965,  it was a critical piece of civil rights legislation, and it still is to  this day. It was written with the intent that every student, no matter  their race, background, ZIP Code, deserved a great education. And  today, the Every Student Succeeds Act maintains that spirit.   If it had some of the prohibition that my colleague on the other side  of the aisle believes it has, but won't be able to cite specific  statute that it has, Democrats wouldn't have supported that bill, and  it wouldn't have passed with nearly every Democrat--if not every  Democratic vote--in the House and the Senate.   For months, States have been working diligently to write their own  State plans to comply with the Every Student Succeeds Act. My home  State of Colorado has undertaken an extensive process. I got to attend  one of the stakeholder meetings as part of that process, gathering  feedback from educators, and parents, and students to write a State  plan that works for Colorado and meets the requirements of the new law  and the rules that this CRA would undo.   This resolution would undo all of that State-level work, all of the  work that people in Colorado have done, that people in other States  have done; create massive chaos and uncertainty in public education;  and destroy the civil rights safeguards that Republicans and Democrats  worked so diligently to put in place in the Every Student Succeeds Act.   Not only would this CRA overturn the regulations, but it would  prevent the Department of Education from looking at accountability  again. It would tie the hands of the newly confirmed Secretary of  Education, preventing her from improving or building upon the  accountability measures that Congress, through the language of ESSA,  asked the Department to take on.   This regulation was written after the Department of Education  received thousands of comments from stakeholders, including parents,  teachers, school boards, and advocates. Without a rule, the approval of  the State accountability plans would be entirely at the discretion of  the new Secretary, Secretary DeVos--the exact type of scenario the  Republicans wanted to avoid by rewriting ESSA, essentially arguing--and  many Democrats agreed with the argument--that effectively it was  arbitrary use of power that then-Secretary Duncan wielded, and then- Secretary King, to grant the necessary waivers under the No Child Left  Behind Act by removing these rules that had been promulgated.   Effectively, we would be back to where we started without criteria  for approval or denial of State plans; without adequate safeguards for  civil rights; and without the assurance that we can improve and build  upon progress.   How can we trust any Secretary--Duncan, King, DeVos, future  Secretaries--to know what a good accountability plan and bad  accountability plan look like? Why should our legislative body delegate  that level of authority without rules and regulations that we derive  and allow them to make an arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking  process that could involve approving bad accountability plans, or  failing to approve strong accountability plans? That should be a huge  concern for parents, teachers, students, and the public system.   You know what? Republicans were right, as were Democrats, when we  argued that we needed criteria for the approval of accountability  plans. And the answer is not to give blanket authority to any Secretary  with regard to approval or denial of their plans, and that is what  these rules do. And if they need to be improved and built upon, let's  work with the new Secretary to do that.   But by not only undoing those rules, but by actually prohibiting the  Secretary from promulgating additional rules, it will give the  Department of Education effective arbitrary veto over every State in  our country and an unprecedented level of federalized control of our  schools, which might be the real Republican agenda with this bill here  today.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Espaillat), who is a new member of the Education and the  Workforce Committee and is doing an excellent job so far.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester), who is a new member of the Education  and the Workforce Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California, (Ms. Judy Chu), the chair of the Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about the legal implications and the  chaos that this resolution would create if it were passed. I want to  share with you a brief story from a parent who has two sons with  special needs and who depends on strong accountability for her son's  success.   What parents across this country who have kids in public schools want  to see is a system that works for them. They are not so caught up in  which rule is being passed by who and who is doing what. They want to  make sure the learning needs of their child are met.   Frankly, a strong accountability system and a reliable accountability  system with parameters that are clear rather than a chaotic and  unpredictable one goes a long way to reassuring parents across this  country that the needs of their child are being met.   Here is a brief story from a parent with two sons with special needs:         My son Jacob is a freshman in high school. Today, he's a       straight A student well on his way to a great future. But it       wasn't always that way. He spent his early elementary school       years lacking the supports he needed to be successful in the       classroom.        At the beginning of fourth grade, he was in a self-      contained classroom, which supported his behavioral needs,       but not his academic needs. We were given the choice to ``opt       out'' of grade-level testing, but refused. It was the results       of those tests that gave us the data we needed to see where       he needed support and to see where he could excel       academically. We all saw he was working at or above grade-      level in many areas. It kept us accountable to planning his       successful future.        By the end of fourth grade, he was partially included in a       general education classroom. By middle school, he was fully       included in the general education classroom with minimal       supports in place. Without accountability standards in place       for students like Jacob, none of us--his parents, his       teachers, and even Jacob himself--would have been able to       track his upward trajectory.    I hear stories like this from so many of my constituents, Mr.  Speaker: kids with learning disabilities, kids who attend schools that  have pervasive achievement gaps between higher- and lower-income  students and students of color and White students.   Frankly, the accountability system that we have had and the  improvements that we built into it through the Every Student Succeeds  Act and this rulemaking process are the prime civil rights safeguards  that families across the country have so that they can, with  confidence, know that the public schools are required to meet the  learning needs of their child and that somebody is watching that, who  will watch the watchers, and that their only recourse isn't just  expensive litigation,  [[Page H1052]]  which the repeal of this rule would lead to more of, but, frankly, is  where the money is coming from and making sure that there is a degree  of controls in place that the learning of the child is being met.   Stories like Jacob's are the reason why so many organizations have  voiced their opposition to H.J. Res. 57.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of organizations that  have announced opposition.         The following organizations have all voiced their       opposition to House Joint Resolution 57:        Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC);       Congressional Black Caucus (CBC); Congressional Hispanic       Caucus (CHC); Alliance for Excellent Education; Association       of University Centers on Disabilities; Center for American       Progress; Children's Defense Fund; Consortium for Citizens       with Disabilities; Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates;       Democrats for Education Reform; Disability Rights Education &       Defense Fund.

To the Members of the United States Congress: The Chamber       opposes H.J. Res. 57, which would block regulations       implementing accountability provisions in the bipartisan       Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).        The Chamber believes these regulations, although not       perfect, have provided states, districts, and schools the       guidance necessary to ensure an orderly transition from the       prior No Child Left Behind Act to the new, and far more       flexible, accountability provisions under ESSA.        The Chamber is concerned that repealing the regulations       could delay implementation of this critical new law. Over the       past year, states have been developing implementation plans       with input from thousands of stakeholders. Many states are in       the final stages of developing these plans and preparing them       for submission to the Department of Education. Repealing will       create unnecessary confusion and uncertainty.        The Chamber urges you to vote against H.J. Res. 57.            Sincerely,      Jack Howard.                                   ____     Congressional Tri-Caucus Chairs Oppose Efforts To Undermine Public                                 Education                   [For Immediate Release--Feb. 7, 2017]         Washington, DC.--Today, the Chairs of the Congressional       Tri-Caucus--composed of the Congressional Asian Pacific       American Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, and the       Congressional Hispanic Caucus--released the following joint       statement in opposition to H.J. Res. 57, which would       undermine the Department of Education's authority to       implement and enforce key provisions of the Every Student       Succeeds Act (ESSA):        ``H.J. Res. 57, the joint resolution to undermine       implementation of the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act       (ESSA), is another step in the Republican attack on public       education and enforcement authority of the Department of       Education. First, President Trump nominates a champion of       privatization who is unfamiliar and unwilling to enforce key       civil rights protections for students. Now, Congressional       Republicans are ripping apart regulation to guide       implementation of the most important equity provisions of our       nation's new K-12 law.        ``As leaders of the Congressional Asian Pacific American,       Black, and Hispanic Caucuses we fought to couple ESSA's       unprecedented state and local flexibility over school       accountability and improvement with strong federal       protections for our most vulnerable students. Without the       stability and clarity provided through regulation, plan       development stops, systems halt, and students and teachers       lose. While this regulation reflects the consensus of the       education and civil rights community, it is within the       purview of the new Republican administration to reexamine and       amend it as they see fit. However, rather than take this       responsible approach to implementing the new law, Republicans       have chosen to put politics before students.        ``H.J. Res. 57 would leave key provisions of the law       completely unregulated indefinitely, leaving state systems       that serve our nation's more than 50 million public school       students in limbo and important civil rights obligations       unfulfilled. Faithful implementation of ESSA must honor both       the bipartisan intent of Congress and the longstanding civil       rights legacy of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.       This reckless measure flies in the face of both. For these       reasons, we firmly oppose H.J. Res. 57.''                                   ____                                             Consortium for Citizens                                               With Disabilities,                                                   February 6, 2017.        Dear Representative: The co-chairs of the Consortium for       Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Education Task Force, on       behalf of the CCD Education Taskforce, write in opposition of       H.J. Res 57 to rescind the accountability regulations under       the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).        The CCD Education Task Force advocates for Federal public       policy that ensures the self-determination, independence,       empowerment, integration, and inclusion of children and       adults with disabilities in all aspects of society. The CCD       Task Force sees these principles as critical elements in a       society that recognizes and respects the dignity and worth of       all its members.        The CCD Ed Task Force believes that the ESSA accountability       regulations are critical for meaningful implementation of       ESSA. The regulations clarify the statutory language in ESSA,       build upon ESSA's flexibility for school improvement and       provide a clarified role for families, educators and       stakeholders to share in the implementation process. Perhaps,       most importantly, the final regulations help assure that       States meaningfully develop accountability plans that will       create statewide systems to identify schools and districts       which need to target funds to intervene and support students       not meeting state-determined standards. We view this as       critical to helping shine a needed light on the education gap       for groups of students, including students with disabilities       so they can make important gains and achieve the same       education outcomes as their peers.        The passage of ESSA was a successful bi-partisan effort to       improve education for all students built upon the frame of       accountability. To rescind these regulations would not only       be a disservice to the spirit of ESSA and diminish the       efficacy of the law, but would also serve to undermine the       equity of educational opportunity for all students, including       students with disabilities.        Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to       contact any of the co-chairs listed below.            Sincerely,      Lindsay E. Jones,        National Center for Learning Disabilities.      Laura Kaloi,        Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates.      Amanda Lowe,        National Disability Rights Network.      Kim Musheno,        Association of University Centers on Disability.      Cindy Smith,        National Assoc. of Councils on Developmental Disabilities.                                   ____                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                                   February 6, 2017.      Keep ESSA Implementation Moving Forward--Oppose H.J. Res. 57.        Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights and the 29 undersigned       organizations, we urge you to oppose H.J. Res. 57 and to       support continued implementation of the bipartisan Every       Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). In order for the latest       reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act       of 1965 to fulfill its purpose as a civil rights law and for       implementation to comply with the requirements Congress set       forth, federal oversight is critical. The underlying       accountability and state plan regulation will help states,       districts, and schools to faithfully implement the law and       meet their legal obligations to historically marginalized       groups of students including students of color, students with       disabilities, and students who are English learners,       immigrants, girls, Native American, LGBTQ or low-income.       Congress should reject the effort to overturn these       regulations under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and       should preserve critical protections for marginalized       students.        Over the course of legislative debate in 2015, Congress       reached several compromises which enshrined both meaningful       guardrails and state flexibility into the new law. It was       these compromises--the allowance of flexibility while still       maintaining core principles of fiscal responsibility and       protections for marginalized students--which led to the       passage of the ESSA. At the core is an offer to states--      federal funding in exchange for compliance with requirements       regarding accountability, protections for students, and       fiscal responsibility. States must not be permitted to take       federal funds while flouting the law's mandates. The       accountability and state plan regulation provides       clarification and timelines which will support the vital role       of the U.S. Department of Education in ensuring that states       hold up their end of that deal.        The process of soliciting public feedback on potential ESSA       regulations began long before a draft rule was even       published. On December 22, 2015 the Department of Education       issued a request for information and  [[Page H1053]]       noticed two public meetings, ``soliciting advice and       recommendations from interested parties prior to publishing       proposed regulations.'' Then, when draft rules were issued       more than five months later, the agency received over 21,000       public comments in response to the notice of proposed       rulemaking. After considering the voluminous feedback, the       Department of Education issued a final rule on November 29,       2016. This robust and transparent engagement process was       appropriate and needed--questions regarding the responsible       use of federal funds and the need to ensure that every       student succeeds generate considerable interest. Support for       the CRA and discarding this important regulation diminishes       the important time and thought dedicated to this process, and       the voices of parents, students, advocates, educators and       others who have sought to be heard.        ESSA can and should, ``provide all children significant       opportunity to receive a fair, equitable, and high-quality       education, and to close educational achievement gaps.'' These       lofty objectives, however, require vigilance and oversight by       the Department of Education and support from Members of       Congress.

Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Over the past two       years, our organizations have worked together--across lines       that often divide us on matters of public policy--to secure       provisions in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) that we       all think are vitally important to our nation's future, and       ensure those provisions are implemented well in the states.       Our common goals include:        State-adopted standards aligned with the demands of       postsecondary education and the workforce;        Annual statewide assessment of all students in grades 3-8       and once again in high school, with a strictly limited       exception for students with the most significant cognitive       disabilities;        Transparent, accessible reporting of data--disaggregated by       race, income, disability status, and English proficiency--at       the state, district, and school levels, so educators,       parents, and students themselves have objective information       on where they are on their journey to college and career       readiness; and        Statewide accountability systems that include achievement       and graduation-rate goals for all groups of students, rate       schools in large part on the academic performance of all       groups of students, and require action when any group of       students consistently underperforms.        The overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation reflects these       principles. It grants states broad discretion to design their       systems while holding them responsible for working within-      federal guardrails to design systems that ensure genuine       equity and excellence for all students.        Since ESSA's passage, we have collectively been working in       states across the country to equip diverse partners to push       for and support the development of state systems focused on       equity and improvement.        One important piece of this process is the adoption of       regulations, which provide clarity and certainty on both the       key principles of the statute and the processes for       implementation.        The U.S. Department of Education finalized those       regulations in November. But just as states and state       advocates are putting pen to paper on their state plans, you       are considering a resolution disapproving of the regulations.       This action will cause unnecessary confusion, disrupting the       work in states and wasting time that we cannot afford to       waste.        Just as we believe the Every Student Succeeds Act       incorporates our principles, we believe the regulations do as       well. And they provide states with the clarity they need to       move forward. We do not support H.J. Res 57 and we ask you to       vote no.     The opposing organizations include Alliance for Excellent  Education; Association of University Centers on Disabilities;  Children's Defense Fund; Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities;  Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates; Democrats for Education  Reform; Easterseals; The Education Trust, League of United Latin  American Citizens; Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund;  NAACP; National Center for Learning Disabilities; National Council of  La Raza; National Down Syndrome Congress; National Urban League;  National Women's Law Center; Southeast Asia Resource Action Center;  Stand for Children; Teach For America; United Negro College Fund. And  even, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has weighed in on this  bill to oppose these efforts to strip away the accountability system  from our public education.   I also want to point out that I was opposed to the earlier resolution  on the floor today, which would unravel the Department of Education's  regulation on teacher preparation.   The intent of the teacher preparation program, as was argued here,  was to provide more transparency and accountability around the quality  of teacher preparation programs.   This Republican quest to abolish accountability for our public  schools is exactly the opposite of what I hear from parents and  families in my district who want to make sure that we have more  transparency and more accountability, not less.   While I think we all can agree that a great education starts with a  great teacher, we ought to be able to make sure that teacher  preparation programs are charged with adequately preparing teachers and  that we have some objective criteria for checking whether teacher  preparation programs are doing a good job or doing a poor job.   The regulation also requires that TEACH Grant recipients attend high- performing teacher preparation programs. It is not a matter of picking  winners or losers. It is simply a solution towards making sure our  limited taxpayer dollars for professional development and teacher  training are used effectively. If money is going to be invested in  teachers at high-needs schools, we want to make sure that teachers are  attending high-quality programs.   Now we have had a robust debate about the implications of  accountability and the real impact it has for States, districts, and  students; but I want people to focus on the story of parents and  families in their district who benefited from the accountability system  that previously existed and is improved upon through the Every Student  Succeeds Act.   It walks away from accountability--that is what this CRA does. If  this CRA passes, it doesn't just get rid of a particular set of rules  around accountability. Everybody might have things they want to change.  There is a process for changing those and a new Secretary in place who  can certainly begin that process. No, it wouldn't do that.   It would abolish the entire rules and effectively prevent the  Secretary from promulgating new rules around accountability, leaving it  completely unknown to the States and the school districts what criteria  the Federal Government was looking for in improving State-based  accountability programs.   Parents like Jacob's wouldn't know if the Federal Government would be  there to make sure that school districts had a plan to meet the  learning needs of every child.   The reason it is opposed so vociferously by civil rights  organizations is none of us would know whether the State accountability  plan had a plan to close the achievement gap to make sure that schools  can cater to the needs of all kids, regardless of their race or income.   That is what is lacking by passage of this CRA. It would effectively  handcuff the Secretary of Education, prevent her from implementing the  overwhelming will of this body, Democratic and Republican, to maintain  the civil  [[Page H1054]]  rights and accountability safeguards of No Child Left Behind; by moving  away from the one-size-fits-all accountability formula towards  increased State flexibility, so long as the basic goal of meeting the  learning needs of all students were met by State level plans.   That is at the heart of why we need accountability in the Every  Student Succeeds Act. This is why we need guidance from the Department  of Education through rules and regulations.   The resolution before us today would completely undermine the civil  rights provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act and would prevent  the Department of Education from even considering new rules and  regulations to protect the civil rights of Americans across our  country.   Those with learning disabilities and those without, parents across  the country have banded together to oppose this Congressional Review  Act.   I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to undermine our public  schools and undermine accountability. I oppose this resolution, and I  urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.                            ____________________
