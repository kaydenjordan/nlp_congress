 Mr. Speaker, on the important economic challenge of  renegotiating NAFTA, once again, the Trump administration is leading us  down a chaotic and unstable path. Our Nation must fix bad trade deals  to create good jobs and stop the wage race to the bottom.   President Trump is taking a ``shoot first, ask questions later''  approach. It reminds me of his recent backward walk of words  diminishing our NATO allies and his brash capitulating performance in  Helsinki.   Closer to home, our continent has a once-in-a-generation opportunity  to reshape our trade deals that have resulted in lowered wages for the  American people. Starting with NAFTA, we must re-create agreements that  raise wages and lift up workers in our Nation and across the world.   Current trade deals exact huge profits for transnational companies  that outsource jobs but continue the race to the bottom on wages for  workers. So far, Trump's unsteady actions on trade just create more  chaos, with businesses putting hiring plans on hold or scaling back  whole projects because of their confusion about tariffs. Is his trade  rhetoric producing a good outcome for the American people or is it just  continuing the red ink of worse trade deficits, suppressed wages, and  rising costs for consumers?   According to the PayScale Index, the paychecks of working Americans  have fallen 1.4 percent just since 2017 when you adjust for the rising  costs of essentials like healthcare, prescription drugs, gas, and  groceries. In fact, wages have fallen, actually, 9.3 percent since  2006, as costs go up and up and up but wages stay flat or go down for  so many families.   This is not what the American people were promised. They were  promised bigger paychecks, more reshoring of jobs--remember Carrier in  Indiana--better trade deals, and a President who was on their side. So  far, we have just unfulfilled promises and confusion.   NAFTA negotiations press on, but there is concern President Trump  will  [[Page H7092]]  go the way of his recent NATO meeting. Reports from his trade  ambassador seem encouraging, but will this administration follow  through on its promises to turn NAFTA into a job-insourcing deal? If  his promise to fix healthcare or promises that the GOP tax giveaway to  the top 1 percent would raise wages is any indication, then count me as  a sceptic.   Since NAFTA's passage in 1993, there has not been a single year in  which our Nation has achieved a trade balance with Mexico or Canada.  These massive billion-dollar trade deficits power the harmful push of  living-wage jobs beyond our borders and reduction in our wages. This  low wage race to the bottom pits our workers against those making  poverty-level wages in other nations.   Talk is cheap, Mr. President. In Ohio, people judge people by their  actions. Words aren't enough to help working families. Our workers and  the middle class that powers this country should not be the victim of  an ill-thought-out trade war or attacks on our allies.   President Trump, listen to the people in places like Ohio, in both  the industrial and agricultural sectors. Listen to the voters who took  a chance on you because of trade. More trade chaos is not the path we  were promised.   Renegotiate a NAFTA that will result in trade balances, insourcing of  jobs to this country with higher paying jobs in our country and rising  wages for our workers, and with continental efforts to gain stability  working with our trade partners in both Canada and Mexico. That is what  a renegotiated NAFTA should look like. Let's hope we get it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Takano for his great  support and for yielding me the time, and I thank Chairman Roe very  much for moving this bill through his committee.   H.R. 2787, the Vet MD Act, also called the Veterans-Specific  Education for Tomorrow's Health Professionals Act, I am honored to  speak on its behalf this evening.   The Vet MD Act works to break down barriers and expand opportunities  for healthcare professionals to get training to care for our veterans.  The bill creates a 3-year pilot program for pre-health undergraduate  students to gain clinical observation experience within at least five  VA medical centers.   Health schools recommend or require clinical observation hours, but  there is no formal process to apply for these hours. Opportunities to  shadow are limited and are based on where you go to school or whom you  know; and students who attend schools outside major cities, as well as  those whose families lack connections to the medical community, find it  harder and harder to shadow and are disadvantaged in medical school  admissions. This places an unfair burden on otherwise qualified  students who come from less affluent communities or rural areas.   Several years ago, two premedical undergraduate students highlighted  to my team the struggles disadvantaged, minority, and other young  people who lack personal connections face as they apply for medical  school. So I thank Seamus Carragher and Andrew Frank for bringing this  serious omission to our attention, and I thank Carrie Swope, my  legislative assistant, on this important issue, for her work  throughout.   Through their own struggle, these students struggled to gain access  to clinical observation, experience so critical in medical circles, and  they realized an immense opportunity was missing. The bill prioritizes  students in medically underserved areas; first-generation college  students, of which I was one; students referred by minority-serving  institutions; and, of course, veterans.   The Vet MD Act creates a pipeline for future physicians and medical  professionals and prioritizes training for students who specialize in a  health profession where there is a serious staffing shortage. This  important step will help narrow the gap and ensure we are training pre- health students in careers that are in demand and necessary.   I can tell you, in every hospital system I represent, there is an  unmet demand. Thousands and thousands of individuals are needed.    Mr. Speaker, importantly, pre-health students in the  pilot will gain a deeper understanding of veterans' specific health  needs and experiences, which is critical for health professionals who  treat veterans, many of whom have complex conditions, as the chair and  ranking member know.    One of our top responsibilities as a Congress is to ensure that our  veterans, those who have sacrificed so much for our country and for  liberty's cause, receive high-quality healthcare from highly trained  health professionals. This bill furthers that effort, and I am pleased  it will get a vote this evening.   I thank my colleagues: Mr. Takano, for his diligent work on this  bill; Ranking Member Walz; and Chairman Roe, for bringing this bill to  the floor so expeditiously. On behalf of our health professionals, our  veterans, myself, and all the cosponsors, I can't thank you enough.
