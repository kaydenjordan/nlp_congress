 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1187, strike lines 3 through 15.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Brooks) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Chairman, America suffered four  consecutive trillion-dollar-per-year deficits during the Obama and Bush  administrations. The election of a Republican House in 2010 brought  progress. The trillion-dollar-per-year deficits were cut to a low of  $439 billion in fiscal year 2015. A $439 billion deficit is still  horrible, but it is a whole lot better than a trillion-dollar deficit.   Unfortunately, America's solvency has deteriorated since 2015. In  fiscal year 2016, America's deficit exploded to $587 billion, $148  billion worse than the previous year. In fiscal year 2017, this fiscal  year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the deficit  will again explode to $693 billion, $145 billion worse this year than  last year, and that is before the bill comes due for the Hurricane  Harvey destruction in Louisiana and Texas.   Congress will soon raise America's debt ceiling as a result, and  within days thereafter, America's debt will blow through the $20  trillion mark.   As a result of America's $20 trillion debt, we pay over $250 billion  per year in debt service. How much is $250 billion? It is roughly five  times what we spend on transportation for things like highways,  bridges, and interstates each year. That debt service money is gone, no  longer able to provide services to Americans; rather, it is spent to  make amends for past government excesses and irresponsible spending.   Worse yet, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that  America's debt service costs will increase by another $600 billion  within a decade to more than $800 billion per year. The question is  then asked: Where is that money going to come from? What is going to be  cut? Will it be Social Security, will it be Medicare, Medicaid,  national defense? What?   The CBO, America's Comptroller General Gene Dodaro, and the  Government Accountability Office have all warned Congress and the  President in writing that America's deficits and debt past are:  ``Unsustainable.''   To be clear, in the accounting field, the word ``unsustainable'' is  bad, really bad. It is the equivalent of a bankruptcy warning. It is a  warning that America is headed to a debilitating insolvency and  bankruptcy if we don't do better.   In sum, Washington's financial irresponsibility is a betrayal of the  American people, it is pushing America into a debilitating bankruptcy  and insolvency that will destroy the American Dream for our children  and grandchildren.   It is in this setting that I have beseeched the House of  Representatives to be financially responsible. Please support my  amendment that eliminates Federal Government operating subsidies of  Amtrak, thus forcing Amtrak passengers to pay their actual costs of  riding on Amtrak trains.   Stated differently, what policy justification is there for forcing  Americans who don't use Amtrak to subsidize the travel of Americans who  do use Amtrak? I know of none.   How bad is the Amtrak subsidy problem? The Congressional Research  Service reports that, from 1971 to 2015, Federal Amtrak subsidies  totaled $78 billion in constant 2015 dollars.   In fiscal year 2014, Amtrak had a net loss of $1.1 billion. Who will  pay for that loss? America's children and grandchildren, that is who,  because that is money we don't have, have to borrow to get, and cannot  afford to pay back.   Instead of allowing Amtrak to continue to run up debts and add to our  national debt, we should force Amtrak to be self-sufficient, we should  force Amtrak passengers to pay their own travel costs, and we must cut  Amtrak from the government dole. We don't give these kind of subsidies  to people who ride on airplanes, and we don't give these kind of  subsidies in a lot of other means of transportation.   Mr. Chair, I ask for a ``yes'' vote. Be financially responsible. Make  Amtrak pay its own way.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, this amendment would shut down, as we  have heard, all 15 of Amtrak's long-distance routes and all 28 State- supported routes.   Now, let me tell you, the gentleman from Alabama is absolutely very  consistent, he is sincere about trying to reduce the Federal deficit,  and I commend him for that.   Now, here is the problem. This amendment results not in savings but  in increased costs of $423 million. I want to repeat that. This  amendment would have the effect of increasing costs by $423 million. It  would stop all revenues associated with the national network  immediately, but costs would continue to accrue for years, and in  addition, some costs that were paid for from the national network  account would now simply be shifted to the Northeast corridor account.   So, for instance, assets that are shared by both long distance and  Northeast corridor, like stations or tracks, are funded under each  account proportionally. These costs that were formerly paid by the  national network would still need to be paid. So, again, this amendment  actually costs more money.  [[Page H7050]]    I know that, obviously, is not the intent, because I know the  gentleman from Alabama, and I can say that, is absolutely sincere.   This is something that we have to realize. This bill is not just  arbitrary decisions. We held hearings, and we carefully scrubbed each  account to make sure that the reductions that we made were responsible  and that they were actually going to result in reductions.   So, again, this is not the right way to do it. This would actually  increase costs. It is not prudent to eliminate an entire transportation  option.   By the way, furthermore in this case, as I mentioned before, it would  actually cost even more so to do so. So I would respectfully urge a  ``no'' vote.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, only in the Halls of Congress  does a $1.1 billion cut in subsidies for a mode of transportation  allegedly result in higher costs to taxpayers.   I would submit that there is zero evidence that Amtrak passengers  cannot absorb higher fares to pay their own way.   Mr. Chair, we are talking about $1.1 billion out of a $700 billion  deficit for this fiscal year. We have to be responsible, we have to  protect the future of our children and our grandchildren, and I urge  the adoption of my amendment to do just that.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he would consume  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the chairman for  yielding and join him in opposing this amendment.   Amtrak serves more than 500 destinations in 46 States. It is a more  and more critical component of our transportation system in North  Carolina and many States like it across the country. It connects small  communities that otherwise wouldn't have access to air service or other  first-rate transportation.   In the past 11 years, Amtrak has had ten consecutive years of record  ridership, serving over 32 million passengers last year. So this is an  irresponsible amendment. It would eliminate thousands of jobs for  Amtrak workers, and it would hurt the local economies that benefit from  Amtrak routes.   Eliminating this national network service would also harm State- supported routes, and we in North Carolina and other States take notice  when that is charged, and it is an accurate charge. They feed into  these long-distance routes. It costs the government billions of dollars  due to the violation of labor agreements. So it would be a very costly  amendment. There is no doubt about it.   Support for a robust national rail system has been reaffirmed by  members of both parties, and we can reaffirm it here tonight by voting  against this amendment.                                time  2030    Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Brooks).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will  be postponed.                     Amendment No. 36 Offered by Mr. Soto    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 36  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
