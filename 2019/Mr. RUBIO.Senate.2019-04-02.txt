 Madam President, today I am pleased to recognize  Daniella Boyd, the Palm Beach County Teacher of the Year from Royal  Palm Beach High School in West Palm Beach, FL.   Daniella received this award in front of her students with a surprise  visit from Palm Beach County Superintendent Donald Fennoy, her husband,  parents, grandparents and her 7-week-old son. Her students credit her  style of teaching that allows them to learn with ease.   Teaching has long been a part of Daniella's ambitions, originally  focusing on social science in college. Her time with Teach for America  allowed for her first assignment in a math class, leading to where she  is today. In order to meet that challenge, Daniella had to relearn math  and considered it a great opportunity to better understand how to teach  her future students.   Daniella has been a mathematics teacher at Royal Palm Beach High  School for 7 years and founded the school's math honor society and the  Girls Who Code Club. She earned her master's degree from Harvard  University. She is the eldest child of Ecuadorian immigrants.   I extend my sincere gratitude to Daniella for her tireless efforts to  help her students succeed in math. I look forward to learning of her  continued success in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I honor Makeda Brome, the  St. Lucie County Teacher of the Year from Fort Pierce Westwood High  School in Fort Pierce, FL.   After receiving this important recognition, Makeda said everything  she does is to serve others and see them experience success in all  aspects of their lives. She takes to heart the fact that her students  must learn mathematics and retain what she has taught in order to be  successful in their next courses, in college, and beyond.   Makeda models the best practices she has seen into her classroom to  provide students with the best opportunity to succeed. Her colleagues  note her expertise in a wide array of mathematics practices and keen  ability to share this knowledge with others makes her an energetic  educator and a leader among her school.   Makeda is an instructional mathematics coach and leads collaborative  [[Page S2185]]  planning sessions, tutors students, and participates in her school's  algebra 1 and geometry boot camps before and after school.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Makeda for her dedication  to helping her students succeed in mathematics. I look forward to  learning of her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Hollie  Cunningham, the Marion County Teacher of the Year from West Port High  School in Ocala, FL.   After Hollie received the teacher of the year award at the Circle  Square Cultural Center, she credited God with leading her on this  journey. When she first started college, she was an education major and  contemplated earning degrees in teaching or nursing. One of her  professors, Dr. Osteen, gave her advice she considered an impactful  pearl of wisdom: Dr. Osteen advised her to become a nurse as she would  always have the chance to teach. She earned her bachelor of science in  nursing from Florida State University in 2002 and her master of science  in family practice from the University of South Alabama, College of  Medicine in 2011.   Hollie said she left the nursing profession because God put it on her  heart to become a high school teacher as her students are worth the  effort and sacrifice. Hollie teaches certified nursing assistant,  electrocardiograph technician tech honors, health science foundations  II honor, and medical skills classes and is the department chair for  the vocational department.   She has the opportunity to instruct young students interested in  nursing. She believes great teachers are always on call, like doctors  and nurses, and that teaching is a gift, not a degree.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Hollie for her medical  work and dedication to teaching her students. I look forward to hearing  of her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I am pleased to honor Sarah  Hall, the Seminole County Teacher of the Year from Longwood Elementary  School in Longwood, FL.   In receiving this award, Sarah's colleagues described her as an  energetic and inspiring teacher who radiates positivity to her students  each day. She believes every student should have the opportunity to  learn, and she devotes time to assisting her colleagues.   Sarah has been a teacher for 15 years and has made it her mission to  build relationships with her students and their families by creating a  literacy program, Roaring Readers: How to Train Your Cub. The program  invites parents of kindergarten and first graders to the school each  month for discussions on how they can better support their young  readers at home.

Shannon enjoys showing her students how to use their imagination to  create art and guides them through the learning experience.

Joseph challenges his students each day toward success. His influence  on the school's campus is seen with all students; from those considered  at-risk to the highest achieving, they all note how tirelessly Joseph  works to help them learn.

In Kristin's classroom, being respectful and never lying are the only  two rules. She considered it a high honor to have been among her peers  that were also nominated for this award. She was taken aback after  learning of their backstories and the great strides they are achieving  for their schools.   Kristin has been at Nova Middle School for 3 years and teaches world  history and pre-law. She has been an educator for more than 20 years.  She credits the school with providing several programs that present  opportunities for students to improve their learning potential. In the  law program, students work with the Public Safety Institute at Broward  College to help future police officers prepare to testify in their  careers.   I am thankful to Kristin for her dedication to teaching her students  and look forward to hearing of her continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I am pleased to recognize  Sarah  [[Page S2186]]  Pasion, the Duval County Teacher of the Year from Sadie Tillis  Elementary School in Jacksonville, FL.   Sarah considered this recognition an unexpected blessing from God.  She believes teaching is more than a profession; its role is to serve  as an inspiration for students to learn and become productive members  of society. To Sarah, education is the key to a better life.   Sarah likes to engage her students in conversations to help them  understand mathematical concepts, which results in the students  discussing the concepts amongst one another. When she sees them agree  or disagree with their ideas, she knows this is a more effective and  efficient strategy to teaching and helps them to fully grasp the  concepts.   Sarah is a 4th grade teacher at Sadie Tillis Elementary School and is  a 15-year veteran educator in Jacksonville. Her teaching philosophy has  been credited with improving her school's grade from an F to a C  through personalized instruction for each student and by developing  strong professional relationships with her colleagues. Both students  and teachers take notes from her instructions and lessons.   I express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Sarah for her  dedication to her students and colleagues. I look forward to hearing of  her continued success in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Shelli Rhoden,  the Baker County Teacher of the Year from Baker High School in Glen St.  Mary, FL.   Shelli was shocked and humbled to be named teacher of the year and  considers it to be a great honor. Originally a civil engineer, Shelli  became a teacher because she wanted to have more interaction with the  local youth and influence their growth. She enjoys the opportunity to  build relationships with her students and says that while it can be  challenging, seeing their success makes it worthwhile.   Each of her students come to class with different academic and  emotional needs. Shelli tries to meet with them individually, but knows  they can be distracted with life outside of the classroom. Though she  finds this frustrating, humbling, and heartbreaking, she also finds the  relationship and their questions fulfilling and always worth the  effort.   Shelli is a math and science teacher and she teaches pre-calculus,  algebra 2, and physics. Aside from teaching, Shelli cochairs the  Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports, PBIS, team and  cosponsors the Mu Alpha Theta math honor society.   I convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to Shelli for her work with  her students over the years and look forward to hearing of her  continued success.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Katharine  Williams, the Okeechobee County Teacher of the Year from the Okeechobee  School Board in Okeechobee, FLa.   Katharine believes God has led her to the position she is in today,  where she is able to help students with serious emotional or mental  distresses. She teaches them they are lovable, can love others, and can  learn how to have successful emotional regulation.   Helping students has inspired her every day, and it represents  PRIDE--perseverance, respect, integrity, dependability, ethics--to her.  This teaches students to be active listeners, how to have emotional  regulation, and also serves as the foundation of the school district's  work for its students.   Katharine has a master's degree in counseling psychology and is a  licensed mental health counselor. She has worked with the Okeechobee  County School District for 16 years and as a crisis counselor for 13  years. She is involved in the development and management of district  protocol for both threat assessment and safety planning for students.  Katharine is also one of six instructors for youth mental health first  aid.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Katharine for her  dedication in helping her students succeed in life. I look forward to  learning of her continued success in the coming years.                            ____________________
