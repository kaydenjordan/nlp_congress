 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete the  full duration of my remarks.    Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a great citizen  of the State of Colorado and a dear friend of mine, Sam Mamet. Sam is  retiring at the end of March after 40 years of working with the  Colorado Municipal League. CML is an organization that is dedicated to  representing the best interests of cities and towns throughout the  State of Colorado.   In 1979, shortly after receiving a master's in public administration  from the University of Colorado at Boulder, Sam began his tenure at  CML. For 26 years, he worked diligently to make sure that local  communities had the proper tools to better serve themselves.   In 2005 he was appointed executive director of the organization. From  this unique position, Sam was at the forefront of developing the  organization's policies and executing vital programs with the  overarching purpose of helping those who oversee communities become  more effective leaders. It is clear to the people of Colorado that Sam  has excelled in this position from day one.    It is unlikely you will find someone in Colorado government or  politics who doesn't know Sam or hasn't worked with Sam, and there is  no shortage of recognition for the incredible work he has done. If you  need proof, you can look through the abundance of awards he has  received, including a lifetime achievement award from the Colorado City  & County Management Association earlier this year. It is also not  surprising that Sam has his own day, Sam Mamet Day, on February 4,  which was dedicated by the city of Greenwood Village as a thank-you for  his years of sincere dedication to them. These are just a few of the  many examples of appreciation that showcase the passion and zeal Sam  has for the cities and communities across our great State.   I can't stress enough how Colorado communities have benefited and how  the State of Colorado has benefited from the work of Sam Mamet. His  years of persistence and dedication in his work have had a tremendous  and monumental impact. His work transcends beyond partisanship, and I  think that is the most important thing to talk about. When you see Sam  Mamet, you don't think of left or right or red or blue. You see  nonpartisanship in the work he does.   He cautions leaders to avoid demeaning an issue or individual on the  other side, something so important in today's political environment,  and to focus more on cultivating policies that will simply benefit each  and every community based on the specific needs and requirements of the  people. We need more leaders like Sam.   Sam has long believed public service is the highest calling. He  recognizes the gravity the position holds and why it is so important  that public servants are given the tools necessary to better the  streets and neighborhoods and communities they belong to. This is what  each and every citizen expects of their leaders and what he has  dedicated his life to accomplish.   ``Empowered Cities and Towns, United for a Strong Colorado,'' is  CML's vision statement, and Sam is the embodiment of these words. Each  and every day he worked to give the cities and towns around him the  tools and knowledge to empower them, and for 40 years he helped to  unite a stronger Colorado. While CML and the local municipalities they  serve will be losing an exceptional, talented, and impassioned civil  servant, I have every confidence Sam will continue to better the lives  of the people of Colorado in his work going forward.   On a personal note, there are many times when Sam and I were on the  same side of an issue and were able to work together and accomplish  great things. There were also times when Sam and I were on opposite  sides of an issue, and some of my most glorious defeats were at the  hands of Sam Mamet. As legislation went down in flames of glory, thanks  to work he was able to lead, I never took it personally because Sam  Mamet never took it personally. I remember meeting Sam through my  father and his work on the city council years ago. When a leader like  Sam steps down, he will be missed. He has big shoes to fill, but I know  Kevin Bommer, the next executive director, will do an outstanding job.   I know we all wish for Sam to stay involved in his next endeavors  that will continue to benefit our great people of Colorado. Thank you.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I want to recognize Junior  Achievement USA, who are celebrating their 100th anniversary this year.  In 1919, Junior Achievement opened its doors to young people, with the  simple goal of helping students succeed in their future careers. This  was accomplished by helping students develop skills necessary to make  smart choices in their academic and economic futures.
