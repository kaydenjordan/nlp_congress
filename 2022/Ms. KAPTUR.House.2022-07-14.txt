 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Sergeant First  Class Heath Robinson, a son of Ohio, who served America honorably and  with distinction.   After tours of duty in Kosovo and Iraq, he returned home and was  diagnosed with terminal cancer.   Sergeant First Class Robinson, like far too many others, became  afflicted with the grievous wounds of war caused by exposure to toxic  substances.   He and thousands more made the ultimate sacrifice. Every American  owes them our unending gratitude.   But we owe them more than that. When returning from the battlefields  with injuries and illnesses, America has a moral responsibility to  provide every ounce of care to our servicemembers and veterans.   This week, the House takes a step forward in meeting this sacred  obligation. The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson PACT Act will  ensure that those who served and are suffering receive the care they  need to heal.   The debt America owes to these patriots can never be fully repaid,  but we can make a down payment by delivering the care to help them  overcome, the care that they have most certainly earned.                            ____________________
