 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise  Act of 2019.   Last week, I went to El Paso to see what was going on on our southern  border. I can tell my colleagues today that our border is an utter  disaster.   Last month, Customs and Border Protection apprehended an average of  4,500 people every day. During the first 7 months of the fiscal year,  CBP has apprehended more individuals than in any full fiscal year since  2009.   While I was in El Paso, a single group of more than 1,000 aliens  illegally walked across the border from Juarez. A group of migrants the  size of a high school strolled right into downtown El Paso and  surrendered to Border Patrol. I personally witnessed hundreds of others  in smaller groups do the same thing.   The number of family unit members and unaccompanied alien minors  apprehended in April set records, and May numbers eclipsed those  records. The number of single-adult apprehensions has now reached a 5- year high.   So far this year, Border Patrol has encountered over 180 large  groups, those with over 100 people. With so many people entering  illegally, it is no wonder Border Patrol processing centers are far  beyond capacity and ICE detention facilities are full.   Even the NGOs providing shelter and other aid to migrants are  completely overwhelmed by the unending surge of people who have learned  we are rewarding those who break our laws and endangering vulnerable  men, women, and children in the process.   Perhaps the worst part of this humanitarian crisis is the toll it  takes on children. CBP has identified over 3,000 potentially fraudulent  family units arriving at the border. As unbelievable as it may sound,  aliens admitted that they have ``borrowed,'' ``rented,'' or ``bought,''  yes, ``bought'' a child because they know showing up with a child at  the border all but guarantees release into America's interior.   It is a crisis. One of the overworked, overwhelmed agents that I met  last week told me, after I thanked him for doing his work and being  there, he looked at me and he said: ``I'm doing my job; now y'all go do  yours.''   I took that to heart. I believe that the surge of migrants can be all  but ended by enacting a legislation to fix the Flores settlement, which  the Obama administration agreed with me on; amend the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act and raise the credible fear standard of asylum.   But what are my Democratic colleagues going to do to address this  situation? Nothing.   Democrats have the chance to help the overworked DHS heroes,  overwhelmed NGOs, and the American people who believe in our country's  sovereignty.   Sadly, the Democrats are making us consider a bill that will worsen,  give a green light to the border crisis, incentivizing more people to  cross our borders illegally in hopes of getting a piece of the amnesty  pie.   No doubt, at this very minute, the smuggling cartels are getting the  word out--just as we heard from migrants walking across our border,  they were told it's open--that there's availability, to come across.  They are telling them Congress is going to legalize millions. Just get  there. They will do it for you.   I have repeatedly implored my committee chairman to give us a bill  legalizing some of the illegal immigrant population and include  enforcement measures to secure our border and enforce our laws inside  our country.                                time  1515    Sadly, Democrats refuse. They had a chance to show they are serious  about an immigration solution for DACA recipients and perhaps even for  the Dreamers they have talked about protecting for years. Instead,  today, we are considering a political messaging bill. The message is  that America won't enforce its laws or protect its people.   H.R. 6 provides a special path to citizenship for millions of illegal  immigrants as well as hundreds of thousands of TPS and DED, or deferred  enforced departure, recipients. It places the interests of those who  have violated our laws before those people who have waited patiently  for green cards to become available. Because the bill provides that  same path to some legal nonimmigrants and even people living outside  America, the number of potential beneficiaries is completely unknown.   H.R. 6 allows criminal aliens and those who have committed  immigration fraud to receive green cards. It rewards with green cards  and eventual citizenship the parents who knowingly brought children to  the U.S. illegally. It incentives fraud through lax documentation  requirements, allowing affidavits to show compliance with some of those  requirements and allowing people to withdraw an application at any time  without prejudice.   H.R. 6 pretends to prevent alien gang members from getting green  cards, but the prohibition is so deliberately narrow, it is virtually  unworkable.   H.R. 6 actually provides U.S. taxpayer funds to NGOs, in the form of  grant programs, to help illegal aliens apply for green cards.   It has been said by my colleagues across the aisle to not worry, that  the Department of Homeland Security Secretary will have the  nondelegable ability to review these. I am not sure what my colleagues  across the aisle believe the Secretary does all day except review these  applications. It is the most amazing thought and statement I have ever  heard.   If enacted, H.R. 6 would overwhelm U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Services to the point where adjudicators will be pulled off of  processing legal immigration benefits to process the millions of  applications resulting from this bill. There will be several million  applications for amnesty because H.R. 6 has no consequence for filing a  false or frivolous application.   Hear me clearly: A person could file a false or frivolous  application, and there is no consequence to it.   CBO has estimated that over the 2020 to 2029 period, the two bills  combined to make H.R. 6 would cost $26.3 billion and $8.3 billion  respectively, and that is, frankly, I believe, an underestimate.   As evidenced by the two floor votes last year, Republicans want to  provide legal status for DACA recipients. We want to do it the right  way, to minimize fraud, to ensure criminals cannot get legal status,  and to bolster border security. Without these commonsense measures and  compassionate measures, we will find ourselves repeating this  conversation a few years from now.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6 does none of these things, so I urge my  colleagues to oppose this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  might consume.   Madam Speaker, just quickly, if their criminality keeps them simply  ineligible, then why does the bill have an entire section devoted to  the Secretary's provisional authority of those who conduct a public  safety determination?   By the way, again, going to the Secretary of Homeland Security, I am  not sure what they believe that person does, but it is definitely not  to review these every day.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Rogers), the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship.    Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 5  minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), another  member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), another committee member.    Madam Speaker, I would remind the gentlewoman  from Texas that, as Americans, we also have rule of law. We stand for  that and have wanted to fix the DACA situation, not just give a green  light to continue a problem on the border that we are continually  seeing.   There are problems with this bill. It is not a perfect bill and  doesn't fit, in many ways. We are pointing that out. The pride that we  take in that is not that we are seeing something broken. It is the  pride that we need to fix something in this. We want to see these  recipients be here and be able to participate in a legal fashion.   The legal immigration system is being overwhelmed by the illegal  population coming across, which we are not fixing, and don't say that  we are because we are not. Nothing has come to this floor, and it  happens every day.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Cline), another member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Iowa.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman, the  speaker, Mr. Cicilline. I agree with him that we need to fix this, but  this is not the way to fix this. There is a bipartisan way to fix this,  and this simply just gives a green light.   It is a powerful symbol. This bill is a very powerful symbol to those  who want to come here and know that there will be no consequence for  coming and will continue to overload our border. That is the symbolism  that comes from this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate the majority leader coming down. It  is amazing to me, though, that as we come down and talk about this  bill, if there really was a desire to have a bipartisan bill, then  maybe we would have brought the bill that actually did get close, as  the gentleman did bring up last Congress, and actually ask some of  those cosponsors on the Republican side who were sponsoring it last  time to be a part, who have said they have been froze out.   Let's face reality. So spare me the discussion on getting a  bipartisan bill and the disdain for it and saying that this bill  actually helps.   This is a bill written for a promise, as was just said. Let's, at  least, be honest about why it was written and the fact that it will not  help the situation on the border and, frankly, is not going to help us  get a bill passed, because this will not pass because, as the President  has said, he wants to see some security attached to this, so that we  have a safe and secure legal immigration system.  [[Page H4284]]    Mr. Speaker, I would agree with him. Spare me those discussions  because that didn't happen here, as is painfully obvious.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  Florida an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I inquire how much time is  remaining for both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, derogatory statements toward the  President; also, that was impugning the integrity of the President. I  think that is much more beyond what was actually warned about, and I  would ask the Parliamentarian for a ruling on that.    Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary inquiry would  say that that statement, as quoted, ``a racist rant'' is an attack on  the President, implying he is a racist. Is that not true? Which is  contrary--    Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this House  is run on parliamentary language that is not consistent with what was  just used?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia  continues that parliamentary inquiry, then, because it is an issue that  needs to be addressed. It should not have been said on this floor.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, here we go again. Now, it may  not matter to anyone else here, but the Members who wear pins  understand that parliamentary language is important and what rules this  floor. ``Xenophobic'' is another word being used on this floor about  the President's character. Please advise how that is parliamentary  language.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.  [[Page H4288]]         Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much  time each side has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  time, and I appreciate the gentlewoman (Ms. Lofgren) and the ability to  close.   Mr. Speaker, there is a saying sometimes, and it is ``everything has  been said, just not everybody has said it.'' I think we sort of went  through that today.   But some of the things that have been said today need to be brought  out and, I think, continue to be brought out, and it may be that we  don't talk about them.   What we have found here is that, today, my colleagues clearly do not  care--as we have seen--about rule of law. They don't even seem to care  about the rules of the House today, and they had to actually waive the  paygo rules in order to bring this bill to the floor.   The estimate on this was $35 billion. They have waived that. They  said: We don't care. We have got a bill that is going nowhere, a bill  that is not going to be signed. So I guess, just to make our point, we  are just going to waive that.   But let's talk a little bit about some of the other stuff that is not  in this bill, that is not with DACA recipients, or DACA, or the  Dreamers--however, it is described today--that many of us would like to  have seen.   I think it was very telling when the majority leader came down here  and brought up a bill which I acknowledged was very close to coming  bipartisanly and passing last year, but didn't. If you wanted a  bipartisan bill, that is where you would have started, and you would  have had an opportunity to actually then put something with it with  security and actually get something passed.   But that was not what my friends across the aisle wanted. They  wanted, it seems to me, a political bill, a statement bill, something  that will not get passed but simply continue to use this population,  seemingly, in a way that furthers political goals and not a real  solution.   An interesting part of this bill which has not been talked about as  much--it has been mentioned, but it also needs to be recognized. We  have a serious issue with this temporary protected status, TPS. There  is no T anymore. T is not available in this. Temporary does exist.   When we talk about this--and it is supposed to be for those who are  in dire need. I agree with the concept of TPS, that it should be there  for those areas and times when we need to allow people to come in, and  that should be a part, and it should not be natural disasters and other  things. But I want you to think for just a second--and this was  actually brought out in Rules last night by my colleague from  California, whom I respect highly about this.   But understand, the TPS was granted to El Salvador in March 2001;  Haiti, 2010; Honduras, 1999--these were earthquakes, hurricanes--Nepal,  2015, an earthquake; Hurricane Mitch in 1999, with Nicaragua. Others  were armed conflicts, which we can understand.   But temporary after a hurricane, we are looking at 15, almost 20  years and we are still dealing with this, because all we did in this  body and all the administration did was simply kick the can down the  road.   I feel for those who came here on a temporary status but did not go  home, and then they got left. Yes, this has become their home because  we did not obey the law.   Now, there has been a lot said also about--and there is no need to  continue on it because there is the ability for criminal elements to  get green cards--the discussion about having the Secretary of Homeland  Security being able to take these up; and an individual, a nondelegable  authority, to actually take these individual items up is a farce. They  don't have that time or ability.   They will never get that far because, actually, amazingly, the  Department of Homeland Security Secretary is a busy person, both female  or male. Whoever serves in it, under Republican or Democrat, does not  have time to do this. So the very narrow exemption will never get used.  So, yes, it does open that possibility up.   But I think the interesting thing here is, it was shown by some of  the discussion in this debate, it was beyond the political rhetoric of  a bill that is going nowhere and a bill that should and could find  solutions.   It goes back to the problem that we see right now that this is,  frankly, another green light to those who want to come here seeking  freedom from the place that they currently are, which I sympathize  with. I understand. But either we have a way to get into our country  legally or we don't. Either we  [[Page H4290]]  have a way that you should come properly to our country or we don't.   It is not an in-between item here. It is not saying that we want you  to come but, yet, at the same point, don't worry about our rules and  laws if you can come.   As I said earlier in my statement today, they are borrowing, renting,  and begging for children to walk across the border because they know  that, once they do, they are free. Within 48 to 72 hours, they can get  to an NGO and be on a plane somewhere, even when we have found over  3,000 cases of fraudulent, unaccompanied minors and family units. But  we don't address that here.    In other words, we don't talk about what is happening in combination  with this, which many of us could have actually gotten on board with.  We simply put another green light, Mr. Speaker, on the fact that we are  not helping.   If either side, both Republicans or Democrats, could look at a Border  Patrol agent or an ICE agent or one who works in our immigration and  port authority and actually look at them and tell them while they are  doing their job upholding the law, which is all they can do--it is not  their job to make laws. That is this body's job: to make laws or to  help them or to send them aid.   Then how can we look them in the eye when they are staying 15 and 20  hours away from their families each day, when their own families are  falling apart, because we are overcrowding our Border Patrol offices  because they can't hide them?   How do we explain to those who come here properly on asylum from Cuba  and other places where they have been told, as one told me, looked at  me and said: ``If I was to go back to Cuba, they would disappear me,''  how can we sit there and look at them while they are held for 60 or 90  days or longer, while unaccompanied family members and unaccompanied  minors and family units are being passed over within 24 to 48 hours as  they are sitting there legitimately trying to get into this country  through an honest asylum claim?   But we sit them there to the side. We don't want to discuss them. We  want to make a political statement today.   So this will be a partisan vote. There will be some bipartisan vote.  There may be some who will vote for it, and that is okay. But at the  end of the day, we are not getting what we asked for. We are not  getting what we wanted. If we did, we probably would have taken the  bill from last Congress. They did have bipartisan votes, what the  majority leader spoke of. But that is not what we did.   Until we get serious about this issue, until we get serious about  wanting to fix this and not simply use debate time to bash the  administration or the President and to find solutions here, then we  will continue down this path.   And you can celebrate if you pass this--which you will because the  majority has the numbers--but how hollow a celebration is something  when you look and say: This will not do anything because this will not  become law.   The powerful symbol spoken of by one of my colleagues earlier is  this. The powerful symbol is not that you can pass a bill on the floor  that has nothing of support from either side or actually has the hope  of becoming law, or giving false hope to anyone who is watching today,  what actually has the ability to do is that why would we do this if we  are not dealing with the issues that we have as we go forward? Why  would we take the flaws in this bill, bringing it to the floor in a  closed rule?   Why? Because I believe the majority didn't want to have to deal with  the honest problems in this bill with amendments, so they closed the  rule. They didn't want it to happen.   Mr. Speaker, but as this is our time, this our place, I would urge a  ``no'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
