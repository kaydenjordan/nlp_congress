 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the work being done by  the Department of Defense regarding the threat of climate change, and  to reinforce congressional intent on this important issue.   Last year's National Defense Authorization Act expressed the sense of  Congress that climate change is a direct threat to national security.  We have studied a number of readiness factors when it comes to our  Armed Forces, but for too long, we have not given this major,  multifaceted threat the attention that it deserves.   Current and former military leaders and members of the intelligence  community agree that climate change poses a security challenge that has  the potential to affect our tactical and strategic readiness.   Secretary Mattis was correct when he stated: `` . . . the effects of  a changing climate--such as increased maritime access to the Arctic,  rising sea levels, desertification, among others--impact our security  situation.''  [[Page H4148]]    Naval bases, such as Norfolk or Key West, are already at risk for  flooding. In fact, Norfolk frequently deals with nuisance flooding, and  that risk will only increase as storm surges increase in magnitude and  tides continue to rise. Inland bases will experience other weather  volatility, such as extreme heat and wildfires, all of which can impact  their ability to train, and ultimately impacts readiness.   The displays of dominance in the Arctic will grow, where new sealanes  will connect continents more directly than ever before. The changing  global climate, Mr. Speaker, will also lead to greater instability in  the form of economic migration, increased competition over resources,  and possibly more failed states, which we know to be breeding grounds  for extremism and terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that a changing climate will alter our joint  battle space. So when the U.S. Congress instructs the Department of  Defense to take these threats seriously and evaluate the risk posed to  our national security by climate change, we need exactly that. Our  intent is clear, and there can be no room for misinterpretation.   Last week, The Washington Post reported that during revision of the  Department's January 2018 Screening Level Vulnerability Assessment  Survey report, Department of Defense officials omitted information  pertinent to how our military installations report their vulnerability  to sea level rise, how climate change is affecting the operating  environment in the Arctic, and the potential risk to the Department's  ability to conduct training and testing activities that have important  impacts on our readiness.   While I appreciate the need to update reports when it is appropriate  and necessary, it is unacceptable to attempt to bend congressional  intent for political convenience. The Department of Defense must answer  tough questions as to what motivated these changes, if not a skewed  political narrative. In fact, the issue of climate change and its  impact on national security has become more bipartisan over the last  several years.   In fact, last year, in the National Defense Authorization Act,  Congress instructed each service within the Department of Defense to  assess the top 10 military installations likely to be affected by  climate change over the next 20 years. We also instructed combatant  commanders to incorporate the effects of a changing climate into their  strategic battle plans.   Forty-six Republicans joined with Democrats to support this language  on the floor of the House, and I expect that when this report is  delivered to Congress later this year, it will make candid assessments  in line with the clear language we supported in that floor vote and  that was signed into law by the President.   Mr. Speaker, we must ensure that the Department remains resilient and  is prepared to address the effects of climate change on threat  assessments, resources, and readiness, as well as to conduct operations  both today and in the future. Congressional oversight plays an  undeniable role in that process.   Mr. Speaker, the dangers of climate change on our national defense  are real, and we support the researchers on the front lines of these  critical threat assessments. Together, we can continue to craft a sane  and sober strategy to defend the United States from a variety of  threats, including climate change.   That is the expressed intent of Congress for the upcoming climate  report, and is a necessity as we prepare for our Nation's future.                            ____________________
