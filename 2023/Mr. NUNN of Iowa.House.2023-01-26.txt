 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major Katie  Lunning, a Critical Care Air Transport Team nurse in the U.S. Air Force  Air National Guard.   The wings of angels come in many forms. On August 26, 2021, those  wings came in the form of Flight Nurse Lunning. Her medical evacuation  team boarded a C-17 Globemaster, a massive flying ambulance, to  evacuate critically injured Americans and allies in the evacuation of  Afghanistan.   Major Katie Lunning, an intensive critical care unit nurse manager in  her civilian career, is no stranger to hard work and the harrowing  missions with the Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs in Des Moines,  Iowa.   Recently, Major Lunning became the first flight nurse in the Air  National Guard to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, our  Nation's highest award for extraordinary aerial achievement.   As Afghanistan fell and Taliban forces converged on the capital,  Major Lunning was one of the first to respond to a mass casualty  suicide bombing at Kabul airport. The tragic death toll claimed the  lives of nearly 200, including 13 American servicemembers, among them  Iowa's very own Corporal Daegan Page.   Major Lunning was on the scene within hours of the bombing and  immediately worked to triage and prepare patients for evacuation while  taking enemy fire.   With few resources, Major Lunning provided medical care to patients,  including five who were critically injured and a 2-year-old with a  traumatic brain injury, during the 8-hour flight to safety. All 22  patients survived.   She is the epitome of a winged angel: heroic, selfless, and providing  rescue to those in times of critical need.   With all of Iowa, I join in saluting Major Lunning as we could not be  prouder. Moreover, her dauntless courage is an inspiration to the  future women and men who will don the flight nurse's uniform and serve  our State and country in the missions ahead.                            ____________________
