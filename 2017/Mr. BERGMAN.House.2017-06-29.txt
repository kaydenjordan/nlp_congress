 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and his committee for  their diligent work on this extremely important and timely law.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3004, Kate's Law. Our  immigration system here in the United States is the most generous in  the world. Good people from all over the globe who understand the  American Dream seek to join us, and we are better for it.   Alexander Hamilton, Levi Strauss, Albert Einstein, and so many others  have called themselves Americans because of it. But as we continue to  draw on that spirit of understanding and acceptance, we have to  remember that a nation without borders is not a nation.   We have a responsibility here in Congress to be proactive and protect  our communities and our citizens from unlawful and criminal immigrants,  and that is what this legislation does.   Kate's Law, named in honor of 32-year-old Kate Steinle, who was shot  and killed in the prime of her life by an unlawful immigrant who had  accumulated seven felony convictions, been deported five different  times--you have heard this many times said--aims to strengthen public  safety by imposing hasher mandatory prison sentences for deported  felons who return to the U.S. and increasing penalties for unlawful  immigrants who have been convicted of nonimmigration-related crimes.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation just makes sense, and I am confident  that we can continue to welcome the tired, the poor, the huddled masses  yearning to breathe free in our country without giving free rein to  dangerous convicted criminals in any of our communities.
