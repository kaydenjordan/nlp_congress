 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my pastor, Mark  Goeglein, to the U.S. House of Representatives and to commend him for  his many years of faithful service to the Lord and to others. It is a  blessing to have him here offering the opening prayer for today's  legislative session.   Pastor Mark grew up familiar with the legislative process, as his  mother was a longtime State representative from Indiana. I am thrilled  to have him here today and appreciate his support of me and his love  for our country.   Mark has served in ministry for 25 years in churches in his home  State of Indiana, Texas, California, and now as pastor of the  Harrisonville Community Church in Missouri. I appreciate his passion  for sharing God's Word with his congregation and how his love of  Scripture shows in his preaching and in the faded thumbprint on his  Bible, testifying to the many years he has held that Bible preaching,  studying, and praying.   Besides a love of the Word, Pastor Mark loves the Pittsburgh  Steelers, basketball, and his family. He is blessed to have his wife,  Michelle, here today along with daughter, Makenzie, and sons, Micah and  Mason. This family is an inspiration to our congregation and a  testimony of God's faithfulness and goodness.   I wish Pastor Mark God's continued blessings and know his  faithfulness will be richly rewarded.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the National  Defense  [[Page H4373]]  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. I thank Chairman Thornberry and  Ranking Member Smith for bringing this important bill to the floor.   For years, the House Armed Services Committee has been fighting  relentlessly to increase defense spending to ensure our troops have the  capabilities, capacity, and training needed to face the growing threats  of today.   Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Thornberry, we were able to pass  a 2-year budget agreement earlier this year that paved the way for the  committee to draft a defense authorization bill that will continue our  military's road to recovery.   As chairwoman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I am  proud of the provisions included in this bill that relate to the  subcommittee's work, and I appreciate Ranking Member Seth Moulton's  support of these efforts, including several important provisions to  combat efforts by our adversaries to gain unauthorized access to highly  sensitive military technology.   We must face the reality that countries like China are using a whole- of-nation approach to steal and exploit highly sensitive U.S. military  information.   This bill adds an extra layer of vetting for dual nationals who wish  to work at the DOD or the National Nuclear Security Administration.   The subcommittee is also conducting oversight on the transition of  DOD security clearances from the Office of Personnel Management to the  Department of Defense. The bill seeks to tackle security clearance  reciprocity issues by directing DOD to ensure seamless transition of  investigations between authorized investigative agencies.   This bill is also good news for the warfighter. It fully funds  continued development of the new B-21 bomber. Nuclear deterrence  remains the foundation of national security for the United States and  is fundamental to preserving international stability. The bomber fleet  is the most flexible leg of the nuclear triad, and it is vital that we  continue to invest in this new capability.   As we invest in the B-21, we must also ensure that our current bomber  fleet remains effective until the B-21 is operational. The NDAA  supports responsible modernization programs for the current fleet, such  as the B-2, to ensure we maintain our long-range strike capability.   It also continues to address readiness and modernization needs by  authorizing 24 additional F-18 Super Hornets, investing in A-10  modifications, and adding 4,000 troops to the Army's end strength.   These investments, along with many other important provisions, will  ensure our Nation remains safe and secure.   Mr. Chair, once again, I thank Chairman Thornberry for his leadership  in advocating on behalf of our national defense.   I am proud of this bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to  support its passage.                                time  1830
