 Madam Speaker, this past weekend and early this week,  the people of Michigan's southeast area in the Twelfth District have  experienced devastating floods. More than 7 inches fell on my hometown  of Dearborn in a few hours.   But it is not new for Michiganians. We keep experiencing these once- in-a-lifetime storms every year. But that doesn't make it any different  when your basements are flooded, family photos are ruined, carpets are  soaked, cars can't operate, water is not running, and the power is out.   We have to do something. Our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling,  and the American people deserve better.   We need to invest in our infrastructure to make communities more  resilient to the impacts of the climate crisis.   On Saturday, I sent a letter to the President urging immediate FEMA  assistance to our communities. I have asked the Army Corps of Engineers  to begin a study to tell us what we have to do.   My constituents are dealing with so much damage and are in immediate  need of essential resources. We are focused on doing everything we can  to coordinate with all to help our communities. We just wish we could  send the West some of our water.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I  share the bipartisan happiness at seeing his smiling face and good  health back.   I rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 3684, the  INVEST in America Act.   We need to invest in the infrastructure of the future, not the past.  This surface transportation reauthorization legislation, along with the  important package of water infrastructure and assistance outlined in  this bill will make a meaningful and bold difference in the lives of  Americans.   I am proud to have authored a number of provisions in this bill, but  at the moment I want to specifically address the water package that is  in the bill, thanks to the tireless work of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   Water is a human right that no one should be denied. In this  pandemic, the very first instructions before we ever wore masks, we  told people to wash your hands. Yet, so many Americans didn't have  access to water because the water had been turned off. Imagine living  in this pandemic and not having sanitary conditions--water in a running  bathroom.   This bill includes legislation that I have authored with  Representatives Tlaib and Blunt Rochester, the Water Debt Relief Act,  that establishes a $4 billion residential emergency relief program  through EPA for public water systems to forgive any debt incurred by  struggling households since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many  are in our frontline communities. It would also prevent water systems  from cutting off any of these households from clean water. People have  a right to be able to wash their hands.   Additionally, it includes bipartisan legislation that I have co-led  with Representatives Blunt Rochester, Katko, and Tlaib that would  establish a permanent, long-term water assistance program to address  the growing water debt crisis we have.   I thank the leadership of Chairman DeFazio and Chairman Pallone, and  I urge my colleagues to support this.
