 Mr. Chairman, as we all now know, pandemic unemployment  assistance funds became the source of the greatest theft of taxpayer  dollars in American history.   Estimates put the total amount of assistance lost to fraud as high as  $400 billion. California alone lost around $60 billion under the  leadership of President Biden's Secretary of Labor nominee Julie Su.   As Californians in particular continue struggling under spiking  prices and high taxes, it is absurd to force them to foot the bill for  fraud committed while their leaders were asleep at the wheel.   That is why I am proud to support the Protecting Taxpayers and  Victims of Unemployment Fraud Act, which will address this  unprecedented theft by incentivizing States to recover these stolen  funds and providing the tools to prevent future fraud.   Government caused this problem, and it owes the American taxpayers a  solution. I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this measure to  provide the fiscal oversight we were sent here to deliver.
