 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Cornyn  amendment No. 4096, as modified, be called up and reported by the  clerk.    Mr. President, we have eight votes, two of which I think  we may be able to take. I hope that those who wish to have votes may  talk just a little bit so that we can speed up the process.   The first vote will be 15 minutes; the remainder of the votes will be  10 minutes. We will begin that process with Young No. 4080. I think  there is agreement for him to speak for 1 minute.                              Amendment No. 4080     Mr. President, we were going to have 10-minute votes. We  have had two votes in 54 minutes. Can we not just vote? OK. All right.   I think we have two rollcall votes left. A number of Senators are  doing voice votes, and then we will have the journalist resolution at  the end, by voice also.   Go ahead, Senator Cornyn.    Mr. President, I yield back.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S.J. Res. 69.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint  resolution be considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    Mr. President, I want to thank our ranking member and my  friend, Senator Menendez, for his tremendous cooperation for many years  but especially over this last week, and Senator Kaine for coming in and  supporting it.   I want to reiterate what the ranking member just said. The Senate has  now unanimously said that Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman is  responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That is a strong  statement. I think it speaks to the values we hold dear, as the rest of  this resolution does.   I am glad the Senate is speaking with one voice, unanimously, toward  this end. I thank the leader for accommodating--making this happen.   I yield the floor.    I thank the Senator.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Foreign Relations I  report favorably the following nomination list which was printed in the  Record on the date indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that this nomination  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.
