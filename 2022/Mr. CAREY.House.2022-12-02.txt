 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of my dear friend,  Congressman Dave Hobson, who is a former member of the Ohio Air  National Guard, the Ohio State Senate, as well as a Member of this body  for 17 years representing Ohio's Seventh District.   Earlier this week, Dave--or ``Uncle Dave'', as his former  constituents fondly call him--was inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall  of Fame for his service in the Ohio Air National Guard. As a veteran in  Congress, Dave was able to secure more than $200 million in Federal  funding for military projects in Ohio and beyond.   I would also like to personally thank Dave for the positive impact he  had on me throughout the years, as you can see, from a very young age,  and he continues to have on me today as he does much of Ohio. I am also  now honored to represent Dave's home county of Clark County in western  Ohio.   We have quite literally come full circle, and I am glad to see his  legacy recognized as he joins the impressive ranks of his brothers and  sisters in arms in the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame.   Dave, congratulations on this momentous occasion, and thank you for  your continued mentorship and friendship for the last 35 years.                            ____________________
