 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this historic  bipartisan legislation. This progrowth bill is thanks to all the  hardworking members of the House Financial Services Committee, and I am  proud to have contributed to this meaningful reform.   S. 2155 will reduce regulatory burdens hindering Main Street by  providing job creators with resources they need to grow their  businesses and, frankly, their banks. Under Dodd-Frank, big banks have  gotten bigger and small banks have become fewer. Our economy is not  well served when small banks are handicapped.   As a former manufacturer, I understand the toll excessive regulatory  burdens can have on small businesses. That is why I am a proud  supporter of this legislation, and I look forward to seeing this bill  signed on the President's desk.                                time  1200
