 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this Thursday,  October 5, is an important deadline: 154,000 young men and women have  until this Thursday to renew their status under the Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Those 154,000 DACA recipients,  whose authorization expires before March 6, 2018, must renew their  application.   If you are one of them, please send in your application today. Under  the new DACA rules, you are entitled to receive two more years of  deferral, but only if the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  receives your application by October 5. If you have not already sent in  your application, send it in the fastest way possible. A regular first  class stamp will likely not arrive in time.   My district is home to many DACA beneficiaries known as DREAMers. Do  not wait. To all the other DREAMers, I say: Don't lose hope. You have  the support of the vast majority of the American people, and we are  fighting every day to get the Dream Act to the House floor.                            ____________________
