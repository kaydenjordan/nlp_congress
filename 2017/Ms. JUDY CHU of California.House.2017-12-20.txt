 Mr. Speaker, less than 24 hours after it  passed, we already have to come back to vote on fixes to the Republican  tax scam.   This bill was so needlessly rushed that there wasn't even time to  proofread. I can only wonder what other mistakes we will discover in  the coming days, weeks, and months.   This was sloppy lawmaking and bad policymaking. In order to give  massive tax cuts to corporate interests and the top 1 percent,  Republicans have created trillions in new debt that will have to be  paid for by, you guessed it, the rest of us.   Republicans claim that everybody is getting a tax cut. But if you  read it--something they clearly didn't do--you will see that 83 percent  of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. The average savings for the  lowest earners is just $60. My own constituents in California can  actually expect to pay more in taxes thanks to the capping of the State  and local tax deduction.   Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this tax scam, and I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.''
