 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the excellent law  enforcement personnel who serve North Carolina's 13th District. I would  like to specifically mention a heroic act that happened on July 14 in  Rowan County.   A detective named Josh Simmons saw a burning car as he drove down  Highway 52. When he approached, he found an elderly woman unable to get  out. He pulled her from the car just minutes before it went up in  flames.   Detective Simmons said of his actions: ``The way I was raised, you  take care of people. I didn't know who was in the car. It didn't matter  who they were. They just needed help.''   Mr. Speaker, this is a great example for all of us. Our community is  truly lucky to have such courageous folks serving and protecting us.                              Healthy Skies Act     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to put forward a new proposal to  help reopen our country with speed and with safety.   Between business, leisure, and tourism, air travel is a mode of  transportation that must be trusted if our country can fully reopen. In  fact, before the pandemic, commercial aviation drove 5 percent of our  GDP and helped support more than 10 million American jobs.   Unfortunately, there are currently no concrete proposals to lessen  the fear that has gripped air travelers and crippled the aviation  industry. And that is why I am proposing a bipartisan bill called the  Healthy Skies Act, along with Congressman Ralph Norman and   John  Larson.   This bipartisan legislation instructs the TSA Administrator to create  a pilot program that would temporarily screen the temperature of all  travelers going through TSA security before they reach the gate area.   Having the TSA temporarily screen passengers for elevated  temperatures has a number of practical advantages. It ensures that each  passenger experiences a consistent nationwide process to prevent  infected individuals from boarding planes and spreading the virus. This  will give travelers the peace of mind they need to confidently start  flying again, while discouraging folks who might be sick from even  attempting to come to the airport in the first place.   Reopening America should be the top priority of our government.  Making sure air travelers are healthy enough to fly is a commonsense  way to boost passenger confidence and jump-start economic activity. And  that is how we can stop the spread of COVID-19 and continue a great  American comeback.                            ____________________
