 Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I  rise, along with Senator Tom Carper of Delaware and Representative Lisa  Blunt Rochester of Delaware, to honor BG Karen A. Berry, a Delawarean  who has provided exemplary service to the National Guard.   With more than three decades of distinguished military career service  dedicated to the National Guard, BG Karen Berry has represented  Delaware in a variety of leadership capacities, including company  command of the HHC 280th Signal Battalion and Officer Candidate School,  193rd Regional Institute, and the 261st Tactical Theater Signal  Brigade. She completed a yearlong deployment serving as the deputy  commander of the 335th Signal Command in Afghanistan, acting as the  senior communications officer and providing essential guidance for the  communications network theater. Moreover, in 2019, she transferred to  the Connecticut National Guard, serving in two key leadership  positions: assistant to the Adjutant General Army and the Director of  the Joint Staff. There, she oversaw the training and deployments of the  Connecticut Army National Guard and ensured mission readiness and  support to State and Partnership Programs between Connecticut and its  partner Uruguay, a role critical to the success of countless overseas  missions.   Brigadier General Berry has built on her extensive experience to lead  with practical knowledge. Her educational background includes a  bachelor of science in agricultural engineering and technology from the  University of Delaware, a master's degree in education from Salisbury  University, and a master's degree in strategic studies from the U.S.  Army War College. Her promotions and list of major awards over the  years are extensive and include National Defense Service Medals, Army  Commendation Medals, and Delaware National Guard Medals for Military  Merit, just to name a few.   Brigadier General Berry is also the first female Army guardsman to  hold a brigade command in the Delaware Army National Guard, as well as  the first female in the Delaware Army National Guard promoted to the  general office rank of brigadier general. Brigadier General Berry has  opened the door for countless others to follow, serving as an example  of strong leadership, phenomenal work ethic, and service before self.   Brigadier General Berry has provided reasoned, invaluable, and  experienced counsel while serving as chair of my Military Service  Academy Board since my arrival in the Senate. A hallmark of Brigadier  General Berry's leadership has been her high regard for the  servicemembers she leads and their families. Brigadier General Berry  has also been instrumental in forging enduring relationships with local  community members and organizations. These bonds will serve the  Delaware National Guard and Delaware communities well for years to  come.   The values of hard work and serving others are second nature to the  Berry family. Karen, her husband MG Michael Berry, and the entire  family are known throughout the State of Delaware for their generosity  and support of education and local community initiatives, sowing seeds  of success for the future. We are truly grateful for all they have done  to inspire the next generation of military leaders in Delaware and  beyond.   We wholeheartedly congratulate BG Karen Berry on over three decades  of service in the National Guard. Your strong dedication and leadership  serve as a phenomenal example for many others. We wish you and your  family the very best. Thank you.                            ____________________
