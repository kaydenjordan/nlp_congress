 Mr. Speaker, I have the great privilege of  serving with many veterans here in Congress, and to them, I am so  grateful for their service. This is also why I rise in support for this  resolution, to pull our great military from Syria.   I would point out, on the official website for the U.S. Department of  Defense, when it tells who the Department of Defense is on the  ``about'' page, it says: We are your defense. The Department of Defense  is America's largest government agency. With our military tracing its  roots back to prerevolutionary times, the Department has grown and  evolved with our Nation. Our mission is to provide the military forces  needed to deter war and ensure our Nation's security.   That is the job of our Department of Defense, not to wage war in  foreign lands and foreign countries at the expense of the American  taxpayer. It is to deter war.   It is also the role of the Department of Defense to ensure our  Nation's security, but our border is being ignored. Every single day,  our border is invaded by thousands, and over 300 Americans die daily  from fentanyl brought into our country by Mexican cartels. I would say  those are the enemies we need to be focusing on, not in a country  called Syria where no one in my district ever demands: ``Marjorie, we  must go to war in Syria.'' I never hear that request from anyone who  voted for me.   As a matter of fact, the veterans in my district say: We are sick and  tired of foreign wars. We are fed up with it, and too many of our  American military have died in foreign lands serving their foreign  borders and their foreign causes.   I thank my colleague, Matt Gaetz, for introducing this resolution,  and I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support it.
