 Mr. Speaker, this past Friday, Biden's CDC, formally  known as the Centers for Disease Control, but often referred to now as  the center for Democrat control, announced that it would be ending  title 42.   At a time when liberal mayors across our country are extending mask  mandates on our children in schools, and the American public is still  being forced to mask-up on airplanes, the Biden regime has decided that  protecting the American people from diseases, including but not limited  to COVID, is not a priority if it comes at the expense of their amnesty  and open borders agenda.   Now, it is no coincidence that the Biden regime has decided to drop  title 42, a policy that has been used to prevent communicable diseases  from spreading into the homeland via illegal aliens entering our  southern border.   In fact, more than 2 million illegal aliens have been apprehended at  our southern border since Joe Biden took office, and Border Patrol  agents estimate another 70 percent of these illegal immigrants have not  been apprehended. They call them got-aways. So, in fact, that means  nearly 3.5 million illegal aliens have come across our border on  Biden's watch.   Now, Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate have  condemned canceling title 42. Some have called it dangerous, and others  have called it frightening. I call it an attack on the safety and  security of the American people.   It has been reported that by the time the mid-terms roll around in  November of 2022, nearly 7 million illegal aliens will have crossed the  southern border this year. That is larger than the populations of  Denver, San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Boston, Seattle,  Miami, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Portland, Tampa, and Detroit combined.  Can you imagine?   We have a product here that is working. We have a policy that is  working to deter some people away from the border, but we are going to  take whatever sliver we have that is keeping people out of our country  illegally and do away with it.   Maybe it is to overrun our system, maybe it is to create chaos; 8 to  10 years of backlogs, so then the American people have to accept  amnesty. I am not sure exactly what the plan is, but it certainly is  intentional, and that is what members of the House Freedom Caucus are  here to discuss tonight.   I have with me members from the House Freedom Caucus who are going to  address what has been going on at the southern border. We have been to  the southern border multiple times to see firsthand what is happening-- the invasion that is taking place in our country--unlike the border  czar, who has failed to visit the most dangerous parts of our southern  border. I think she made a trip to El Paso. And then, of course, the  Commander in Chief, who is in command of nothing, he hasn't been there  at all.  [[Page H4392]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the former chairman of the House Freedom  Caucus, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my good friend.    Mr. Biggs, do you believe that the cartels have been  emboldened during Biden's first year as President of the United States?    What about these illegal aliens who are coming through  with the help of the cartel, what do they owe the cartel for getting  into the United States?    Mr. Biggs, you also chair the Border Security Caucus,  and you recently brought in Secretary Mayorkas. Thank you for bringing  him here to the Hill so we could ask some questions.   Now, he was talking about title 42 being a CDC issue, and that is not  really his issue to enforce. That is not his policy to enforce. What is  a policy that he could enforce that would effectively secure our  border?    Thank you. Now, one final question for you here. You  are a businessman. We may have 7 million undocumented workers in our  country by November. What does that mean for our economy?    We have more Members joining us here from the House  Freedom Caucus to talk about title 42. Thank you so much, Congressman  Biggs, for your insight on this. I know that you work really hard in  studying what is going on at the southern border.   I have the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman) here now. Do  you believe that this regime is responsible for signaling to poor and  desperate people that now is the time to take this dangerous journey,  to break our laws, to come into our country, and live under the  freedoms and protections our country provides but not as a citizen?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, absolutely not. The city of Rifle just hit  10,000 for our population. I mean, 18,000 people a day, that right  there exceeds the little city of Rifle, Colorado.   But this is something that we absolutely cannot endure, so I am glad  that we have this time tonight to discuss this.   Representative Good, you have been to the southern border. You have  talked to Border Patrol agents. Can you tell me what you have seen,  what you have heard from Border Patrol agents?    Mr. Speaker, I agree that that absolutely needs to be  brought up in the next Congress.   Now, these appointed Secretaries, they really have turned our Border  Patrol agents into travel agents. They are being shipped all throughout  our country, these illegal immigrants, and every State is now a border  State.   Congressman Good is from Virginia. We have Congressman Ralph Norman  here from South Carolina. I am from Colorado. But someone who has a  front seat view here, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy), this has been  a really hot topic for him, and rightfully so.    Republicans and Democrats from both Houses of Congress have said that  they don't support ending title 42, yet no legislation or action has  been taken to reinstate it. What are your thoughts on that?    Mr. Speaker, we talk about this issue regularly in our  meetings with the House Freedom Caucus, and one question that comes up  regularly is, where is Kamala Harris? Where is the border czar in this?  Are there any plans for her to visit the southern border?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, we are wrapping up here. We have 30  seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the chairman for his final thoughts.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from the House  Freedom Caucus for joining me here on the House floor tonight to  discuss this issue.   I would encourage all Members of Congress--both bodies, the House and  Senate--to talk to a Border Patrol agent. Ask them about the policies  that they need to secure our southern border. I guarantee you, they  won't be telling you they need funding or personnel or even  infrastructure. They  [[Page H4395]]  just need the policy to do their jobs so they can go home feeling like  they have accomplished something and have protected American citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
