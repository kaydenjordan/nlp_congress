 Mr. President, first, I would like to offer a brief word  on some tragic events that occurred in my State over the last few days.   Yesterday, at the University of Texas in Austin, a man wielding a  knife began attacking students on campus. He injured three and  tragically killed another. My prayers are with the entire UT community,  particularly the friends and families of those injured and the student  who lost his life.   This was a senseless act of violence, and it is abhorrent. We don't  yet know the details for why this deranged individual acted the way he  did. Local officials are still gathering details about the case.   I am grateful to the University of Texas police for quickly  apprehending the suspect and stopping further loss of life and injury.  I offer them and the rest of the law enforcement community in Austin,  around the State, and around the Nation my support as they seek justice  and continue to protect, in this instance, one of the State's flagship  institutions of higher learning.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1011         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
