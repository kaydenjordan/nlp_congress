 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Equality  Act.   For far too long our Nation has failed to read and live up to the  words that adorn the front of the United States Supreme Court: Equal  Justice Under Law.   We now have a rare opportunity to explicitly push our Nation to live  up to its founding ideals and make that phrase ring true for all  Americans. No matter who you are or whom you love, under the Equality  Act you will be guaranteed the exact same protections as everybody  else.   LGBTQ individuals should not have to worry when they try to access a  small business loan, seek healthcare, or buy a home.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this historic civil rights  legislation, and I look forward to casting my vote in support of its  passage.                            ____________________
