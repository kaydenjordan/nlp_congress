 Mr. Speaker, while the Judiciary Committee should be  focused on securing the borders and overhauling a very broken  immigration system, they, instead, bring a clown and circus show to  town.   When I looked up yesterday and saw John Dean, it took me back to the  hot summer of 1974, when we saw John Dean and his cohorts on our  television screens for days at a time. In an era with only three  television stations--that is right, Mr. Speaker, we only had three  stations growing up--Mr. Dean was on all three of them for hours at a  time, for days on end.   Bringing another convicted felon, and a biased one at that, a person  who has tweeted 970 times anti-Trump propaganda, to bring this criminal  to these Chambers was yet another embarrassment to the majority party.  All of America realizes the Democratic leadership has dug a deep, deep  hole for itself and, for all practical purposes, has started this  impeachment process and hearings. Nevertheless, in contradiction to  public wishes, it appears the Judiciary chairman will continue to dig a  deeper hole by calling such a slanderous, offensive witness and move  forward with impeachment.    After doing over 38 townhalls across the State of Kansas since  January, everywhere I go, folks tell me the same thing: It is time to  move on.   Mr. Speaker, we have real problems that need to be addressed. My  folks back home are dealing with floods and tornadoes. The farmers  can't get their crops in the field, and China and the European Union  are blocking us from exporting our commodities. All these things are  things we cannot control. We have enough problems without the  Washington swamp adding to our misery.   Folks back home want our border secured. They want a fair,  streamlined immigration system, which helps fill the 70,000 open jobs  we have across the State. From agriculture, to the aircraft industry,  to high-tech jobs, Mr. Speaker, we need more people who are able and  willing to work. And we all know this immigration reform is exactly  what the Judiciary Committee should be taking up as we speak. Instead  of fixing real problems, the Democrat-controlled House just keeps  digging deeper down this false impeachment hole they have initiated.   Mr. Speaker, I want to stop and applaud the President for his most  recent efforts to secure our borders. As we all know, over the course  of less than 2 weeks--record time for diplomacy in this age--the  President was able to leverage potential tariffs into real action by  the Mexican government. That is right, real action with real results.   Thanks to these efforts, Mexico is going to place 6,000 new troops to  control their southern border. Additionally, Mexico has agreed to  shelter, feed, and help those who apply for asylum in this country.  This all matters to Kansans, and we thank the President for his  efforts.   This is huge. How huge is it? Well, I have been to the border, almost  a year ago now, and I know a crisis when I see it. It was a crisis then  and, by all measures, this crisis has literally doubled.  [[Page H4396]]    Every day, on average, we are now apprehending almost 5,000 people  crossing the border illegally. We are housing, feeding, and providing  healthcare to over 40,000 people daily. We literally have run out of  bed space. We now have over 900,000 people waiting for asylum hearings,  of which only 10 percent have a legitimate claim.   Even in the words of the most liberal of newspapers, the New York  Times agrees this is a crisis: ``While lawmakers wring their hands and  drag their feet, tens of thousands of migrant children are suffering.   ``Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that suffering.''   Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that Congress won't do its job, that we  won't secure the border, and that we won't overhaul a broken  immigration system. Instead, the Democrats drive the agenda that  started, for all practical purposes, an agenda that brings in the ghost  of Christmas past, a convicted liar and felon, as their star witness  for impeachment hearings.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to learn lessons about leadership. Leaders  must at times endure criticism and attacks and stay the course. Leaders  keep their word, they demand results, and they hold people accountable.  Leaders keep the ship moving into high headwinds. Leaders think outside  the box. They use the tools given them. They don't make excuses. They  never, never give up. Somehow, they always bring the light back to the  objective, the goal at hand. When others won't lift, they lift the  entire weight. They show the path, they shine the light, and they go  first when others are afraid. Leaders don't repeat the mistakes of  those who went before them over and over again.   Mr. Speaker, great leaders all have their own unique style. One of my  heroes was President General Dwight David Eisenhower, who was a  visionary, able to move pieces around for the D-day invasion, but also  had the vision to see the need for an interstate highway system, a  space program, and civil rights.   Another hero of mine is John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn, the mythical  marshal from the movie ``True Grit,'' who often, when he couldn't get  people to follow, well, I guess I would say, he just ran over them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our President for showing us what true  leadership looks like, and what true grit looks like in real time, in  real life.   Mr. Speaker, we need the President to keep leading.                            ____________________
