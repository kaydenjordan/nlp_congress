 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted  to speak for up to 10 minutes, Senator Murphy for up to 12 minutes, and  Senator Grassley for up to 10 minutes prior to the scheduled vote.    Mr. President, it has now been more than 3 years since the  2018 farm bill, and it is time to start thinking about the next one.  The House Agriculture Committee has already begun holding hearings on  the 2023 farm bill, and I am hoping that the Senate Agriculture  Committee will begin holding hearings soon as well.   Agriculture is the lifeblood of our economy in South Dakota, and  advocating for farmers and ranchers is one of my top priorities here in  the Senate. I am fortunate enough to be a longtime member of the Senate  Agriculture Committee, which gives me an important platform from which  to address the needs of South Dakota ag producers.    During my time in Congress, I have worked on four farm bills, and I  am particularly proud of the nearly 20 measures I was able to get  included in the 2018 farm bill. Among other things, I authored  provisions to improve the Agriculture Risk Coverage Program, improve  the accuracy of the U.S. Drought Monitor, and include soil health as a  research priority at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   I was also able to secure a number of improvements of the  Conservation Reserve Program, including a provision to increase the CRP  acreage cap, increased flexibility for acres enrolled in CRP, and cost  sharing for fencing and water distribution practices on CRP-enrolled  acres.   I also secured approval for a new, short-term alternative to CRP--the  Soil Health and Income Protection Program--to provide an option for  farmers who don't want to take their land out of production for the 10  to 15 years required under the Conservation Reserve Program.   And I was able to secure important provisions to increase the  approval rate of Livestock Indemnity Program applications for death  losses due to weather-related diseases.   I would never have been able to get all this done without the input  of South Dakota farmers and ranchers. These provisions were a direct  result of extensive conversations with South Dakota ag producers that  provided insight into the challenges that they were facing and what  improvements could be made to make things easier in this demanding way  of life.   As I look to the 2023 farm bill, I will once again be relying on  South Dakota farmers and ranchers to lend their firsthand knowledge to  this effort. In fact, last Friday, I held the first of a series of  roundtables I am planning to hold to hear from South Dakota  agricultural producers. Friday's roundtable focused on the commodity  and crop insurance titles of the farm bill, and I was grateful to be  able to hear from representatives of the South Dakota Farm Bureau;  South Dakota corn, soybean, and wheat producers; as well as crop  insurance industry representatives.   I will be holding additional roundtables to cover other farm bill  priorities, including livestock, conservation, and forestry issues.  And, of course, I will continue to rely on the many informal  conversations I have with South Dakota ag producers as I travel around  the State.   There is nothing worse than having ``experts'' in Washington come in  and dictate to the real-world experts: the farmers and ranchers who  spend every day producing the food that feeds our Nation. And my goal  is always to make sure that any farm legislation is directly informed  by farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and around the country. I  already have a list of issues that I am looking to see addressed in the  next farm bill, and I plan to refine that list over the coming months  in my conversations with South Dakota ag producers.   One thing that emerged clearly from Friday's roundtable is the  importance of the farm safety net and the critical role of crop  insurance and commodity programs. Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price  Loss Coverage payments, which help offset losses when prices for  agricultural products drop, are not always proving sufficient,  particularly with our current high inflation, which has sent the price  of inputs like fertilizer soaring.   As I mentioned earlier, I was able to secure improvements to the  Agriculture Risk Coverage Program in the  [[Page S1883]]  2018 farm bill, and I plan to seek further commodity title program  improvements in the 2023 farm bill.   I also want to secure further improvements to the Conservation  Reserve Program. From my conversations with South Dakota ag producers,  it is clear that we need to make changes to ensure that CRP continues  to be an effective option for producers and landowners. In fact, last  week, I introduced the Conservation Reserve Program Improvement Act,  which I will work to get included in the 2023 farm bill.   Among other things, my legislation would make CRP grazing a more  attractive option by providing cost-share payments for all CRP  practices for the establishment of grazing infrastructure, including  fencing and water distribution. And it would increase the annual  payment limit for CRP, which hasn't been changed since 1985, to help  account for inflation and the increase that we have seen in land  values. This would expand the enrollment options available to  landowners to ensure the program effectively serves farmers and  ranchers, as well as conservation goals.    The Conservation Program Improvement Act is the first of multiple  bills I plan to introduce in the runup to the 2023 farm bill to address  the concerns of farmers and ranchers.   The one issue I have been working on extensively over the past year  is the challenges facing livestock producers, particularly cattle  producers. I will work to make sure the farm bill will provide  resources to help them face these challenges.   The life of a farmer and rancher is a challenging one. The work often  starts long before the Sun rises and concludes long after the Sun has  set. The labor can be backbreaking, not to mention the deep uncertainty  that goes along with this existence. There are few other industries so  subject to the whims of the weather, which can wipe out an entire crop  or herd in a very short period of time.   I am profoundly grateful for all those who have chosen and continued  this way of life, often for generations. The food we eat every day  depends upon their work, and our country would not long survive without  them. I am proud to have the honor of representing South Dakota's  farmers and ranchers here in the Senate, and I will continue to work  every day to ensure that their needs are addressed. I look forward to  ensuring that the 2023 farm bill reflects the priorities of South  Dakota farmers and ranchers and farmers and ranchers around our great  country.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Burr).   The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 47, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 125 Ex.]                                  YEAS--52       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--47       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Burr           The nomination was confirmed.   (Mr. KING assumed the Chair.)    Madam President, let me just join my friend and colleague  and neighbor from across the border, Senator Klobuchar, in just  acknowledging the passage of something that is really important and  credit to her staff, who I know worked tirelessly on this, and members  of my staff--in particular Chance Costello--who worked tirelessly  trying to find that common ground and thread the needle to get this  done in a way that would expedite its passage here in the Senate.   As Senator Klobuchar pointed out, the leadership on the Commerce  Committee--Senators Cantwell and Wicker--and their staffs also were  instrumental in helping us get this across the finish line. But as  Senator Klobuchar pointed out, I think this is a good example of how,  if you are willing to keep grinding and keep working at it, you can  come up with solutions that are bipartisan and solutions that really  get at problems that we are facing in this country.   I don't think anybody would argue that we have a supply chain crisis  in America. It has heightened the importance of addressing some of  these shipping challenges; and our legislation, although it may not be  the end-all, certainly takes us a long way toward addressing what have  been identified as many of the problems associated with trying to get  the goods and products through our port system into the United States  and, as importantly, trying to get those products, those things that we  raise and grow and manufacture here in the United States, to their  destinations around the world.   And there have been lots of examples which Senator Klobuchar has  alluded to that she and I and our staffs have, in visiting with  stakeholders out there, people who were impacted by these bottlenecks  that exist today--as we have listened to them, much of that input and  feedback was incorporated into this legislation.   So it does take strong measures to help tackle supply chain  slowdowns, and it does level the playing field for American exporters,  including South Dakota ag producers. It does this in several ways. She  has covered it well, but let me just briefly touch on a couple of  things. It does this by giving the FMC, or the Federal Maritime  Commission, new authorities to crack down on unfair ocean carrier  practices, whether that is a refusal to carry certain cargoes or  discrimination against certain commodities for export.   We have all heard these examples--Senator Klobuchar alluded to this-- of containers leaving the ports in the United States that are empty,  filled with air, or the carriers making determinations based upon the  value of certain products instead of--and then assessing detention and  demurrage fees sometimes on shippers that are unfair and unrelated,  really, to anything that they have done.   So providing the FMC with more tools to quickly resolve detention  disputes, bringing greater efficiency and transparency to a process  that leaves many shippers frustrated--and especially small businesses-- is what this legislation is all about. These improvements, we believe,  are going to bring long-term, positive changes to the maritime supply  chain, which I hope will benefit not only exporters but importers and  consumers alike.   The legislation not only levels the playing field for producers in  South Dakota and across the Nation, but it will also benefit exporters,  small businesses, and, as I said, consumers across this country.   So I hope, as she does, that our colleagues in the House will be able  to take this up and pass it. There has been some good work done there  already, much of it by my colleague in South Dakota, a Member of the  congressional delegation from our State, Dusty Johnson, who has been  the leader on this legislation in the House of Representatives when it  passed earlier this year. And now, we have our chance here in the U.S.  Senate.   And it is a product of a tremendous amount of work. Senator  Klobuchar's staff and my staff spent not weeks but months negotiating-- and, you know, there are always disagreements. There are always  differences. Of course, when you present it to the rest of our  colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee, they have their ideas,  unique ideas, about things that they want to fix and change and make  better. So it went through that process.   But, ultimately, when we brought it up for consideration in front of  the Senate Commerce Committee, there were some amendments that were  offered and voted on. People got a chance to have their voices heard. A  lot of the ideas that people had were incorporated into the base text,  but, ultimately, when it was voted out, it was voted out of the Senate  Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee unanimously. It came  out without a dissenting vote, and that, I think, set us up here on the  floor of the U.S. Senate to process in a way that, again, included a  high level of bipartisanship.   And I credit, too--as we brought it to the floor, there were a couple  of issues we had to again deal with, individual Members who had  concerns--some with the legislation, some with other issues. But as is  always the case here in the U.S. Senate, an individual Senator can  assert their rights in a way that enables them, gives them leverage on  the process; but we were able to work through those things, and that  product today has now passed the U.S. Senate.   Hopefully, if the House is inclined to do so, it would be great if  they would pick it up, pass it, put it on the President's desk, and  have him sign it into law because I think it will take us a long way  down the road toward leveling that playing field and addressing many of  the concerns that have been identified by our exporters.   I know that the farm organizations in my State of South Dakota have  been very active in influencing this, very concerned about the  bottlenecks and their ability to reach export destinations in a way  that allows them to maximize their profitability and, in doing so,  increase the prosperity of people all across the Midwest in States that  we represent where agriculture is the No. 1 industry.   So congrats to those who worked on this, again, to the staff who have  labored, and to my colleague from Minnesota. This is not the first time  we have collaborated on issues. We share not only a border but,  obviously, a lot of commonality in terms of the issues that impact our  States; and this is one  [[Page S1898]]  in particular where I think the farmers, ranchers, small business  people, manufacturers in Minnesota and in South Dakota will all derive  a benefit once it is enacted into law.   We are going to do everything we can now to continue to press  forward. We have gotten it this far. We need to now get some additional  action by the House of Representatives. I am not sure exactly what that  looks like, whether that is going to conference with them. Preferably,  obviously, they pick up and pass this bill, put it on the President's  desk and turn it into law.   I am pleased to be able to be a part of this and to get a result  today.    I would be happy to yield to our colleague and the  chairman of the Senate Ag Committee, who also has big equities in this  discussion.
