 Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn Vladimir  Putin and the Russian Army. These brutal and violent thugs have  attempted to rehang the Iron Curtain for the sole purpose of committing  abject violence against the free and sovereign people of Ukraine. The  killing of women and children outside of Kyiv is a vile act. These acts  amount to war crimes.   It is time to deliver the lethal aid that the Ukrainian people need  to deter the violent acts that the Russian people commit upon  Ukrainians.   It is time to cut off Russian exports to the free world. No country  that values the sanctity of life should want to buy their goods from  Russia. No place, where free people live, should use the energy that  Russian refineries produce be accepted.   The Biden administration must hold the line and impose severe  sanctions against Russia for their multiple murderous acts, and the  people of Ukraine must know that Americans stand with them in their  fight for freedom.                            ____________________
