 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  [[Page H5371]]  call up House Resolution 954 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 954         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4760) to       amend the immigration laws and the homeland security laws,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The amendments printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate, with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Homeland Security; and (2) one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 954 provides for the  consideration of a bill aimed at curbing the flow of illegal  immigration across our southern border by combining a strong border  wall and security measures with targeted modifications to the current  immigration visa process.   The rule provides for one hour of debate on H.R. 4760, the Securing  America's Future Act of 2018, with 40 minutes equally divided and  controlled by the Committee on the Judiciary and 20 minutes controlled  by the Committee on Homeland Security.   The rule provides for the adoption of the Goodlatte amendment  reflecting a number of provisions, which were negotiated with numerous  parties since the bill was first introduced in January of this year.  This amendment will be incorporated into H.R. 4760 upon adoption of the  rule today.   It also includes the McCaul amendment, which makes technical  corrections to the underlying bill.   Further, the rule provides the minority with one motion to recommit  with or without instructions.   The laws and legal agreement currently governing our enforcement  efforts along the southern border are between 20 and 60 years old.  America is a Nation built and continually supported by immigrants.  However, the world has changed and how we accept new immigrants may  adapt as well.   H.R. 4760 begins the process of reforming our immigration system for  the first time in decades, and I encourage the passage of the rule to  consider this important bill.   The Securing America's Future Act refocuses legal immigration for the  skills that our country needs. It also secures our border, strengthens  interior enforcement, and makes changes to the Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals program. The diversity visa lottery program, which  awards 50,000 green cards to a randomly selected pool of applicants, is  eliminated, along with visas for relatives except for spouses and minor  children. Overall, immigration levels are decreased, while visas for  skilled workers are increased and the agricultural guest worker program  is reformed to better meet the needs of our farmers and food  processors.   Construction of a border wall system is authorized, including the use  of additional cameras, sensors, and aviation assets. Recently,  President Trump approved the use of the National Guard along the  border, increasing capacity by over 1,100 personnel and 14 aircraft.  This bill would also authorize the use of the National Guard aviation  and intelligence support. It requires full implementation of the  biometric entry-exit system at all ports of entry and provides for  10,000 border patrol agents and officers.   To strengthen interior enforcement, the bill mandates E-Verify so  that all employers check the immigration status of their employees. It  combats sanctuary city policies by withholding law enforcement grants  and allows the Department of Homeland Security to detain dangerous,  illegal immigrants who cannot be immediately removed from the country.   Many illegal immigrants without legal status claim asylum when  apprehended by border agents. While there are legitimate claims of fear  of persecution, there are also instances of immigrants being coached to  say the correct phrase to obtain asylum. To combat this fraud, the bill  increases the credible fear standard. It also makes being a gang member  a removable offense and qualifies illegal presence as a Federal  misdemeanor.   In 2015, Kate Steinle was killed by an immigrant without status while  walking with her father in San Francisco. The man responsible for her  death had been deported multiple times and should never have been in  the country on that day.   Constituents of the 26th District of Texas experienced a similar  tragedy in 2013 when a young girl in a crosswalk was struck and killed  by someone in the country without legal status.   While the recent enforcement policies along our southern border have  led to a temporary separation of parents and children, a father and a  grandmother in the 26th District of Texas will never be reunited with  their daughter and granddaughter.   Kate's Law enhances criminal penalties for multiple illegal reentry  to help prevent future tragedies. Inclusion of this provision will  reduce the possibility of the tragic killing of American citizens.   Finally, the bill provides for a 3-year renewable legal status for  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival recipients that allows them to  work and travel overseas. This will apply to approximately 700,000  individuals who are currently in the United States. While it was not  the fault of these then-children that they entered the country without  legal documentation, the fact of the matter is that they are here now  and we need a solution.   While I do not support an expedited path to citizenship, I do support  allowing them to get in line and apply just like any other law-abiding  potential immigrant. The bill does not allow for a special path to  citizenship. However, it does allow the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrival recipient to obtain a green card and apply for citizenship like  any other law-abiding applicant.   Recently, we have heard a lot about the enforcement policies along  the southern border. Mr. Speaker, this crisis is not new. In 2014, the  number of unaccompanied alien children increased exponentially and  reached crisis levels. It remained steadily above 400,000 apprehensions  from 2013 until the present.    During a visit by the Honduran First Lady in 2014, she was asked if  Honduras wanted their children back, and without hesitation, she  responded that they did. So a planeload of women and children was sent  back to Honduras that resulted in an immediate reduction in the  attempted crossings of unaccompanied alien children. However, because  there was no follow-on enforcement actions, the numbers again began to  increase, reaching above 563,000 in 2016.   In the lead-up to the 2010 election, the numbers increased, because  then-candidate Trump spoke about securing our border with a wall that  would finally end the possibility of illegal entry along our southern  border. When candidate Trump became President-elect Trump, this number  dramatically decreased because potential immigrants believed that  construction of the border wall was imminent.   As a Member of Congress representing a border State, I have  maintained regular contact with Customs and Border Protection and the  Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. What we heard during  this period, 2016, was that immigrants crossing the border illegally  wanted to get into the country before the possibility of a Trump  election occurred and could direct construction of the border wall.  They were under the impression that if  [[Page H5372]]  you crossed our border, at a point of entry or illegally, you would be  granted amnesty and welcomed into the country. While we do welcome  legal immigrants, this perception led to only more vulnerable children  being entrusted by parents to human traffickers, typically for large  sums of money, to bring their children to the United States.   On this journey, children could experience harsh conditions. Some  were abused physically, sexually, and emotionally. And this abuse is  not a threat just from the adults that are supposed to care for them,  but also it can occur from their fellow travelers. A lot of these kids  are just trying to survive, trying to make it to a life where they may  one day thrive, but this existence is often all they have known, and  they react in a way that reflects this reality.   While there is a concern about children arriving with parents who are  then prosecuted for illegal entry and subsequently placed in the  custody of the Health and Human Services Office of Refugee  Resettlement, numerous children never get to make this journey with  their parents or even relatives. Many adults are now bringing  nonrelated children with them in an attempt to be released into the  United States because of their association with a child that cannot,  because of the Flores Agreement from 1997, be held in custody.   When the influx of unaccompanied alien children began exceeding the  capacity of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, I traveled to the  border area specifically to visit these facilities. I engaged with the  Office of Refugee Resettlement to fully understand the care that these  children were receiving in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The Office of Refugee  Resettlement responded to my concerns about threats of communicable  diseases from foreign countries being brought to our homeland. Mr.  Speaker, there was not even a physician employed in the Office of  Refugee Resettlement in 2014 before I raised this issue.   The issue became a concern because there were members of Customs and  Border Control that actually felt that they were perhaps developing a  condition as a result of contact with people because of a skin parasite  that was easily communicated. And the question arose, could other  diseases be communicated as well? And people were rightfully concerned  about that. It is not just an illness like scabies; it is an issue like  multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis that people were most concerned  about.   While treatment in facilities has vastly improved in the last couple  of years, the path by which immigrants come here is still dangerous. On  one of my visits near the border at McAllen, Texas, I traveled with  border patrol agents along a cactus-strewn, dusty road, mesquite bushes  growing in from the sides. They brought a bus down there, a big bus.  They stopped, they flashed their lights, they honked their horn, and  the bus filled up with people. The bus went off to town, bouncing  across this dusty road, and I remained back with the Customs and Border  Patrol.   Then a State agent came up, someone from Fish and Wildlife, and said:  I need help. I have got people over here that I think belong in your  jurisdiction because you are the Federal Government.   And Customs and Border Patrol went over to the area that he had  pointed out, and here were a number of women, small children, and  teenage boys. They had come across the river, delivered by traffickers,  just literally on the other side of the river, and dropped there. They  had no idea what was the direction to town. They were not equipped to  travel in the harsh conditions. It was probably 110 degrees outside  that day. Small children, children, babes in arms, probably 1 year of  age or less: this is what the traffickers left on the side of the  river.   Had the Fish and Wildlife Service not come by and the U.S. Customs  and Border Patrol not come by, I don't know how these people would have  made it to town. And it is quite possible they would not have made it  safely.   So the situation along the southern border is not just a border  crisis, it is also an immigration crisis. Attorney General Sessions  announced a zero-tolerance policy to finally and fully enforce our  laws. I believe he did this so that Americans and immigrants alike  would recognize and remember that we are a Nation of laws, and also to  demonstrate that the dangerous journey to our southern border is  sometimes not worth the risk and the struggle required to make it  within just a few miles of a fence.   The ebb and flow of border crossings has consistently reflected the  rhetoric of American leadership and perception of enforcement of our  laws. The rate of border crossings rapidly increased in the last year  because there has been no significant visible action by the Congress to  President Trump's request for a border wall. However, this is not the  only factor.   It is no secret that countries in what are called the northern  triangle, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, are some of the most  dangerous countries in the world. Yet, these countries receive millions  of dollars of aid each year for economic development, for military  financing, and security initiatives.                                time  1045    This funding rapidly increased to more than $600 million each year  beginning in fiscal year 2014, mostly in response to the growing crisis  with unaccompanied alien children. So I think it is appropriate to ask  ourselves, is the funding being allocated in a way that will help  improve domestic conditions on the ground and reduce the desire to  leave?   To address this concern, I introduced the Unaccompanied Alien  Children Assistance Control Act, and I offered this bill as an  amendment to H.R. 4760. Simply put, this bill would reduce foreign aid  allocations to Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala by $15,000  per child to each country if their child crosses the border illegally  or if they are referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement for  custody and care.   While this may not seem like a lot, the reality is that each child  cared for by the Office of Refugee Resettlement costs the American  taxpayer about $35,000. Even Attorney General Sessions has stated that  the care these children receive is better than the average American  child.   While we cannot leave children without care, we must recognize that  prioritizing alien children over our own sends the wrong message.  Removing that $15,000 of foreign aid per child will send a message to  Mexican and Northern Triangle leaders that our accepting their children  will not be without cost to them.   As we all know, Mr. Speaker, if you want to make it important, it has  to be about the money.   Unfortunately, the accountability in these countries is poor, and the  use of funds largely goes unchecked. They rely on American aid, and we  must ensure that it is being used appropriately and wisely to combat  the forces that are driving their future generations--it is their  future--away from their own countries.   By withholding funding in the face of rampant corruption, we not only  provide a potential funding stream for President Trump's proposed  border system, but we send a signal that we will not willingly deprive  the children and desperate immigrants of the life they desire and need  in their countries of origin.   The best place for a child and a family is their home. Because of the  condition in the Northern Triangle countries, home for many children is  now a stark facility along a foreign border.   It is time to take steps that would not only strengthen our  immigration laws for the security of American citizens, but is in the  interest of restoring and maintaining the home from which many would-be  immigrants try to escape.   Congress has not successfully reformed our immigration laws in  decades. It is time to begin that debate to align our immigration  system with current realities. For this reason, I encourage the  adoption of the rule to begin consideration of H.R. 4760, Securing  America's Future Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, this is not a crisis of President Trump's making. Those  of us who served here during the Bush administration were aware that  this was a problem. Certainly, those of us who served during the Obama  administration were aware that this was a problem.   When President Obama declared the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals in 2012, it was immediately followed, 2 years later, by the  wave of unaccompanied alien children who came to our southern border.  This crisis has been a long time in the making. Congress does need to  solve this problem. The President is quite correct in that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I would just point out that, under current conditions,  current laws, the United States of America takes in 1.1 million new  citizens every year. We are the most generous country on the face of  the Earth. American citizens should be rightly proud of that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I just remind people in this body that 10 years ago the  Democrats were in the majority. Indeed, then in the 2008 election that  occurred 10 years ago, they strengthened that majority. House  Republican Members were so far in the minority as to be irrelevant in  all exchanges.   There was a 60-vote majority over in the Senate. You may recall that  is where the Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank and other pieces of  legislation that I would have thought would never pass actually did  pass in that environment.   A question that I hear a lot is: Why didn't Democrats do something  about the Dreamer problem when they controlled all the levers of power?  And it is a valid question.   Senator Durbin had a bill, as you will recall, in that next session  of Congress that began in January of 2009. Senator Durbin had a bill to  deal with the Dreamer situation, and he worked on it all year. It never  came up until December of 2010.   Now, you remember in November of 2010, actually, the majority changed  in the House of Representatives and there were enough Republicans  elected that the Democrats would not be in the majority the next year.   So here we are in a so-called lame duck session of a party that is  exiting power, and I think it was December 8 of that year that, in the  House, the Democrats brought Senator Durbin's bill up and passed it on  the House floor, as would be expected. They did have a significant  majority.   They lost one vote over in the Senate, as I recall, and had 59  Democrats. Speaker Pelosi told me at a Rules Committee hearing several  months ago that it was then that the Republicans blocked that vote from  happening in the Senate.   But that is not exactly true.   Three Republicans voted with the Democrats on the Durbin bill. Five  Democrats voted in the negative, and that is what killed the Durbin  bill when the Democrats controlled all levers of power in 2010, the  last time they did.   Mr. Speaker, don't blame this problem on President Trump. It has been  in existence for some time, but it is up to us to solve it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee and the author of H.R. 4760.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk to you about a story of separation, a  father and daughter who have been separated. Chris, my constituent,  came to me with this story several years ago.   He served his country in Iraq. While he was serving his country in  Iraq, his wife developed cancer and died. Chris returned home to be a  single dad to his daughter.   His daughter went out with friends one night and was struck and  killed by an automobile--an automobile driven by someone who was in the  country without the benefit of citizenship.   Chris comes to my townhalls and asks me: While I was serving my  country, you were supposed to be enforcing the laws on the border.  Because you did not do your job, I am now separated from my daughter in  perpetuity.   H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act of 2018, is the product  of months of work by Chairman Goodlatte, Chairman McCaul, and other  stakeholders. This is an answer to our persistent problems with our  immigration system that so many Members of this body have been talking  about for years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's rule and move  the debate forward on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding House Resolution 949, during consideration of H.R. 6  pursuant to such resolution, general debate shall not exceed 1 hour,  with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member on the Committee on Energy and Commerce and 20 minutes  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Ways and Means.
