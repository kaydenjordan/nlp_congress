 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas for yielding.   I recognize my friend, Representative Jodey Arrington, as exactly the  type of American that our Founding Fathers envisioned serving within  the House of we the people.   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to highlight the importance of  American agriculture and the spirit of the American farmer. Being  raised on a horse ranch, I learned at an early age the value of work  and that rural America wasn't just a place, but a way of life.   Now my wife and I live in a 1,000-square-foot, 65-year-old, wood- frame home in the middle of farm country in south Louisiana. We have  nine pecan trees, two magnolia trees, and two bushes with flowers on  them. I am not sure what they are, but I know she knows. She enjoys  them. They bloom once a year.   Other than that, it is just an honor to represent my district, which  is deeply agriculturally centered: farmers, ranchers, fishermen, oil  and gas workers, petrochemical workers. They are salt-of-the-earth  folks who know what it is to earn a living. They understand sweat. They  understand labor. In representing my district in Louisiana, these are  the industries that stand up our rural communities. They are the  backbone of our economy.   My district is home to the heart of sugarcane for the entire country.  Cane farmers in south Louisiana account for about 20 percent of all  sugar production in the United States.   My district is also home to the rice capital of America. Crowley,  Louisiana, right in the heart of Cajun country, is home to more rice  mills than anywhere else in our Nation.   Those two crops, alone, account for billions of dollars in economic  output every year and employ tens of thousands of hardworking  Americans.   Given a level playing field and opportunities to compete on a global  scale, American farmers will always win.                                time  1800    That is why we are working to put American farmers first to open new  [[Page H6284]]  markets, expand American exports, and create jobs in our communities.  We are rolling back regulations that slow growth, stifle innovation,  and restrict the agricultural industry's access to the resources and  manpower it needs to thrive.   We have made great strides this year to help our farmers, and we will  continue to do so. Just last week, a groundbreaking rice export  agreement with China, the world's largest rice consumer, was announced.  This opens a massive new market to United States rice farmers.   These are the type of landmark policy victories that elevate American  farmers and bring economic growth to our rural communities. I am  committed to an America First agriculture policy where American farmers  compete and win. Agriculture is a critical industry that bolsters  economic growth and ensures American independence and national  security.   In my home State, we understand that our economy is run on the sweat  of hardworking American patriots.   As Congress moves forward, I will continue to work tirelessly with my  colleagues on behalf of our farmers and producers to provide  Louisiana's agricultural industry with critically needed support. I am  proud to represent a district so strongly rooted in the spirit of rural  America, and I am honored to stand with my colleagues today in loud and  vocal support for the Americans who we serve in rural America.
