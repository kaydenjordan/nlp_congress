 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the title X CRA. It  is just a continued abuse of power, something we have never seen in  this body--one after another, after another, along party-line votes--to  overturn rules and overturn decisions that this government has made. It  is disgraceful that this body is debating yet another effort that will  threaten a woman's right to healthcare.   Title X ensures that women across the country have access to  affordable healthcare, including family planning at clinics that are  convenient and affordable. These are a vital resource for preventive  care and for primary care.   Overturning this rule will allow States to discriminate against  providers, allow States to pick and choose and potentially put  thousands of healthcare centers out of business. We know that because  we have seen this kind of activity in some State legislatures. These  clinics are often the only places women and men have to turn to for  basic health services.   Why do this in the same week that the House, fortunately, failed to  throw 20 million people off of health insurance and throw off 200,000  Ohioans who are getting opioid addiction treatment and who have  insurance because of the Affordable Care Act? The House did not do  that, but now the Senate wants to do this? Again, it compromises  people's healthcare, as it takes away, in some cases, their insurance  and, in other cases, their clinics and health services they cannot get  elsewhere.   Some 6 in 10 women who turn to title X for visits to family planning  health centers say it is their regular source of healthcare. Many of  them have nowhere else to turn. They either cannot afford healthcare  elsewhere or they live too far away from another health center for  there to be meaningful access to basic healthcare.   Let's be clear. This is not about defunding abortion, clearly. The  Federal Government does not provide funding for abortions. I will say  that again. The Federal Government does not provide funding for  abortions, period. I support a woman's right to make a personal,  private healthcare decision for herself and with her doctor. No matter  your personal feelings about abortion, whether you call yourself pro- choice or pro-life or something else, surely, we can agree that cancer  screenings and programs that have helped bring down Ohio's teen  pregnancy and STD rates are a good thing. Cutting these services will  have a real and serious impact on women and families across Ohio.   If these actions by men--and it is, overwhelmingly, by men in  Washington--whose healthcare is paid for by taxpayers continue to chip  away at women's healthcare access, we will see more undiagnosed  cancers, more untreated illnesses, and more unintended pregnancies.   I emphasize again that these are mostly men in this body, or men down  the hall in the other body, who are voting--men with insurance that is  paid for by taxpayers. Their insurance is subsidized by tax dollars.  Last week, down the hall, they voted to take away healthcare--in this  case, mostly for women but also for men--for people who are getting  opioid treatment.   In case after case, privileged Members of this body, who get  insurance paid for by taxpayers, take healthcare services away from,  literally, millions of Americans. It is shameful. It is morally  questionable. It is something we, simply, should not do.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Melissa  Rubenstein, a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of this Congress.
