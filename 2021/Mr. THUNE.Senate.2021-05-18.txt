 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Ronald Reagan once said that the nine most  terrifying words in the English language are ``I'm from the government,  and I'm here to help.''  [[Page S2556]]    He was partially joking, of course, but what he was getting at is  that government is not always the solution, and the government can  sometimes do more harm than good, and we are definitely seeing some  evidence of that right now.   On May 7, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April jobs  report. With businesses desperate to hire and vaccinations increasing  daily, the report was expected to be big, with a good chance that a  million or more workers would be hired.   But that is not what happened. Just 266,000 workers were hired,  despite the fact that there were 8.1 million job openings as of the end  of March, and the unemployment rate ticked up.   That is right. Despite the fact that businesses are desperate to hire  workers, the unemployment rate actually increased, and it turns out  that we don't have to look far for one of the reasons--Democrats'  massive, partisan spending bill, which, among others things, extended  the expanded unemployment benefits to September of this year, to the  point where many workers are making more staying home than they would  be going back to work.   Increasing unemployment benefits was the right thing to do early in  the pandemic. Businesses were closed, workers were being forced to say  home, and the landscape was bleak. But even last year it became clear  that our economy was starting to rebound.   That didn't mean it was time to eliminate all government help, but it  did mean that we needed to calibrate the help to actual need.   But Democrats consistently rejected that line of thinking, and  despite the fact that we had passed our fifth bipartisan COVID relief  bill in December--bringing the total amount of COVID funding the  Federal Government had provided to $4 trillion--weeks later, Democrats  announced that we needed another massive COVID relief bill.   Republicans tried to suggest that maybe we should keep it carefully  targeted to meet remaining needs without wasting taxpayer dollars or  running the risk of overstimulating the economy and driving up  inflation, but Democrats were having none of that. This was urgently  needed funding, we were told. America needed a massive rescue plan to  save us from the virus, and Democrats were going to make it happen.   Well, as it turns out, that massive rescue package was too massive.  Democrats insisted on extending increased unemployment benefits to  September of this year, and now we are seeing the result.   Reports suggest that many people are declining to return to work  because they can make more money staying home and drawing unemployment  benefits. That is right. Jobs are available--the number of job openings  is very high--but thanks to Democrats' long-term extension of increased  unemployment benefits, some workers are staying on the sidelines.   It is not surprising. If individuals can make as much or more sitting  at home instead of working, it is not very shocking that many would  choose not to work.   The long-term increase in unemployment benefits is not, of course,  the only factor keeping people from returning to the workforce, but it  is clear that it is one substantial reason why businesses are  struggling to find workers.   In the wake of April's dismal jobs report, Democrats, of course, were  quick to discredit or downplay any association between increased  unemployment benefits and the reluctance of some workers to come off  the sidelines.   The President's Treasury Secretary suggested that a significant  reason for not returning to work was the fact that schools have not  fully reopened. Well, that is definitely another factor, and it is a  problem Democrats could have addressed wit their March COVID  legislation.    Democrats directed tens of billions of additional dollars to schools  in their legislation, most of which will be used long after the  pandemic is over.   Republicans repeatedly urged Democrats to tie this funding to school  reopening, but the teachers unions were not too interested in returning  to school, and Democrats have made it very clear that unions' wish is  Democrats' command.   And so Democrats gave schools billions of additional dollars to  respond to COVID, without actually requiring schools to follow the  science and reopen.   And so, yes, many parents are struggling with returning to work  because their kids are still not fully back to in-person learning, and  it is too bad that Democrats were more committed to satisfying the  teachers unions than getting kids back to the classroom.   Before Democrats passed their COVID bill, there were concerns that  the size of it could end up overstimulating the economy and thus  driving up inflation. Even some liberal economists sounded the alarm  over the size of Democrats' coronavirus legislation. But, again,  Democrats were not about to listen to any calls to reduce the size of  their massive spending bill.   And while the full results of Democrats' spending spree have yet to  be seen, there are already signs that inflation may be becoming a  problem.   Consumers are seeing increases--in some cases, steep increases--in  the price of everything from groceries to used cars, to trucks.   There is no question that government had a significant role to play  in responding to the COVID crisis. That is why a Republican-led Senate  passed five--five--COVID relief bills, totaling $4 trillion, and why we  supported everything from increased unemployment benefits to forgivable  loans to help small businesses weather the virus.   But as the crisis wanes, so should the role of government. American  workers are no longer being forced to stay home while businesses close  their doors. Our economy is back up and running, and businesses are  desperate for workers.   We should be doing everything that we can to get Americans back to  work, and Democrats' $1.9 trillion boondoggle isn't helping us with  that goal.   A Democratic operative famously said: ``Never let a serious crisis go  to waste.'' And as our economy has recovered, a lot of Democrats have  seemed very unwilling to let go of the pandemic. I don't know if that  is because Democrats want to take credit for getting our Nation out of  this, even though all the essential groundwork for our massive  vaccination campaign and our economic recovery was laid in the previous  administration or if it is because Democrats think that the COVID  crisis will provide them with the cover they need to permanently  increase government spending and government intervention on a massive  scale. But whatever their motivation, the fact is that Democrats need  to realize that it is time--it is time to get government out of the way  of the recovery, and that should start with increasing, not decreasing,  incentives for Americans to get back to work.   As we are seeing right now, sometimes throwing government money at a  situation can do more harm than good.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
