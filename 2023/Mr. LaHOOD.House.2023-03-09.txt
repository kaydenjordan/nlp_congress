 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri for yielding  and for his leadership on the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 27, providing for  congressional disapproval of the Army Corps of Engineers' and the EPA's  rule expanding the definition of waters of the United States.   This rule is one of the latest examples of regulatory overreach that  the Biden administration has chosen to pursue, ignoring Congress' role  in making policy decisions and vastly increasing Federal authority over  private lands.   Expanding the WOTUS definition creates harmful uncertainty and  increased administrative burdens for many parts of our economy,  especially our farmers and agriculture sector.   On top of having to endure the effects of high inflation, supply  chain disruptions, and labor shortages, farmers in my district and  across the country now have to invest more time and money on compliance  costs to protect themselves against potentially crippling legal  penalties.   Between President Biden's attempts to repeal stepped-up basis, the  SEC's onerous ESG proposal, and now this WOTUS rule issued by the Army  Corps of Engineers and EPA, it is clear that family farms and small  businesses are not being prioritized or heard by this administration.    Mr. Speaker, as the Representative of one of the largest  corn- and soybean-producing districts in the country, I understand the  importance our farmers have in feeding our Nation and the world. Our  farm economy is the lifeblood of rural communities, and this resolution  is a necessary first step in supporting our farmers and small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution.
