 Madam Speaker, usually it is easy to identify the  endgame for bad policy.   Those who want open borders are looking for more votes. Those who  support things like the Green New Deal want to eliminate fossil fuels  and American energy strength along with it.   But here is the endgame for the Equality Act, or H.R. 5. It would  flip our moral, social, legal, and religious fabric of this Nation  upside down.   By erasing the recognition of gender from Federal law, the  traditional family, laws, religious beliefs, morality and/or identity  gets erased with it.   Madam Speaker, every man and woman in this body are special, and they  should vote ``no'' on H.R. 5.                            ____________________
