 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the  tremendous impact forests have on our rural economies and natural  environment nationwide. Next week is National Forest Products Week.   In Arkansas, we know that growing and sustaining jobs in forest  communities begins with ensuring that working forests continue to  thrive. Most working forests--over 70 percent--are privately owned by  families, small and large businesses, and an increasingly broad array  of Americans who invest in forest ownership.   When forest owners have confidence in their ability to manage and  sell their timber productively, they will continue to grow and invest  in forests and provide the foundation for the rest of the forest  products supply chain. Federal policies have a significant impact on  the long-term economic and environmental benefits we derive from these  working forests and the livelihoods of those who own and manage them.   The forest products industry represents a key economic driver for  rural economies nationwide, totaling nearly $92.8 billion in GDP. In my  home State of Arkansas, environmentally friendly forestry-related  businesses support more than 62,000 jobs, with more than $2.4 billion  in annual payroll.   A strong marketplace for forest products helps keep rural America  employed and U.S. forests robust. These healthy forests, in turn,  provide crucial habitat for species, filter America's drinking water,  sequester carbon, and provide outdoor recreation opportunities for the  public.                            ____________________
