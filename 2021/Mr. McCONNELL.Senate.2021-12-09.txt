 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, the Capitol is once again  hosting a hallowed tradition. The U.S. Congress just solemnly welcomed  our  [[Page S9055]]  late friend and colleague, Leader Robert J. Dole, one final time. This  most distinguished soldier-statesman now lies in state at the epicenter  of our democracy. Our Nation has bestowed this honor only 33 times in  its history--to Presidents, to Senators and Representatives, to heroes  of war.   With today's ceremony, Bob's path aligned one last time with his Army  hospital buddy's, turned longtime fellow Senator, Danny Inouye. It was  amazing enough that Bob's and Danny's paths converged all the way from  bedside bridge games in the 1940s to votes on this floor into the  1990s, but now they have both rested on the exact same catafalque that  has held up our great statesmen, dating back to President Lincoln.   Bob Dole earned these honors many, many times over--through a heroic  fight that began on Hill 913 and left lifelong scars, through  accomplished service at both ends of this building, and in a bid for  even higher office, conducted with integrity and grace.   Bob Dole left this Chamber a quarter of a century ago, but service to  his beloved Kansas and his fellow Americans remained the focus of his  life until the moment he was called home on Sunday.   The sting of losing our friend is still fresh, but we are proud to  celebrate this extraordinary American--now draped in the colors to  which his entire life was dedicated and already at home in eternal  rest.                            Build Back Better Act    Now, Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, on Tuesday, I  shined a spotlight on Washington Democrats' proposed toddler takeover.  They want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in order to upend  families' arrangements, create massive inflation in daycare costs, and  attack faith-based providers.   Now, Democrats say their plan would not hurt faith-based providers  because it wouldn't explicitly block them up front. Ah, but that is  only a small part of the story. The reckless taxing-and-spending spree  might not ban faith-based providers on day 1, but their scheme of  mandates and subsidies would slowly and quietly push them out.   The Democrats' bill would deny religious providers an extra funding  stream for upgrading their facilities, which their secular competitors  would actually get, and their proposal would let woke bureaucrats  persecute faith-based groups unless they leave their values at the  door. If a Jewish daycare wants to prioritize Jewish families, they  could get thrown out of the Democrats' scheme for engaging in  discrimination. A Catholic facility could be kicked out if families who  are registered parishioners get first dibs. If a faith-based provider  decides not to hire somebody who fundamentally rejects their teachings,  leftwing bureaucrats and lawyers would come after them as well. The  woke mob that stalks cake bakers and florists is now coming for church  daycare.   Twenty-one organizations, representing hundreds of thousands of  faith-based daycares and preschools, signed an open letter to the  Senate. Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Muslims all wrote to  Chairwoman Murray and Senator Burr.   Here is what they said:         The Build Back Better Act will suppress, if not exclude,       the participation of many faith-based providers. . . .       [P]rovisions in the bill text make it virtually impossible       for many religious providers to participate.    Let me say that again:         [P]rovisions in the bill text make it virtually impossible       for many religious providers to participate.    Now, the far left says that if you don't support the toddler  takeover, you are somehow out of touch, but they are projecting, as it  is their Big Government scheme that is out of touch with the diverse  aspirations of different families.   Last year, a nonpartisan survey asked families what childcare  arrangements they would ideally like. Apart from the pandemic, if  finances were no obstacle, what would American parents want? The share  who said ``center-based childcare'' was 27 percent. This is the only  route that Democrats want to subsidize--center-based childcare. Just 27  percent of parents say that is their ideal world, and of that 27  percent, a majority prefer the faith-based options that Democrats would  push out.   Now, a larger group, nearly 40 percent, said their ideal arrangement  would involve full-time parenting in some form, either one parent stays  home or the two trade off. Another 9 percent said they would ideally  like an extended relative like a grandparent to be the caregiver. Other  families would ideally want a nanny share or a neighborhood co-op.   The Democrats' daycare scheme would give all these people nothing-- nothing. A family that has sacrificed so much so that a mom or dad can  stay home will not get one penny for books or supplies or make up for  lost wages. A grandparent who leaves a part-time job to spend weekdays  with their grandkids will not get a dime under the Democrats' plan. A  neighborhood nanny share gets zero help.   Forget about diversity. Forget about choice and fairness. Families  would either enroll in a specific pathway that Big Labor and Big  Government like best or they get nothing. Meanwhile, even in the  centers that Democrats do want to subsidize, parents would get a very  mixed bag.   Analysts agree the new regulations would send costs skyrocketing. The  District of Columbia's local government estimates that these sorts of  policies would increase the cost of daycare by roughly $12,000 per  child per year. Their plan would supposedly use government subsidies to  make up this new inflation, but that assistance would be confusing and  uneven.   So this bill manages to be wildly inflationary and wildly unfair at  the same time. That is pretty hard to pull off--wildly unfair and  wildly inflationary at the same time. It insults the diversity of  American families and their aspirations. It simply hands money and  power to the same woke bureaucrats who are letting far-left propaganda  into K-12 schools and then sending the Department of Justice after  parents who speak up.   This bill would give HHS Secretary Becerra, a hard-core culture  warrior, a giant slush fund to start shaping the care of babies and  toddlers. And facilities and families who make different choices would  be left facing a massively inflated market with zero help.   This would be an awful--awful--proposal for American families, even  if it were free. But, of course, it isn't.   Washington Democrats don't just have to explain to parents why they  want to make childcare more expensive, more inflexible, and more  unfair; they also get to explain why they want to print and borrow  hundreds of billions of dollars to do it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
