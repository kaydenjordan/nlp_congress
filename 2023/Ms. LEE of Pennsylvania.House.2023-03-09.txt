 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all  [[Page H1236]]  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to submit extraneous material into the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus to convene this Special Order hour  today to discuss the growing threats and harms that we have seen from  our rightwing judiciary.   From student loan debt to reproductive justice and rights, millions  of Americans have found their rights stripped or their prosperity or  their interests impeded.   Indeed, I stand here today on behalf of the more than 40 million  working- and middle-class Americans eligible for relief under President  Biden's student debt cancellation plan, who might never see that relief  because a Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority chose to take up  a politically motivated lawsuit brought by a network of rightwing  billionaires.   To the 1.7 million Pennsylvanians afraid that SCOTUS could rip up  your debt relief, I feel your pain.   As a Black woman and a first-generation college student, and a Pell  grant recipient that is still in a mountain of student debt myself, I  am right there with you--angry and exhausted by a system that is  failing us miserably.   Like you, every single decision I make is shaped by the obscene  amount of student debt I carry because I had the audacity to pursue a  higher education--as the daughter of a working-class single mom from  the Mon Valley, indeed.   Millions of folks can't start their lives because of the suffocating  burden of their student loan debt; and yet in 2023, only 44 out of the  435 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives carry any student loan  debt.   While I hope there are more of us with that lived expertise, I want  the rest of my colleagues to hear about the people closest to the pain,  like my sister Representative Ayanna Pressley would say.   For poor and working-class folks, crushing student debt is preventing  us from buying homes, for saving for retirement, starting businesses,  starting families, and building generational wealth.   For all Black college graduates who owe an average of $25,000 more in  student loan debt, and for all Black women who carry the highest  student debt burdens, it is an even greater barrier.   It is an economic crisis for all poor and working-class folks, and  Black and Brown folks are getting hit the hardest.   In western Pennsylvania, the student debt crisis is a regional crisis  holding our future hostage by preventing students and workers from  accessing the training they need for our region to become the  innovation hub and leader in STEM that hundreds of thousands of good- paying jobs depend on right now.   Under President Biden's plan, one in four Black borrowers will see  their debt fully eliminated, and nearly half of all Latino borrowers  will be entirely debt free.   This is our best shot at addressing the systemic inequities that have  forced communities of color to take on higher debt for the chance at a  college degree.   On the day the Supreme Court began hearing the case that could rip  away relief from this crisis, I met with a group of student organizers  from western Pennsylvania on the frontlines of this fight.   Those students who camped out overnight in front of the Supreme Court  in the rain to have their voices heard told me what student debt relief  would mean to them. They asked me what insight I had in my first 2  months in Congress. I told them these problems are systemic, systemic  both in who is behind these attacks and who they hurt the most.   My community will be punished for getting an education for the same  reason half of this country doesn't have the freedom to control our  bodies and our futures, and the same reason a Federal judge in Texas is  expected to outlaw abortion pills.   It is the same reason that corporations are allowed to spend  unlimited amounts of money on elections and the same reason corporate  PACs are able to come in and blow Black women out of the water when we  run for office.   It is because an unelected rightwing Republican-appointed judiciary  is waging a full-on assault on our freedoms.   Those folks whose forebearers were enslaved are the folks who today  are shackled by tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of  dollars in student loan debt.   It is those who are denied access to adequate maternal healthcare by  the wealthiest country on Earth that are subjected to forced birth. It  is those whose loved ones fled violence for a better life but are  separated from their children and locked up at the border.   The most marginalized folks bear the brunt of the reactionary  rightwing judiciary's attacks--Black folks, Brown folks, trans folks,  poor folks, and otherwise marginalized folks.   Our communities deserve leaders who will fight back as hard as the  organizers back home fight every single day; leaders who carry student  debt, who have depended on food stamps, leaders who lack access to  reproductive healthcare on Medicaid, who went to public schools that  were divested, who lived with poor air quality because of unregulated  industry. We deserve those sorts of leaders in office to tackle these  issues.   That is why I was sent to Congress.   Now I will yield to my colleagues with the lived expertise to fight  for you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Pressley.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing us to  address the floor this evening, and thank you to the Congressional  Progressive Caucus for holding this Special Order hour.   I rise today on behalf of the millions of Americans whose student  loan debt balances are at risk of escalating due to the rightwing  reactionary judiciary.   Hundreds of borrowers from across the country gathered in front of  the Supreme Court on February 28 to express their discontentment. West  Palm Beach resident Kayla shared: I think President Biden's loan  forgiveness plan is a good thing for college students who don't have  funds to pay for college. Indeed, this is a good thing.   One important aspect of the debt relief program is that it addresses  the unequal burden that student debt has placed on borrowers of color.                                time  1745    Mr. Speaker, 40.2 percent of White undergraduate students use student  loan debt to pay for their school, while 50 percent of Black students  use student loan debt. In addition, approximately 72 percent of Latinx  students take on debt.   By providing up to $20,000 in debt relief to borrowers that received  a Pell Grant, President Biden's plan would allow one in four Black  borrowers to see their debt fully eliminated, and nearly half of all  Latinx borrowers to be entirely debt free.   This is so important because Black and Brown college graduates owe an  average of $25,000 more in student loan debt than their White  counterparts.   Furthermore, Black bachelor's degree holders have an average of  $52,000 in student loan debt. Over 50 percent of Black student  borrowers report that their net worth is less than they owe in student  loan debt.   The disparity between the amount owed by Black and White borrowers  quadruples 12 years after graduation. Four years after earning their  degrees, 48 percent of Black students owe an average of 12.5 percent  more than what they borrowed. After that same time period, 83 percent  of White students owe 12 percent less than what they borrowed.   In addition, women hold nearly two-thirds of outstanding debt in this  country. Black women carry the highest student loan debt burden of any  race or ethnicity.   We must address the unequal burden that student loan debt has had on  borrowers of color. I ask the majority of the Supreme Court to turn  against the right-wing, reactionary agenda and to deliver for the 40  million people in June.   We rely on our education systems. Education and higher education is  one of the pivotal equitable points that we have in this country. We  must protect it for everyone.   The destiny of our country is dependent on everyone being able to  matriculate through school, pursue their education, and give back to  this country that we love so much.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for holding this Special Order  hour. To the Congressional Progressive Black Caucus, and the anchor,  the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Lee), it is an honor to be here  this evening to speak on behalf of the student loan borrowers. But it  is also a special honor to be here tonight with my Howard University  alumna.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues with the  Congressional Progressive Caucus for raising up the danger of the far- right court.   I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. McGarvey), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman McGarvey,  particularly for lifting up and saying the name of Breonna Taylor here  in this space and recognizing the continued struggle for accountability  for the thousands, now, way too many, victims of police violence whose  names we could not say in this short hour that we have here today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  [[Page H1239]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman. I  thank, once again, my colleagues at the Congressional Progressive  Caucus for raising the dangers of this far-right court but also for  their leadership, their commitment to fighting back, to finding  solutions and finding pathways to restore and protect the freedoms of  millions of Americans and to create ethical pathways to opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
