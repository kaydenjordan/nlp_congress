 Mr. Speaker, in President Lincoln's Second  Inaugural Address, he called on our Nation to care for those ``who  shall have borne the battle.''   As we debate legislation this week to support our Nation's 16.5  million veterans, we must remember that charge that was given to us by  President Lincoln to care for those who have given so much of  themselves, of their time, in order to keep our Nation free and our  Nation safe.   It is essential that we honor our commitment to those men and women  and fully fund veterans benefits and VA programs. We owe an incredible  debt of gratitude to those who have worn a uniform in service of the  United States.   From inpatient hospitalizations to outpatient primary care and  addiction services, our veterans hospitals provide the essential  services that our veterans can rely on.   While working as a doctor, I was proud to treat veterans at the James  E. Van Zandt Veterans' Administration Medical Center in Blair County,  Pennsylvania. These men and women have served in conflicts including  World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan.  Having the opportunity to provide care to these veterans is one of the  proudest moments of my medical career.   Moving forward, we must ensure that our veterans hospitals are  equipped with the latest tools, technologies, and treatments to ensure  that our veterans are receiving the highest and utmost care.                      Unbearable Conditions for Farmers     Mr. Speaker, this summer, farmers across  Pennsylvania will grow produce, milk dairy cows, till their fields, and  tend to their orchards that help to feed our entire Nation.   Recently, I spent time at Richards Farm in Fulton County,  Pennsylvania, and met with the owner, Ryan Richards, to talk about the  challenges that are faced by dairy producers who work to provide the  nutritional products that Pennsylvanians and all Americans rely on.   Sadly, the failed policies of the Biden administration have made  conditions unbearable for family farmers. It is time to stop the  handouts to liberal special interests and reinvest in the policies and  programs that enable our American farmers to succeed. It is time to  rescind the $1 billion allocated for Green New Deal programs in  President Biden's so-called Inflation Reduction Act. It is time to put  an end to runaway spending and finally support our great American  farmers.                            ____________________
