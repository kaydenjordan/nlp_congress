 Mr. President, unfortunately I was unable to  attend the rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the  Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the  Republic of North Macedonia. Had I been able to attend, I would have  voted in support of cloture.                            ____________________
