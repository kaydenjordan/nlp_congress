 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend and ranking Republican  on Ways and Means for the opportunity, and I thank him for his  leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Chairman, we all agree that the prices of drugs are too high. We  agree that something needs to be done to fix this for all Americans,  not just our seniors.   The problem I have--and it is a big problem--is the way we go about  doing this. It is like a rerun of ObamaCare. It is this government  knows best, this top-down, government-controlled, let's tax, regulate,  and mandate our way to a better system. It doesn't work.   So we are doubling down on a failed philosophy on how to deliver  affordable quality products to the American people.   The approach should be more choices, more competition, a healthier  market, and greater transparency.   By the way, we have worked on those issues in a bipartisan fashion. I  have introduced two pieces of legislation with my Democrat friends that  would do just that.   The problem here is not just this top-down, heavy-handed government  knows best, let's fix the crisis and assume nothing bad will happen. It  is that nothing is going to come of this H.R. 3. It is a messaging  bill. It is purely political, and it won't help the people whom we all  intend to help.   I do not judge the motives of my colleagues. I think they want to  help our seniors just as I do. But we can't do it with partisan  messaging bills. We have to do it by working together.   In a former life, I was vice chancellor at Texas Tech, and I was  responsible for bringing new drug technologies, therapies, and  biologics to market.
