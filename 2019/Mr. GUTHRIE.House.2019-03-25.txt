 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1839, which  extends the important Medicaid Money Follows the Person program until  September.   The Medicaid Money Follows the Person program allows certain Medicaid  beneficiaries, such as the elderly or individuals with disabilities, to  transition from a healthcare facility to receiving care in their own  homes. It does not force patients to leave a facility if they don't  want to.   Since the Money Follows the Person program was created over a decade  ago, it has successfully helped over 88,000 individuals receive care in  their own homes.   I have worked with Congresswoman Debbie Dingell on the bipartisan  EMPOWER Care Act, which extends the Medicaid Money Follows the Person  program for 5 years.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1839 to extend the program until  September, and I will continue to work with Congresswoman Dingell to  get the EMPOWER Act across the finish line.
