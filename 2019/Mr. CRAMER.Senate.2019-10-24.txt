 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to offer the following amendments: No. 961, No. 1019, and No.  1067. I further ask unanimous consent that no second-degree amendments  be in order to these amendments prior to the votes and that at 5:30  p.m. on Monday, October 28, the Senate vote in relation to these  amendments in the order listed.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  patriotism of Radioman 2nd Class Floyd A. Wells. A native of Cavalier,  ND, he answered the call to defend his country during World War II. At  the age of 24, he made the ultimate sacrifice on December 7, 1941,  along with 2,402 other soldiers and sailors during the Japanese attack  on Pearl Harbor.   It was not until earlier this year that his remains were positively  identified, and on October 1 he was brought home to be buried at the  North Dakota Veterans Cemetery. Attending this burial were members of  his family who traveled from across the Nation to pay their respects to  this beloved member of their family. Even though most of them had never  met him, together they mourned the lost blessings of Floyd not being a  part of their family for the past 78 years.   He was remembered as a generous man and a gifted athlete who had a  full life ahead of him. Floyd's life could have included competing in  sports at college and having a family and home of his own.   Floyd's burial service was a poignant reminder of how the sacrifice  of heroes defending our country has an impact on those who knew and  loved them far into the future. He died so Americans could live in  peace and prosperity. I am thankful he is now back in his home State,  lying in eternal rest with other North Dakota heroes, and I am grateful  for the continued work of the many patriots who are committed to  identifying the remains of all unknown soldiers and bringing them home.   Mr. President, to the family of Radioman 2nd Class Floyd A. Wells, I  join citizens across the Nation in sending our sincere condolences. It  is heroes like Floyd whose service has kept our communities, State,  Nation, and world safe. His life made a difference in the lives of all  of us, and we are forever grateful.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a  remarkable woman who has been named North Dakota's Teacher of the Year.  Sara Medalen is a reading and math interventionist at Sunnyside  Elementary School in Minot.   While working with students to improve their reading and math skills,  she has also implemented other innovative programs helping Sunnyside  students gain greater self esteem. Girls arrive mornings before school  for Books and Braids, so she can braid their hair while they read to  her. The Girl Power group does charitable projects and hears from local  women in various professions around town. Her STEAM Saturdays bring  students together to collaborate on science, technology, engineering,  arts, and mathematics projects, and Strides for Sunnyside is a running  group encouraging students to embrace healthy habits and physical  fitness. Through these programs and her genuine love for teaching and  learning, Ms. Medalen has made a profound difference at Sunnyside  School. She is an inspiration to her students, parents and fellow  educators across North Dakota.   Mr. President, I congratulate Sara Medalen on this well-deserved  recognition. We all remember favorite teachers from our own schooldays,  and no doubt they share many of the good qualities that Ms. Medalen  brings to her classroom. WalletHub recently ranked North Dakota as one  of the best States for teachers, and my State has many top quality  educators who are just as remarkable as Sara Medalen. We cannot thank  them enough for the positive impact they have every day on North Dakota  students.  [[Page S6154]]                                ____________________
