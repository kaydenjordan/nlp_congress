 Mr. Speaker, Russia is not our friend;  Russia is our adversary.   We witnessed our President side with an autocrat and adversary of our  country over his own intelligence community and blame the USA for our  relationship with Russia.   From separating families at the southern border to embracing Putin  over the protection of U.S. interests, Mr. Trump has thrown out that  values that our country is founded on.   Putin may be Mr. Trump's friend, but he is not America's. Our  President forgets that the U.S. interests go beyond his own personal  interests and relationships. If Putin wants to return to the days with  no pushback from the U.S., that is one thing. If our President wants to  return to those days, rather than defend America and our allies, that  is another.   It shouldn't matter whether you are a Republican or a Democrat. If  the President of the United States won't defend our interests before  those of our adversaries, Congress must.                            ____________________
