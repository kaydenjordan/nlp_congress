 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule, to voice my  strong support of the America COMPETES Act, and to highlight pivotal  supply chain provisions that I worked on with Representatives  Malinowski and Kinzinger.   As I have traveled Delaware over the last summer, speaking to  businesses and constituents, I heard a lot about three things:  workforce, inflation, and supply chains. The provisions we are  discussing today would tackle all three, ensuring that the  manufacturing of critical components of goods we rely on every day are  brought back home, creating good-paying union jobs.   At a time when Americans are facing rising prices and manufacturers  are struggling to obtain the raw materials they need to produce  consumer products, we must act.   These provisions are the solution to strengthening our supply chains  while preventing these disruptions from impacting us again in the  future. And that is why I am so proud that these provisions enjoy  support from key stakeholder groups, from the United Steelworkers to  the National Association of Manufacturers.   Let's work together to support American jobs, maintain our national  security, and lower the price of consumer goods. Let's pass this bill.                                time  1300
