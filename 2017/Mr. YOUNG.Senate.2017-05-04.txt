 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Today, Mr. President, I rise to speak from the floor of  this proud Chamber for the first time. My message today is, at once, a  warning and an invitation.   Dear colleagues, as our Senate increasingly grows more partisan, we  move further and further away from the practical governance our  Founding Fathers espoused, and so today I would like to talk about the  principle of the common good in the hopes that this body might be  reminded that is our unifying purpose for serving.   Two Hoosiers exemplify the principle of working for the common good  that I believe our Founding Fathers envisioned.   Governor Ed Whitcomb was the 43rd Governor of Indiana. A hero from  World War II, he twice escaped capture from the Japanese, making it to  safety by swimming through shark-infested waters all night to get to  safety. Whitcomb pursued the common good in the midst of a rift in his  own Republican Party. He successfully led Indiana in improving our  State's highways, mental health services, and creating our State's  Higher Education Commission. He bucked his own party's interests  frequently to do what he thought was right for Hoosiers. Governor  Whitcomb has been described as Indiana's most amazing Governor. He  passed away this past year and in tribute Republicans and Democrats  alike acknowledged that he served all Hoosiers well.   Coach John Wooden was born and raised in Indiana, and he learned to  coach basketball there before heading to UCLA where he became one of  the most successful college basketball coaches of all time. Wooden  understood the importance of working together as a team, that working  together as a team was better than working as individuals. Wooden  acknowledged this principle in saying, ``Ten field horses couldn't pull  an empty baby carriage if they worked independently of one another.''  He also said, ``If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go  far, you need a team.''   These two Hoosiers remind us that we are here not to work for  ourselves or our parties, but the interest of all Americans for the  common good of the American people.   Can we perpetuate our Founders' brilliant system to safeguard our  liberties by vesting power in the American people themselves?   Our charge is simple, but it will not be easy: for our republican  system to endure, we must breathe life back into the notion of the  ``common good'' through the relentless application of common sense.   Now, I don't profess that Hoosiers have a monopoly on the common  good, but rather than allowing ideological labels to guide policymaking  decisions, we should instead be guided by what we in Indiana call  Hoosier common sense. It is the notion that we should be guided by the  facts, and that we are open to change or new ideas, regardless of  ideology, when presented with results.   The common good--I happen to know from personal experience that any  young boy or girl who grows up in Indiana already has a keen sense of  the thing.   I was raised in a place where neighbor cared for neighbor. This is  the common good in practice.   I lived among people of character who made others' concerns their own  concerns. This is the common good.   I benefited from the selfless contributions of Americans who invested  their own time, their own attention, their own resources and talents  into helping their fellow Americans. This is the common good.   I came to know rank-and-file citizens who quietly took the initiative  to care for the forgotten Hoosiers who needed a hand up. This is the  common good.   With respect, my colleagues, I note that this outline of the common  good would fully satisfy any ordinary rank-and-file Hoosier, and most  ordinary Americans, but sadly, in our modern politics sometimes our  most stubborn partisans resist even the most self-evident truths.  Forgive me as I must demonstrate that what works in practice also works  in theory.   I will borrow from 18th century political theorist and English  statesman Edmund Burke, for he brightly illuminated this notion of a  common good. Burke argued that the common good could only exist where  rule of law exists. Rule of law, properly understood, requires a shared  allegiance by which people entrust their collective destiny to others  who can speak and decide in their name. This, said Burke, is a  partnership between the living, the unborn, and the dead.   The common good requires individual cooperation and compromise.   Burke noted that individuals are not simply a compendium of human  wants and individual happiness is not realized by merely satisfying  those wants. Our own happiness is linked to one another's happiness.   Our purpose, then--our duty--in both our private and public  capacities, is to preserve a social order which addresses the needs of  generations past, present, and future. This is our duty.   In the Marine Corps, I learned something about duty and practice.  Marine leaders of every rank teach through the power of their example  that every marine has a duty to serve a cause greater than themselves.  Marines learn to venerate sacrifice for the greater good. We are  trained to refrain from self-indulgent behavior, to check our egos at  the door, and to never let ambition interfere with judgment.   For marines, our comrades' lives and our country's future depends on  embracing uncomfortable facts and then improvising, adapting, and  overcoming those facts together.   Of course, in the marines, there was no red State or blue State.  Every marine fights for red, white, and blue. Marines don't have the  luxury of stubbornly clinging to false doctrines or failed practices,  and neither do we. Every day our men and women who wear the uniform  from every branch take up arms ``to provide for the common defense''-- come what may.   Colleagues, if we are to keep the Republic, we too must remain open  to fact-based conversations, to new information, and to new, better  approaches.   Now look, I understand that this is not the United States Marine  Corps. We have been issued a pen and a microphone, not rifles, but like  the marines, we should be working to advance a common mission, common  goals. We are the trustees of the common good.   Now, please don't misunderstand me. As a marine, I like a good fight  as much as the next guy, but let's resolve whenever possible to fight  together because I know most assuredly we are fighting for the same  people--and, in most cases, we are fighting for the same ends.   I am fighting for Steve, a self-employed laborer from Indianapolis.  Steve's in his fifties, but he hasn't seen his takehome pay increase in  decades. Colleagues, you are fighting for Steve, too.   I am fighting for Whitney, a high school student from Gary. Whitney  doesn't come from money, and she worries about the future. She is a  hard-working student who helps her family how she can through a part- time job, but Whitney doesn't know if she can afford a college  education. Colleagues, you are fighting for Whitney, too.   I am fighting for David, an Army helicopter mechanic from Evansville  who spent nearly 15 years in uniform. David is exhausted by his  countless overseas deployments, and he prays that his family will find  relief from the stresses and strains of an overstretched force.  [[Page S2740]]  Colleagues, you are fighting for David, too.   I am fighting for Carrie, a single mother of three young children  from Paoli. Carrie is addicted to opioids. Her aging mother tries to  make a bad situation better, but she is fearful the family will not  find a way out of the crisis. Colleagues, you are fighting for Carrie,  too.   I am fighting for Sherman, a trucker from Fort Wayne. Sherman is  quickly approaching retirement. Sherman has put a small nest egg away  for retirement, but in a few years, he and his wife will depend on  Social Security and Medicare to make ends meet. Colleagues, you are  fighting for Sherman, too.   I am fighting for Bob, a single father of two boys from South Bend.  Bob's been able to pull together care for himself and his children by  piecing together various forms of public assistance. Bob wants a better  life for himself and his boys. I hope we are all fighting for Bob--I  hope we are fighting for every single American.   Let's resolve to fight for these people. Let's renew our vow to fight  for them more than we fight with one other.   Let's come together to grow our economy by simplifying our Tax Code  and reducing the burden of Federal regulations. I ask you, colleagues,  to join me in supporting the REINS Act, which I championed in the House  of Representatives. Let every proposed major regulation come before  this body for a vote before it can take effect, then let the American  people hold us accountable when those regulations kill jobs and  constrain household incomes.   Let's come together to help Americans acquire the skills to  meaningfully participate in this 21st century economy. If we cooperate,  we can develop new solutions for financing higher education that  liberate students from avoidable student debt, like income share  agreements. ISAs keep score with outcomes, so people aren't punished if  they are unemployed or have low incomes.   Let's come together to better serve the poor, the vulnerable, those  on the margins of society. My social impact partnership bill passed  unanimously out of the House last Congress.   This Congress, the Senate should come together to allow private  investors to provide operating capital to those social service  providers with the proven capacity to achieve measurable improvements  in chronic social problems like homelessness and long-term  unemployment.   If targeted improvements are achieved, government saves money and  repays the project's initial investors, plus a modest return on  investment.   Let's come together to restore confidence in our foreign policy and  protect our men and women in uniform. While we rebuild our military,  let's ensure we are optimizing every instrument of national power. The  American people won't tolerate wasteful or ineffective foreign aid  expenditures, but they will continue to support investments in smart,  effective diplomacy.   Let's work with this administration to reform the State Department  and foreign bodies like the United Nations.   Earlier, colleagues, I spoke of a former Republican Governor of  Indiana, Ed Whitcomb--but there was another Whitcomb who was Governor,  James Whitcomb, a Democrat, who also went on to serve in this body  before passing. He also made his mark as Governor, saving the State  from insolvency, establishing institutions for the physically and  mentally handicapped, and advancing the first system of free public  education.   But even more impressive is his dedication to those Hoosiers who  fought from Indiana in the Mexican-American War. With Indiana's budget  broke and our credit in shambles, Whitcomb took out personal loans to  purchase arms and send these Hoosiers out in service of our Nation. Two  Whitcombs, one Republican and one Democrat, who served our State and  Nation for the common good.   In closing, colleagues, allow me to acknowledge that folks in your  States probably feel a lot like those in Indiana: they are frustrated  by our failure, and the Federal Government's failure to live up to the  high expectations Americans have for other pillars of our public life-- our churches, our State governments, and so on. Where good old Hoosier  common sense seems to inform work in those areas, in Washington, our  common sense is too often crowded out by stale partisan battles and  unyielding ideological biases.   Colleagues, our charge, our duty, is to advance the common good by  identifying common goals and then using common sense to further advance  those goals.   In spite of our principled disagreements, let us disagree without  questioning each other's motives; let us work through tough problems.  Let us be principled in our beliefs but pragmatic in advancing those  beliefs. Let us adapt to new realities. Let us have the courage to  change our minds. Let us put results over rhetoric. Let us find  practical solutions to pressing challenges. Let us, first and foremost,  never forget that we are custodians of the common good.   My fellow Americans, let us rededicate ourselves to remain one  nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.   Thank you.
