 Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to call my colleagues'  attention to the dire need for Congress to continue building upon  recent progress to unlock the mysteries of the human brain and serious  mental illness. Along with other legislation we are working on in the  field of health, we have to create and pass robust mental health  legislation.   Alongside other members of our Congressional Mental Health Caucus and  the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force, we are pulling  together legislation to establish a comprehensive Mental Health Crisis  Response Act.   I invite all of our colleagues to please work with our bipartisan  working group. America has waited too long. The fundamentals of our  social economy depend on the good health of our citizenry, and their  ability to access quality and affordable behavioral health services has  for too long been ignored.   Countless constituents face insurance barriers when accessing mental  health services, and we must address the negative social and physical  determinants of health that cause trauma and tragic illnesses.   It is time for us to take meaningful action. Again, I invite my  colleagues to join us in preparing this important legislation.                            ____________________
