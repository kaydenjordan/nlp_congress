 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a bipartisan  resolution I am introducing today, together with a group of Democrats  and Republicans, recognizing the global coalition to defeat ISIS.   This resolution recognizes the critical contributions of the counter- ISIS coalition partners; the value of those partnerships to countering  threats, both today and tomorrow; and the importance of building and  maintaining trust among partners for the sake of future fights--as well  as reaffirming Congress' commitment to defeating ISIS.   It is important to remember how this coalition of 60-plus countries  came together in the first place. Take yourself back 5 years. ISIS had  taken over wide swaths of Iraq and Syria. They had huge amounts of  territory. They were systematically slaughtering the opposition. They  were targeting ethnic groups. They were targeting Christians. They were  targeting Yazidis. They were systematically raping women. They were  setting up bureaucratic structures, charging taxes, and  extorting people.    They were projecting violence and threats out of that territory into  places like Europe, into places like Russia, and into places like the  United States. So the Department of Defense and the Department of State  pieced together 60 nations to contribute to a coalition.   Some of those countries provide F-16 air cover. Some provide overhead  imagery. Some provide human intelligence. Some train the Iraqi security  forces and police. Everyone has a part to play.   Today, as I speak, Secretary Pompeo is convening the counter-ISIS  coalition at the highest levels in an emergency session to discuss the  future of the counter-ISIS mission, following President Trump's  decision to pull out U.S. forces from northern Syria.   Our allies and partners are rightfully questioning the future of this  coalition. The President surprised these nations, all 60 of them, with  the pullout. Many of our partners found out about the pullout, in which  they are involved, via tweet and via the media.   As the counter-ISIS coalition partners come to Washington, I,  therefore, want to take a moment to recognize their partnership, their  contributions, and their commitment to the counter-ISIS fight.   Why is it important to have a coalition? Why is it important that 60  nations come together to fight this terrorist group? It is not just for  show. For every airman, marine, soldier, or sailor from the U.K.,  Spain, France, or Norway who comes to contribute to the fight, that is  one fewer soldier, airman, marine, or naval officer who needs to come  from the United States. For every piece of intelligence that they risk  their lives to collect, that is one fewer piece that we need to collect  and risk our lives for.   Most importantly, working in coalition keeps the American homeland  safer than it would be simply if it were up to us to defend. In an era  of globalized threats that can come from anywhere, we need a global  coalition before the threats land on our shores.   As we know in Michigan, our handshake is our bond; our word is our  reputation; and we are stronger together than we are apart.   I am, therefore, proud to be introducing this resolution, together  with a bipartisan group, as a signal of our appreciation and our word  and as a sign of our commitment to our counter-ISIS partners today and  into the future.                            ____________________
