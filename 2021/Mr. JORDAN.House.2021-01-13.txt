 I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in his opening remarks, the Democrat chair of the Rules  Committee said that Republicans last week voted to overturn the results  of an election.   Guess who the first objector was on January 6, 2017, the first  objector? The Democrat chair of the Rules Committee. And guess which  State he objected to? Alabama. The very first State called, Alabama.  President Trump, I think, won Alabama with 80 points. Actually, he won  it by 30 points.   They can object. They can object to Alabama in 2017 but tell us we  can't object to Pennsylvania in 2021, Pennsylvania where the State  supreme court just unilaterally extended the election to Friday;  Pennsylvania where the secretary of state unilaterally changed the  rules, went around the legislature in an unconstitutional fashion;  Pennsylvania where county clerks in some counties, and you can imagine  which counties they were, let people fix their ballots against the law,  cure their ballots, their mail-in ballots, a direct violation of law.  And they tell us we tried to overturn the election?    Guess who the second objector was in 2017? The individual managing  the impeachment for the Democrats.   Americans are tired of the double standard. They are so tired of it.  Democrats objected to more States in 2017 than Republicans did last  week, but somehow we are wrong.   Democrats can raise bail for rioters and looters this summer, but  somehow when Republicans condemn all the violence, the violence this  summer, the violence last week, somehow we are wrong. Democrats can  investigate the President of the United States, as Mr. Hoyer went  through, tried to impeach him, investigate him for 4 years, but will  not look at an election that 80 million Americans, half the electorate,  80 million, Republicans and Democrats, have their doubts about.   I said this last night. I do not know where all this goes, and this  is frightening for the country. We should defeat this rule, and we  should defeat the impeachment resolution when it comes up later this  afternoon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Nineteen minutes. Nineteen minutes. Four years ago on inauguration  day, January 20, 2017, 19 minutes into President Trump's  administration, at 12:19 p.m., The Washington Post's headline was  ``Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.'' And now with just 1  week left, they are still trying.   In 7 days, there will be a peaceful transfer of power, just like  there has been every other time in our country, but Democrats are going  to impeach President Trump again. This doesn't unite the country. There  is no way this helps the Nation deal with the tragic and terrible  events of last week that we all condemn. Republicans have been  consistent. We have condemned all the violence all the time. We  condemned it last summer. We condemned it last week.   We should be focused on bringing the Nation together. Instead,  Democrats are going to impeach the President for a second time, 1  week--1 week--before he leaves office. Why? Why?   Politics and the fact that they want to cancel the President--the  President who cut taxes, the President who reduced regulations, the  President who, prior to COVID, had the greatest economy, lowest  unemployment in 50 years, the President who got us out of the Iran  deal, put the Embassy in Jerusalem, brought hostages home from North  Korea, put three great Justices on the Supreme Court, gave us a new  NAFTA agreement, the Abraham Accords, the COVID vaccine, and who built  the wall.   It is about politics. This is about getting the President of the  United States. They spied on his campaign before he was elected.  Nineteen minutes into his Presidency, they started the impeachment  push: 3-year Mueller investigation, 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 500  witnesses, 2,500 subpoenas, $40 million to find nothing--impeachment  round one, based on an anonymous whistleblower with no firsthand  knowledge, who was biased against the President and who worked for Joe  Biden. Now it is impeachment round two.   It has always been about getting the President, no matter what. It is  an obsession, an obsession that has now broadened. It is not just about  impeachment anymore. It is about canceling, as I have said, canceling  the President and anyone that disagrees with them. The Ayatollah can  tweet; the President can't.   Democrats can object on January 6, 2017, but Republicans aren't  allowed to object on January 6, 2021. Democrats say antifa is a myth;  Republicans condemn all violence all the time. The double standard has  to stop.   Frankly, the attack on the First Amendment has to stop. Stop and  think about it. Do you have a functioning First Amendment when the  cancel culture only allows one side to talk? When you can't even have a  debate in this country, this great country, the greatest country ever?  It needs to stop because if it continues, if it continues, it won't  just be Republicans who get canceled; it won't just be the  [[Page H167]]  President of the United States. The cancel culture will come for us  all.   America is a great country, the greatest country ever. It seems to me  that we need to think about how great the people of this Nation really  are, think about what we have accomplished in the past, and begin to  come together as leaders who represent so many great folks across our  districts.   Think about this. Think about this: In 1903, Kitty Hawk, North  Carolina, two guys fly this thing they called a plane 100 feet. Barely  got off the ground. Barely got off the ground. Amazing thing. Forty- four years later, Chuck Yeager breaks the sound barrier. In 44 years,  we go from two guys flying a contraption they called a plane a few  hundred feet to Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier, and 22 years  after that--22 years after that--another American steps on the Moon.  Think about it. In one lifetime, in 66 years, two guys flying 100 feet  to putting a man on the Moon. That is what this country is capable of.  That is what we can do.   We, as the Congress who represents the people who did that, should  start leading, should start understanding what really is going on here.  So I hope--I hope--we defeat this. I hope we can begin to come together  and recognize the greatness of the American people and focus on the  things they want us to focus on.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

So Democrats can say, ``I just don't even know why there aren't  uprisings all over the country,'' while there are uprisings happening  around the country, but they impeach the President of the United States  for saying, ``Peacefully and patriotically, make your voices heard.''   Democrats can say, ``You know, there needs to be unrest in the  streets,'' while there is unrest in the streets, but they are going to  impeach the President for saying, ``Peacefully and patriotically, make  your voices heard.''   Let's be consistent, all of us. All of us need to be consistent and  condemn the violence all the time.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Herrell).
