 Madam Speaker, millions of freedom-loving  Americans with legitimate concerns with the vaccine--some are  vaccinated, by the way--have had their jobs, livelihoods, and military  service held hostage by this new vaccine mandate. They are being told  to shut up and take it. That is un-American.   With both Army Fort Rucker and Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in my  district, I am especially disturbed by the new vaccine mandates our  military and civilian contractors are having to endure.   Last week, I spoke at a meeting of concerned Fort Rucker employees.  We expected about 20 to 30 attendees, but hundreds showed up. Clearly,  Americans are mobilizing to resist against these mandates.   I met with Lieutenant Colonel Theresa Long, a military physician  stationed at Fort Rucker. We have seen firsthand the health risks  associated with the vaccine that can impact our military readiness. Why  are voices like hers being ignored? She has the rank of lieutenant  colonel; she has a medical degree; and she is an expert. And if she is  not, who is?   These mandates are about control and not safety. Every American must  have the freedom to make their own health decisions, and our concerns  will not be silenced. The American people will continue to resist the  vaccine mandates, and I am proud to stand with them.                            ____________________
