 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two outstanding  members of our community and my dear friends: Peg Roberts, a retired  teacher, and Fran Henry, a retired nurse.   Peg and Fran embody the American patriotic spirit through their  musical talent. The two sisters were inspired by the famous duo,  Diamond and Silk. They refer to themselves as Ruby and Lace. Some of us  in the country affectionately refer to them as Coal and Flannel. These  darling songstresses, retirees, have also been known by the moniker,  ``the two Hotties.''   It is a true honor to represent such determined and patriotic people.  Mr. Speaker, I hope you and all my colleagues can laugh a little and  enjoy the humorous lyrics of our upstate Hotties, affectionately known  as Ruby and Lace, or as I like to call them, Coal and Flannel.                            ____________________
