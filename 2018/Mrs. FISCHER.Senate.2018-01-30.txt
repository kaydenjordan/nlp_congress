 Mr. President, I rise this evening to call up and pass  a resolution recognizing the commissioning of the USS Omaha.   This weekend, the USS Omaha is scheduled to be commissioned in the  United States Navy as one of our newest Independence Class Littoral  Combat Ships.   As the only triply landlocked State in the union, you may not think  of Nebraska when you think about the world's oceans.   And while we are proud of our heartland heritage, we are equally  proud of the ships that have carried the name ``USS Omaha'' to the far  corners of the globe.   Just two years after Nebraska became a State, the USS Omaha, a screw  sloop, was launched in 1869, helping to grow our young Nation's navy.   The second USS Omaha, launched in 1923, served with distinction in  World War II, capturing a German blockade runner a month before the war  officially began.   And now this upcoming weekend, we welcome the newest USS Omaha, LCS- 12, which carries the distinction of being among our Nation's newest  Littoral Combat Ships.   She will enter the navy as an agile surface combatant, and one which  I know will prove to be a capable tool in our Nation's naval arsenal.   Though Nebraska may be far from open water that has not stopped  countless men and women from our State from answering the call to serve  in the United States Navy.   Their service and sacrifice, both in times of war and peace, have  helped ensure that the United States continues to enjoy freedom of  navigation around the world.   For that reason, I am honored to know that now we will once again  have another USS Omaha carrying on this proud tradition, and urge my  colleagues to join me in recognizing this momentous occasion.   To the crew of the USS Omaha, I wish you well in your mission and all  the years of distinguished service to come.   May you enjoy fair winds and following seas, and know that you have  the best wishes of the State of Nebraska behind you.   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________
