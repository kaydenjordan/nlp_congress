 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2915) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 regarding  the procurement of certain items related to national security interests  for Department of Homeland Security frontline operational components,  and for other purposes, as amended.

(ii) Helmets that provide ballistic protection and other       head protection and components.        (iii) Rain gear, cold weather gear, and other environmental       and flame resistant clothing.        (d) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-      296; 116 Stat. 2135) is amended by inserting after the item       relating to section 835 the following:  ``Sec. 836. Requirements to buy certain items related to national                security interests.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2915, the Homeland Procurement  Reform Act, or better known as HOPR Act. I am proud to have introduced  this bipartisan legislation to reform the way the Department of  Homeland Security purchases uniforms and protective equipment for its  personnel.   My bill seeks to improve the quality of uniforms and equipment issued  to frontline DHS personnel by requiring, to the maximum extent  possible, that at least one-third of the funds be used to purchase  goods manufactured by American small businesses in America.   Today, DHS has more than 60,000 men and women in uniform, but fewer  than half of those uniforms are actually manufactured in the United  States.   Furthermore, in response to the concerns expressed by frontline  personnel about how quickly they exhaust their annual uniform  allowances, this bill directs DHS to study the adequacy of uniform  allowances for those serving on the front lines.   My bill also strengthens supply chain security for uniforms by  mandating locked storage, reports of stolen goods, and the destruction  of defective items for any item bearing official DHS insignia not  manufactured in the United States.   In response to supply chain shortages that we have been seeing  recently during this pandemic, my bill also requires the Department to  assess how to get more items related to national security from domestic  sources.   This provision is targeted at such items as personal protective  equipment, or PPE, which we all know has  [[Page H6294]]  been quite scarce at points during this pandemic. Simply put, this bill  is good for Homeland Security, good for Americans, and good for  American businesses.   H.R. 2915 is endorsed by the Warrior Protection and Readiness  Coalition and passed out of the committee unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Homeland Procurement  Reform Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, if enacted, H.R. 2915 will simultaneously serve the  frontline personnel who protect our homeland and support the domestic  industrial base, especially small businesses.   Most importantly, as noted in the committee report, it is our  expectation that, once this measure is enacted into law, DHS implement  it in a manner that supports small business domestic manufacturing.   To that end, DHS is expected to prioritize buying from small  businesses that manufacture the item here in the United States over  purchasing foreign-manufactured goods supplied by a small business.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the bipartisan work that went into  creating this legislation that is cosponsored by my Republican  colleague, Mr. Brian Mast of Florida. I also appreciate the efforts of  Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire, who introduced the Senate companion  of this bill, which the Senate Committee on Homeland Security ordered  to be favorably reported this year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the HOPR Act, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5652) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish the Acquisition Review Board in the Department of Homeland  Security, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101 et       seq.) is amended by inserting after the item relating to       section 835 the following new item:  ``Sec. 836. Acquisition Review Board.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, each year, the Department of Homeland Security spends  billions of dollars on its major acquisition programs to execute its  most critical missions. It acquires systems vital to homeland security,  including those used to screen travelers, enhance cybersecurity, and  improve disaster response.   However, over the past decade, the Government Accountability Office,  or GAO, has repeatedly raised alarms regarding DHS' management of its  acquisition programs.   Earlier this year, the GAO reviewed 24 major acquisition programs  that DHS is pursuing. Ten had been in breach of their cost or schedule  goals, or both, at some point during fiscal year 2020.   Given the complexity of DHS' acquisition programs, it is critical  that there be a standing oversight body to give major acquisition  programs the attention they deserve. At DHS, the Acquisition Review  Board is just that body.   H.R. 5652, the DHS Acquisition Review Board Act of 2021, seeks to  strengthen the role of the Acquisition Review Board, or ARB, to improve  acquisition outcomes at DHS.   The ARB is charged with reviewing major acquisition programs for  proper management, oversight, accountability, and alignment with DHS'  strategic functions.   The ARB can intercede when it identifies a program with significant  cost, schedule, or performance issues and drive a course correction or  even terminate such a program.   Passage of H.R. 5652 will help stabilize oversight within DHS when it  comes to major acquisitions, which, according to GAO, is a high-risk  activity, by codifying the Board into law.   Most importantly, the bill also authorizes the Board to not only  review major acquisitions but also to review certain acquisitions that  are valued below $300 million but are critical to the Department's  success.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the DHS Acquisition  Review Board Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5652 strengthens the Acquisition Review Board, one  very important mechanism within DHS that can help ensure that  acquisition programs are delivered on time and on budget, and in-line  with DHS missions.   A version of this bill passed the House in both the 115th and 116th  Congresses, and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew)  for sponsoring the legislation in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the DHS Acquisition  Review Board Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
