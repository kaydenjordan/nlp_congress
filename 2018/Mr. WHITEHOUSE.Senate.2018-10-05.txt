 Mr. President, as a U.S. Senator and a member of the  Judiciary Committee, giving careful consideration to Supreme Court  nominations is among my most important responsibilities. These lifetime  appointments can change not only the course of the Nation but the  course of lives.   I began with deep concerns about Judge Kavanaugh: his unfettered  views of executive power, effectively believing that the President is  beyond the law; his refusal to commit to well-established precedents on  critical issues, like women's constitutional rights regarding abortion;  his affinity for unlimited and dark political money and his studious  blindness to its harm to our democracy; and his very selection and  support by big special interest groups. I had significant concerns  about his truthfulness and temperament--concerns proven more than  justified over the course of these hearings.   Another warning sign was flashing. Senate Republicans were stopping  at nothing to get this nominee through. Why, it made we wonder. Why?   Behind all of the shattered norms and traditions of the Senate,  behind all of the hidden documents and unanswered questions, stands the  looming question: Why?   In my opening comments in the committee, I chronicled a pattern under  Chief Justice Roberts, an unpleasant pattern of 5-to-4 partisan rulings  for the big corporate and special interests that are the lifeblood of  the Republican Party--not 3 or 4 times, not even a dozen or two dozen  times, but 73 times--73 times and all 5-to-4 partisan decisions, all  wins for the big corporate and special interests that are the lifeblood  of the Republican party--73 times.   The pattern is clear in these 5-to-4 partisan decisions. Every time  big corporate and Republican special interests are involved, the big  interest wins--every time, 73 to 0.   On its way to delivering these Republican special interest victories,  the Roberts Court--or I should say the five of them who do this; call  it the ``Roberts Five''--leaves a trail--a trail of wrecked precedents,  a trail of sketchy, nonfactual fact-finding, a trail of longstanding  statutes ignored or rewritten, and a trail of supposedly conservative  judicial principles, like modesty, deference, originalism, and stare  decisis, all violated. The pattern of these 73 partisan ``Roberts  Five'' decisions explains why. It explains why big Republican interests  want Kavanaugh on the Court so badly and why Republicans shredded so  much Senate precedent to shove him through. The big Republican  interests want to be able to pull 5-to-4 wins out of the U.S. Supreme  Court as if it were a legislature they controlled.   What are the areas of law where the big Republican corporate and  special interests have a stake where the Roberts Five delivered for  those big Republican Party stakeholders?   Well, first, they helped Republicans to gerrymander elections in  Vieth v. Jubelirer, 5 to 4. This was a big deal. It let Republicans  gerrymander their way to control of Congress, to control of the House  of Representatives, in a year Republicans lost by a million votes. They  lost the House by a million votes and won it by gerrymandering.   The Roberts Five has helped Republicans to keep minority voters away  from the polls: Shelby County, 5 to 4; Bartlett v. Strickland, 5 to 4;  Abbott v. Perez, 5 to 4. Making it harder to vote--harder for  minorities or poor people or the elderly--is a Republican  electioneering tactic, and Republican State legislatures went right to  work, passing voter suppression laws right after these partisan  decisions.   The Roberts Five also helped to unleash big-money political  influence, giving big interests unlimited power to buy elections and  threaten and bully Congress. McCutcheon and Bullock and the infamous,  grotesque 5-to-4 Citizens United decision were their tools.   This is the sockdolager, the really big deal, by the way. There is a  very small world of very big interests that have unlimited money to  spend and a business strategy to spend it to influence politics. It is  not a big group, but it is a powerful group, and it is the heart of the  Republican funding machine. These few but big Republican interests were  given unprecedented political artillery by the Roberts Five, at least  unprecedented since Teddy Roosevelt cleaned house over a century ago.   Our politics since Citizens United has been contorted and corrupted,  but those big influences are, oh, so happy.   What else do the big influencers want to get out of courtrooms?   Big special interests that can muscle their way around Congress and  capture executive agencies hate courtrooms. There is this annoying  thing in courtrooms of being treated equally with regular people. There  is this annoying thing in courtrooms about having to turn over your  actual documents. There is this really annoying thing in courtrooms  about having to tell the truth. So, bingo, the Roberts Five protected  corporations from group class-action lawsuits--Walmart v. Dukes, 5 to  4; Comcast, 5 to 4; Epic Systems, 5 to 4--and helped corporations to  steer customers and workers away from courtrooms and into corporate  friendly mandatory arbitration--Concepcion, Italian Colors, and Rent-a- Center, all 5 to 4 at the hands of the Roberts Five.   What else? Of course, to bust unions, a perennial Big Business  special interest classic, kind of a golden oldie for big Republican  influencers: Harris v. Quinn, 5 to 4; Janus v. AFSCME, 5 to 4.   And, of course, to protect polluters. Big polluters pour big money  into the Republican Party. They do this, they will tell you, to protect  your freedom. They talk a lot about freedom. It turns out that it is  your freedom to breath dirty air, drink dirty water, smell the river  going by, eat chemicals with your food, and have climate havoc and acid  oceans. It is all about freedom--indeed, the freedom for big polluters  to pollute for free and get away with it. Right with them there is the  Roberts Five over and over, for the polluters, even stopping the  Nation's Clean Power Plan 5 to 4 for the coal industry.   The list goes on. It totals 73 partisan 5-to-4 decisions under Chief  Justice Roberts, each giving big wins to big Republican interests. It  is an indelible pattern.   Although the American people might not be keeping exact score--they  might not know that the number is 73--they feel the Court is rigged,  and the Court is flying all the warning flags of a captured agency,  dancing to special interest tunes and rampaging through precedent and  principle to get there.   This pattern is a disaster for the Court, and I know Kavanaugh will  contribute to that disaster.   How do I know this? I know this because Kavanaugh's record tells me.  That is why he is the nominee, after all. That is the why. He has been  signaling the big influencers with over 50 speeches to the Federalist  Society. I think he has the human record for speeches to the Federalist  Society, signaling that he is their guy.   And he has been signaling with his record as a judge on the DC  Circuit Court of Appeals in the most controversial and salient civil  cases, those decided by bare 2-to-1 majorities. When Kavanaugh was in  the majority with another Republican-appointed judge, he voted to  advance the far-right and corporate interests a striking 91 percent of  the time. That is almost a perfect match for the Roberts Five majority  rulings in 5-to-4 cases where these conservative groups show up.   The Roberts Five gives conservative groups a 92-percent win rate.  Kavanaugh gives conservative groups a 91-percent win rate. No wonder he  is their guy.   Ninety-one percent--remember that number.   Kavanaugh reliably voted for polluters and for dark money and for  corporate interests with a healthy dollop of anti-choice, pro-gun,  religious-right  [[Page S6611]]  politics thrown in. Ninety-one percent is how he campaigned for this  job.   Big special interests have a habit of turning up regularly in  appellate courtrooms like the DC Circuit. Their tool of influence is  one of the worst policed tools of special-interest influence in  America--the so-called amicus brief, where big special interests fund  front groups to file these amicus briefs to instruct courts how they  want the courts to rule.   They are called amicus briefs because they are supposedly appearing  as a friend of the court, but this has nothing to do with friendship.  It is a scandal of secrecy, deception, and manipulation.   How does this involve Kavanaugh? In cases where conservative groups  weighed in with these amicus briefs before him, Judge Kavanaugh sided  with them--wait for it--91 percent of the time--again, 91 percent. Call  him ``Judge 91 percent,'' and you understand why those big interests  want him so badly on the Supreme Court and why the Republican Party  drove like drunk kids over the curbs and across the lawns, smashing  mailboxes of procedure and propriety to get him there.   The overlap between the groups in Kavanaugh's 91-percent club and the  groups who fund Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society architect of  Kavanaugh's nomination, is telling. The multimillion-dollar scorched- earth ad campaign by groups like the Judicial Crisis Network is funded  by big dark money interests.   The NRA poured its own millions into campaigning for Kavanaugh. They  promised NRA members that Kavanaugh would break the tie. They are 91  percent sure.   In the face of all this, Kavanaugh feigned impartiality, but then  came the ``tell.'' When Kavanaugh returned to the Judiciary Committee  to defend himself against accusations of a sex assault, his veneer of  impartiality was pulled away, and we saw--America saw--the fierce and  rabid conspiracy-mongering partisan within. His performance was  recently described by a right-of-center columnist as his ``partisan,  unhinged diatribe and nonjudicial demeanor.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from which I  am quoting be appended to the end of my remarks.   (Mr. LANKFORD assumed the Chair.) He even blamed Bill and Hillary  Clinton--seriously.   It shows where we are in this country that this display was not by  itself disqualifying. But for the big special interests behind ``Judge  91 Percent,'' this was not at all disqualifying. This was reassuring.  This was great stuff. It just confirmed what they knew: Judge 91  Percent would be their boy. The Roberts Five would get back in the  saddle, and they would get 73 more 5-to-4 partisan victories.   But that moment gave the rest of the country the opportunity to take  true measure of a man who claims he is impartial--a man who asks the  Senate to grant him a lifetime seat in judgment of others and claims he  will judge fairly--fat chance.   One longtime observer of the judiciary who was an early supporter of  Kavanaugh recently withdrew his support. He wrote in the Atlantic  magazine:         I cannot condone the partisanship which was raw,       undisguised, naked, and conspiratorial from someone who asks       for public faith as a dispassionate and impartial judicial       actor. His performance was wholly inconsistent with the       conduct we should expect from a member of the judiciary.    Extraordinarily, even former Supreme Court Justice Stevens has warned  against Kavanaugh for the same reasons. Kavanaugh's raw, undisguised,  naked, and conspiratorial partisan screed may have excited the donors,  but it did nothing to address the concerns that had prompted the  hearing in the first place. So in addition to an epic fail of any  reasonable test of impartiality, Judge Kavanaugh still bears credible  allegations of sexual assault levied against him.   I will confess, I believe Dr. Blasey Ford. We have a big dispute  here, but I do hope that in this Senate we at least can agree on one  thing. If Dr. Blasey Ford's testimony was true, I hope we can all agree  that Kavanaugh has no business on the Court.   Well, I believed her then, and I believe her now, and I did not find  him credible at all. I found him belligerent and aggressive--just as  his Yale drinking buddies said he was while drunk in college--and  evasive and nonresponsive.   Dr. Ford's allegations were credible enough to get her here before  the Senate. Her testimony here was quiet, open, and powerful. She was  calm, composed, and utterly believable. Even President Trump called her  testimony ``credible'' and ``compelling.'' So did many of my Republican  colleagues.   But then came the smear campaign to discredit and demean her, led by  the President's sickening taunts and mockery in Mississippi. Then came  the majority leader's criticisms. He knew it wouldn't do to say  outright that she lied, but his every accusation fell to pieces if she  was telling the truth. His attacks were a bank shot--a relentless,  indirect bank-shot smear of Dr. Ford's credibility.   One element of the smear of Dr. Blasey Ford was to describe her  testimony as ``uncorroborated.'' We have heard that over and over. The  majority leader said that again just this morning on the floor-- uncorroborated. Well, first, that just isn't true. Prior consistent  statements are a well-known form of corroboration, and Dr. Ford's prior  consistent statements are abundant. It is ironic to have Republicans  complain about a lack of corroboration when Republicans did everything  possible to prevent corroborating evidence from coming forward. It is  deeply unfair to Dr. Ford to disallow, prevent, and freeze out  corroborating evidence and then call her testimony uncorroborated,  which bring us to the, to put it politely, abridged FBI investigation.   First, the FBI background investigation was closed to this new  evidence in an unprecedented break from the entire history of  background investigations. Then, the investigation was limited by  secret orders from the White House we still have not seen.   What do we see? We see the dozens of credible, percipient, and  corroborating witnesses who came forward to say that they couldn't get  an interview from the FBI, who were never contacted when they made  themselves known to the FBI.   I ask unanimous consent that that two letters from the  representatives of Ms. Ramirez and Dr. Ford explaining this be added at  the end of my remarks.   Mr. President, many witnesses were fobbed off into a black hole of a  tip line--a tip line from which no tip appears ever to have been  pursued, a tip line that was just a dumping ground for unwelcome  evidence. As a U.S. attorney, had I received the set of witness  summaries we saw, I would have sent the package back for more  investigation.   A sincere and thorough investigation designed to get at the truth  would have broadly interviewed Kavanaugh and Blasey Ford's known  contemporaries to probe their recollections.   An investigation to get at the truth would have interviewed the  witnesses who corroborated Dr. Blasey Ford's prior consistent  statements.   An investigation designed to get at the truth would have tested  Kavanaugh's calendar and yearbook entries with contemporaneous  witnesses.   An investigation designed to get at the truth would have done  interviews of witnesses who corroborate the incident alleged by Ms.  Ramirez, like the classmate ``100 percent sure'' he was told at the  time that Kavanaugh had exposed himself to Ramirez.   An investigation designed to get at the truth would have interviewed  people who recalled Kavanaugh's propensity to drink to excess and his  behavior when drunk relevant to these incidents.   An investigation designed to get at the truth would have certainly  sought to interview the alleged victims, like Christine Blasey Ford and  the accused perpetrator, Brett Kavanaugh.   From public reporting, we know that none of this happened. It is  difficult to escape the conclusion that like everything else in this  nomination, such as hiding 90 percent of the records from the Bush  White House days, putting bogus ``Executive Privilege'' cover over  other documents, and claiming documents are ``committee confidential''  through a nonexistent process that was  [[Page S6612]]  partisan from start to finish--like everything else, it is hard to  escape the conclusion that this investigation was designed not to get  at the truth, but to step carefully around it.   I am a huge fan of the FBI. I admire that organization immensely. It  must have killed the agents to do such a half-baked and incomplete job  because of marching orders from the White House. My heart goes out to  the experienced FBI professionals hamstrung by the Trump White House  through this investigation. They know better than anyone the holes in  what they did, but in this matter they don't have the independence of a  criminal investigation. The White House is the client. They must do  what they are told. This was yet another Trump abuse of a proud  American institution.   So here we are.   A defendant in a criminal prosecution enjoys a presumption of  innocence until proven guilty. A defendant in a civil trial must be  found culpable by a preponderance of the evidence. An executive agency  must make decisions based on substantial evidence. But the question  before us is none of those. The question before us is whether Brett  Kavanaugh is a man with the character, credibility, impartiality, and  temperament to sit in judgment on America's highest Court.    We now know Brett Kavanaugh is not that. He is not close, and  Americans know it. But the big Republican interest groups don't care  because they see that 91 percent, and they yearn for 73 more 5-to-4  partisan victories.   Service to the law has at its heart an earnest pursuit of the truth.  In Kavanaugh's pursuit of office, truth has too often not been his goal  but his casualty. The history of falsehoods is well chronicled: denying  that he worked on the nomination of the controversial Judge Pryor,  denying that he knew of documents stolen from Judiciary Committee  Democrats when he was at the Bush White House, denying that he was  involved in questions about the knowledge of the secret detention  program or the warrantless wiretapping program, denying what he himself  said about Presidential immunity from investigation, and complicit in  the coverup of millions of documents we should have seen, and on and  on.   Once Dr. Blasey Ford and then Ms. Ramirez came forward with sexual  assault allegations, the lies came fast and furiously--that he knew  nothing about the Ramirez allegations until the ``New Yorker'' story  was published; that he had no alcohol problem and never drank to the  point of impairment of his memory; that he had unique definitions of  phrases in common parlance he related to binge drinking and sex; that  he ``always treated women with dignity and respect''; and that claiming  himself as a girl's ``Alumnius'' was a sign of affection. As the woman  herself retorted: ``There is nothing affectionate or respectful in  bragging about making sexual conquests that never happened.''   On they came, little lies and big lies about not having connections  to get into Yale, about honoring grand jury secrecy while helping the  Ken Starr investigation--none perhaps individually fatal but together  adding up to a pattern of dissembling and prevarication. Even before  Kavanaugh was nominated, Leader McConnell smelled trouble and urged the  President not to nominate someone he knew was a badly flawed nominee  with a lengthy paper trail that would likely disclose how extreme and  partisan Judge Kavanaugh truly is.   So much has been left by the wayside in the mad rush to jam this  nomination through--documents, facts, Senate rules and traditions, real  investigation, simple respect for truth--all smashed-up wreckage in the  wake of this nomination. But as my fellow New Englander John Adams  said, ``Facts are stubborn things.'' The truth has a way of coming out.  The millions of hidden pages of Kavanaugh's White House records will  come out. The nonassertion assertion of Executive privilege will fall  or yield to time. The unheard witnesses will ultimately be heard, and  others may come forward, which brings me back to the question I began  with: Why all the wreckage? Why all the rush? Why all the damage? Why  all the violation? The answer is in the numbers: 5 to 4, 73, and 91  percent. At the end of the day, we go back to a Supreme Court far too  often dancing to the tune of a handful of big Republican special  interests. The record of this--the pattern of this--is undeniable. As I  said, it will be a disaster for the Court, and Kavanaugh will eagerly  contribute to that disaster.   This whole mess has been a dark episode for the U.S. Senate, for the  Supreme Court, for our image around the world, for our democracy. But  there is one bright jewel that can be picked in the midst of all the  filth and wreckage and lies; that is that something very special is  happening out there. The testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford of her  assault at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh, though studiously ignored by  so many Republicans and mocked by the President of the United States,  has lit a fire.   Just in my small State of Rhode Island, at least 10 women have  written to me to share their own personal stories of survival of sexual  assault. Like all of us, I get mail everyday about various policies  that are being debated here in the Senate. I am coming up on 12 years,  and I have never, never had mail like this. These women have come  forward from widely different ages and backgrounds--college students  and grandmothers--to tell their stories. Some have held these secrets  close for years, even for decades. Several of these women gave me  permission to share their words--words they have allowed me to free on  the Senate floor after years of silence. What a privilege it is. What  an honor for me to be trusted in this way by these remarkable women.   Some were moved to tell their stories because they see their own  fears reflected in Dr. Blasey Ford's brave testimony--the fear of not  being believed, the fear of losing the respect of family or of friends.  But they knew that Dr. Blasey Ford's memories were real, and they told  me they wanted me to trust that Dr. Blasey Ford's memories were real  because they knew that their own memories were real, because their own  memories of their assaults were seared into their minds. One told me:  ``I am Dr. Ford.''   A woman wrote to me:         I am sure my rapist hasn't thought of me since that night       21 years ago either. In fact, he, like Kavanaugh, would       likely deny anything had ever happened. But here's the thing       about rape--the victims never forget.    The coverage of Dr. Blasey Ford's appearance before the Senate for  some stirred deep and disquieting emotions. As one woman wrote:         The past few weeks have been doubly difficult with Dr. Ford       coming forward and all of the constant news threads and       social media threads. I have been triggered with nightmares,       fear of being alone, and emotionally wrecked. PTSD and       triggers are real. No matter how much therapy and time goes       by, one small statement or physical interaction can trigger       someone who has experienced a traumatic assault.    One letter read:         As a rape survivor (I was 19 years old--I am now 66 years       old), I want you to know that that experience does color the       rest of a person's life, informing decisions that you make,       where and how you go somewhere, how you raise your children       and relate to your husband and all other people. Sometimes       through the decades, you think about it consciously and on       purpose, and sometimes outside events can bring it back       without your willing it to be so.    Dr. Blasey Ford's quietly compelling testimony has forced our Nation  to face up to the tough questions about how women have been treated.  The redemption, if there is one, for this foul nomination process is  for us to grasp the power of this moment, for our country to act on the  power of this moment. This is about far more than a troubled and  troubling nominee. Something big is happening. Women across the  country, like these extraordinary women in Rhode Island, are  reconciling with their truth, fighting through a long and deeply unfair  legacy of shame, fear, and stigma. They are stepping up. They are  coming forward, determined, as one wrote to me to leave a different  world for their daughters and granddaughters than the world that  silenced them for years, for decades.   For me, it is a true personal honor to share this moment with them,  to be trusted with these long-held stories, to have the chance to help  end that bitterly unfair legacy, and to support them toward that new  and better world for their daughters and granddaughters.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S6613]]                       [From The Washington Post, Oct. 5, 2018]                     Is The Supreme Court Salvageable?                            (By Jennifer Rubin)         Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh's frantic op-ed in the Wall Street       Journal insisting that he is a fair, impartial judge--and       that we should disregard his partisan, unhinged diatribe and       nonjudicial demeanor during last week's Senate testimony--      serves as some recognition that the partisan wars in which he       has taken up arms now threaten the legitimacy of the Supreme       Court. Other than denying a seat to an overt partisan such as       Kavanaugh, what can be done to recapture at least the       illusion that the high court is something more than another       blue-vs.-red battlefield?        It helps to understand how we got here, how we got to the       point at which a Supreme Court nominee doesn't bother to       conceal his animosity toward an entire political party.        The federal judiciary and the selection process for it were       not intended as expressions of representative democracy. We       didn't even directly elect senators who in turn confirmed       judges until the 17th Amendment. It wasn't intended to be an       expression of popular will. The expansion of judicial power       in the 20th century was a mixed blessing to be sure, serving       as both a last line of defense for individual rights against       a growing administrative state and an imperfect, sometimes       counterproductive tool for ameliorating deep social       conflicts. (As an aside, an unelected judiciary with vastly       expanded power used to be the right's nemesis; now it is a       political prize and a midterm election base-pleaser.)        The high court certainly became a bone of contention for       the right during the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren, but       the nature of the justices and the institution itself changed       when our parties become more overtly ideological, with fewer       centrists. Still, matters were not dire for the court due to       a very undemocratic instrument--the filibuster. That required       some small degree of consensus for judicial confirmation and       bestowed greater legitimacy on the courts. A justice       acceptable to at least a small number of the opposition       party's members had to contain his or her partisanship; he or       she couldn't be a gladiator for one side or the other.        Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decided that he had enough of       that. He envisioned the Supreme Court as simply another arena       for bare-knuckle brawls. Custom and comity went out the door.       He denied a mainstream liberal judge, Merrick Garland, so       much as a hearing. He did away with the filibuster for the       high court. Post Opinions contributing columnist Ron Klain,       speaking to the New Yorker, put it brilliantly: ``If       [Republicans] can, they will.''        Republicans saw no need to release all of Kavanaugh's       records. What could Democrats do other than holler? They saw       no need to take Christine Blasey Ford's allegations seriously       (they'd ``plow right through,'' McConnell said). So what if       Democrats squawked? With impunity they could order an FBI       inquiry designed to hopscotch around problems for Kavanaugh       (e.g. his claims about drinking). Democrats didn't have the       votes to block him, and the GOP moderates could be counted on       to crumble. Hence we got a Supreme Court nominee pleading his       case on Fox News and the Wall Street Journal op-ed page.        In some respect, the fix for the Supreme Court is the same       as the fix for our politics--leveling a right-wing populist       party that abhors democratic norms and building a center-left       to center-right coalition. (Some structural reforms such as       ranked voting, eliminating gerrymandering and automatic voter       registration would help.)        In the near-term, the goal would be to depoliticize the       Supreme Court, reducing the vicious partisanship that       accompanies a lifetime appointment. A term limit of 12 to 15       years for justices and a 60-vote threshold seem increasingly       attractive. A constitutional amendment would be needed for       the former and probably for the latter (unless both sides       finally agree that losing the filibuster has been a       disaster). That's no easy task considering that an amendment       must be proposed by either a two-thirds vote by both houses       of Congress, or a call by two-thirds of the state       legislatures for a constitutional convention (a prospect so       alarming given the extremism and anti-democratic passions of       the day that it should be avoided at all costs). However,       given the right's former antipathy toward a powerful       executive and the left's recent experience in a hyper-      politicized nomination process, it might be doable.        The Supreme Court can do its part as well. It has resisted       adopting its own ethics rules, including guidelines for       recusal. That should end. Justices have become less reticent       about making public, political remarks. That should end as       well. Judges should eschew appearances before overtly       ideological groups. If they act more like judges of old, they       might recapture some of the luster the Supreme Court once       had.        We've witnessed the destruction of a slew of executive       branch norms and the collapse of Congress (which is now a       partisan handmaiden to the president rather than a coequal       branch of government). If we let the court go to seed, we       will have pulled off a trifecta. But it's not an       accomplishment that any of us should seek.                                   ____                                      Katz, Marshall & Banks, llp,                                    Washington, DC, October 4, 2018.      Re Supplemental Background Investigation of Judge Brett M.           Kavanaugh--UPDATED       Hon. Christopher A. Wray,      Federal Bureau of Investigation.        Dear Director Wray: As you are aware, the Federal Bureau of       Investigation failed to interview our client, Dr. Christine       Blasey Ford, in connection with its Supplemental Background       Investigation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh. It also declined       to interview witnesses whose names we provided to the FBI as       possessing information highly relevant to Dr. Ford's       allegations. We write to provide you with the names of       several of the witnesses we requested that the FBI interview       in connection with this matter. None were contacted nor, to       our knowledge, were more than a dozen other names we provided       to the FBI whose interviews would have challenged the       credibility of Judge Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate       Committee on the Judiciary on September 27, 2018. They remain       available to talk with law enforcement.        Jeremiah Hanafin:        Mr. Hanafin is a former FBI agent and professional       polygraph examiner. He conducted Dr. Ford's polygraph       examination on August 7, 2018, and determined that Dr. Ford's       responses were not indicative of deception. Mr. Hanafin had       the data from the examination reviewed by four independent       reviewers, who all agreed with his conclusions. Mr. Hanafin       would be able to discuss the examination with the FBI, as       well as provide the polygraph examination data to the FBI for       its independent review. He also would have been able to       refute the false statements made in Rachel Mitchell's report       about Dr. Ford's mental state on the day of the examination.        Russell Ford:        As described in his sworn declaration provided to the       Judiciary Committee, in 2012 Dr. Ford told her husband and       their couples therapist that she was sexually assaulted by       Brett Kavanaugh when she was in high school. He can explain       how and why this issue arose in therapy. Mr. Ford has been       married to Dr. Ford since 2002 and can attest to her       character and credibility.        Keith Koegler:        As described in his sworn declaration provided to the       Judiciary Committee, Dr. Ford told Mr. Koegler in 2016 that       she was assault led by a man who was then (in 2016) a federal       judge. Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy's resignation       and prior to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, Dr. Ford sent an       email to Mr. Koegler naming Judge Kavanaugh as her assailant.       Mr. Koegler has been close friends with Dr. Ford for over       five years and can attest to her character and credibility.        Adela Gildo-Mazzon:        As described in her sworn declaration provided to the       Judiciary Committee, in 2013 Dr. Ford told Ms. Gildo-Mazzon       that she was previously sexually assaulted by a man who was       then (in 2013) a federal judge. Ms. Gildo-Mazzon has been       friends with Dr. Ford for over ten years and can attest to       her character and credibility.        Rebecca Olson:        As described in her sworn declaration provided to the       Judiciary Committee, in 2017 Dr. Ford told Ms. Olson that she       was previously sexually assaulted by a man who was then (in       2017) a federal judge. Ms. Olson has been friends with Dr.       Ford for over six years and can attest to her character and       credibility.        Kirsten Leimroth:        In interviews with the media, Ms. Leimroth described a       lunch meeting with Dr. Ford and Jim Gensheimer at a beachside       restaurant with Dr. Ford in early July 2018, before Judge       Kavanaugh was nominated. At that meeting, Ms. Leimroth says       Dr. Ford named Judge Kavanaugh as her assailant and described       her fears about what would happen if her name and her       accusations against Judge Kavanaugh became public. Ms.       Leimroth is a family friend of Dr. Ford's and can attest to       her character and credibility. See https:// www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/17/metoo-spurred-christine- blasey-ford-to-open-up-about-alleged-attack-year-before- kavanaugh-nomination-friends-say/.        Jim Gensheimer:        In interviews with the media, Mr. Gensheimer described a       lunch meeting at a beachside restaurant with Dr. Ford and Ms.       Leimroth in early July 2018--the same meeting as the one       described by Ms. Leimroth--before Judge Kavanaugh was       nominated. At that meeting, Mr. Gensheimer says Dr. Ford       named Judge Kavanaugh as her assailant and described her       fears about what would happen if her name and her accusations       against Judge Kavanaugh became public. Mr. Gensheimer has       been friends with Dr. Ford for over eight years and can       attest to her character and credibility. See https:// www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/17/metoo-spurred-christine- blasey-ford-to-open-up-about-alleged-attack-year-before- kavanaugh-nomination-friends-say/; https://www.cnn.com/2018/ 09/18/politics/kavanaugh-accuser-friend/index.html.        Monica L. McLean:        Ms. McLean has been friends with Dr. Ford for many years. A       letter released to the public on the night of October 2,       2018, apparently written by Brian Merrick, an ex-boyfriend of       Dr. Ford during her 20's, falsely claims that Dr. Ford helped       Ms. McLean prepare for a potential polygraph examination       sometime in the 1990's. Ms. McLean can attest to the falsity       of the claims contained in this letter, as well as the       character and credibility of Dr. Ford and that of the former       boyfriend.        It has come to our attention that another person who       requested anonymity came forward to the FBI with information       highly relevant to Judge Kavanaugh's behavior in high  [[Page S6614]]       school and was turned away. His sworn statement was published       on October 3, 2018 in the New Yorker: https:// www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/will-the-fbi-ignore- testimonies-from-kavanaughs-former-classmates.        In addition, had the FBI interviewed Dr. Ford, she would       have provided her direct account of Judge Kavanaugh's assault       and answered any questions about it, including questions that       Ms. Mitchell and the Judiciary Committee members were       unwilling or unable to ask during the hearing. She would have       also provided corroborating evidence, including her medical       records and access to the phone from which she messaged The       Washington Post about Judge Kavanaugh's assault prior to his       nomination to the Supreme Court. The FBI could have also       asked her about her conversations with the witnesses       referenced above in order to establish those witnesses'       credibility. Such an interview would have played a crucial       role in providing the FBI with a full picture of all of the       facts involved in this important and serious matter.        We were heartened on September 28, 2018, when Senators       Flake and Coons announced that the FBI would conduct a       supplemental background investigation. All those mentioned       above, and more, could easily have been interviewed in the       time allotted. It took tremendous courage for Dr. Ford to       come forward. As she testified before the Judiciary       Committee, she was eager to talk to the FBI. The       ``investigation'' conducted over the past five days is a       stain on the process, on the FBI and on our American ideal of       justice.            Sincerely,      Debra S. Katz,      Lisa J. Banks,      Michael R. Bromwich,        Attorneys for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.                                   ____                                               Kaiser Dillon pllc,                                    Washington, DC, October 4, 2018.      Hon. Christopher A. Wray,      Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,      c/o Dana Boente, General Counsel.        Dear Director Wray: My firm represents Deborah Ramirez, as       does the law firm of Hutchinson Black and Cook, LLC. As you       likely know, a reporter recently reached out to Ms. Ramirez       to ask about an incident involving Brett Kavanaugh, President       Trump's nominee for the United States Supreme Court. Ms.       Ramirez answered the reporter's questions, and he, after       interviewing a number of additional witnesses, wrote a story:       https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats- investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the- supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-  ramirez.        As you likely also are aware, two of your agents met with       Ms. Ramirez this past Sunday, September 30, 2018, in       Colorado. Ms. Ramirez spoke with the agents for approximately       two hours, answering a host of detailed questions. Ms.       Ramirez offered credible and compelling information--as       everyone in the room would acknowledge.        Later that day, Ms. Ramirez, through counsel, provided the       FBI with a list of more than twenty additional witnesses       likely to have relevant information. Ms. Ramirez suspected       that a number of those individuals could corroborate her       account of Mr. Kavanaugh's behavior.        Fewer than four days later, however, the FBI apparently has       concluded its investigation--without permitting its agents to       investigate. We are deeply disappointed by this failure. We       can only conclude that the FBI--or those controlling its       investigation--did not want to learn the truth behind Ms.       Ramirez's allegations.        We know this much, however: If your agents had been       permitted to investigate Ms. Ramirez's allegations, they       would have uncovered substantial corroboration. Just last       night, The New Yorker published a new article: https:// www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/will-the-fbi-ignore- testimonies-from-kavanaughs-former-classmates. That article       highlights Dr. Kenneth Appold, a professor at the Princeton       Theological Seminary. The article reports that, at the time       of the relevant incident, Dr. Appold was a Yale       undergraduate, a resident of the relevant dormitory (Lawrence       Hall), and a suitemate of Mr. Kavanaugh. The article further       reports that Dr. Appold has confirmed that, shortly after the       relevant incident occurred, he learned of it, including that       Ms. Ramirez was the victim and Mr. Kavanaugh the perpetrator.       Dr. Appold is one of the witnesses that Ms. Ramirez had       suggested that the FBI contact; the FBI never did.        Dr. Appold apparently himself recounted this incident,       years ago, to another individual, Michael Wetstone. The New       Yorker article cited immediately above reports that Mr.       Wetstone has confirmed that Dr. Appold in fact relayed the       story in late 1980s or early 1990s. Mr. Wetstone is another       of the witnesses that Ms. Ramirez had suggested that the FBI       contact; the FBI apparently never did.        If your agents had been permitted to investigate, they       would have uncovered still more corroboration:        Dr. Richard Oh is an emergency room doctor in Santa Clara,       California. He attended Yale for his undergraduate studies,       between 1983 and 1987, i.e., at the same time as Ms. Ramirez       and Mr. Kavanaugh. He recalls, during his freshman year at       Yale, a female student ``emotionally reporting'' what can       only have been the same incident as described by Ms. Ramirez.       See Decl. of Dr. Richard Oh (Oct. 3, 2018), attached. Dr. Oh       is another of the witnesses that Ms. Ramirez had suggested       that the FBI contact; the FBI never did.        There may be many additional witnesses who could offer       still further corroboration (if any additional corroboration       were needed, which it is not). But we likely never will know,       given that your agents were barred from investigating. What       we do know, despite that lack of investigation, is that       multiple witnesses have corroborated Ms. Ramirez's       allegations. Respectfully, your agents should have been       permitted to develop that information.            Sincerely,                                                   William Pittard.     I yield the floor.
