 Mr. Speaker, one good thing about voting for this bill  is the rhetoric we are hearing from this Chamber today. It sounds like  the drumbeat from high school guidance counselors, college recruiters,  and politicians kowtowing to the education lobby that everybody has to  go to a 4-year college or that it is even wise for people to go to a 4- year college is beginning to come to an end.   I am glad, under this bill, we are going to make it easier for  students to get a degree focused on skills. For some, that degree could  be 1 year; for some, it could be 2 years. Frequently, these degrees  lead to jobs that are higher paying than many jobs that you get after  you have a 4-year degree.   Not only are they higher paying, but I think they result in more job  security because you are not a generalist who will get laid off when  you are 45 or 50 and not find a job. But if you have a skill, that  skill is something in which you can still get a job when you are 50,  55, 60, or 65. Therefore, I am proud to announce for this bill today.
