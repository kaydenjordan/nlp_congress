 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this is the 28th closed rule we are considering in  Congress. Let me repeat that. This is the 28th closed rule that we are  considering in this Congress. That means that 64 percent of the rules  that the Republican leadership has brought to the floor this year have  been completely closed, with no opportunity for Democrats or  Republicans to offer their ideas to expand upon or improve the  legislation.   Under a closed rule, you can't even offer an amendment to fix a typo.  If somebody is in their office listening to the debate on this bill and  has an idea on how to improve it, they are denied that opportunity to  offer any amendments on the floor--in short, no amendments.   Mr. Speaker, this place is called the people's House. Maybe it should  be called the Russia House because this is the way they legislate in  Russia, completely closed, no opportunity for different ideas to be  brought before the Congress and debated.   I have never, in all my years in Congress, experienced a more  authoritarian approach to legislating than I have in this Congress. I  have never encountered a more closed Congress than this Congress is.   This is not right, and it should not be considered normal. Not only  Democrats should be outraged, but Republicans ought to be outraged as  well.   You know, I wish my Republican friends had learned something from the  collapse of their healthcare bill a few weeks ago. They rushed to the  floor a bill cobbled together in the dark of night, filled with bribes  and backroom deals. In fact, to strong-arm Members into voting for the  bill and to correct for all the technical drafting errors that occurred  thanks to their secretive process, there were not one, not two, not  even three, but five--that is right, five--separate manager's  amendments filed with the Rules Committee.   Now, let me explain that.   Only the people who wrote the bill were allowed to amend it. They  wrote it so quickly, so sloppily, that they had to amend their  amendments. I mean, this would be laughable if it weren't so tragic.  And even after all of that, they were not able to piece together votes  within their own Conference, and the bill imploded.   Well, it was a mess from beginning to end; and, to put it bluntly,  the process was a disaster. Don't take it from me. Listen to Sean  Hannity of FOX News. Now, don't adjust your television set. I am  actually going to quote FOX News--and Sean Hannity, at that. I can't  believe that he and I agree on something.   Here is what he said. According to a CNN report, he said: ``Now, this  legislation was flawed from the beginning. It was created behind closed  doors. Not one single Member saw the bill until it was rolled out. And  that made it a disaster.''   That is Sean Hannity, one of President Trump's biggest cheerleaders,  one of the biggest cheerleaders of my Republican friends. Here he is  trashing the Republican health bill. And if that is not a wake-up call  for Republicans, I don't know what is. You know, if Republicans are  being criticized on their process by Sean Hannity, they have a serious  problem.   Now we are reading that Republicans are again huddling in back rooms  in the Capitol in an effort to resurrect their terrible plan to repeal  the Affordable Care Act, strip important protections away from our  constituents, and put insurance companies in charge of our health care.  There it is on the front page of today's Washington Post: ``GOP Presses  for New Health Plan.''   Now, I haven't been invited to any of these secret backroom  negotiations, but from what we are hearing, it isn't good. It seems  that things are not looking good for hospitals. MassDevice alerted us  to the fact that: ``Hospital Stocks Fall as GOP Looks to Revive  TrumpCare Bill.''   It appears as though Republicans are still working to make their bill  even more devastating. Mother Jones reported: ``TrumpCare 2.0 Still  Isn't Cruel Enough to Satisfy Conservatives.''   Yesterday, Tribune Media Wire wrote about: ``How the Revised  TrumpCare Plan Could Hit Americans with Preexisting Conditions.''   I include in the Congressional Record, Mr. Speaker, an article that  appears in today's New York Times about how the latest health proposal  weakens coverage for preexisting conditions.                  [From the New York Times, Apr. 4, 2017]   Republican Health Proposal Would Undermine Coverage for Pre-Existing                                 Conditions                          (By Margot Sanger-Katz)         Throughout the debate to repeal and replace the Affordable       Care Act, President Trump and Republican congressional       leaders have insisted they would retain a crucial, popular       part of the health law: the promise that people can buy       insurance even if they've had illnesses in the past.  [[Page H2710]]         Their efforts foundered last month, when a House health       bill had to be pulled from the floor after it failed to       attract enough support. Late Monday night, word emerged that       the White House and the group of conservative lawmakers known       as the Freedom Caucus had discussed a proposal to revive the       bill. But the proposed changes would effectively cast the       Affordable Care Act's pre-existing conditions provision       aside.        The terms, described by Representative Mark Meadows,       Republican of North Carolina and the head of the Freedom       Caucus, are something like this: States would have the option       to jettison two major parts of the Affordable Care Act's       insurance regulations. They could decide to opt out of       provisions that require insurers to cover a standard, minimum       package of benefits, known as the essential health benefits.       And they could decide to do away with a rule that requires       insurance companies to charge the same price to everyone who       is the same age, a provision called community rating.        The proposal is not final, but Mr. Meadows told reporters       after the meeting that his members would be interested in       such a bill. To pass the House, any bill would need to find       favor not just with the Freedom Caucus, but also with more       moderate Republicans. It would also need to attract the       support of nearly every Republican in the Senate to become       law.        The ability to opt out of the benefit requirements could       substantially reduce the value of insurance on the market. A       patient with cancer might, for example, still be allowed to       buy a plan, but it wouldn't do her much good if that plan was       not required to cover chemotherapy drugs.        The second opt-out would make the insurance options for       those with pre-existing conditions even more meaningless.        Technically, the deal would still prevent insurers from       denying coverage to people with a history of illness. But       without community rating, health plans would be free to       charge those patients as much as they wanted. If both of the       Obamacare provisions went away, the hypothetical cancer       patient might be able to buy only a plan, without       chemotherapy coverage, that costs many times more than a       similar plan costs a healthy customer. Only cancer patients       with extraordinary financial resources and little interest in       the fine print would sign up.        There is a reason that many conservatives want to do away       with these provisions. Because they help people with       substantial health care needs buy relatively affordable       coverage, they drive up the price of insurance for people who       are healthy. An insurance market that did not include cancer       care--or even any cancer patients--would be one where       premiums for the remaining customers were much lower. The       result might be a market that is much more affordable for       people with a clean bill of health. But it would become       largely inaccessible to anyone who really needs help paying       for medical care.        We do not have to speculate to know what the world looks       like without essential health benefits and community rating.       It was how most state insurance markets worked before       Obamacare. Back in 2009, most sick people who did not get       insurance through work or a government program were excluded       from coverage if they had a history of health problems like       allergies or arthritis. Plans that did not cover pregnancy       care or drug addiction treatment were widespread. (The data       about individual market insurance premiums is a little       spotty, but it appears that they were substantially lower in       most states.)        One idea Republicans have about how to care for the sick       was also in effect pre-Obamacare. Many states had ``high-risk       pools,'' where people shut out of the traditional insurance       markets could buy special plans with the help of state       subsidies. The Freedom Caucus proposal is likely to include       some money that states could use to set up such pools.        ``The fundamental idea is that marginally sick people would       pay with risk associated with their coverage,'' Mr. Meadows       said Monday. ``Those that have, you know, premiums that would       be driven up because of catastrophic illness or long-term       illnesses, we've been dealing with that for a long time with       high-risk pools.''        But insurance in the old high-risk pools tended to be       expensive, and often came with long waiting periods or       benefit limitations, even for the very sick.        The main difference between the policy environment in 2009       and today is that the federal government would now be       offering tax credits to help healthy people buy what would       probably be relatively skimpy plans. That would mean that       more middle-income Americans would probably have health       coverage than before the Affordable Care Act, since the       combination of policies would tend to make insurance much       more affordable for people who are young and healthy.        What states would choose to do with this set of options is       hard to predict. Before Obamacare, few states required       community rating of health plans. And few states required       insurers to cover all of the benefits deemed essential under       Obamacare, though most did require a few types of treatments       to be covered. State governments would face a difficult       choice: either take away the requirements, and leave sick       patients without insurance options, or keep them and see       people unable to afford coverage under the new subsidy       system.        Under Obamacare, states can already waive many of the law's       insurance rules if they can show that an alternative program       would cover as many people with comprehensive coverage at a       lower cost to the government. But that standard is difficult       to meet. Mr. Meadows suggested that the waivers under       discussion should be ``very easily granted'' to states.        The politics of health care in the United States have       shifted since the Affordable Care Act was passed seven years       ago. In recent months, the law has grown more popular, and       the pre-existing conditions policy is among its best-known       protections. That could create political pressure for states       to keep the insurance rules, even if they are not required by       law. But it is likely that at least some states might decide       to eliminate them if they are made optional. Shifting norms       about health insurance regulation may also affect the idea's       reception in Congress.        Mr. Meadows said that the proposal presented to the Freedom       Caucus would retain the pre-existing conditions policy. But       that would be true in only the most literal sense. The mix of       policies could allow insurance companies to charge sick       people prices that few of them could pay. And it could allow       them to exclude benefits that many healthy people need when       they get sick. The result could be a world where people with       pre-existing conditions would struggle to buy comprehensive       health insurance--just like before Obamacare.        Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.     Mr. Speaker, I mean, preexisting conditions. Oh, my  God. What are my friends thinking about?   And we are reading that essential health benefits are still on the  chopping block.   You know, these are some of the main provisions of the ACA that  people like, that people need, and that people deserve.   Protecting essential health benefits in people with preexisting  conditions is our moral obligation. Taking these protections away from  people would be cruel and unjust and immoral. I would say to my  Republican friends: You don't have to do it.   But I guess we will have to wait and see until these secret  negotiators emerge from their back rooms with details to share. And I  will start getting ready for the next emergency Rules Committee. I am  looking forward to that meeting because that will probably be the only  time we will have to talk about the bill because I think it is probably  too much to expect that my Republican friends would actually, this time  around, hold a hearing. Maybe they will bypass a markup, but they will  have to go to the Rules Committee in an emergency meeting, and we will  probably look forward to another martial law rule.   But we are doing this bill today that no one has ever heard of. It  was a noncontroversial suspension bill last year, but now we lift it up  like it is the most important piece of business that we are facing in  America today. You know, what about the urgent priorities facing our  country?   I think it is clear that Speaker Ryan and the majority leader are  grasping for filler legislation to keep us busy on the House floor so  that the American people really don't see really how dysfunctional this  majority really is.   Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Member of the Republican  Conference, said, and I think he said it best last week when he said:  ``It's pretty evident that we don't have the votes among Republicans to  do, in essence, anything that's real.''   Maybe that is why we are wasting our time this week on these bills  instead of moving an infrastructure package or finishing the FY17  appropriations process, which should have been finalized last year.   I will remind my Republican colleagues that our government runs out  of funding on April 28. That is 5 legislative days from now, since we  are going on break at the end of this week. Now, maybe, again, this is  a radical idea, but maybe we should be dealing with that today.   I am beginning to give up hope for regular order in the  appropriations process under the Republican leadership, but I would  have thought we would at least have some insight about a funding bill  by now. Again, 5 legislative days from now, the government potentially  could be shut down.   Maybe some of you think that the underlying legislation that this  rule would allow us to consider, a bill to increase the number of  companies that are exempted from certain SEC regulations, is vitally  important. Maybe you are being inundated with calls about this issue. I  don't know. Maybe your townhalls are overflowing with people  [[Page H2711]]  demanding this SEC suspension bill, but I am certain that no Member of  this body could say with a straight face that this is somehow more  important than keeping the entire Federal Government open.   For the life of me, I don't understand why we always have to get  right up to the edge of the cliff, but here we are again. Today is just  the latest example that the priorities of this Republican leadership do  not serve the American people.   I would urge my colleagues to think about this as we spend time in  our districts over the next 2 weeks. Maybe, when we get back, Congress  can actually do its job and fund the government and focus on things  that are important like a jobs bill or an infrastructure bill instead  of more of the same Republican messaging bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am glad the gentleman from Michigan believes that closed rules are  regular order--maybe in Russia, but that is not supposed to be the norm  here in the people's House. We have an obligation to actually debate  serious bills.   Right now, my Republican friends are behind closed doors somewhere in  the Capitol debating healthcare legislation. And what I am against is  this whole process. This is backwards. My Republican friends ought to  be out in the open debating health care. They ought to be doing  hearings. This is what I am objecting to.   In the scheme of things, this is a relatively minor piece of  legislation, compared to my Republican friends' plans to repeal the  Affordable Care Act.   Yes, we should be debating Russia and all the ties that the Trump  administration has with Russia. The question  [[Page H2712]]  used to be: Who in the administration has ties with Russia? Now the  question is: Who in this administration doesn't have ties with Russia?  Yes, those are important things we ought to be talking about. But, come  on.   What we are objecting to is you bringing filler to the floor while,  in secret, you are trying to dismantle health care in a way that we  believe will harm millions and millions of Americans; that will take  away their protections, those who have preexisting conditions; that  will throw millions of people off of their insurance; that will take  away essential health benefits. Yeah, that is important to us, and it  is important to the American people.   What we are objecting to is a process where you debate these issues  in secret and you bring stuff like this to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, this week, President Trump signed a bill to allow  internet service providers to sell their customers' sensitive  information. This information includes location, financial and health  data, information about customers' children, Social Security numbers,  web browsing history, app usage history, and the content of their  customers' communications, such as emails and video chats.   Yet, amazingly, President Trump's tax return information is still off  limits to the American people. Every President since Gerald Ford has  disclosed his tax return information. These returns have provided a  basic level of transparency that has helped to ensure the public's  interest is placed first.   So the message from President Trump and the Republican Party is  clear: It is okay for companies to profit off your medical and  financial information, or information contained in your private emails,  but the American voter is not allowed to know if the President has any  conflicts of interest. That is right. Donald Trump's privacy matters,  but your privacy doesn't.   Internet companies can auction off your private, personal information  to the highest bidder. But information related to Donald Trump's  business life must be kept secret.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better, and it is incumbent  upon us, as the people's elected Representatives, to hold the executive  branch accountable.   So I am going to ask people to vote ``no'' on the previous question.  And if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to  the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, which will require  Presidents and major party nominees for the Presidency to release their  tax returns.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, this is a big deal. The American people  have a right to know because the American people are concerned that  this White House is on a collision course with corruption. It is time  to let a little light shine on the President's tax returns so the  American people know what his dealings have been and know what, quite  frankly, they have been able to know about every other President and  every other major party nominee.   I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Eshoo) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to be clear so that my good friend from  Colorado understands where I am coming from.   I don't really care about this bill. I think it is a noncontroversial  bill that, quite frankly, probably could be approved by voice vote if  it were brought up that way.   The point I am trying to make is that this is a relatively minor bill  compared to some of the important issues that we need to deal with. It  is troublesome to me that, on this bill, which my friend from Colorado  said involved years of hearings and where the sponsor of the bill  consulted with Democratic colleagues--I favor all of that. But what I  am really outraged about is that, while we are talking about this  relatively inconsequential bill and about how wonderful this process  around this bill is, there are meetings going on in secret, right now,  with my Republican colleagues, on dismantling health care in this  country, conversations that might result in tens of millions of  Americans losing their health insurance, conversations involving taking  away essential benefits from insurance packages, conversations that  would basically remove protections for people who have preexisting  conditions.    All of this is going on in secret. We are reading about it in the  press. I am sure my colleagues know about it because they are reading  about it. Maybe they are proud of these secret meetings. I want to know  where these secret meetings are.   I am simply saying to my friends on the other side of the aisle, on  something as big as health care, you ought to be having these meetings  out in the open. There ought to be hearings. You ought to bring in  patients and patient advocate groups. You ought to bring in doctors,  nurses, and heads of hospitals. You ought to bring in people who are  going to be affected by any kind of changes you make in our healthcare  policy.   Instead, it is being done behind closed doors, in secret, and I think  the American people are outraged by that. That is one of the reasons  why the bill you brought to the floor recently only had 17 percent  support amongst the American people.   So what we are objecting to is the fact that we are not bringing to  the floor matters that are urgent, like keeping the government running  and like an infrastructure bill. We are also objecting to the fact that  we are reading that my Republican friends are, once again, behind  closed doors negotiating another healthcare bill that we think will do  great damage to the health care of a lot of people in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and  I will close for our side.   Mr. Speaker, I want to alert my Republican colleagues to some recent  polls that came out today. There is a poll that Qinnipiac did that said  that Trump is more unpopular than Obama ever was, and, today, President  Trump's approval rating is at 35 percent. That is down from 37 percent,  and that is the lowest, I think, of any President this early on in his  Presidency. I think the lowest rating ever was President George W.  Bush. It was at 28 percent, but it took 8 years, two unpopular wars,  and a staggering economy to get to that point. But with President  Trump, we are already at 35 percent. The Gallup Poll says his approval  is at 39 percent.   By the way, the Affordable Care Act, according to Kaiser, now polls  at 55 percent approval rating, and the Republican Congress is about as  low as President Trump is right now.   I am trying to think of the words to help my colleagues understand  what these polls mean. I guess ``not good'' comes to mind, or ``very,  very bad.'' I don't think, even if you tried, you could get poll  numbers so low so early on in a new Congress or so early on in a new  administration.   I would say to my friends the reason for this unpopularity is the way  you are conducting business in our government, that the closed  processes that are being used with regard to legislation I think are  unprecedented. There has never been a more closed Congress than this  one. You were pretty closed last session as well. This is a terrible  pattern.   I agree with my friend, Mr. Buck, on one thing he said. The gentleman  said yesterday that good process produces good policy, but perhaps  equally as important, good process helps instill faith in this  institution. I agree with that. I could have said those remarks here  today.   My question is: If that is the case, why are my Republican friends  tolerating a process on healthcare reform that is now going on that is  being done behind closed doors in some back room somewhere in this  building with no input from patients or patient advocate groups or  doctors or nurses or hospitals or anybody who has anything to do with  health care? Why, on something so important, is the process so closed  and so restrictive and so secretive?   I will tell you, just as this closed process led to a disastrous  Republican healthcare bill recently, this continued closed process will  lead to more disaster. This is not the way we should be doing the  people's business. So we  [[Page H2714]]  strongly object to the way the Republicans are running this House and,  in fact, the way the President is handling this issue as well.   It is always nice to see Vice President Pence in the hallway when he  is walking back and forth, but it would be better to see him in a  public setting talking about what the administration's priorities are,  not rushing from one back room to another back room to another back  room trying to make secret deals to get more people to vote for  something when they have no idea what is in the legislation. That is  not the way of doing business. So we object to the process.   Again, I urge my colleagues to also vote ``no'' on the previous  question so we can have an opportunity to see President Trump's tax  returns. Every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax  returns, every major Presidential candidate, and every day we read in  the newspaper about more and more potential conflicts of interest  between the President and his family. I have to tell you, we are on a  collision course with corruption. The President has promised to drain  the swamp. He has created a cesspool, and it should be of concern to  every single person in this Chamber, Democrat and Republican alike.   I don't think it is too much to ask for transparency when it comes to  the person who is our Commander in Chief. I shudder to think if Hillary  Clinton had won the Presidency and didn't release her tax returns,  the outrage that would be coming from the other side of the aisle. I  can't even imagine how much outrage would be coming from them.    Yet when Donald Trump hides his financial information from Congress  and the American people, there is silence; people don't want to know.  Well, the majority of people do. Poll after poll show the overwhelming  majority of Americans want to know what is in his tax returns.   Why is this such a state secret? Why can't people see what they want  to see and what they have been given with every other President?   So this is an opportunity to put this issue behind us, and if there  is nothing controversial in his taxes, well, then this issue goes away  and we can talk about something else. But maybe there is something he  is hiding. Maybe there is something that we should be concerned about.  Maybe there are conflicts of interest that might be constitutionally  questionable. Maybe there are ties to Russia that would cause my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle more concern.   This idea of hiding this has to stop. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on the previous question and vote ``no'' on the underlying rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
