 Mr. President, I am announcing my intention to object to  any unanimous consent request to proceed to S. 1080, the Cooper Davis  Act.   There is no question that there is a fentanyl epidemic in the United  States. However, this bill fails to offer serious solutions to this  epidemic. Instead, it would mandate that platforms scan their users'  communications for anything that could be interpreted as being about  selling or using drugs. Given this country's experience with the failed  ``War on Drugs'' it is easy to predict that communities of color will  disproportionately have their conversations surveilled and referred for  prosecutions, which is why it is opposed by civil rights groups,  including the ACLU, NAACP and Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  Rights. Further, forcing a platform to decide what represents a drug  transaction means that lots of innocent people will be referred for  investigation and prosecution. Finally, the reporting structure of this  legislation is likely to produce large numbers of meritless referrals  to the Drug Enforcement Administration and do little to address the  real causes of the fentanyl epidemic or protect vulnerable communities.   Given these concerns, I will object to any unanimous consent request  in relation to this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am announcing my intention to object to  any unanimous consent request to proceed to S. 1199, the Strengthening  Transparency and Obligations to Protect Children Suffering from Abuse  and Mistreatment Act of 2023.   The protection of children from exploitation and abuse is an  incredibly serious issue. The criminals that create and distribute  child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, need to be hunted down and locked  up. The victims of their crimes need critical support. However, this  bill would limit the availability of encrypted communications, making  children and families less safe. Indeed, whistleblowers, human rights  activists, journalists, labor organizers, and women seeking  reproductive care, as well our children and families, all depend on  secure and private communications and would suffer the harms of its  unavailability.   The portions of this bill that hurt the availability of encrypted  communications are extraneous and stray from the ostensible purpose of  the bill. Until  [[Page S3455]]  they are removed, I will object to any unanimous consent request in  relation to this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am announcing my intention to object to  any unanimous consent request to proceed to S. 1207, the Eliminating  Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act of 2023.
