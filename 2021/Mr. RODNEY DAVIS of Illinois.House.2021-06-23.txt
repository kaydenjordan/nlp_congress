 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Champaign Police Officer Chris Oberheim of Monticello, Illinois, who  tragically lost his life in the line of duty on May 19 of this year.   Officer Oberheim was a 21-year veteran of law enforcement. He joined  the Champaign Police Department in 2013 after beginning his career with  the Decatur Police Department in 2000. During his career, he received  two medals of valor for selfless acts of bravery.   In his time off duty, Chris enjoyed coaching softball and spending  time with his family. He was a loving husband, father, son, coach, and  trusted friend. His four daughters were his inspiration. Those who knew  Chris remember him most for his commitment to loving his family and  serving his community.   My prayers are with his wife, Amber, and daughters Hannah, Avery,  Addison, and Aubree, as well as the rest of his family, friends, and  fellow officers. Chris was nothing short of a hero.   In closing, I would like to share a Bible verse that Chris' family  says he lived by: ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be  called children of God.''                          Honoring Grace Herschelman     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Grace Herschelman of Hillsboro, Illinois, who passed away on May 19 at  the age of 9 after a lifelong battle with infantile neuroaxonal  dystrophy, INAD.   When Grace was 3 years old, she was diagnosed with INAD, a  neurodegenerative disease that results in a loss of muscle strength,  movement, and the ability to speak. Grace did not let this stop her  from enjoying many trips to the Saint Louis Zoo; rooting on her  favorite soccer, softball, and basketball teams; and having a blast  with her sister and best friend, Charlotte.   Grace and her family also had a huge impact on awareness and  fundraising for INAD research. Since Grace was diagnosed in 2014, the  Herschelman family has raised about $200,000 for the INAD Cure  Foundation, with donors from all 50 States.   Grace was an inspiration to all who met her, never failing to light  up any room with her smile.   My prayers go out to her parents, Kyle and Mary, her sister,  Charlotte, and the rest of her family.   Grace, may you rest in peace.                         Congratulating Mark Butcher     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Mark Butcher on his retirement after 30 years of teaching  math and science in the Rochester school district, Lincoln Christian  University, and Lincoln Land Community College.   After working in the private sector for many years, Mark decided to  go back to school to get his teaching certificate in 1991. Ever since  then, he has taught at Rochester and also part-time at night at Lincoln  Land where he would frequent my family's McDonald's in Taylorville for  a quick dinner.   Over the past 30 years, Mark has taught, mentored, and given valuable  career advice to thousands of students. Mark is known for his Einstein- like appearance and science experiments, which were highly educational  but sometimes caused heartburn among the administration and school  board members. He was instrumental in developing the dual credit  program at Rochester, which has allowed hundreds of students to receive  college credit for courses while still in high school.   Mark received numerous awards throughout his career, including the  Rochester Teacher of the Year, the Golden Apple Excellence in  Leadership award, Lincoln Land's Outstanding Adjunct Faculty Award, and  being named the State Journal Register's Top Teacher of the Year.   Congratulations on your retirement, Mark. Enjoy your time with your  wife, Brenda, four children, and your six grandchildren.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan amendment to  the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, a bill that I  am proud to be working on with my good friend, Chairman Scott.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill provides an important fix caused by the  outcome of the 2019 Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., Supreme  Court decision in order to ensure that older workers can seek the  justice they deserve when they face age discrimination in the  workplace, on a level playing field.   The amendment that I introduced with Representative Chellie Pingree  highlights the discrimination that women face in the workplace based  not only on gender, but on age as well.   According to a 2018 report from the EEOC, women, especially older  women, but also those at middle age, were subjected to more age  discrimination than older men. Research suggests that ageism at work  begins at age 40 for women, 5 years earlier than men. This is  unacceptable and we must find ways to correct this problem.  [[Page H3065]]    This amendment would require the DOL and EEOC to conduct a  comprehensive study on these age discrimination cases. DOL and EEOC  would then be required to make recommendations for best practices to  combat age discrimination of women in the workplace.   Challenges that women face are not partisan issues and, together, we  should make every effort to address them. Employers should make, and  have the right tools to make, conscious efforts to ensure that women  have equal rights and opportunities in the workplace, regardless of  their age.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Pingree for co-leading this  amendment, and also Chairman Scott for his kind words and support of  its inclusion. I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment and to  vote ``yes'' on this amendment and the underlying bill to protect older  adults from workplace discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
