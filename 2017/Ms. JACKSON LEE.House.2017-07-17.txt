 Mr. Speaker, I support H.J. Res. 92 granting consent  and approval from Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State  of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to amend the Washington Area  Transit Regulation Compact.   As Houston is a major transportation hub, I understand and appreciate  the importance of this legislation.   The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), an  interstate compact agency, provides transportation services to millions  of people each year.   It is imperative that the WMATA be safe and effective because it is  essential to the commerce and prosperity of the National Capitol  Region.   The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State  of Maryland intend to create the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission  to act as the state safety oversight authority for the WMATA system  under 49 U.S.C. 5329.   In title III of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act  (section 3026, Public Law 114-94), the Congress provided sole authority  to the Secretary of Transportation to appoint Federal Directors to the  Board of Directors of  [[Page H5894]]  the WMATA and required the signatory parties to the Compact to amend  the Compact as necessary.   This compact is created for the benefit of the people of the District  of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland so  that there may be an increase in their safety, commerce, and  prosperity.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.J. Res. 92    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. J. Res.  76, which grants consent and approval from Congress for the  Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of  Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the  Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.   As Houston is a major transportation hub, I understand and appreciate  the importance of this legislation.   The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), an  interstate compact agency, provides transportation services to millions  of people each year.   It is imperative that the WMATA be safe and effective as it is  essential to the commerce and prosperity of the National Capitol  Region.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. J. Res. 76.    Mr. Speaker, I always applaud when the United States  steps in and takes a leadership role to prevent war. I have traveled to  the Mideast for many years as a Member of the United States Congress  representing my constituents.   I want to express my appreciation to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  for the energy that he is putting into engaging Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,  UAE, Jordan, Egypt, and Qatar to be able to stop the blockade and the  conflict that may continue to grow against Qatar.   This is a region that many of these countries have been allies of the  United States, the Southern Command is in Qatar, and, frankly, I think  they need to be united against those terrorists that plague them all.   I would also say that the UAE, as has been reported in the Nation's  newspapers, hacked into the emails of Qatar and put words in the mouths  of their government officials that were untrue. This is not the way to  proceed with peace and diplomacy.   So I believe we should energetically and aggressively engage these  countries to stop this blockade and begin to repair the collaborative  efforts to ensure that we fight the war on terror together and not  against.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Tillerson. I look forward to working with  him as a Member of the United States Congress to bring peace to that  region.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Veasey), the coleader of this hour, along with Delegate  Plaskett, for not only their astute leadership of the hour, but  certainly of their astute leadership of the issue. I am delighted to  join my colleagues. I thank the chair of the Congressional Black  Caucus, Mr. Cedric Richmond, for continuing to make sure that the  conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus, is heard on  these crucial issues.   Mr. Veasey, I am going to focus my issues--because this is not a  Republican or Democratic issue. It is an American issue. I do want to  personally thank you for your leadership as the named plaintiff of the  Texas voter ID litigation, which has been--how should I say? I wanted  to say Earth-shattering--but it has been groundbreaking in its  recognition of the diminishing of the rights of people to vote by a  draconian voter ID law. We know that it has been somewhat modified, but  your astuteness recognizes that, even in its modification, in the  coming elections, we should be very wary of the effort that the State  will utilize the voter ID law for voter suppression.   So today I want to rise in the backdrop of the Shelby case, which  many of us are well aware of. The Shelby case, which occurred in  Alabama, was the unfortunate case that turned back the clock on the  1965 Voting Rights Act that had been working for decades with  absolutely no problem; but, unfortunately, this conservative-leaning  Supreme Court made decisions not on what is good for America, not even  on what is good in terms of the law, but decided to eliminate section  5.                                time  1930    I am reminded of the very astute words of Justice Ginsburg, very  astute words, when she was appalled that the Supreme Court yielded to  what I would consider misinterpretation, that there is no problem with  discrimination and there is no problem with racism, and Justice  Ginsburg very astutely said: Well, we have been very fortunate that the  polio vaccination has all but extinguished polio in the United States.   That is great news. But because we have extinguished polio, does that  mean we need to get rid of the polio vaccination? And any commonsense  thinker, any American, any hardworking American, would absolutely,  because they love their children and their families, would have a  resounding ``no.''   So why would you get rid of section 5 when there is documentation,  unfortunately and sadly, of discrimination and of racism? Racism is a  question of being discriminated against because of race. It does not  say Black, it does not say any particular type of race, but it does  mention race. That means that section 5 was a protector for all  Americans and giving them the added protection of one vote, one person.   So, unfortunately, on June 28, 2017--and, by the way, Mr. Speaker,  the pending meeting of this established Commission, the Presidential  Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, PACEI, is going to be  meeting July 19, this week. This is a dangerous phenomenon.   The chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach wrote to the  Nation's secretaries of state requesting extensive personal information  on American voters--personal information, when we have stood in this  well fighting against the PATRIOT Act when it was not written well  after 9/11 because its premise was to spy on the American people and to  ignore the Fourth Amendment, which is to protect Americans against  unreasonable search and seizure.   This is unreasonable search and seizure. Let me list for you what  this Commission is asking for. Some of this is public knowledge, but  listen to this list: the full first and last names of all registrants;  middle names or initials, if available; addresses, dates of birth,  political party, if recorded in your State; last four digits of Social  Security, if available; voter history--voter history--what elections  you voted in from 2006 onward; active and inactive status.   I would venture to say that if I asked my Republican colleagues if  they want their constituents sending this information in I would hear a  little bit of grumbling.   Canceled status; information regarding any felony convictions.   All these are State issues.   Information regarding voter registration in another State;  information regarding military status; and overseas citizen  information.   First of all, there is no documentation of massive voter fraud.   ``The right to vote, and the sanctity and privacy of the vote, is  protected by the U.S. Constitution, including the Fifth, Fourteenth,  and Fifteenth Amendments. Due process. All of these allow you to have a  degree of privacy. It is an obligation of your administration,'' which  is a letter to President Trump that I am reading from, ``to preserve  the sanctity and privacy of the vote, not to undermine it as would be  the case if Texas were to comply with the PACEI's unconscionable  request. The only approved government use of voter registration data,  outside of voting, is jury selection, not a Presidential Advisory  Commission of dubious purpose formed to search for nonconsistent  evidence to vindicate your false claim that you lost the popular vote  by 2.9 million votes, the largest loss in American history, because  `millions of people who voted illegally.' ''   As you well know, that was a statement that no one can document by  this present administration. So this Presidential Advisory Commission  is a doubling down of an executive order to find a problem that does  not exist. It is a solution, a false solution, seeking to find a  problem. It is a dangerous proposition. It is an invasion of the  privacy of the American people. And any good person who believes in the  right to privacy, any conservative, liberal, moderate, anyone with any  political philosophy who believes in the Constitution of the United  States should stand arm in arm together against PACEI.   It is the beginning of Big Brother, the arm of Big Brother, the  frightening Big Brother, to intrude into the homes of the American  people and to secure information that is, in fact, challenging whether  you can move from one State to the next, challenging whether or not you  can have a voter card canceled or expired, challenging individuals who  have been given pardons but had a felony, and challenging military  persons who move from place to place. This is an insult, and this is  [[Page H5906]]  clearly voter suppression, not in any way a way to speak to the issue  of fraud.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to take this very seriously. I have  asked my State to stand down. I have asked the President to pull this  request, and I, frankly, believe this executive order should be  eliminated.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two documents related to this.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, July 6, 2017.      President Donald J. Trump,      The White House, Washington, DC.   Dear Mr. President: I am writing to urge you to rescind your May 11,  2017 Executive Order establishing the Presidential Advisory Commission  on Election Integrity (PACEI) and to direct that the PACEI be dissolved  immediately. The PACEI is charged with studying ``the registration and  voting processes used in Federal elections'' and identifying  ``vulnerabilities in voting systems'' that could lead to voter fraud.  Many people, however, suspect that the real purpose of the Commission  is not investigate widespread voter fraud, which every reputable study  has already debunked as a myth, but to gather data to aid in future  voter suppression efforts.   On June 28, 2017, PACEI Chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris  Kobach wrote to the nation's secretaries of state requesting extensive  personal information on American voters threatens to violate individual  privacy. Specifically, the PACEI seeks to obtain, inter alia: ``the  full first and last names of registrants, middle names or initials if  available, addresses, dates of birth, political party (if recorded in  your state), last four digits of social security number if available,  voter history (elections voted in) from 2006 onward, active/inactive  status, cancelled status, information regarding any felony convictions,  information regarding voter registration in another state, information  regarding military status, and overseas citizen information.''   Releasing the confidential voter information sought by the PACEI  which will be stored in an unsecure database on unsecured servers and  accessible to the public is illegal, irresponsible, jeopardizes civil  liberties and privacy rights, and puts our national security at risk.   It is important that all voters, including those in the 18th  Congressional District of Texas whom I am privileged to represent, be  fully protected. While supplying only public voter information may seem  secure, the sad fact is that it is not. There is no publicly available  record for voter registration information for any state in America.  Such data set is protected under the principle of collective privacy,  recognized by the Supreme Court in the landmark decision of NAACP v.  Alabama, 377 U.S. 288, 84 S. Ct. 1302, 12 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1964), which  held that compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in  advocacy may constitute an impermissible chilling effect on the freedom  of association guaranteed by the First Amendment. The Court has  affirmed this principle and it is now settled law. Accordingly, Texas  cannot, consistent with the U.S. Constitution, supply the private voter  information requested by the PACEI. Indeed, if the information sought  was public as PACEI contends, there would be no need for it to request  the information from state governments.   The right to vote, and the sanctity and privacy of the vote, is  protected by the U.S. Constitution, including the Fifth, Fourteenth,  and Fifteenth Amendments. It is an obligation of your administration to  preserve the sanctity and privacy of the vote, not to undermine it as  would be the case if Texas were to comply with the PACEI's  unconscionable request. The only approved government use of voter  registration data, outside of voting, is jury selection, not a  presidential advisory commission of dubious purpose formed to search  for nonexistent evidence to vindicate your false claim that you lost  the popular vote by 2.9 million votes, the largest loss in American  history, because ``millions of people who voted illegally.''   Voter suppression is real but the oft-repeated claim that American  elections are rife with voter fraud is a myth. A comprehensive 2014  study published in The Washington Post found out of more than a billion  votes cast only 31 credible instances of impersonation fraud from 2000  to 2014, and that event this tiny number was likely inflated because  the study's author counted not just voter fraud prosecutions or  convictions but all credible claims. Numerous other reports have  reached the same conclusion.   Finally, it should be noted that compliance with the PACEI's voter  data request would put the security of the nation's electoral processes  at risk. We know from recent and painful experience, including the  cyberattacks on the Veterans Administration, the Office of Personnel  Management, not to mention SONY and Yahoo, that large centralized  databases are targets of opportunities for criminals, terrorists, and  foreign adversaries. It would be the height of recklessness for Texas  to provide the PACEI with personal information of millions of person  via unsecured email address to be stored in undersecured databases on  undersecured servers.   This is why the large majority of states, 44 states and the District  of Columbia, have refused to comply with the PACEI's data requests. To  date, only five states have indicated they will cooperate with the  PACEI and with a data set this small, any findings drawn by the PACEI  will lack external validity and yield no generalizable conclusions. In  view of all the circumstances extant, the most reasonable and accurate  conclusion that can be reached about the PACEI is that it is not  intended to ferret out and prevent voter fraud, but to obtain  information that can be used to refine voter suppression efforts.   For these reasons, I strongly urge you to rescind your May 11, 2017  Executive Order and direct that the President's Advisory Commission on  Election Integrity be disbanded immediately. Thank you for your  consideration. Please contact me if you have any questions or need  additional information.            Very truly yours,                                                Sheila Jackson Lee,      Member of Congress.                                   ____               [From Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas]   Trump's Voter Fraud Commission is a Fraud and Should Be Disbanded Now         Unable to cope with the brutal fact that he lost the       popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2.9 million votes, the       largest vote deficit of any president in American history,       Donald Trump tweeted that he would have won the popular vote       but for ``millions of people who voted illegally.'' Instead       of producing any credible evidence to support this claim, a       hoax that has been repeatedly and decisively debunked by       experts, the President doubled down and issued an Executive       Order establishing the ``Presidential Advisory Commission on       Election Integrity'' (PACEI), appointing Kris Kobach, anti-      immigration warrior and poster-child for voter fraud       conspiratorialists everywhere, to lead the Commission.        It would be more accurate to characterize the PACEI as the       ``Presidential Advisory Commission on Vote Suppression.''       Voter suppression is real but the oft-repeated claim that       American elections are rife with voter fraud is a myth.       According to a comprehensive 2014 study published in The       Washington Post, out of more than a billion votes cast       between 2000 and 2014, only 31 credible instances of       impersonation fraud were found, and even this tiny number was       likely inflated because the study's author counted not just       voter fraud prosecutions or convictions but all credible       claims. Numerous other reports have reached the same       conclusion.        Any lingering doubt regarding the true purpose of the PACEI       should be laid to rest by the request made by Commissioner       Kobach on June 28, 2017 when he wrote each of the nation's       state secretaries of state requesting that they provide the       Commission with ``the full first and last names of all       registrants, middle names or initials if available,       addresses, dates of birth, political party (if recorded in       your state), last four digits of social security number if       available, voter history (elections voted in) from 2006       onward, active/inactive status, cancelled status, information       regarding any felony convictions, information regarding voter       registration in another state, information regarding military       status, and overseas citizen information.''        The information requested by the Commission will not       prevent voter fraud. It will violate rather than protect       voter privacy. And it will make it easier to craft       legislation and devise campaign strategies intended to       suppress the vote in urban clusters and among targeted       demographic groups, particularly minority voters.        It is important that all voters, and the people of the 18th       Congressional District of Texas whom I am privileged to       represent, be fully protected. While supplying only public       voter information may seem secure, the sad  [[Page H5907]]       fact is that it is not. There is no publicly accessible       database of voter registration information in any of the 50       states or the District of Columbia. That is because       information of this kind is protected from public disclosure       under the settled principle of `collective privacy'       recognized by the Supreme Court in the landmark decision of       NAACP v. Alabama, 377 U.S. 288, 84 S. Ct. 1302, 12 L. Ed. 2d       325 (1964), which held that compelled disclosure of       affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute an       impermissible chilling effect on the freedom of association       guaranteed by the First Amendment, a holding that has been       affirmed repeatedly.        Accordingly, neither Texas nor any state can, consistent       with the U.S. Constitution, supply the voter information       requested by the PACEI. Indeed, if the information sought was       as public in nature as PACEI contends, there simply would be       no need for it to request the information from state       governments.        Trump's voter suppression commission is a solution in       search of a problem. Contrary to what Trump and Kobach would       have the public believe, American elections are not rife with       widespread voter fraud. Studies have shown that it is more       likely an American ``will be struck by lightning than that he       will impersonate another voter at the polls.'' No, the major       ill affecting our election system is not that too many people       vote due to voter fraud, but that too many people are       prevented from voting due to vote suppression schemes such as       discriminatory photo identification requirements, curtailment       of early voting, too few polling stations leading to long       lines and excessive wait times, purging of election rolls.        Even in the wholly unimaginable event that the commission       created by Donald Trump and led by Kris Kobach could be       trusted enough for states to cooperate by sharing their voter       data, there is no reasonable basis for assuming that       information would be kept secure and the privacy of voters       protected. Recent cyberattacks have made clear the       vulnerability of large central databases to cyberattack. An       information security breach at the Department of Veterans       Affairs compromised sensitive personal data of 26.5 million       persons and cost the VA between $100 million to $500 million       to remediate; another occurring at the Office of Personnel       Management impacted 22 million current and former federal       employees, many of whom held sensitive security clearances;       and the attack on Yahoo, the mother of all security breaches,       resulted in 1.5 billion user accounts being compromised.        Because large centralized databases are targets of       opportunities for criminals, terrorists, and foreign       adversaries, it would be the height of recklessness for Texas       or any state to provide the PACEI with personal information       of millions of persons via unsecured email address to be       stored in undersecured databases on undersecured servers. One       of the biggest strengths of the American election system is       its decentralized nature.        Aggregating all voter data into one centralized database       with questionable security protections makes that data highly       vulnerable to a cyberattack that could lead to the personal       information of hundreds of millions of Americans being stolen       and misused. Voter privacy and the integrity of the secret       ballot are integral to American democracy. Voter privacy       rights should and must be protected. This is especially true       since we now know for certain that adversaries like Russia       are actively involved in cyberwarfare campaigns to undermine       our democracy.        There is no denying that our election system is under       assault, but not in the way Trump imagines. Instead of       wasting taxpayer money to fund an investigation into voter       fraud, which is as mythical as a unicorn, American democracy       would be better served by focusing on and correcting the real       problem with our elections--voter suppression and external,       illegal, and international interference in our national       elections.        I am not opposed to employing reasonable, legitimate, and       workable means to safeguard the integrity of our electoral       system and to protect the precious right to vote. But Trump's       Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is       incapable of doing either and thus should be disbanded and       dissolved immediately.    Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by holding up this map,  which indicates the colors of the individual States that are only  slightly adhering to this Commission. The orange and the blue are  individual States, some that are not adhering and some that are giving  basic public information, but not all the personal information.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I hope we can  collectively fight against the suppression of voters, and I thank him  for alerting the American people to this severe attempt to perpetrate a  wrongness, which is that there is voter fraud, and that we should not  violate the privacy of Americans.
