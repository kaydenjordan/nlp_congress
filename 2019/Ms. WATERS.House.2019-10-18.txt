 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on H.R. 3624, and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3624, the Outsourcing  Accountability Act of 2019 crafted by Representative Axne from Iowa, a  new Member to Congress and the Financial Services Committee.   The Outsourcing Accountability Act of 2019 protects American workers  by shining a light on companies that are shipping jobs overseas.   Although public companies are required to disclose their total number  of employees, there is currently no requirement that they disclose  where those employees are geographically based. This allows companies  to quietly ship jobs overseas and makes it difficult for investors to  know if the companies they are investing in are creating and protecting  American jobs.   Moreover, voluntary disclosure of outsourcing data has declined in  recent decades. According to the AFL-CIO: ``. . . multinational  companies have increasingly focused job creation in non-U.S. markets  and would prefer not to disclose numbers that could lead to  reputational risks.''   As a result of the lack of disclosure, some companies that are  failing to invest in American workers escape accountability. The  limited information the public does have about companies' outsourcing  and offshoring usually comes from the news media.   The data that we do have shows that the U.S. is losing jobs to trade.  According to the Economic Policy Institute, the United States has lost  more than 3 million American jobs to trade with China in the last 20  years. Since 1975, more than 5 million Americans have been certified  for Trade Adjustment Assistance after losing wages, hours, or their  employment because of trade.   President Trump's 2017 tax scam has also worsened matters by  essentially incentivizing certain manufacturers to move entire  production lines overseas.   By requiring public companies to disclose the locations of their  workforces,  [[Page H8234]]  the Outsourcing Accountability Act provides investors with the  information they need on which companies are investing in the American  economy and will incentivize companies to invest in American workers.   With the passage of this bill into law, public companies would no  longer be able to ship jobs overseas under the cover of darkness.   I commend Representative Axne for introducing this bill that creates  transparency and benefits American workers and urge adoption of H.R.  3624.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Axne), who is the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who is the chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital  Markets.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Outsourcing Accountability Act of 2019 is a commonsense bill that  is supported by consumer advocacy organizations, like Public Citizen,  the labor representatives from the AFL-CIO, Communications Workers of  America, the United Automobile Workers, and the United Steelworkers.   According to the Communications Workers of America: ``This key piece  of legislation would greatly help working families and CWA fully  supports the bill's passage. This is a vital effort to guarantee that  companies are required, by law, to disclose the magnitude to which they  outsource American jobs and exploit low-cost foreign labor.''   According to the AFL-CIO, the offshoring disclosure required by H.R.  3624 would ``help investors analyze companies' strategic plans,  exposures to geopolitical risk and risk from extreme weather events.  From a public policy perspective, such disclosure will also allow the  public to see the effect of the corporate tax cut on encouraging  offshoring.''   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the  Communications Workers of America in support of H.R. 3624.                                           Communications Workers of                                 America, Legislative Department,                                                   October 15, 2019.      Hon. Cindy Axne,      Member of Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Axne: On behalf of the officers and       700,000 members of the Communications Workers of America (       CWA), I am writing to thank you for introducing H.R. 3624,       the Outsourcing Accountability Act of 2019. This key piece of       legislation would greatly help working families and CWA fully       supports the bill's passage. This is a vital effort to       guarantee that companies are required, by law, to disclose       the magnitude to which they outsource American jobs and       exploit low-cost, foreign labor.        As you know, under existing law, publicly traded       corporations are not required to publicly list where their       employees are located. This lack of disclosure makes it much       more difficult to hold corporations that move jobs overseas       accountable. The Outsourcing Accountability Act remedies this       problem by requiring companies to disclose the total number       of employees that they have by state and country, and the       percentage change from the previous year.        Without this accountability mechanism, corporations will       continue to attempt to deceive workers and the American       public when they outsource jobs. A prime example of this       problem occurred when Wells Fargo announced a massive layoff       of over 26,500 employees in 2018. While the company       proclaimed the layoff was due to changes in customer       preferences and publicly denied that work was being       offshored, several investigations by the Department of Labor       revealed that many people lost their jobs because Wells Fargo       chose to expand their operations overseas. In fact, the       company is opening a call center in the Philippines where       they will employ over 7,000 workers. This same dynamic occurs       frequently across industries.        CWA believes this bill adds imperative transparency that       will disincentive the practice of corporations outsourcing       jobs. Furthermore, it will help ensure that workers affected       by outsourcing are able to access their Trade Adjustment       Assistance benefits by demonstrating more clearly that       offshoring played a role in their job loss.        We are very grateful for your efforts on this bill and       thank you for your commitment to standing up for American       workers with the introduction of H.R. 3624. We look forward       to working with you on this and other issues of importance to       working people in the future.            Sincerely,      Shane Larson,        Senior Director, Government Affairs and Policy,       Communications Workers of America (CWA).     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I have sat here and listened to my colleagues on the  opposite side of the aisle attempt to explain why it is they are  opposed to this bill and what this bill is attempting to do to create  transparency in American companies by simply asking them to disclose  the number of jobs that they are exporting overseas. I don't understand  what their argument is.   I have heard from both sides of the aisle, for years, that one of our  number one priorities is jobs: job creation and job retention. I have  heard from both sides of the aisle that we must do everything that we  can to stop American corporations from exporting our jobs offshore.   I have heard Members from both sides of the aisle take to the floor  of the House of Representatives and talk about how we must stop, how we  must do everything that we possibly can to ensure that we are in no way  supporting or incentivizing our companies to export our jobs overseas.   We heard the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Axne), author of this bill,  who talked about what happened in her district with Wells Fargo. We  heard her explain how these people, these employees are hurting, and  many of them just feel it is absolutely unfair for our companies who  got big tax breaks to be able to export our jobs overseas in search of  cheap labor, undermining the labor force here in America.   I don't know how they justify that.   And I heard the ranking member of this committee keep talking about  shaming the companies. I don't know who he is trying to protect. I  don't know where he gets this language from, ``shaming the companies.''   But if that is what he wants to use, if that is what he wants to  accuse me of--I am sure he is not accusing the author of this bill of  shaming American companies. But if you want to accuse me of that, you  might be able to do so.    And let me just say this: You might be able to say that I am throwing  a little shade on you also, because if, in fact, you are defending the  actions of American companies that are taking your constituents' jobs  out of your district, offshore, and you can defend that, then there is  something wrong with your reasoning.   And I don't know if it is shaming or shading or whatever it is, I am  opposed to it. Most of the Members of this House of Representatives are  opposed to it.   And this legislator, a new legislator, who came to the Congress of  the United States probably wondered why we hadn't done something about  this sooner. I am so pleased that she had the courage, the wisdom, and  the insight to challenge us all and to say this has got to stop.   And you are saying this bill does nothing? Are you saying that  information is no good? Are you saying that somehow knowing this,  understanding this, we wouldn't be able to do something about it?   Well, let me just tell you, I think you are wrong. I think you are  absolutely wrong.   When this information is revealed, when this information is unfolded,  when it is made evident that these companies are doing this, then I  think we have more than a few Members who will rise to the occasion to  do everything possible to stop shipping American jobs from our  districts to foreign countries for cheap labor.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose Representative Huizenga's  amendment, which would effectively gut H.R. 3624 by exempting the vast  majority of public companies from the outsourcing disclosure.   The amendment does this indirectly by exempting companies that have  to comply with SEC rules requiring disclosure of the pay ratio between  the CEO's compensation and that of its median employee or rules  requiring disclosures relating to conflict minerals. However, all  public companies must comply with those rules, with some narrow  exemptions.   The CEO pay ratio and conflict minerals disclosures have nothing to  do with the new requirement to disclose how many jobs are being  outsourced.   Taken together with the limited exemption for newly public companies  already in H.R. 3624, the amendment would limit the bill's outsourcing  disclosures to small reporting companies, foreign private issuers, and  certain registered investment companies.   What my Republican colleagues do not seem to understand is that  investors do care about all of these types of disclosures. They know  that when a CEO makes significant multiples of the median employee, the  performance of the company is hurt. Investors also know that, if a  company sources its minerals to conflict zones, it faces a much higher  risk than a company with a stable source of resources.   Likewise, investors also want to know whether a company is creating  jobs in the United States or overseas.   By proposing a huge expansion of exemptions, Representative  Huizenga's amendment would effectively negate the bill and allow  companies to continue to, quietly and secretly, ship American jobs  overseas.   Let me just add to these comments, in particular for all of the new  Members of Congress: Anytime any company is shipping jobs out of your  district, no matter where they are going, you raise questions. You ask  why they are doing that. Don't be ashamed to do that. Don't think that  something is wrong with doing that.   You were elected to represent the people in your district, and Mr.  Huizenga would have you believe that, if jobs are being taken from your  State to another State, you are supposed to be quiet because something  is wrong with that.   I don't care whether it is from State to State or overseas or what  have you. Representatives who were sent here to speak for their  constituents should be concerned about that, they should raise the  questions, and they should be involved with everything they can do  to preserve those jobs.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Axne), the sponsor of this important  legislation.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, let me say to my colleague from Arkansas on  the opposite side of the aisle that the need to be concerned about  regulations relative to companies that are shipping jobs overseas is  something I don't understand. I don't understand why the Members on the  opposite side of the aisle could take this precious time to come here  in defense of companies that would ship our American jobs overseas for  cheap labor.   There is no excuse. There is no reason. There is no reason why our  colleagues who come here to represent constituents, many of whom are  still looking for jobs, and those who get laid off because their  companies have taken their jobs and shipped them overseas, would come  here and defend some company because they believe that we are being too  tough on them, that we are overregulating them.   Well, I don't understand it, and there is nothing they could say or  do to help me understand that.   I strongly oppose Representative Hill's amendment because it would  effectively negate the purpose of H.R. 3624 by allowing companies to  opt out of this disclosure if they believe that  [[Page H8240]]  the information is not ``material'' information for investors.   As we all know, in practice, companies have interpreted ``material''  only to include information on issues that have a current and easily  quantifiable impact. This is exactly what the multinational companies  that have been shipping American jobs overseas want, to hide what they  are doing.   As the AFL-CIO noted before an Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship,  and Capital Markets Subcommittee hearing in May, multinational  companies ``have increasingly focused job creation in non-U.S. markets  and would prefer not to disclose numbers that would lead to  reputational risks.''   We must stand with American workers and address this informational  barrier to help investors, the public, and policymakers understand the  true magnitude of the problem. So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no''  on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would ask, does the gentleman have any  more speakers?    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentleman from Arkansas  to use your time to deal with the burden that you claim multinationals  have just for doing this reporting. We will use our time to support the  workers and the people of this country.   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Axne), the sponsor of this important legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to take this moment to thank  my colleague, a new Member of the Congress of the United States who  serves on the Financial Services Committee, for introducing,  supporting, and working for this legislation.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
