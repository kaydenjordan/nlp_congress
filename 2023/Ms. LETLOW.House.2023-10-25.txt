 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 26,  which would slash funding for the Delta Regional Authority by $6.1  million.   This Federal-State partnership is a critical lifeline to my district  and State by providing dedicated funding to address vital  infrastructure, workforce, and healthcare needs for rural towns. These  towns have little to no tax base to be able to raise the funds  themselves to replace expensive and aging infrastructure systems.   Rural communities do not have the financial resources to hire grant  writers to help them through a complex Federal grant process, and  because of this, these towns miss out on national grant competitions.   DRA's funding supports a pilot program that would help these  communities identify opportunities, provide assistance to write the  applications, and help with implementation.   While cutting $6.1 million may not seem like a lot, I have seen  firsthand what a simple $200,000 can do to help grow a rural town.   Finally, the DRA has had minimal increases over the last 5 years. A  cut in funding this deep would be a step in the wrong direction.   On behalf of rural towns across the delta region, I urge my  colleagues to oppose this amendment.
