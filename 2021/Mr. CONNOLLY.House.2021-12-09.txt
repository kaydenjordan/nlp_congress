 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the distinguished  chairwoman of the Oversight and Reform Committee for yielding.    We just heard obfuscation on the floor of the House hoping that  people watching will be distracted from the purpose of this bill, which  is to counter the systematic voter suppression that is occurring in  Republican-controlled States all over America.   Instead of enshrining the right to vote and enabling it, Republicans  want to suppress it, they want to narrow it, they want to make it  harder for you to vote. Because that is how they win elections,  apparently.   This bill, the Protecting Our Democracy Act, led by Mr. Schiff would  counter that, would enshrine and protect that sacred franchise, which  is what America was founded to be.   I also want to highlight an amendment to the bill I provided. On  October 21, President Trump signed Executive Order No. 13957 to  undermine the merit system protection of our Federal workforce by  requiring agency heads to reclassify policy-determining, policymaking,  or policy-advocating positions.   At OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, this meant 80 percent of  its workforce could suddenly be fired or eligible to be fired by the  executive.   The Preventing a Patronage System Act preserves congressional  prerogative by freezing that executive branch ability to unilaterally  remove classes of Federal employees and restore the civil service as a  nonpartisan entity.   I'm proud to support and cosponsor this bill. I urge its passage.
