 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to also thank Chairman Smith, along with his  bipartisan colleagues, in joining together in authoring this  legislation and bringing this bipartisan legislation forward and  speaking in support of and respect of human rights in Ethiopia.   This legislation takes a very important first step for what needs to  be identified and moved forward in terms of identifying what has been  happening for too long, where the Ethiopian Government has been  persecuting the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest minority and ethnic group.   Peaceful protests, led largely by Oromo's youth, have been met with  government repression. Hundreds have been killed and thousands more  have been injured. Now, most of those have also been arrested and  detained by Ethiopia's security forces.   Estimates are that hundreds of thousands of Oromians have been  uprooted from their homes and forced to flee the persecution and the  violence. There is no doubt that Ethiopia is a very important U.S.  ally, but that does not mean that we should turn a blind eye as it  oppresses its people.   Now, in my State of Minnesota, we are home to the largest community  of Oromians outside of Ethiopia. They are valued members of our  community and we are very fortunate to have them.   I joined many Ethiopians and Oromians actually this past Sunday night  when I attended a very large and moving interfaith rally with members  of the African and Jewish community, and they were all together  reaffirming  [[Page H3073]]  their commitment to religious freedom, to diversity, and to justice.  Sadly, many Oromians today won't find these ideals in their home  country of Ethiopia.   Mr. Speaker, today the House can speak with a solid, strong voice to  support human rights and also condemn the killing of innocent  protesters and the arrest and detention of journalists and students and  political leaders.   We are also at the same time urging through this resolution that the  protesters also refrain from violence, and also urge the Ethiopian  Government to take very concrete steps to end its persecution and  oppressive conduct.   Today we have an opportunity to take these important steps in showing  our solidarity with the Oromians, and I hope my colleagues will join in  support of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the start of  National Retirement Planning Week.   For many, retirement can seem a long way off, far away, something not  to worry about, in the future. But healthcare costs are rising, people  are living longer, and a shift away from employer pensions means they  will likely face more uncertainty in their retirement than ever before.  Far too many, Mr. Speaker, will find themselves with too little in  retirement to live comfortably.   But planning early on and socking away a little now for the future  will go a long way. Make a plan, start to save, and find out how your  employer can help. As co-chair of the Financial Security and Life  Insurance Caucus along with Richard Neal from Massachusetts, we are  working together across the aisle to ensure that public policy  encourages more savings, more planning, and more education to help  families plan for the future in the event of disability, long-term  medical care, or death.   Mr. Speaker, 4 million Americans are retiring every year. That is  10,000 people a day. National Retirement Planning Week is a chance to  remind Minnesotans and all Americans that thinking about retirement  should start in your twenties, not in your fifties.                            ____________________
