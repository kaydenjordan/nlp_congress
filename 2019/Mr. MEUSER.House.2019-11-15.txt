 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize several  impressive athletic accomplishments that have recently taken place in  Pennsylvania's Ninth Congressional District.   Last Friday night, Tamaqua football made history as they secured  their first-ever district championship. After coming close to winning  the championship for the past several seasons, I applaud the team's  resilience and grit.   But football isn't the only sport to talk about in the Ninth  Congressional District these days. For the third consecutive year, Penn  State Schuylkill women's cross-country team took home the conference  title at the Pennsylvania State University Athletic Conference  Championships. This is the first time Penn State Schuylkill has  achieved a three-peat. They are truly a sports dynasty.   Congratulations to both Sam Bonner, head football coach at Tamaqua  High School, and Joe Muldowney, head cross-country coach at Penn State  Schuylkill, for leading their teams to victory.   Perseverance and dedication are defining characteristics of  Pennsylvanians. I am incredibly proud of the Tamaqua football and Penn  State Schuylkill women's cross-country teams for these accomplishments.   And always, I am very honored to represent the great Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania's Ninth Congressional District.                            ____________________
