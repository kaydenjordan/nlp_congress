 Mr. Speaker, I rise before you in support of awarding  the Ghost Army veterans with the Congressional Gold Medal.   This is such a great story. In World War II, the Ghost Army had a  mission unlike any other. They were recruited in one of the greatest  counterintelligence operations of our time, fooling the Nazis with  inflatable tanks, mannequins, and decoys.   It is estimated that they saved tens of thousands of American  soldiers' lives. Their work was so groundbreaking that it remained  classified for more than 40 years.   Mr. Speaker, the Ghost Army and their legacy have never been formally  recognized. This bill is long overdue for the soldiers and their  families. Of the  [[Page H1132]]  1,100 who served, only 11 of them are alive today. Among them, 103- year-old Staff Sergeant Stanley Nance, who lives in my home State of  Utah. I have had a chance to get to know him.   He and his fellow soldiers, those few, those 11 who are still alive,  and their families, deserve recognition of their service and  sacrifices.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to honor the Ghost Army and  award them the Congressional Gold Medal.                            ____________________
