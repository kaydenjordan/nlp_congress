 Mr. Speaker, I have very strong views about the  national protest taking place across Colombia over the past 2 weeks and  the absolutely brutal response against the demonstrators by the  Colombian public security forces.   But today, I rise about a very different and specific human rights  crisis in Colombia, one that receives little attention in the United  States and from the international community. I am speaking about the  plight of the Raizal people who have lived for centuries on the islands  that make up the San Andres archipelago.   The Raizal are descendants of Pilgrim settlers, enslaved Africans,  Amer-Indians, and British emigrants. They speak Creole English, and  most are Protestants.   However, in a twist of fate characteristic of the history of  colonization, the islands on which they live--San Andres, Ketlina, and  Old Providence--are under the sovereignty of Colombia, whose population  is Spanish speaking and largely Catholic. It has been that way since  the 1800s.                                time  1015    For a long time, the Raizal were left largely to their own devices.  They were self-governed with a self-sustaining economy.   But in the 1950s, the Colombian Government decided to strengthen  control over the islands by promoting tourism and mass migration from  the mainland. The result is that San Andres, the largest of the  islands, is extremely overpopulated. The Raizal have been reduced to  minority status on that island. And the development for tourism has so  seriously damaged the pristine environment that UNESCO tried to protect  it by declaring it a biosphere reserve in 2000.  [[Page H2201]]    But the smaller islands of Old Providence, accessible only by ferry  or small plane, and Ketlina, connected by a bridge, largely escaped the  fate of San Andres. The population of both is almost entirely Raizal,  and their communities have successfully resisted efforts to bring in  big development projects or build military installations there until  now.   The islands were hit very hard by Hurricane Iota last November. On  Old Providence, hundreds of houses were damaged and hundreds more  destroyed completely.   Colombian President Ivan Duque promised to rebuild in 100 days. It  has now been 6 months. The next hurricane season is on the horizon, and  reconstruction is nowhere near complete.   The delay is partly due to the government's failure to properly  consult with those most affected. But what the government did do was  allow the Colombian Navy to take advantage of the crisis and build a  new dock, a project the community had previously rejected due to the  risk of environmental damage.   The navy has installed its dock near a fishermen's co-op whose own  dock was destroyed by Iota, cutting off its members' access. In  response, fishermen whose livelihoods are at risk have been protesting  for 62 days.   There is a profound difference of vision between the islanders and  the mainlanders. The Raizal fear that if the government continues to  ignore them, their way of life in Old Providence and Ketlina will be  overtaken by the mainland population, as has happened in San Andres.  That would be a major violation of the human rights of the Raizal  people.   In 2004, when the U.N. Special Rapporteur on racism visited the  archipelago, the Raizal communities complained of political  discrimination and marginalization from the decisionmaking processes  that affected their territory. They also described cultural domination  by the mainland, for example, the exclusive use of Spanish as the  language of instruction and pressure to convert to Catholicism to be  able to advance economically.   More than 15 years later, the Colombian Government persists with many  of the same practices that led the Raizal to lodge those human rights  complaints.   It is time to change course. It is time to prioritize the human  rights of the Raizal people. It is time for the government to recognize  the Raizal as legitimate interlocutors and respect their right to  protect their ancestral lands.   I urge the Duque government to accelerate reconstruction so that the  people have adequate shelter and medical facilities as soon as  possible, certainly before the next hurricane season.   I urge the government to stop importing labor from the mainland and,  instead, employ local Raizal workers.   I urge the government to remove the navy's new dock, rebuild the co- op's dock instead, and end further militarization of the islands.   I urge a thorough review of any U.S. Government resources used for  post-Iota reconstruction to ensure that they were expended in full  compliance with requirements of prior consultation.   And I encourage the United Nations and the Inter-American human  rights bodies to immediately review the situation of the Raizal people  and issue new recommendations to the Colombian Government to ensure  that their rights are fully protected going forward.                            ____________________
