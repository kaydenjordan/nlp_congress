 Mr. Chairman, I have an  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, 99.9 percent  of New Mexico is under drought conditions, including over 60 percent of  the State which is suffering from extreme drought or worse. It is so  dry that more than half the State is at significant risk for dangerous  and destructive wildfires, and long stretches of the Rio Grande  riverbed are already dry as a bone.                                time  1700    As I speak, there are wildfires raging across the state, including a  massive fire in Ute Park, which is threatening multiple communities and  hundreds of buildings.   On top of that, last winter's mountain snowpack was the second lowest  on record, creating significant issues for New Mexico's agricultural  industry. Farmers are leaving fields unplanted and ranchers are  downsizing their herds. Many farmers and ranchers, including families  who have worked their land for generations, are worried that they will  not have the water to grow their crops or the hay to feed their  livestock in the months and years ahead.   Extreme drought is the new normal in large parts of the American  Southwest and we have to develop innovative technologies and management  practices to both preserve the water resources we have and increase  access to previously unusable water.   My amendment intends to prioritize $15 million for the Bureau of  Reclamation's water research and development programs. It is critical  that we make new investments to develop innovative methods to recycle,  reuse, and purify water for agricultural, environmental, residential,  and industrial uses.   This funding also supports the Brackish Groundwater National  Desalination Research Facility located in Alamogordo, New Mexico, that  develops more cost-effective and efficient ways to desalinate and  purify water. This cutting-edge facility brings together researchers  from a range of Federal agencies, universities, private companies, and  State and local governments to work collaboratively on sustainability  using billions of previously untapped brackish groundwater in New  Mexico.   Mr. Chairman, if we don't develop innovative water management  strategies to do more with less, we won't have the water we need to  plant our fields, feed our livestock, or grow New Mexico's economy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
