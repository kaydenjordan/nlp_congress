 Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago this Congress  saved the American economy by extending Federally secured low- or no- interest loans to the banking and insurance industries and the American  automakers. In many cases, it was the reckless activity of those  industries that caused the economic crisis.   And nothing for hardworking American families.   In 2017, this Congress passed a 14 percent corporate tax cut,  creating a $2 trillion debt, to many of the same industries that almost  destroyed the American economy.   And, again, nothing for America's working families.   Today, more than 200 pension plans covering 1.5 million Americans are  seriously in danger of failing. Working families from Buffalo to Boston  are threatened with their pensions and their retirement savings being  ripped away from them.   Mr. Speaker, the Butch Lewis Act, brought to the floor today under  the leadership of Chairman Richard Neal and  Bobby Scott, will provide  stability and retirement security for millions of humble, hardworking  Americans, and I urge its passage.
