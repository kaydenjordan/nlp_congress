 Mr. Speaker, this is my sixth speech in a  series on voter fraud, election theft, and the Presidential election.   Today, I cite an August 29, 2020, New York Post article that quotes  extensively from a New Jersey professional Democrat election theft  expert's description of how he steals elections using the en masse  mailed ballot voting system.   The election theft expert states he puts a real ballot into ``the  copy machine, and it comes out the same way.''   ``But the return envelopes are `more secure than the ballot. You  could never re-create the envelope.' ''   So envelopes had to be collected from real voters. The election theft  expert adds: ``He would have his operatives fan out, going house to  house, convincing voters to let them mail completed ballots on their  behalf as a public service. The fraudster and his minions would then  take the sealed envelopes home and hold them over boiling water.''   For those unaware, the process of collecting ballots from voters, it  is called ballot harvesting and is legal in some States but illegal in  others.   The election theft expert continues: ``You have to steam it to loosen  the glue.''   ``He then would remove the real ballot, place the counterfeit ballot  inside the signed certificate, and reseal the envelope. `Five minutes  per ballot tops,' '' is how long he says it takes to steal a vote.   The election theft expert adds that ``sometimes postal employees are  in on the scam. `You have a postman who is a rabid anti-Trump guy, and  he is working in Bedminster or some Republican stronghold. He can take  those filled-out ballots, and knowing 95 percent are going to a  Republican, he can just throw those in the garbage.' ''   ``In some cases, mail carriers were members of his `work crew' and  would sift ballots from the mail and hand them over to the operative.''                                time  1015    The election theft expert continues: ``With mail-in ballots,  partisans from both parties hash out and count ballots at the local  board of elections--debating which ballots make the cut and which need  to be thrown out because of irregularities.   ``Any ballots offered up by him or his operation would come with a  bent corner along the voter certificate--which contains the voter  signature--so Democratic board of election counters would know the fix  was in and not to object.''   The New York Post describes his vote theft methods as  ``organizationally, his voter fraud schemes in the Garden State and  elsewhere resembled Mafia organizations, with a boss--usually the  campaign manager--handing off the day-to-day managing of the mob  soldiers to underboss--him. The actual candidate was usually kept in  the dark deliberately so they could maintain `plausible deniability.'''   This Democrat election theft expert stunningly helps expose the  sordid underbelly of voter fraud and election theft that riddles  America's election system and too often makes official election results  inaccurate and unreliable.   As my prior speeches have detailed, voting in American elections by  illegal  [[Page H7051]]  aliens and other noncitizens so out of control that Joe Biden openly  solicited the illegal alien bloc vote and support with the promise of  amnesty and citizenship if they helped him get elected President.   Further, en masse ballot mail-out schemes are illegal because they  violate Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution and Congress' ensuing  legislation that designates one 24-hour day as the election day. More  to the point, Congress could have but did not create an election week,  an election month, or an election season.   Mr. Speaker, the overwhelming, compelling, and irrefutable evidence  leads to but one conclusion: If only lawful votes cast by eligible  American citizens are counted, President Trump handily won the  electoral college and reelection.   Hence, on January 6, 2021, provided the required one Senator joins  me, I will object to and vote to reject electoral college submissions  of Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and all other States whose  election systems are so badly flawed as to render their vote  submissions unreliable, untrustworthy, and unworthy of acceptance.
