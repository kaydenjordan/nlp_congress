H. Cato. They  originally named it Burns & Cato, Inc. Later C.W. bought out Mr. Cato's  shares for $5,250 on February 5, 1930; therefore, owning the entire  branch.    Following the success of the Lancaster branch, C.W. bought Kershaw  Chevrolet with his brother Jimmy R. Burns and W.H. Shaw, Jr., in 1931.   In 1959, C.W. realized there would be far too much family for  Lancaster Motor Company to absorb shortly after his twin sons graduated  from college; therefore, C.W. sent his son, C. Weldon Burns, Jr., to  Rock Hill, South Carolina, to open Burns Chevrolet there. Weldon  purchased the Chevrolet dealership in Rock Hill on July 17, 1959.   Weldon then partnered with Claude W. Burns, III, and D. Frank Polk,  Jr., in Burns Chevrolet in Rock Hill. Weldon then opened Burns  Chevrolet Oldsmobile in Gaffney, South Carolina. A few years later in  1989, Weldon bought out Frank in Gaffney and C. Sam Burns partnered  with Weldon in Gaffney, South Carolina.   Weldon and his three sons applied for the Ford dealership in  Lancaster and were appointed Ford dealers on February 17, 1994. Robert  W. Burns bought out his dad and brothers in 2003 to have sole ownership  of Burns Ford in Lancaster.   To usher in the new generation of Burns to the family business,  Claude W. Burns, III, added the Cadillac brand in Rock Hill to the  family collection on June 30, 2000. Additionally, D. Frank Polk became  the Buick GMC dealer in Gaffney, South Carolina, shortly after in 2005.   In 2010 Charles Samuel Burns became the dealer at Burns Chevrolet of  Gaffney and sole owner, until he appointed his son, Charles S. Burns,  Jr., a partner and dealer in 2020.   On January 27, 2017, Weldon's sons, Claude and Robert, along with  Claude's son, James R. Burns, added a new Ford dealership in York,  South Carolina. James R. Burns continued to become the dealer of the  Burns Chevrolet Cadillac in Rock Hill.   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the century of dedication and service the  entire Burns family has brought to the automotive industry in South  Carolina. The Burns family has set the gold standard for what has made  America the greatest nation known to man: our free enterprise system.  For over 100 years, the Burns family continues to serve and gain new  customers. Again, from all of us who live and reside in South Carolina,  we send thanks to the Burns family.                            ____________________
