 Madam President, I come to the floor today to join the  vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who will be joining me  shortly, in urging our colleagues to avoid a completely unnecessary  crisis and work together with us to get out our spending bills and get  all of our spending bills signed into law.   We should be able to do this. I am very proud of the work we have  done so far. Under the leadership of the chairman and vice chairman of  the Appropriations Committee, we have been able to negotiate and pass  bills under regular order in a way we have been unable to do for years.  [[Page S6045]]    We did this by rejecting the awful and counterproductive budget ideas  from President Trump and his administration and by pushing aside poison  pill riders that would derail this process--such as attacks on  healthcare, higher education, public schools, patient protections,  workers' rights, and more.   I am particularly proud that we were able to work together and  negotiate and pass our LHHS bill through the full Senate, something  that has not been done in over a decade.   Our bill makes strong investments in families, patients, students,  workers, and the middle class, and it rejects poison pill riders. It  builds on the strong work we have done to increase access to childcare  and early learning and includes targeted funding to address the opioid  epidemic, especially in our underserved areas. It includes significant  new resources to address the truly alarming issues of maternal  mortality, to help us understand why so many women in our country are  dying as a result of childbirth and pregnancy and prevent this from  happening. The list goes on and on.   We still have some work to do, but we should be able to get this done  in the coming days. I am going to keep working until we do. However, I  am very concerned that President Trump continues to threaten to refuse  to sign these bills and shut down the government.   Just this week, we saw new reports that he is talking, once again,  about shutting down the government to try to get the money for his ill- advised and wasteful border wall. President Trump told his voters that  Mexico was going to pay for his wall, so maybe he is talking about  shutting down the Mexican Government so that he can get money in  Mexican spending bills. But if he is talking about trying to get  American taxpayers to foot the bill, that is not going to happen.   I hope Republicans in Congress will continue to stand with us to stay  the course on these bipartisan bills. We have come far in this process  by putting families first and rejecting attempts to insert partisanship  and poison pill riders in all of our spending bills. We need to get  this done.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, as ranking member on the Senate  Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor,  [[Page S6053]]  Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, I would  like to recognize a public servant deeply committed to protecting and  improving the health of the American people, Ms. Anne Houser. Anne will  retire in January, after a distinguished 48-year career at the National  Institutes of Health, where she has for many years been the principal  liaison with the Appropriations Committees.   Over the course of her career, Anne has worked for eight NIH  Directors, performing the essential but often overlooked role of  helping the committees understand the agency's research and funding  needs. It is the kind of low-key work that takes place behind the  scenes, but has been essential to building the case in Congress for  sustained increased investment in medical research. No matter the  issue, or the time of the day or night that it might arise, Anne has  always been there, supporting the case for research that will help lead  to cures. Her honest, thoughtful, and helpful advice has been valuable  to me and to everyone with whom she worked. In short, Anne has set the  gold standard for how agencies can most effectively work with the  committees that oversee them.   Both within NIH and in Congress, Anne is recognized as a consummate  professional and an independent thinker who understands the issues,  gets to the bottom of problems, and communicates those issues clearly  to Members of Congress, our staff, and to the researchers she works  with. Thanks to the dedication of Anne, not only is the NIH working  better, but Americans are better off as well. Her absence will be a  loss for everyone who depends upon her, but I am glad that she will  have more time to spend with her friends and family, and especially her  grandson, Alex, of whom she is so proud.                            ____________________
