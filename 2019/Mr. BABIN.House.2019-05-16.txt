 Madam Speaker, I rise here today commending President  Trump for not waiving the Jones Act.   This is a hypothetical picture, thank goodness, a Chinese-built  vessel, subsidized by their communist regime, operated by the Chinese,  and delivering Chinese goods, all in the very heartland of the United  States of America. But this could easily become a reality if the Jones  Act is waived.   For the past 100 years, the Jones Act has brought strength and  certainty to maritime commerce here in the United States. It has  protected the rights of American sailors, created and maintained  American jobs, and been one of the single largest factors in  facilitating the strong American economy that we are enjoying.   The Jones Act states that goods shipped between U.S. ports are to be  built, owned, and operated by the citizens of the United States, and to  support the Jones Act would be an easy decision to continue promoting  the policy of America first.   To waive the Jones Act would be to directly jeopardize our national  security, our economic growth, and our ability to provide American jobs  all across this country. Worst of all, waiving the Jones Act would be  allowing these foreign-operated ships into our waterways and could be  opening the door to espionage. These foreign vessels would have the  potential to literally threaten our national security by exposing our  waterways to very real threats.    Not only has the Jones Act played a vital role in economic growth,  but it has and continues to play a very large role in disaster recovery  and the efforts of emergency response. Take a look at the photos of New  York City after the attack on 9/11. You will see the Hudson River and  the East River full of American vessels who quickly came to the rescue.  Or how about all of the supplies delivered to the coastal communities  after catastrophic hurricanes?   The list goes on to include the cleanups of oil spills, fires, and  nautical accidents. Americans are always there, and the Jones Act makes  that possible.   The Jones Act creates stability and certainty to the maritime and  shipping industry. Taking away the Jones Act strips this industry of  job and market availability and stability, handing it over to foreign  countries to cheaply fill the role through questionable labor practices  and lower standards of performance. It would singlehandedly jeopardize  one of the Nation's most reliable and strongest of our economic  drivers.   As a conservative Republican, I am well aware that many groups and  thought leaders here in Washington and back in Texas, whom I respect  and agree with on most of the other issues, do not share my view on the  Jones Act, and they are actively working to try to weaken or even  repeal it.   I respectfully, but firmly, disagree, and that is why I am calling on  any and all of my colleagues who want to repeal the Jones Act to  explain why the image that they see here would make for a better and  stronger America.   If they need to borrow this poster, I will be glad to let them use  it. Just let me know.                            ____________________
