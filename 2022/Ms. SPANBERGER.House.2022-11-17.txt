 Mr. Speaker, I stand here as a Virginian, a UVA  alumna, and a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives to remember  the UVA football teammates who were shot and killed earlier this week.   For the University of Virginia, it has been an unimaginable loss for  their families, and it has been an unthinkable reality.   This week, we remember Lavel Davis, Jr. We remember Devin Chandler.  We remember D'Sean Perry.   Both on the field and off the field, their classmates, their coaches,  their professors, and their loved ones saw their commitment to success.  They saw their selflessness, their curiosity, and their determination  to make the University of Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and  our Nation a stronger place.   Please join me in remembering their lives, honoring their memories,  and standing strong as their families mourn. We also stand with the  University of Virginia student body, professors, the community, the  entire football team, and all those who are impacted by this horrific  loss.   We also pray for the recovery of Michael Hollins, Jr., as he and his  family continue on the long road to healing.   This week has demonstrated the resilience of the UVA community. May  we forever remember the lives that were lost: Lavel Davis, Jr., Devin  Chandler, and D'Sean Perry.                            ____________________
