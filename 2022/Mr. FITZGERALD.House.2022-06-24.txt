 Mr. Speaker, what a great day for the babies and--as  the Speaker described it--the Trump-McConnell Supreme Court.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the House amendment to S.  2938. This bill could have had strong bipartisan support if it had  focused solely on mental health and school safety. The Supreme Court  made it clear yesterday that the Second Amendment includes the right to  carry a gun for self-defense purposes outside the home.   This bill flies in the face of that ruling. Specifically, the bill  fails to define what constitutes a willful violation that would warrant  a revocation of a Federal firearm license. This is especially important  given the Department of Justice's zero tolerance policy and the over  500 percent increase in license revocation proceedings that have  occurred under this administration.   Current extreme risk protective orders that exist in 19 States do not  come close to providing adequate due process protections. We cannot  support the use of taxpayer funds to implement more such  unconstitutional laws without specific and ironclad assurances that due  process rights will be protected.   In the wake of the tragic shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in  February 2018, I worked with my colleagues in the Wisconsin legislature  to protect against school shootings. We worked to pass Act 143 which  appropriated $100 million in school safety grants. That is where this  bill should be going.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to focus on bipartisan solutions  that will not infringe on our constitutional rights.
