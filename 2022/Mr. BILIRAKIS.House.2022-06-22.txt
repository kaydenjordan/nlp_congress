 Madam Speaker, with gas prices at or above $5 per  gallon, Americans are feeling significant pain at the pump. In a recent  survey of my constituents, 89 percent said they have had to change or  cancel their summer travel plans due to the surge in gas prices. What a  shame.   I have also heard stories about how the gas prices, coupled with  crippling inflation, have eaten into my constituents' savings and made  it extremely difficult for families to make ends meet. These are the  realities families throughout our country are facing. Yet, this  administration and many of my colleagues in this Chamber appear to be  out of touch with these concerns.   Instead of taking action to relieve the pain at the pump, President  Biden and Congressional Democrats continue to blame, deflect, and  justify the irresponsible decisions that have caused gas prices to  spike.   Earlier this week, the President said: ``Out of everything lousy,  something good will happen if you look hard enough for it.   ``We have a chance to make a fundamental turn toward renewable  energy, electric vehicles--and not just electric vehicles but across  the board.''   No, Mr. President, record-high gas prices are not a good thing. It is  disingenuous to act as though you are powerless, Mr. President, to do  anything to address gas prices. My constituents do not want to suffer  while this administration and Congressional Democrats continue to  pursue a radical, green agenda.  [[Page H5742]]    President Biden has already done enough damage. From his first day in  office, he canceled the Keystone pipeline and paused all domestic  leases and sales. He has tried to blame everyone from Putin to price  gouging and private industry.   But the facts are clear. The Biden administration is currently  sitting on over 4,400 pending applications for permits to drill which  must be approved so American workers can produce more American-made  energy. That makes sense. In addition, Biden's regulatory and  inflationary burdens are thwarting the creation of new large-scale  refineries which are also needed to increase production. The Biden  climate czar, former Senator John Kerry, said last week that we don't  need any more domestic drilling. My constituents and I beg to differ.   Prior to President Biden assuming office, the United States was a net  exporter of energy, and the price of gas dipped below $2 a gallon. The  greatest Nation on the face of the Earth should never have to rely on  Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, Russia, or any other hostile nation to  meet its energy needs. It is also not realistic to believe we can  transition to a green economy overnight without significant cost to  consumers.   However, we can regain American energy independence, create American  jobs, and lower prices at the pump by implementing the pro-growth,  commonsense policies of the previous administration, which is why I  have cosponsored the American Energy Independence from Russia Act.  Unfortunately, House Democrats have blocked this critical bill seven  times on this very floor. That means they are blocking energy solutions  for lowering gas prices by boosting domestic energy production. This  includes resuming the Keystone XL pipeline, restarting oil and gas  leases on Federal lands and waters, and requiring a plan to replace the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve that has been drained by this  administration. It is just not right.   I don't know what message my colleagues' constituents on the other  side of the aisle are sending to them. But back at home, the message  has been very clear. What are their constituents telling them? From my  constituents, the message is extremely clear. My constituents want  Washington to stop its obsessive spending of money we don't have to  push a green agenda, and they want lower prices at the pump. We need to  do it now. It is urgent that we do it. It is critical that we do it.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in this fight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and the  chairman for this very important bill.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope for Mental  Health and Well-Being Act, which reauthorizes and improves key SAMHSA  block grant programs for mental health and substance use disorder  prevention and treatment services. These are all targeted toward  helping our constituents who have struggled with anxiety, stress, and  isolation.   Sadly, our Nation is experiencing an unprecedented mental health  crisis, particularly among our children and teens. It has only gotten  worse during the COVID pandemic, Mr. Speaker. We have seen a disturbing  spike in rates of depression, self-harm, suicide attempts, and death  among teens. Teen depression, in particular, has risen by 60 percent.   We cannot afford to wait any longer to address this mental health and  addiction crisis, and this package presents much-needed solutions that  will enact meaningful changes to help combat the trends we have seen.   Specifically, I am very glad to see in the manager's amendment a  provision I have long advocated for that will require HHS to conduct  research on smartphone and social media use by adolescents and the  effects of such use on emotional and behavioral health.                                time  1445    All of us agree on the need to better protect our children and their  mental health from social media, and this is an excellent start. We are  also going to consider an amendment I am proud to support with my good  friend Rodney Davis that will contain H.R. 2355, the Opioid  Prescription Verification Act, to help prevent opioid abuse through e- prescribing.   In closing, this is a strong, bipartisan package, and I urge my  colleagues to fully support it.
