 Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the  accomplishments of Mi Casa Resource Center, now in their 45th year of  service. Mi Casa was founded in 1976 by a group of eight Latina mothers  who dreamed of a better world for themselves and their families. They  wanted a safe space to develop skills for employment and education and  expanded Mi Casa to include business development--delivering training  for low-income entrepreneurs who just needed an opportunity.   Today, Mi Casa is a pillar for women, Latinos, or anyone looking for  business or career support in the Denver metro area.   In the midst of the devastating pandemic, Mi Casa launched 45 new  businesses, supported 45 Coloradans pivot to new careers, and reached  more than 1,800 people overall. The transformational impact of Mi Casa  on our community cannot be understated. I commend them for their  remarkable work, and I congratulate Mi Casa Resource Center on their  45th anniversary.                              Community Churches     Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the  efforts of several churches in my district that worked tirelessly to  provide relief, support, and resources to their communities during the  COVID-19 pandemic. They hosted food banks for those in need, provided  financial help to those struggling to make ends meet, and sought out  opportunities to support the social, spiritual, and emotional needs of  members.   Our community is better because of them, and I recognize the  volunteers who sacrificed their time, energy, and own well-being to  provide relief to those who needed a lifeline extended to them. In a  time of fear, they built a network of hope.   I thank the staff, volunteers, and members of Mosaic Church,  Friendship Church, Word in Action Church, City of God Church,  Confluence Ministries, Orchard Church, Northern Hills Church, Colorado  Multiethnic Coalition, Renewal Christian Center, and Hard Rock Church.   The impact of this outreach in our communities is profound. I commend  all involved for their ongoing effort to ensure that no one gets left  behind.                          Celebrating Douglas County     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Douglas County in  Colorado's Sixth District for being named the second healthiest county  in the United States by the U.S. News & World Report.   With all due respect to the rest of my colleagues, there is no State  like Colorado. We are home to 300 days of sunshine, the Rocky  Mountains, world-class outdoor recreation, and exceptional small  businesses.   In a year defined by a devastating public health crisis, our State  added another accomplishment: community health.   With six of America's top 257 healthiest communities in Colorado,  Douglas County ranks second. Home to countless walking trails,  community-building events, and innovative infrastructure solutions,  Douglas County is a great place to live.   So come out to see what it is all about. I invite my colleagues to  visit Douglas County and the rest of my incredible district to see for  themselves what makes the Centennial State one of a kind.                  Recognizing the Career of Vita Lantz Brown     Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the career  of Vita Lantz Brown. In Arapahoe County, the saying goes: If you want  something done, ask Vita. And, if Vita asks you to do something, you  just can't say no.   A force for change in our community, Vita's faith drives her devotion  to good government and diverse leadership. Vita is civic-minded and is  committed to ensuring elected officials at every level are working to  better the community.   She devotes her time and energy to many organizations, including Moms  Demand Action, the Aurora NAACP, and countless others. As a servant  leader, she also supports her community by providing free babysitting,  tutoring for children, volunteering at a local school, feeding the  homeless, and serving as deaconess at Macedonia Baptist Church.   Vita's life work is inspired by 2 Timothy 4:7:         I have fought a good fight, I have finished the race, I       have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown       of righteousness.    I thank Vita for her exemplary leadership, expertise, and commitment  to our community.                       30th Anniversary of Aurora NAACP     Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the 30th  anniversary of Aurora, Colorado's NAACP branch.   In 1991 Dr. Barbara Shannon-Bannister founded the Aurora branch as an  important step in a long career devoted to civil rights. She built upon  the legacy of her father's work in her hometown of New Orleans and  later moved to Wyoming where she helped form the NAACP Wyoming chapter.   She recognized a need in Aurora. Though Aurora was one of Colorado's  fastest growing cities, it lacked essential advocacy on civil rights  issues.   Dr. Shannon-Bannister addressed this gap by creating the Aurora  branch of the NAACP.   I extend my gratitude to Dr. Shannon-Bannister, current president  Omar Montgomery, and all who have dedicated their time and expertise to  the Aurora NAACP over the last 30 years. I thank them for their  commitment to the residents of my district and for continually working  toward this crucial mission.                            ____________________
