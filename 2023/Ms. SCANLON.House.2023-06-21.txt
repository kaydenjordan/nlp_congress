 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the steadfast patriotism  and integrity of Adam Schiff. This scurrilous resolution is so  dishonest and defamatory that it would justify a lawsuit if it were  made anywhere other than the Halls of Congress.   This is pure political revenge and exposes both the depths to which  the House Republican majority has sunk and their threat to our  constitutional order.   I encourage our colleagues to seriously consider how stunts like this  bring dishonor upon this House and to condemn it unequivocally.
