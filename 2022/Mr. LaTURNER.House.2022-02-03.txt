 Madam Speaker, today, I come to the floor to celebrate  the 90th birthday of one of my most important constituents, my Grandma  Ruby.   Ruby Ellen Talley was born February 9, 1932. Grandma Ruby married my  late grandfather, Joe LaTurner, on October 5, 1951. Together, they have  6 children, 14 grandchildren, 26 great-grandchildren, and 2 great- great-grandchildren.   Nursing was her profession, but what is clearly most important to her  is faith and family. As matriarch of the LaTurner family, Grandma Ruby  has aggressively instilled the values of honesty, hard work, empathy,  and always caring more about the one who is down on their luck.   For me personally, she helped raise me, and I hear her voice in my  head every single day, insisting that I have both confidence and  humility. I hear my Grandma Ruby say, as I have throughout my entire  life, that I am the best and can achieve anything I am willing to work  hard enough for. And I also hear her saying maybe even louder: ``Don't  get too big for your britches.''   I would not be standing on this floor today without her. I love my  Grandma Ruby dearly, and I wish her a very happy 90th birthday.                            ____________________
