 Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Senator  Blackburn and myself to honor the legacy and impact of Brad Gioia's 29  years of service as the head of school for Montgomery Bell Academy.   Since Brad was called to serve the MBA community nearly three decades  ago, he has grown the preparatory school into a world-renowned  institution. MBA's mission is to ``provide each student with the tools  to reach his maximum potential as a gentleman, a scholar, and an  athlete.'' Brad Gioia has dedicated himself to fulfilling this mission.  Senator Blackburn and I are honored to recognize his great service.   During the past 29 years, Brad has grown MBA's student population by  two-thirds, increased the school's budget by 1,100 percent, and  quadrupled the school's endowment. Most impressively, he has developed  the comprehensive Wilson Grant program, which has sent hundreds of  students to study and serve others all over the world.   Throughout his tenure, Brad has been a constant figure of support,  dedication, and commitment to the students of MBA. He created a culture  of support where all boys are celebrated when they excel, whether it is  in academics, athletics, music, art, debate, mock trial, service, or  theater. The strong sense of community that Brad Gioia built at MBA  will reverberate for decades to come, and our community is forever  grateful for his selfless service to the thousands of young MBA men  over the years.   His dedication to the MBA community and the greater Nashville  community will be missed, and his legacy will not be forgotten. On  behalf of Senator Blackburn and the entire Nashville community, I thank  you for your tireless years of service as the head of school for  Montgomery Bell Academy. We wish you, Minna, Christopher, and Gabby all  the best as you enter the next chapter of your life.                            ____________________
