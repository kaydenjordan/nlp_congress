 Mr. President, as you know, Congress passed, and the  President signed, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act late last year. While much  media attention has been focused on certain aspects of tax reform, one  topic that has not received due attention is the positive effect that  tax reform is already having on small businesses. As chairman of the  Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I strongly  supported this legislation because I saw the potential it had to spur  investment, create economic growth, and provide tax relief to the  millions of small business owners whose resilience and work ethic  provide ample evidence that the American Dream is alive and well. This  piece of legislation has had a positive impact, not just for small  business owners and their employees in my home State of Idaho, but also  for small business owners and employees all across our country. I plan  to introduce and highlight these small businesses on a weekly basis for  the near future.   While there are more and more uplifting stories of small businesses  that are benefiting from tax reform each day, today I wish to share the  story of Renaissance Property Management, LLC located in Dearborn, MI.  Renaissance Property Management's owner, Rudaina Hamade, and her son  Michael operate this successful small business, which specializes in  acquiring rental properties, asset management, and 24 hour property  maintenance. Through their business, the Hamades and their 5 to 10  employees, some of whom are seasonal, strive to offer tenants  affordable and distinguished homes. During the last recession, when so  many small businesses were suffering, her determination was on full  display. Though the Detroit housing market experienced a steep decline,  the Hamades persevered, and after finding financial backing, they  continued to invest in the Detroit market even while many others were  reducing their footprint in the city.   Ms. Hamade, a Lebanese immigrant, is a prime example of the American  Dream, having exhibited an amazing drive and work ethic throughout her  life. She received her finance degree from Davenport University while  raising her children and running a small business. In addition to  running her company and raising a family, Ms. Hamade is also an active  member of the Dearborn Chamber of Commerce and the Small Business  Council at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   Changes in the tax law have offered welcome relief to the Hamades'  employees and their families. This new law has enabled the Hamades to  provide their employees with bonuses ranging from $1,000 to $2,000.  They have also been able to make capital investments in their company.  These investments include upgrades to their computer system and the  purchasing of new software, machinery, and tools. Stories like these  show that tax reform was a more than worthwhile goal that has improved  small businesses's outlook, provided employee bonuses, lowered taxes,  and increased investment in many sectors of our economy. In the coming  weeks and months, I intend to bring more attention to the positive  effects that tax reform has had on small businesses across our great  country.                            ____________________
