 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  letter honoring Jack Leslie, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                           Tribute to Jack Leslie         Dear Jack, Congratulations on your retirement. It's hard to       think of you as retired. In the decades since you got your       career start in the United States Senate, working for Ted       Kennedy, you have made a lasting difference throughout the       world: in leading Sawyer Miller; in your very long and       incredibly successful run heading Weber Shandwick; in       communications in the United States and around the world; and       in your countless contributions to international       organizations, to boards, and to leadership and development.        I thank Caroline, Web, and Finn, for sharing you with so       many of us over so many years. I know you're excited to have       more time to spend with the family, but I know you will       continue your service to our nation as well.        Jack, you've been a leader on more boards than I can name,       among them, Water.org, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS       Foundation, the UNHCR American Advisory Committee, and of       course, most importantly, in my view, the United States       African Development Foundation. You've been appointed and       reappointed by Senates with both Republican and Democrat       majorities; by presidents, both Democrat and Republican.       You've made an indelible mark here and around the world.        Thank you for your friendship, your advice, and your       encouragement in my dozen years here in the Senate. And thank       you for the incredible difference you've made with your       heart, with your service, and with your charm, wit, and       insights.            Sincerely,      Chris Coons.                            ____________________
