 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at certain  times during my remarks I be allowed to address the Senate in Spanish.    Mr. President, I rise today to urge leaders across the  United States and governments around the world to stand in solidarity  with the people of Cuba as they cry out for freedom--for ``libertad''-- and for an end to decades of dictatorship.   What is happening in Cuba today is nothing short of historic. Yes, we  have seen protests take place in years past, but the demonstrations  that began on July 11 stand apart.   What began as one small pro-democracy protest in San Antonio de los  Ba os spread across the island in a matter of hours. Cubans from all  walks of life took to the streets in a courageous call for democratic  change. Among those clamoring for freedom were Afro-Cubans demanding an  end to discrimination and injustice, young people dreaming of a  brighter future in their country, artists and activists from the San  Isidro Movement singing ``Patria y Vida'' and ordinary citizens facing  widespread food shortages, poor access to healthcare, and little to no  protection from the ravages of COVID-19.   The people of Cuba are crying out for freedom, and we must hear them.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         The Cuban people are asking for what is fair, which is       freedom, and we must listen to their cry.    This is not about politics or ideology. The free world has a  responsibility to stand with those who are not yet free, and the people  of Cuba are anything but free.   Let's dispel the myths about what life is under the Cuban regime. For  decades, the regime's ruthless and repressive tactics have systemically  silenced the Cuban people while party insiders and cronies enrich  themselves at their expense.   Today, Cuba remains a one-party communist state, where the basic  principles of political pluralism and representative democracy are  outlawed--outlawed. There are no free and fair elections in Cuba.  Miguel Diaz-Canel may have appeared on a ballot, but there were no  other candidates. He was not chosen by the people but handpicked by the  Castros as their successor. He has the same ideology. He says the same  things. He talks about ``la continuation,'' the continuation-- continuation of oppression.   There is no freedom of the press in Cuba. Independent journalists are  routinely targeted with violence, harassment, imprisonment, and raids  on their homes and offices.   There is no internet freedom in Cuba. The regime monitors online  traffic, blocks sites, and charges so much money for data that most  Cubans cannot afford access. And when the regime gets scared about what  the Cuban people are saying and doing, they shut down the whole  internet. Yes, they shut down the whole internet. The only reason a  government shuts down the internet is because they fear their own  people.   But this has consequences. I recently had a Catholic priest visiting  here in Washington from Cuba. He told me an incredibly powerful story.  He said this young man came to see him in church and said: I would  fight. I would give my life for the cause of freedom if only someone  would know that I died.   If only someone would know that I died.   There is no freedom of expression in Cuba. Hundreds of activists,  artists, and political dissidents are taken prisoner every year without  due process. Others are beaten in the streets or terminated from their  jobs for daring to  [[Page S5133]]  express a contrary opinion. Cubans can even be imprisoned for the  Orwellian offense of ``precriminal dangerousness.'' You heard me right,  precriminal dangerousness. Let that sink in. The political police can  arrest you if they decide you might commit a political crime in the  future.   Fortunately, the regime's brutality has failed to extinguish the  flame of liberty alive in the hearts of the Cuban people. Their  courageous call for freedom is truly awe-inspiring. Yet the regime  responded to these protests--as all authoritarian governments do--with  repression, with censorship, with violence. The regime's internet  outages tried to stop the Cuban people from using social media to open  the eyes of the world to the repression and injustice they live with  each and every day.   Yet it was too late. The truth went viral. Images of everyday Cubans  chanting ``abajo la dictadura'' or ``down with the dictatorship'' and  singing ``Patria y Vida'' or ``Homeland and Life'' spread around the  world.   And so did countless videos of the regime's violent crackdown. Make  no mistake, the incitement of violence came from the very top itself.  It was Miguel Diaz-Canel, ostensibly the President of Cuba, who  encouraged supporters to attack peaceful protesters, declaring in a  televised address: ``The order to fight has been given--into the  streets,'' and he pledged his supporters' lives: ``Over our dead  bodies. We are prepared to do anything.''   What leader of a country invokes the people of the country to turn  against their brothers and sisters in the country in violence? Who does  that? Diaz-Canel did that.   The regime has confirmed just one death. Yet independent reports  suggest additional lives were lost as well as numerous cases of  violence and even torture. I have seen many of the videos. We can't  show videos here on the Senate floor, but I tell you, if we could, it  would be incredibly compelling and incredibly graphic and incredibly  violent.   International human rights groups believe that more than 500 people  have likely been detained, most facing arbitrary charges. Likewise-- don't take my word for it--the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights,  Michelle Bachelet, expressed her concern about ``the excessive force  against demonstrators in Cuba and the arrest of a large number of  people, including journalists. It is particularly worrying,'' she said,  ``that these include individuals allegedly held incommunicado and  people whose whereabouts are unknown.''   And, in fact, we have seen many videos and many stories of families  trying to find out, Where are their loved ones? Where are their loved  ones?   Already the regime is preparing summary trials for protesters that  deny them access to legal representation, subject them to sham  sentences, and make a mockery of due process   Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, a leader of the San Isidro Movement of  artists, known globally for their efforts to promote freedom of  expression, has been jailed and charged with ``resistance'' and  ``public disorder.'' For what? For merely announcing on social media  that he intended to join the peaceful protests--for merely announcing  that he intended the join the peaceful protests. This artistic leader,  this individual, as one of the leaders of the San Isidro Movement,  jailed. For what? For nothing.   Jose Daniel Ferrer, head of the Patriotic Unit of Cuba, or UNPACU, is  already behind bars. He is a renowned civil society leader who spent 8  years in prison for organizing an entirely legal electoral referendum  under the existing Cuban constitution and was declared a ``prisoner of  conscience'' by Amnesty International.   The regime has also unjustly detained multiple journalists for  courageously reporting on the events of July 11, including Camilla  Acosta, Luz Escobar, and Henry Constantin. Regime security forces also  violently assaulted Ramon Espinosa, a photographer for the Associated  Press.   Arrests have surged in recent days, but the politically motivated  arrests have taken place throughout 2021. Rapper and Afro-Cuban artist  Maykel Osorbo has been in prison since May. He is one of the artists  featured in the protest's anthem ``Patria y Vida. Patria y Vida.'' Yes,  in Cuba, you can be arrested for singing.   Today's protest movement builds on decades of efforts by Cuban  patriots to advance the cause of freedom.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         In the decades of the Castro oppression, the Cuban people       have never stopped looking for their freedom. Despite the       little attention some heroes have received, they have made       possible this moment in Cuban's history.    From the Patriotic Union of Cuba's efforts to unite activists in  support of democracy to Berta Soler and the intrepid leaders of the  Ladies in White--these are the spouses, daughters, mothers of political  prisoners who repeatedly faced violence for attending church services  and walking peacefully in white to Havana's streets with a gladiola in  their hands, beaten, beaten, for walking peacefully along the streets  of Havana dressed in white with a gladiola in her hands; I was  privileged to have Berta here at the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee--to the Christian Liberation Movement's work exploiting tools  afforded by the regime's own constitution to advance democratic change.   This month marks 9 years since the movement's leader, Oswaldo Paya,  died in a suspicious car crash that has never been fully investigated  due to the regime's obstruction. I believe he was assassinated.   Decade after decade, Cuban patriots have dedicated their lives and  given their lives to the cause of democracy and freedom. They have  struggled to rebuild communities and preserve values relentlessly  attacked by Cuba's Communist leaders. They have worked tirelessly to  alleviate the hardships that forced hundreds of thousands of Cuban  families to abandon their homeland in search of opportunities abroad.   The suffering that the Cuban regime inflicts on its own people  extends beyond its borders. For over two decades, Cuba has provided  military and intelligence assistance to Venezuela's dictatorship. It  has exploited its repressive tactics from Havana to Caracas. It has  shared its failed economic model with Venezuela's kleptocrats. And it  should be no surprise that Venezuela is now a failed state with a  devastating humanitarian crisis.   Cuba also provides safe haven to members of Colombia's ELN guerrilla  group, designated by the United States as a ``foreign terrorist  organization.'' The regime continues to deny extradition requests from  the Colombian Government.   In addition, Cuba has also harbored and still harbors American  fugitives evading the U.S. justice system. They include Joanne  Chesimard, who remains on the FBI's Most Wanted List for her role in  the murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster; and William  ``Guillermo'' Morales, a terrorist who took part in several bombings in  the United States, including Fraunces Tavern in Manhattan in 1975.   As it exports criminality and repression across the Americas, the  Cuban regime is a cancer that spreads instability across our  hemisphere.   Against this backdrop, the people of Cuba cry out for freedom, and I  urge our partners in the international community to listen to their  voices, hear their cries of desperation.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         It is time the international community listens to the Cuban       people and act. Not only to say they're sympathetic to their       cause, but to take action.    They want freedom from a system that denies them basic human rights  and control over their own destiny. They want freedom from an economic  model that places the interests of corrupt party and military oligarchs  above those of the people.   But there is no freedom today in Cuba. There is no economic  opportunity. There is no justice. The regime has turned a blind eye to  reports documenting a disturbing rise in femicide and violence against  women. It continues to treat Afro-Cubans as second-class citizens  unworthy of political representation and opportunity, even while they  are the leaders of the freedom movement inside of Cuba.   And it continues to deploy Cuban doctors to foreign countries against  their will and under conditions that meet the definition of human  trafficking. The regime sends Cuban doctors abroad, takes away their  passports, monitors their activities, threatens retribution against  their families,  [[Page S5134]]  all the while garnishing 75 percent of the wages that that country is  paying for that doctor. These medical missions aren't humanitarian aid;  they are forced labor.   The regime continues to engage in gross economic mismanagement. Money  that could be spent caring for the sick or vaccinating people against  COVID-19 instead goes to new hotels and tourist destinations.   Despite the growing number of international companies there, Cuban  workers cannot be hired directly by those companies. So you own a  hotel, like the Spaniards do, in Cuba. You don't hire the worker  directly; you go to the state employment agency, and they send you the  worker. You pay the state employment agency, which means the regime, in  dollars, and they pay the worker a fraction of what the regime is  getting paid. They have no rights. If you have a problem with that  employee, send him back to us, and we will send you someone else. Fire  them at will. They have no rights. Cuban workers cannot be directly  hired by them. Instead, they are contracted by state-owned employment  agencies that garnish their wages and, ironically, deny them the right  to organize outside of the Communist Party-controlled union.   As the Cuban people push for a new dawn in their country, a vibrant  Cuban-American community here has never wavered in their support for  their brothers and sisters on the island. They have worked tirelessly  to support family members in Cuba to ensure their cries for help are  heard around the world. In rallies and demonstrations in my home State  of New Jersey, in Florida, and, yes, here in Washington, Cuban  Americans are standing with loved ones on the island and diaspora  living around the world and calling for an end to a system that has  robbed generations of Cuban families of their dignity.   For me, in my 30 years in Congress, this has been a constant  struggle, from my days in the House of Representatives, helping pass  the Cuban Democracy Act; to the tragic downing of the Brothers to the  Rescue, civilians who were just flying over the Straits of Florida  between Cuba and the United States, looking for those people who had  taken to the to try to seek freedom and were shot down, which led to  the LIBERTAD Act, otherwise known as Helms-Burton, which I helped  write; from my visit to Guantanamo, our base, with former  Congresspeople Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, where  thousands of Cubans were being held at one time when the boatlifts were  making their way to the United States and where we eventually brought  them back to the United States; from presentations in Geneva, at the  U.N. Human Rights Council, leading to a resolution there condemning the  regime and here, as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, leading to a resolution, a bipartisan resolution--a  bipartisan resolution--that unanimously passed out of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee today; and so much more. So I marvel at  some of my Cuban brothers and sisters with their insulting remarks  toward me.   Since July 11, President Biden and Secretary Blinken have repeatedly  spoken in support of the Cuban people and made clear the United States  stands with them in their call for freedom.   More importantly, the administration is backing up its words with  action. Last week, President Biden invoked the Global Magnitsky Act,  which is a law that we use, passed by the Congress of the United  States, to sanction human rights violators across the globe. The  President invoked the Global Magnitsky Act to sanction Cuban Defense  Minister General Lopez Miera and the Black Berets SWAT unit for their  violent and repressive actions against peaceful protesters. Secretary  Blinken, the Secretary of State, has made clear the administration will  continue to hold human rights abusers accountable.   I urge the administration to consider additional Global Magnitsky  designations and also to revoke the existing visas of senior Cuban  officials. Such steps are greatly needed.   With the Diaz-Canel regime wielding internet connectivity as a  political weapon against its citizens, the administration is also  pursuing ways to help Cubans gain unrestricted access to the internet.  They need unfettered access to information. They need to be able to  communicate with each other. They need to be able to tell each other  what is happening in their country. They need to be able to organize  peacefully to create change in their country, and we must accelerate  our efforts to provide them with the tools they need to do so, whether  that is satellite feeds, whether that is tethered global balloons,  whether that is a multiplicity of options. Because a beam can be  jammed, we need to find a way to get the people of Cuba internet  connection.   The United States also must continue working with international  partners in support of democracy and human rights in Cuba.   Last week, I was proud to lead a joint statement for the first time  ever in support of the Cuban people with my counterparts who chair the  Foreign Affairs Committees of the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic,  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This week, the Foreign Ministers of 20  nations joined Secretary Blinken to ``condemn the mass arrests and  detentions of protestors in Cuba and call on the government to respect  the universal rights and freedoms of the Cuban people.'' Many of these  countries have never ever expressed themselves in solidarity with the  Cuban people.   I am proud to see Secretary Blinken and the administration make that  happen. I applaud those governments that joined Secretary Blinken, but  I also note the absence of those, including Canada and Spain and the  European Union. Does Spain care more about Spanish hotel investments  than it does about the human rights of the Cuban people?   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)        Is it more important the business you conduct on the island       than the freedom and democracy of the oppressed people? Do       you care more about those investments?    Does Canada place more priority on mining investments than it does on  fundamental freedoms? I would hope not.   These universal principles should unite all of us.   The administration is also convening a working group to study options  for the restoration of some remittances. For too long, the Cuban  military's economic conglomerate has managed the remittances that Cuban  Americans send their families on the island, using fees and currency  conversion to enrich itself. The United States would never allow the  Spanish, the Mexican, or the Argentine military to control the flow of  remittances to their countries. It is time that we insist that Cuban  Americans be able to freely and directly support their loved ones.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         It's only fair that the hard working Cuban American       families can send money to their families instead of that       money being used to enrich the elite of the Cuban Communist       Party.    The steps taken thus far by the Biden administration are important,  but we must do more.   Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved my resolution,  along with colleagues on both the Republican and Democratic sides,  expressing our solidarity with the Cuban people and condemning the  regime's abuses. This bipartisan, bicameral initiative deserves the  support of the full Senate, and I hope we will pass it on the floor  this week.   It is also time for the Biden administration to issue a new Executive  order to provide direction for U.S. policy toward Cuba. The order  should hone our accountability measures for persons involved in human  rights abuses and those who materially support them. It should solidify  our strategies on internet access and support for the Cuban people.  Congress should review options to increase funding for U.S. democracy  programs as well as internet freedom initiatives.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         We must continue putting pressure on who violate human       rights and elevate our support to the Cuban people   The United States must also find new ways to work with trusted,  impartial international partners, including international  organizations, to provide vaccines and other aid directly to the Cuban  people. The Cuban regime has grossly mismanaged its pandemic response.  It has refused to participate in  [[Page S5135]]  COVAX and continues to promote its own vaccine, which is either  ineffective or unavailable because people in Cuba are dying. As a  result, everyday Cubans continue to suffer.   The United States must lead a serious effort to push for the  demilitarization of the Cuban economy. The military-owned umbrella  company GAESA reigns supreme over the Cuban economy. It is run by whom?  By Raul Castro's son-in-law, Luis Alberto Lopez-Callejas, fueling the  rise of a new generation of regime oligarchs. The Cuban people will  never achieve economic prosperity while regime military companies  control the economy.   After years of efforts by the Trump administration to slash funding  for programs that we continuously had to fight to bring back that  provide lifelines to Cuban activists and civil society, I am very  pleased to see that the Biden administration has requested $20 million  for these programs and made clear that America will continue standing  with those on the frontlines of Cuba's pro-democracy movement.   It is time also for the United States to launch a campaign in support  of labor rights inside of Cuba. There is no acceptable explanation for  why Cuban men and women are unable to be directly hired and directly  paid by international companies and organizations that are present in  Cuba. If we are serious about empowering the Cuban people, they must  have a direct say in their livelihoods.   The Biden administration should pursue the success of past campaigns,  such as the Sullivan Principles in South Africa, to lead efforts that  require businesses to engage directly with the Cuban people and their  employment.   The Biden administration should also maintain the State Department's  Cuba Restricted List, which can help businesses and organizations  directly engage with the Cuban people instead of regime conglomerates.   Additionally, the United States and our allies must send a message to  members of the Cuban military. The Cuban military's slogan is that it  draws its power from the people. Well, the people are protesting. In  reality, you should not use your power against the people.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         The Cuban Army has to understand that if their mandate       comes from the people, the people is protesting; the people       wants freedom. Don't use your arms against your brothers and       sisters if you want to have a future in Cuba.    Additionally, let's be clear. When we send that message to the Cuban  military not to turn its arms against its brothers and sisters, the  world is watching what is happening in Cuba. There is a future in a  democratic Cuba under civilian control for members of the military who  refuse to repress their fellow citizens, but if you are involved in  human rights abuses and have blood on your hands, you will be held  accountable.   It is also worth noting to Cuba's military leaders that their future  with this regime is anything but certain. In the last 10 days--in the  last 10 days--five Cuban generals have died under highly suspicious  conditions that the regime seems intent on covering up. All of a  sudden, five Cuban generals, in 10 days, have died. I don't know at  this time that I would want to be a general in Cuba.   To those who want to blame Cuba's misery on the U.S. embargo, I would  say that it is the Cuban regime that needs to lift its embargo on its  own population. It is the regime's own restrictive policies that have  left the average Cuban destitute while oligarchs enjoy state-run stores  that are brimming with dollar-denominated goods out of reach to the  general population.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         The real embargo is the one the communist regime has       imposed against its own people who are not able to access       food, medicine or basic needs without its consent.    The steps to end the embargo are laid out clearly in title II of the  LIBERTAD Act, which is the law of the United States, which I wrote.  Those steps include releasing political prisoners, legalizing political  activity, and holding democratic elections.   If the regime ends its iron-fisted rule over the Cuban people, title  II of the LIBERTAD Act lays out what the United States stands ready to  do to pursue a different relationship with the people of Cuba. The  United States would work directly with a democratic government to take  steps to remove the embargo, to engage in direct trade with Cuba, to  support its return and membership to international financial  organizations, and so much more. It is all there in U.S. law. This is  not a promise of something that could happen; it is a promise of what  would happen if there is a change in Cuba.   It is time for the Cuban regime to take the steps and accept the  demands of the Cuban people.   Let me close on a personal note.   I stand here on the floor of the U.S. Senate as the son of Cuban  refugees who came to this country in search of freedom and opportunity.   Today, we are bearing witness to something in Cuba that my parents  never got to see.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         The day they dreamt about is the day millions of Cubans       around the world dream today, the day Cuba is set free.    We are bearing witness to a historic moment in which Cubans from all  walks of life are coming together to demand that same freedom. We are  bearing witness to a deep discontent within the Cuban people with the  status quo and life under one of the most repressive regimes ever  known.   For more than 60 years, they have lived without liberty and justice,  without freedom of expression, without human rights and the ability to  determine their own future.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         Don't be fooled. When the people went out to protest, they       are not asking for food, vaccines, or work. No.        One word, and only one. Freedom, freedom, freedom.    Freedom, because with freedom, everything else comes.   Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past. Let us not fall victim to  tired myths. Let us embrace the facts over the fiction. Most  importantly, let us hear the Cuban people's cries for freedom.   It is our job to stand with them, to empower them, to ensure that the  international community helps them achieve their dreams and  aspirations.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         Because without freedom and democracy, there is no ``Patria       y Vida.'' But with freedom and democracy, there is a homeland       of life and many opportunities.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Foreign       Relations I report favorably the following nomination lists       which were printed in the RECORDS on the dates indicated, and       ask unanimous consent, to save the expense of reprinting on       the Executive Calendar that these nominations lie at the       Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.
