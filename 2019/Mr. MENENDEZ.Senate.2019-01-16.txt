 Madam President, I rise to give voice to the more than  5,000 Federal employees across New Jersey who aren't getting paid due  to President Trump's pointless government shutdown. Make no mistake.  This shutdown is the result of a Presidential temper tantrum.   Democrats have voted for border security funding, for new technology  to scan vehicles for drugs, for more port-of-entry infrastructure  personnel, and for new drones to detect unauthorized crossings. Yet  President Trump is holding 800,000 Federal workers hostage all because  he wants $5.7 billion for a border wall that he promised Mexico would  pay for.   We have long known that something is broken inside this President  that makes him incapable of caring about anyone other than himself.  Clearly, he does not see Federal workers as real people with real bills  to pay--people like Emily Nering of Basking Ridge, NJ.   Emily has worked at the EPA's Edison field office for 8 years. She  coordinates water quality research and is in the midst of a major  survey of the New Jersey-New York Harbor, and she assisted in emergency  efforts to deliver clean drinking water to Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands after Hurricane Maria. She said:         I took an oath of office too. I want to get back to doing       the important work that the EPA conducts and to continue to       serve this great nation. I saved up to contribute to an IRA       this year and to start saving for a down payment on a home,       but those funds will now be used to help me pay rent and       other bills, pushing my financial and life goals further out       of reach. . . . I urge the President and Congress to put us       back to work so we can continue to serve the American people!    In recent days, I have heard from Coast Guard members, TSA agents,  IRS workers--patriots who have built their careers on serving their  fellow Americans. Their work is important, and they deserve to be paid.  If President Trump wants to discuss issues like border security and  comprehensive immigration reform, then he should end the shutdown,  reopen all of those elements of the government that have nothing to do  with his desired border wall, release his hostages, and reopen the  government, but if he continues to bury his head in the sand, then it  is time for the Senate to act.   We could likely pass legislation to reopen the government with a  veto-proof majority if only the majority leader would hold a vote.  Let's do the right thing for Federal employees like Emily. Let's vote  and end this shutdown now.   I yield the floor.
