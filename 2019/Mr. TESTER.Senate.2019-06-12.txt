 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a ranching  community, a community that knows the meaning and value of hard work  and that truly embodies the spirit of the great state of Montana.   Garfield County is 100 years old this year. After splitting from  neighboring Dawson County in 1919, this group of homesteading pioneers  voted to make Jordan its county seat and get to work doing what  Montanans do best: making a living off the land.   Ranching is a way of life out here, one that has sustained families,  built communities, and contributed to Montana's rural heritage.   While ranching and agriculture remain Garfield's top industries, the  county is perhaps most well known for another export: bones.   Garfield County sits atop the Hell's Creek Formation. Millions of  years before European settlers built their homesteads and long before  the Assiniboine and Crow tribes occupied the land, Garfield County was  home to some of the most fearsome creatures ever to roam the Earth. Its  Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops fossils are some of the best  preserved, and most renowned, specimens ever discovered.   Rexy, the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex who now roams the halls of the  Natural History Museum in New York City, was discovered just north of  Jordan, and is just one example of the paleontological contribution  Garfield County has made, a reminder of an ancient history long  forgotten and discovered anew.   The good people of Garfield County have much to be proud of. I rise  today to honor them and to congratulate them on 100 great years.   I know the next 100 will be even better.                            ____________________
