 Mr. President, the Senate failed to pass emergency  relief funding yesterday to help the American families recovering from  natural disasters. It failed for one reason--the Republicans removed  critical aid for Puerto Rico and other territories from the House bill  after President Trump told them to do it. Under this administration and  with Leader McConnell's blessing, even disaster relief has now become  political.   I don't need to litigate why we are here. Over the last 2 years, the  American people have endured staggering natural disasters that have  devastated communities across the country. These Americans need help.  They need help now. I would parenthetically add, if there were ever  evidence of global warming or of climate change, this would be it  despite the fact that just about every Republican has his head or her  head in the sand and will not admit it.   Regardless of what you think the causes were, Americans have always  stood together when American citizens have been hit by disaster. We  band together and say we are going to help one another--all American  citizens, all. Yet one part of America is not being treated like the  others, and why not? It is because President Trump, for reasons that  defy decency, harbors an apparent contempt for the people of Puerto  Rico. He tweeted again last night and erroneously claimed that $91  billion has been afforded the people of Puerto Rico. He ridiculed the  leadership that has desperately tried to rebuild the island in the wake  of these megastorms.   Let's get the facts straight.   The Republicans know the storms that hit Puerto Rico over a year ago  were not ordinary storms; they know these were historic catastrophes.  We are talking about the deadliest disasters to hit American soil in  over a century. We are talking about the worst power outage in American  history. We are talking about 3,000 lives lost. Yet here we are, 18  months later, and the island hasn't recovered.   It is surreal that a disaster so awful has been met with a  Presidential response that is so tepid and so heartless. It is surreal  that our Republican colleagues go along with this and say we are not  going to help Puerto Rico in the way that is needed. Billions in  funding for recovery and mitigation efforts right now remain locked in  the Treasury. Congress already appropriated $20 billion that the  administration has not allocated. All we want to do is make sure the  money is allocated. That is one of the things we want to do.   Are our Republican colleagues opposed to that? That is what it sounds  like. Some of them say it is political. What is political is President  Trump's saying no aid for Puerto Rico and having the Republicans jump  in line, even those with many Puerto Ricans in their States. Make no  mistake, we have reached this impasse because the President has said  himself he opposes help for Puerto Rico, and the Republicans follow  along.   Some of my colleagues from the other side came up with another  shibboleth; that we opposed the House bill because it didn't provide  funding for the Midwest. First of all, the House bill was aimed at  disasters in 2018, not in 2019. Second, Senator Leahy offered an  amendment that would have added funding for the Middle West and funding  for Puerto Rico. What did the Republicans do? They blocked it anyway.  So this undoes their fantasy that the Democrats are opposed to aid for  the Middle West. Senator Leahy and I will be offering an amendment that  will give aid to the Midwest and to Puerto Rico. Let's see where our  Republican colleagues stand. Will they block that too?   Yesterday's vote boiled down to a simple question: Do the Republicans  believe the people of Puerto Rico deserve relief for their natural  disasters as do all Americans? Do they believe the families of Puerto  Rico--whatever you think of this elected official in Puerto Rico-- deserve to be helped just like the families of the Midwest and  California?   Do they believe the statement of the Governor of Puerto Rico,  Rossello, that the House bill is much preferable to Puerto Rico than  what the Senate has proposed or do they make their own judgment based  on what President Trump said and then call it political?   What a shame.   Let me be clear as day: Without objection, the Democrats support  funding for all regions of the United States that have been affected by  natural disasters, which is any State or territory that needs to  rebuild. That list should include the Middle West, and it should  [[Page S2168]]  include Puerto Rico because our fellow citizens on that island have yet  to recover from the deadliest of storms in our recent history.   I will let this Chamber know that Senator Leahy and I will be  offering a new amendment to the disaster bill in order to provide  billions of new additional dollars for the Midwest's 2019 disasters.   The Senate Republicans say they care about Iowa and Nebraska, but  they didn't put an additional penny in for that aid. They said to let  them compete with the 2018 disasters and the same amount of money. We  are going a step further. We are going to say we need additional aid  for the Middle West--for Iowa and Nebraska--as well as aid for Puerto  Rico. It is not an either-or.   If we get into an either-or, the next time, it will be your State, my  Republican colleagues, when people will not want to vote for aid or it  will be for mine or another's. I experienced it, incidentally, with  Sandy, when a lot of Republicans didn't want to vote for aid after  Sandy because it was for New York. That was so wrong.   So I say to all who are suggesting that the Democrats aren't willing  to help the people of Iowa and Nebraska and other States that we are  calling their bluff.   Are you ready to actually appropriate new money--more money--for what  the people in the Midwest who are struggling need? The Democrats are.  Let's see where you stand.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, on healthcare, the Republicans have failed to advance  any of their healthcare plans through Congress, so they are trying to  repeal healthcare through the courts. This reeks of desperation, for  they do not have a backup plan.   Last night, the President tweeted that the Republicans will come up  with their plan in 2021. Translation: The Republicans have no  healthcare plan. Translation: President Trump has no healthcare plan.  It is the same old song the Republicans and the President have been  singing. They are for repeal, but they have no replacement. President  Trump confirmed he will hold Americans hostage through the 2020  election when it comes to healthcare. He promises with ``re-elect me,  and maybe you can take a peek at my backup plan after that,'' which he  doesn't have. What a ruse. What a shame. What a disgrace.   People are suffering. When their children have cancer, people need  protection so the insurance companies will not pull away the  healthcare. Seniors need protection from the rising costs of  prescription drugs. Women need protection so they will not be treated  differently than men when they have healthcare needs that are  particular to women. Young people need protection to be allowed to  continue to stay on their parents' plans until they are 26 if they  start new lives after high school or college. All of these folks need  protection.   President Trump and our Republican friends say: Rip all of those  things away, and trust us. Maybe in 2021, we will have a plan.   With a stubbornness that would impress a mule, President Trump has  waged a manic war on the American healthcare system that shows no sign  of stopping. Now we are asked to believe that President Trump has a  wonderful but secret healthcare plan but will, for some reason, not  reveal it until the next election. What a transparent ruse.   Snake oil salesmen, take notes.   Here is why we can't believe the President's punt and promise.   In May 2017, after the Republicans voted to repeal the healthcare  law, on national television, the President celebrated in the Rose  Garden with House Republicans. He celebrated the passage of a bill that  would result in 23 million fewer people having health insurance and  would result in gutting the protections for Americans who have  preexisting conditions. He celebrated his own broken promise to never  cut Medicaid and to always protect people with preexisting conditions,  and he did it on national TV. So don't tell me this time will be  different. Don't tell me there is a secret plan, when we know what the  Republicans' healthcare plan will be--increased premiums, a loss of  coverage, and the elimination of protection for preexisting conditions.  The markets will be stabilized, but families will be tossed into an  abyss of inferior care.   President Trump's lawsuit seeks to wholly undo the progress we have  made, but he wants the American people to just wait for a magic plan to  appear 2 years from now?   If successful, the President's lawsuit will mean skyrocketing costs  for families. The President wants the American people to just wait and  see.   President Trump's lawsuit will mean massive increases in prescription  drug spending for seniors who are on Medicare. The President wants the  American people to just wait and see.   President Trump's lawsuit will mean women will be charged more  because they are women. The President wants the American people to just  wait and see.   So, when President Trump insists he has a silver bullet plan that we  will only be able to see if the American people reelect him, we know  what a sham that is. For a President who has perpetrated lots of shams,  this one takes the cake.   I am asking: Which one of our Republican colleagues will stand up for  healthcare for the American people?   Senator Shaheen has a resolution that simply reads to the Justice  Department: Withdraw your suit that would do all of these awful things.   How many of our Republican colleagues will go on that proposal? Let's  see. Are they going to say it is politics too? With regard to the  healthcare of millions of Americans, any time the President does  something horrible and the Democrats resist, are they going to say it  is politics? Oh, no. That is what we are supposed to do whether it  comes to Puerto Rico or whether it comes to healthcare.                                    China    Mr. President, I have one final word on China.   The New York Times reported yesterday that a trade agreement with the  United States and China is nearly 90 percent complete, with a deal  being potentially finalized later this month. Yet it alarms me that the  President, for all his bluster, will likely settle on a deal that will  be devoid of any meaningful reform to China's economy and trade  practices. Instead, he will settle for the purchases of American goods  by the Chinese state. This move will only strengthen China's leverage  while it will do little to help us long term.   We want to protect our farmers, but we don't want a soybean sellout  where, in exchange for soybeans, we trade away America's family  jewels--our intellectual property, our industrial know-how, our hard- working labor force being able to compete in a reciprocal way in China  the way China can compete here. If it is just the purchases of product,  the Chinese Government can always turn off the tap. So we are entering  treacherous territory.   I have a simple message for President Trump and praise him for  standing up to China more than President Bush or President Obama did on  this issue. I say to him: We have made progress in making China see it  has abusive practices. Stand firm. Don't back out. I cannot think of a  worse end for us than to say ``uncle'' at the last minute. Skip the  political photo op and make good on your promise to stand up for  American business and workers when China takes advantage.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
