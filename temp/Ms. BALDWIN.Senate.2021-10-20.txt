 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of legislation  that I have recently joined Senator Warren in introducing. It is called  the Stop Wall Street Looting Act, and it concerns some of the practices  and the business model of what I would describe as predatory private  equity firms.   Now, before I dive into the details, I want to say that there are  very good private equity companies that invest in the businesses they  have purchased and the communities and the workers.   But, unfortunately, this is something that I have firsthand knowledge  of, the impact of predatory private equity businesses on workers and  communities in my home State of Wisconsin. Several historic Wisconsin  companies have been driven into bankruptcy or had their facilities  moved overseas by the private equity funds and companies that acquired  them.   The first company that I want to talk about is ShopKo. For those who  weren't in the ShopKo footprint in the United States, ShopKo is a  retailer that was founded in 1961 in Ashwaubenon, WI. ShopKo was bought  by a private equity firm, after many profitable years of existence,  back in 2005. The firm was Sun Capital Partners.   Sun Capital immediately executed what is known as a sale-leaseback. A  sale-leaseback is a textbook private equity maneuver in which the fund  sells the company's real estate right out from under it. Real estate  and the facilities were the most major asset that ShopKo had.   Certainly, they also had inventory and workers, but they owned the  real estate, and this private equity firm basically sold ShopKo's 351  locations with hundreds of millions of dollars, and they were sold to a  company that would lease the land and buildings back to ShopKo.   Sun Capital promised to reinvest the proceeds of the sale back into  the company, but instead it paid out cash to itself in the form of  dividends and management fees. Not only was ShopKo prevented from using  its cash to reinvest, it was also loaded up with $200 million more in  additional debt to fund even more payouts to Sun Capital executives.   After years of being starved of investment, ShopKo was forced into  bankruptcy and liquidation in 2019. The 3,000 Wisconsin workers were  promised severance pay in exchange for working through the company's  final days.   I mean, if you think about that, you have a retail store. You don't  want everybody to--the day they find out that store is ultimately going  to close--to go out and find other jobs or you don't have the way to  wind down your business. So they were promised severance pay in  exchange for working through the company's final days. But when the  time came to pay the workers, Sun Capital said it didn't have any  money.   When I met with these ShopKo workers, I remember meeting Kristi Van  Beckum. She said to me:         I always felt proud to work at ShopKo because it was a       Wisconsin-based company and it invested a lot in the       community. But I saw how Sun Capital sold out ShopKo's       properties and [literally] destroyed the company, all for       their own benefit. They made millions while I didn't even get       the severance I was promised. Sun Capital ran a company we       loved into the ground.    More recently, I visited with workers at Hufcor, a company that has  operated in Janesville, WI, for over 120 years. In 2017, the  manufacturer was acquired by a private equity firm called OpenGate  Capital.   Wisconsinites are sadly already familiar with OpenGate. This is an  L.A.-based private equity fund that bankrupted another Wisconsin firm,  Golden Guernsey Dairy, back in 2013, only 2 years after acquiring it,  laying off hundreds of workers in Waukesha, WI.   Dairy workers showed up one day to find the doors locked. They were  given no notice of their layoff, and they had to fight OpenGate for 8  years just to get their back pay.   This past summer, OpenGate notified the 166 workers at Hufcor that  their jobs would be terminated, and the workers soon learned that the  manufacturing operations would be moved to Monterrey, Mexico.   When I visited with the workers this summer, I learned this from  Michelle, who had worked for Hufcor for 23 years. She told me she is  anxious about what training she might need to get another job that will  pay what she earned at Hufcor.   Then I also heard from Jesse. He was diagnosed with cancer 2 years  ago, and he depends upon the health benefit provided by Hufcor for his  treatment.   These workers had great benefits because of their representation by  the Communications Workers of America union and because of their  employment at Hufcor, but they were left with an uncertain future  because OpenGate has decided to move their jobs to Mexico.   These stories illustrate the devastation that the predatory private  equity business model has wrought on my State. These workers deserve  better. We need to rip up private equity's predatory playbook that  enriches looters, but leaves workers with nothing but pink slips.   I was proud to work with Senator Warren to introduce the aptly named  Stop Wall Street Looting Act. This legislation will prevent private  equity firms from enriching themselves by starving businesses of  investment and running them into bankruptcy or shipping their jobs  overseas. This bold reform will help rewrite the rules of our economy  and protect workers from the predatory practices so that we can start  to reward hard work, not just wealth.   Thank you for the opportunity to share the stories from my State, and  I look forward to working to pass this important legislation.
