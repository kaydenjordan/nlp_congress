 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I thank my colleagues who have taken the time tonight to  speak in defense of life.   Next week, a beautiful, peaceful protest will take place here in  Washington, D.C., the March for Life, in which not tens but hundreds of  thousands of Americans will gather, including many from the Eighth  District of Ohio.   When I have looked across that vast crowd in the past on the National  Mall, I have been filled with hope for our future because the faces in  that crowd are overwhelmingly young people. The younger generations are  increasingly pro-life. They feel the effects of more than 60 million  elective abortions carried out in America since 1973.   These 60 million lives had so much potential. They could have been  someone's spouse, brother, sister. They would have been mothers and  fathers in their own right, but their lives were snuffed out by  abortion.   We should, of course, have compassion for the women whose babies'  lives have ended through abortion. Too often, they lacked support, been  pressured or deceived into a fateful choice to end their baby's life.   Mr. Speaker, I especially want to honor and encourage women like Mya,  the mother of Ohio State running back J.K. Dobbins, who chose life  courageously.   Next week is different. We celebrate a different vision, a hopeful,  optimistic vision. The youth will rise up, and by the grace of God, I  will be there with them to say: It is time to end the abortion culture  in America and defend the right to life.
