 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding; and I  do mean the gentleman. It has been an honor over these last 16 years to  participate in this event.   My record as a captain after the first 4 years was not very good;  and, actually, John Tanner was the captain for some of those years.   But the gentleman from Georgia is absolutely right. It is an  incredible retreat from what we do around here, to get out on the golf  course; to play in friendly competition in a game known for its  courtesies; and to have met so many fine Republicans and made so many  fine Republican friends over the years and, in the course of doing  that, for raising an awful lot of money for good causes.   So once again, I thank the gentleman for his kind words. I hope that  I can come back as captain emeritus; or maybe even let the former  Members play, and then I will be back for that, as well.    Of course, congratulations to the victors. It is getting  old. I had that trophy for a little while. I haven't seen it in quite  some time.
