 Madam Speaker, last week, I had the opportunity to  visit the Community Volunteers in Medicine center in West Chester,  Pennsylvania, which works to meet the healthcare needs of the working  poor and uninsured in my community.   Giuseppe is a member of my Pennsylvania community and owns a pizza  shop with his wife. He has diabetes, hypertension, and major cardiac  issues. Combined, they bring in $2,200 a month, and their prescription  drug prices are $1,790. Without CVIM, the family would be paying 81  percent of their monthly income just for prescription drugs.   The astronomical costs of prescription drugs affect everyone. Neither  being a Democrat nor a Republican will get you a discount. We are  failing the people of this country by not working together as a  Congress to relieve these burdens. For too long, Congress has used  people's access to healthcare as a political pawn.   As my mother would say: ``We need to knock it off.'' Please join us  in working together and side by side to help people across our country  with these issues.   I applaud CVIM for their efforts, and I want Giuseppe and my fellow  Pennsylvanians to know: I see you, and I will keep fighting for you.   Please join me.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise to support the NDAA and the rule  and the bipartisan work that went into it.   Part of the reason I separated from the Air Force was from a lack of  sufficient childcare options.   People across our country are often forced to decide between building  their careers and building their families, and, frankly, this is bad  for our economy and for our country.   We need to be working to ensure that we attract and retain the best  possible talent for any and every job. Eighty-two percent of Americans  believe our country should be providing this, and only 16 percent of us  have it. And this should start at the top, at the Federal level.   I cannot fathom a world where any person, regardless of party, would  hesitate to understand the importance of  [[Page H5322]]  having the best and brightest people working in our government.   Our legislation addresses this core issue. No one should have to  choose between their family and career. The government should be  leading by example, and today, this legislation allows us to  effectively send a successful message to all workers: paid family leave  is an investment in all of our families.   For me, it is inspiring, and it is an inspiring moment when we see  legislation being born from unlikely bedfellows: a concern for securing  our supply chain of rare earths help fund the need for us to provide  paid family leave to all Federal workers. This is the type of  legislation my community in Pennsylvania expects from Congress, and I  am very proud to introduce it today.   Madam Speaker, I urge the support of the NDAA. I am very, very  grateful for the support and work of Congresswoman Maloney in leading  me to this and leading us to this.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
