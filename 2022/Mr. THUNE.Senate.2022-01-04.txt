 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I begin, I want to express my deep  sorrow at the death of former Senator Johnny Isakson. I served with  Johnny for a long time, not just here in the Senate, where we came in  together as freshman Members in 2005, but also in the House of  Representatives, and I was honored to call him my friend.   Johnny was a tremendously effective legislator and, in particular, a  champion for veterans and a model of decency and graciousness. When I  came down to the floor to discuss his retirement 2 years ago, I read a  quote from a politics professor in Georgia that I thought really  captured Johnny. I think so still. Here is what that professor had to  say:         As a political science professor and an administrator, I'm       often asked by students if good people can serve in       government and keep their integrity. Johnny Isakson is always       the first example I come to. It's very often a shocking       revelation to most people--that good people can, and often       do, serve in government for long periods, fight hard for what       they believe in, and remain true to themselves and their       principles. And they don't have to sell their souls to do it.       It's a great lesson, really.    Mr. President, that was Johnny--a good man, one of the best I have  ever known. He came to Washington to serve his State and his country  and served them faithfully throughout his life.   My thoughts and prayers are with Johnny's wife Dianne and with his  children and grandchildren.
