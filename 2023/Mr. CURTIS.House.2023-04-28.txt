 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with a profound sense of  reverence and humility to honor the legacy of a true American hero, Mr.  Ken Potts.   Mr. Potts was one of the last two USS Arizona survivors who recently  passed away at 102.   On the morning of December 7, 1941, Ken Potts answered the call of  duty. As a crane operator, Mr. Potts had the responsibility of ferrying  supplies to the USS Arizona. Upon reaching the harbor, he was  confronted with a scene of devastation.   Mr. Potts stood as a beacon of hope. With dauntless courage, he  wielded his crane as an instrument of salvation, plucking survivors  from the jaws of peril and guiding them to the sanctuary off Ford  Island.   To the Potts family, and especially Doris, Ken's beloved wife, our  hearts are with you as you honor his memory today in this esteemed  Chamber.   I am profoundly privileged to pay homage to the indomitable spirit of  Ken Potts.                            ____________________
