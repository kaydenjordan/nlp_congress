 Madam President, in the many years since ObamaCare was  imposed on the American people, it has continued to hurt the people we  represent over and over and over again with higher costs, fewer  choices, pain and heartbreak for the middle class. We have watched  ObamaCare unravel before our very eyes with each passing year. Now it  teeters on the edge of collapse, and we face a choice: Allow the  unsustainable ObamaCare status quo to continue hurting more Americans  or take action to finally move forward.   Early on, Democrats made it clear they did not want to work with us  toward that goal in a serious or bipartisan way. I regret that. But we  have a responsibility to move forward, and we are.   As I have said, our entire conference has been active and engaged in  moving beyond the failures of ObamaCare for quite some time now, and we  are focused on the following: stabilizing insurance markets, which are  collapsing under ObamaCare; improving the affordability of health  insurance, which keeps getting more expensive under ObamaCare; freeing  Americans from ObamaCare mandates, which force them to buy insurance  they don't want; strengthening Medicaid for those who need it the most;  and preserving access to care for patients with preexisting conditions.  Those are the principles.   We believe we can do better than the ObamaCare status quo, and we  fully intend to do so. We have all received the calls, letters, and  emails from our constituents who have been hurt by this failed  healthcare law. We all know the pain it has caused in our home States.   Take my home State of Kentucky, for example. Under ObamaCare,  insurance markets are collapsing in Kentucky, just as we see them  collapsing across the country. We want to stabilize them. Kentucky was  once held up as an ObamaCare success story, but ObamaCare made a mess  of healthcare markets in my home State, just as it has made a mess of  markets all across the Nation. Too many families in Kentucky who liked  their insurance plans or their doctors soon found they were unable to  keep them. When families are kicked off their plan, they must find a  new insurer, often at a higher price. When families must change  doctors, they often lose a bond of trust they develop with a physician  who is familiar with their medical history. When insurers flee the  exchanges, it leaves families with fewer options for their healthcare.  In fact, Kentuckians in nearly half of our counties now have only one  option on the ObamaCare exchanges, and as we all know, one option  really isn't an option at all.   A woman from Lexington contacted my office about her difficulty  finding a plan on the exchanges. Here is what she had to say: ``I live  in one of the three largest cities in our state, and I had two options  for insurance this year.'' She wrote that the limited networks on both  of those two plans ``[eliminated] a huge number of providers in Fayette  County,'' the second largest county in my State. In addition to the  limited access to care on these plans, she said, ``The lowest  deductible option was $10,000.''   The lowest deductible option--$10,000. For this Kentuckian and for so  many others, ObamaCare has failed. We must do better, better for  Kentuckians and  [[Page S3658]]  better for families all across the country. That is why we have to act.   Under ObamaCare, healthcare costs are skyrocketing in Kentucky, just  as they are skyrocketing across the country. We want to improve  affordability. Too many Kentuckians have learned firsthand that the so- called Affordable Care Act has really been anything but affordable.  Premiums and deductibles continue to climb higher as ObamaCare takes a  larger bite out of Kentuckians' budgets.   A recent Health and Human Services report shows that ObamaCare  premiums in Kentucky have spiked an average of 75 percent since 2013,  when the law was fully implemented. This year alone, ObamaCare premiums  have shot up by as much as 47 percent.   After years of being frustrated by ObamaCare, a small business owner  from Lancaster, KY, said she had ``decided it was utter nonsense to buy  insurance that covered nothing.'' She said that it was utter nonsense  to buy insurance that covered nothing.   Although she pays a large sum every month, her plan ``covers no  office visits, no prescription coverage, [and] has a $6,000  deductible.'' In her estimate, ``[i]t is useless.''   The rising costs of ObamaCare add a burden that many in my State  simply cannot bear. I have received heartbreaking letters from  Kentuckians, such as one family faced with this dilemma: Pay for health  insurance or put food on the table. As ObamaCare collapses, these  families are stuck dealing with the consequences. Increasing costs have  become the status quo under ObamaCare, and it is completely  unsustainable--unsustainable for Kentuckians and unsustainable for  families across the country. That is why we have to act.   Under ObamaCare, Kentuckians are being forced to buy insurance plans  they don't want, just as Americans are being similarly forced to do so  all across our country. We want to free them from those mandates. The  American people have made clear that they don't like the mandate, which  compels individuals to purchase unaffordable ObamaCare plans or pay a  penalty. When you combine those who pay the fine and those who received  a waiver, it adds up to millions of Americans who decided they didn't  want or simply could not afford ObamaCare.   Listen to the story of a single mom from Berea, KY, who recently  wrote my office. She is a full-time student trying to make ends meet.  When she began searching for a plan on the ObamaCare exchanges, she saw  a startling picture: high premiums and a staggering deductible. She  wrote:         At this rate, I would honestly be better not to take health       insurance at all and hope for the best.        Americans like myself need something better.    Some families, instead of bracing for another double-digit increase  next year, are considering not buying health insurance at all. Because  of the ObamaCare mandate, they are forced to buy insurance they just  can't afford.   The elimination of the mandate will restore to Americans the freedom  to choose the healthcare plans that are right for them, instead of  being forced to purchase something that may not meet their needs. The  American people, just like this Kentucky mom, deserve a better  healthcare system than ObamaCare.   The Senate Republican conference is focused on addressing the issues  I mentioned as we work toward strengthening Medicaid and preserving  access to care for patients with preexisting conditions.   The Kentuckians' stories I have read this morning are just a sample  of the pain felt by so many across my State, just as Americans from  States across the country continue to share similar concerns with their  Senators. ObamaCare's years-long legacy of soaring prices, shrinking  choices, and total failure will continue to get worse unless we act.   The ObamaCare status quo is simply unsustainable. It is hurting  Americans, and it will continue to do so unless we act. The American  people are demanding relief, and we intend to deliver it to them. That  is why Senate Republicans are continuing to work toward smarter  healthcare solutions that will finally allow us to move beyond this  failed law.   I want to repeat what I said yesterday. A discussion draft will be  made public tomorrow. Every Member of the Senate will have it, and it  will be posted online for everyone to review.   For the past 7 years, ObamaCare has continued to hurt the people we  represent. For the past 7 years, Republicans have offered ideas for a  better way forward. Soon we will finally have the chance to turn the  page on this failing law.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all time  postcloture on the Mandelker nomination be considered expired at 4:15  p.m. today; further, that if cloture is invoked on the Billingslea  nomination, it be as if cloture had been invoked at 6:30 p.m. tonight.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, today I wish to touch on a topic that,  as I announced recently, I am going to continue to speak about in the  coming weeks and months on the Senate floor; that is, the right of free  speech.   This fundamental right is one of our most cherished. It forms the  beating heart of our democracy. It sits at the core of our civic  identity. Yet, these days, it seems to be coming under an increasing  threat all across our country.   The challenges it faces are different from what we have seen in the  recent past, but we must confront these, too, if we are to preserve  this right for future generations. That is certainly what I intend to  do. I know others share that commitment, and I hope more colleagues  will join in this effort as well.   Our colleagues know this is a topic I have devoted a large part of my  career to. Throughout the Obama years, I warned that our ability to  freely engage in civic life and organize in defense of our beliefs was  under coordinated assault from an administration that appeared  determined to shut up anyone--anyone--who challenged it. These efforts  to suppress speech were well documented, they extended throughout the  Federal Government, and they were often aided by the Obama  administration's allies here in Congress.   There were threats before then as well. I know, because I took up the  fight against many of them. Sometimes it was a lonely battle. Often it  was an unpopular one, but, in my view, it was necessary because whether  the threats to free speech came from the IRS or the Obama  administration's SEC, they shared a similar goal: to shut down or scare  off the stage those who chose to think differently.   Today, however, the threat to free speech is evolving. The speech  suppression crowd may no longer control the levers of Federal power,  but it hasn't given up its commitment to silencing those with an  opposing view.   Yesterday, in the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Grassley held a  hearing to explore the worsening problem of a lack of tolerance on  college campuses--imagine that, college campuses of all places--for the  views of others--lack of tolerance on college campuses for the views of  others. One of the witnesses at the hearing was Floyd Abrams, whom our  former colleague Senator Moynihan rightly described as ``the most  significant First Amendment lawyer of our age.'' Mr. Abrams noted that  we are witnessing ``an extraordinary perilous moment with respect to  free speech on campuses'' where ``too many students . . . seem to want  to see and hear only views they already hold. And to prevent others  from hearing views with which they differ.''   So what could account for this?   A profound lack of information is one answer. For example, Mr. Abrams  cites a study where ``nearly a third of college students could not even  identify the First Amendment as the one that deals with freedom of  speech.''   The day before, across the street, the Supreme Court reminded us of  the importance of a vibrant right to free  [[Page S3679]]  speech, where its exercise does not depend upon the sufferance of the  government.   In striking down the disparagement clause of Federal trademark law,  the Court reminded us of what too many of those on college campuses  appear not to have learned, and too many others seem to have forgotten:  ``Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that  offend.'' ``Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses  ideas that offend.''   The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education estimates there  were 43 reported instances of revoked speaking invitations or similar  efforts to block speakers on campuses just last year. That is double  the number recorded the previous year. It is more than 700 percent  higher than the six incidents recorded back in 2000.   The trend is getting worse, not simply in terms of the overall number  of incidents but--more worryingly--in terms of the growing  aggressiveness of those efforts. This year alone, there have been  multiple instances of intimidation, violence, and rioting at  universities across the country.   There has been nasty and thuggish behavior aimed at suppressing  speech. Sadly, it has often succeeded.   As USA TODAY put it in a recent editorial:         In just the place where the clash of ideas is most       valuable, students are shutting themselves off to points of       view they don't agree with. At the moment when young minds       are supposed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of       arguments, they are answering challenges to their beliefs       with anger and violence instead of facts and reason.    This should worry all of us, regardless of party, regardless of  ideology.   Hearing criticisms of one's beliefs and learning the beliefs of  others is simply training for life in a democratic society. It doesn't  mean one has to agree with those opinions, but no one is served by  trapping oneself and others in cocoons of ignorance. That is hardly the  recipe for a free and informed society.   To quote Frederick Douglass, ``To suppress free speech is a double  wrong [because] it violates the rights of the hearer as well as those  of the speaker.''   Just as it was not right during the Obama years for Americans to  endure harassment or incur crippling expenses because the government  didn't like what they believed, it certainly is not right today for  Americans to live in the shadow of fear simply because they dare to  speak up or think differently or support a candidate or a cause that  the speech suppression crowd may disagree with.   It really doesn't matter who you are or whether what you are saying  is popular. These rights do not exist to protect what is popular; they  exist precisely to protect what isn't.   That is one reason I have long opposed ideas like the flag-burning  constitutional amendment. That doesn't mean I agree the flag should be  burned. Of course, I don't. I disagree strongly, but it is the  principle that matters because the moment we allow ourselves to believe  that some people stand outside the free speech protections of the First  Amendment, then we are all in trouble--all of us.   The growing trend of intolerance we are seeing has taken many forms  lately, but the underlying hostility to free speech has not changed. As  I noted earlier, in recent years, the threat had often come from the  Federal Government. These days, the threat tends to come from different  quarters. There have been many high-profile incidents of speech  suppression and violence at universities across the country, in  particular, but it would be a mistake to think this problem is isolated  to college campuses.   The bottom line, for me, is this: We simply cannot allow this trend  of violence and intimidation to become the new normal in our country.  This is a really serious problem that deserves serious attention. The  solutions will not come simply. They will not be found in a single  piece of legislation.   As President Reagan famously put it, ``Freedom is never more than one  generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it on to our children  in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on to  them to do the same.''   That is what we are called upon to do again now--to inform, to  engage, to empower; in the end, to inspire a new generation to defend a  fundamental right for future generations, just as past generations did  for us.   That is what I aim to do by continuing this dialogue on the Senate  floor. From this platform, I will continue to raise the importance of  free speech, outline the threats it faces, and do what I can to inform  and encourage Americans to rally in its defense.   Others are using their platforms to advance similar goals, as  Chairman Grassley did yesterday. I hope more will join as this  discussion continues because free speech is crucial to who we are as  Americans, regardless of party, and we owe it to future generations to  do what we can today to defend it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate this  year's winners of the Congressional Award. Established by Congress in  1979, the award recognizes the achievements of young Americans between  the ages of 14 and 23 years old. It celebrates their accomplishment in  four program areas: voluntary public service, personal development,  physical fitness, and expedition/exploration.   The Award challenges participants to set goals in an area that  interests them. If they successfully achieve their goals, they earn  bronze, silver, and gold certificates and medals. Through the program,  these young Americans gain new skills, earn greater confidence, and  position themselves to be productive citizens.   Each year in June, these young people are presented their  Congressional Awards at a ceremony here in our Nation's Capital. On  behalf of the U.S. Senate, I would like to congratulate all of the  winners for their accomplishments and for the example they set for  others. Among this impressive group, my State of Kentucky is home to  five medalists. Through their efforts, the recipients of the 2017  Congressional Awards are strengthening their communities and our  Nation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of this year's  recipients of the Congressional Award be printed in the Record.
