 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life of Sergeant  First Class Donald Keith Strickland, who recently passed away. Donald's  favorite quote was: ``My proudest accomplishment was defending our  great Nation.''   Sergeant First Class Donald Keith Strickland was born on May 31,  1934, to George and Ruth Strickland in Richmond, Indiana. The  Stricklands moved out to California for a better life, as many did back  in those days.   Young Donald grew up in the San Fernando Valley and had many  different jobs, from working at his family's grocery store to doing a  paper route on his horse called Star Baby.   While attending high school, Donald had a call to duty and joined the  Navy on his 17th birthday. Donald's father had to sign papers in order  to release him to enlist for the Korean war. While in Korea, he served  on the famed aircraft carriers USS Yorktown and USS Hornet. After the  Korean war and 3 years in the Navy, Donald decided to join the Army,  where he spent the next 18 years of his life.   Donald did his basic training at Fort Bragg. During Donald's first  jump after training, his parachute did not open until he almost hit the  ground. As he tells the story: ``I was the last one out of the plane  and the first one down.''   During Donald's time in the Army, he was stationed in West Germany,  where he met the love of his life, Antonie, and they have been married  for over 60 years.   Donald was sent off to the Vietnam war, where he served two tours of  duty and was awarded the Bronze Star for bravery in action during the  Tet Offensive. Donald rose to the rank of sergeant first class.   After getting injured in the war, Donald became a drill sergeant at  Fort Ord Army Base in Monterey, California. As his kids tell their  friends, imagine having a drill sergeant for a dad.   In reminiscing with his children, Donald was always proud to be  called a soldier for America. Donald considered the United States of  America the greatest country in the world.   In 1973, Donald retired from the armed services and relocated to Simi  Valley, California, where he worked for the police department.   Donald loved working with his hands and could fix anything. Donald  never had a negative comment about anyone, and any person who knew him  loved him for his hard work and his smile. Donald's commitment was  resounding, as he did not retire until the age of 75.   Donald is survived by his wife, Antonie; his children, Gabriele,  Rene, and Anthony; his grandchildren, Jacob, Samantha, Natasha,  Alexandra, Ruby, and Anthony; and his great-grandchildren, Wyatt,  Kayla, Sophia, and Bryce.   Donald had been a resident of Ventura County since 1973 and resided  in Camarillo since 2000 with his wife for the remainder of his life.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a tribute to Donald Strickland.                        SFC Donald Keith Strickland                    May 31, 1934-April 29, 2021 (age 86)                                   tribute  ``My proudest accomplishment was defending our great nation.''--Donald                               K.

During his first jump       after training, Donald's parachute did not open until he       almost hit ground. As he tells the story, ``I was the last       one out of the plane and the first one down.'' Not       discouraged, his commanding officer sent him right back up       with no hesitation on Donald's part. He loved jumping out of       airplanes.        During his time in the Army, Donald was stationed in West       Germany where he met the love of his life, Antonie, and have       been married over 60 years.

Faith in God, then we're right,      And we'll fight with all our might,      As the Army keeps rolling along.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this past weekend, we celebrated Mother's  Day, a day for families across our great Nation to honor our mothers.   God has blessed me with a wife, the mother of our three beautiful  children, including two daughters.   My own mother, Lala, has instilled in me the values I am proud to  cherish today, including my faith and belief in family. My mother, who  is almost 80 years old, fled Communist Cuba under the Castro regime and  is now a proud American. Her love of country inspires me each day.   Mother's Day was founded by West Virginia native Anna Jarvis in 1908.  But the radical left, including some Members of Congress, have begun  referring to mothers as ``birthing people.''   NARAL, the pro-choice lobbying group, tweeted on May 6: ``When we  talk about birthing people, we are being inclusive. It is that  simple.''   The canceling of the term ``mother'' actually began here in the  Congress when Speaker Pelosi changed the House Rules package and  eliminated the words ``mother,'' ``father,'' ``son,'' and ``daughter,''  and replaced them with ``parent'' and ``child.''   It defies common sense that the cancel culture and some Members of  Congress would seek to cancel the term ``mother.'' It is wrong that we  cannot celebrate mothers on the House floor. All mothers play an  important role.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
