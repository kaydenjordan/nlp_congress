 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Earlier today, the Congressional Budget Office released its updated  budget and economic outlook for the next decade. This report once again  confirms that, despite the economic expansion he inherited, the fiscal  outlook has worsened since President Trump took office.   Under President Trump, deficits have risen to heights not usually  seen outside of recessions and major world  [[Page H613]]  wars. They have increased every year, an unusual trend given that  deficits tend to fall as unemployment rises.   In fact, the deficit in 2019 was the highest since 2012, when we were  recovering from the Great Recession and the unemployment was 8 percent,  more than double today's rate.   As a result of these deficits, the national debt has climbed higher  and faster than CBO projected at the end of the Obama administration.  Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. After all, this is the same  President who proclaimed just last week, ``Who the hell cares about the  budget?'' The record is clear that he doesn't.   On their face, these fiscal facts might not be so concerning if one  forgets about the multitude of deficits we face in the real economy:  crumbling infrastructure, skyrocketing healthcare costs, widening  student achievement gaps, warming climate, lower life expectancy.   In light of these and other problems, it is difficult to escape the  conclusion that we should be making bolder investments in American  families and our Nation's future. But President Trump didn't use our  fiscal space to repair the roads and bridges that support our economy,  to reduce drug prices for working families, or to bolster our  environmental resilience in the face of the defining threat of a  generation. No, President Trump and Republicans in Congress ran up our  tab with a $1.9 trillion tax cut--if you add interest, $2.3 trillion-- that showered benefits on corporations and the wealthy.   Madam Speaker, that $1.9 trillion had little meaningful impact on the  economy, other than increasing our already shameful income inequality.  Madam Speaker, that $1.9 trillion could have been, but was not, put  toward making childcare more affordable, college education more  accessible, and retirement security more achievable for American  families.   Making this situation far worse, President Trump is once again  suggesting that he will offset the deficits that his signature policy  exploded by cutting Social Security and Medicare, taking money right  out of the pockets of America's seniors and forcing them to foot his  bill.    Our economy and budget face difficult times ahead. An aging  population and rising healthcare costs mean economic growth is  projected to be slower and deficits are expected to be larger going  forward.   Addressing this issue over the next several decades will require a  balanced approach that includes a fair tax system.   President Trump has taken us precisely in the wrong direction by  adding trillions to the debt for a tax giveaway for the rich that  yielded little in return for everyone else. He is squandering the  chance to lay the groundwork for a more productive and equitable  economy.   Despite these challenges, we still have the opportunity to make  responsible investments in the American people, our infrastructure, and  the environment, investments that reflect our values, promote a  stronger economic and fiscal outlook, and move our Nation forward.   As chairman of the Budget Committee, I have stressed that we need to  think seriously about severe and persistent deficits in the real  economy, not just deficits in the budget. That doesn't mean that we can  spend tax dollars without thought or discretion, but it does require  that we use our Nation's resources, including our deficits, more wisely  than this administration has. It means prioritizing policies that  improve the living standards of current and future generations that  support those most in need and help mitigate the challenges American  families are facing today and the challenges they may face tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, a week from today, we will hear about the  state of our Union from an impeached President who has repeatedly shown  a complete disregard for the principles on which that union was  founded.   President Trump has brazenly trampled the constitutional boundaries  of executive power, damaging the foundation of our democracy. He  shamelessly betrayed his oath of office by putting his own corrupt  agenda before our national security.   His withholding of aid to Ukraine has dominated the news, but the  administration's willingness to pervert our laws for President Trump's  ego, personal vendettas, and political gains goes much deeper.   Earlier this month, the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability  Office, or GAO, issued a legal opinion stating that Trump's Office of  Management and Budget, OMB, violated Federal law, specifically the  Impoundment Control Act of 1974, by withholding foreign aid.   Madam Speaker, I will include that opinion in the Record.                                time  1845    As chairman of the Budget Committee, which has jurisdiction over this  law, it is my responsibility to provide the full story to the American  people and to Members of Congress so that we can all fully understand  what is happening to our government.   To start with, this violation of Federal law was not an innocent  mistake. Withholding Ukrainian aid was an intentional and brazen abuse  of power. This quid pro quo is the most egregious example that we know  of, but the Budget Committee has been concerned by OMB's questionable  behavior and apparent violations of the Impoundment Control Act for  some time.   A deeper look clearly reveals how methodically the President and his  administration have been circumventing our laws to advance their  authoritarian view of executive power. To understand their scheme, we  must understand the law they tried to secretly dodge and ultimately  broke, the Impoundment Control Act.   The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to appropriate our  tax dollars, while the President's administration carries out these  spending decisions. It is a simple but incredibly important check on  executive power.   In 1974, Congress passed the Impoundment Control Act, the ICA, in  response to another law-breaking President, President Nixon. By  refusing to spend congressionally appropriated funds for programs he  opposed, such as funding for clean drinking water, Nixon's  administration was impounding funds.   An impoundment means any action or inaction that prevents Federal  funds  [[Page H624]]  from being obligated or spent, either temporarily or permanently.   By passing the ICA, Congress reasserted its constitutional power of  the purse by establishing procedures to block the President and other  government officials from substituting their own funding decisions for  those of Congress.   It created two pathways the executive branch can use to reduce,  delay, or eliminate congressionally appropriated funding: They can  propose to cancel funding, which is known as a recision, or delay  funding, which is a deferral, but both must meet strict requirements.   For example, if the President wants to eliminate funding for a  specific program, he must first secure congressional approval to cancel  that funding. The ICA requires that the President send a special  message to Congress identifying the amount of, the reasons for, and the  effects of a proposed recision.   After submitting this special message, the President can withhold  those funds for up to 45 legislative session days while Congress  considers the request. But if Congress does not pass a law to cancel  those funds within that 45-day period, those funds must be released. So  even with this process, the President cannot cancel funding without  Congress' explicit approval.   Also, the President cannot use the recisions process to run out the  fiscal year clock, in other words, to withhold funds for so long that  they can no longer be used. We will come back to recision, so keep this  in mind.   Now, the ICA defines a deferral as withholding, delaying, or  effectively preventing congressionally approved funds from being  obligated or spent, either through executive action or inaction. But  here is the catch. There are only three narrow circumstances in which  the President can propose a deferral: to provide for contingencies, to  achieve budgetary savings through approved operational efficiency, and  as specifically provided by law.   Notice that policy reasons is not one of the three.   As with recisions, the ICA requires that the President send a special  message to Congress identifying how much they want to defer, why, and  for how long. However, a proposed deferral may not extend beyond the  end of the fiscal year. Only once Congress receives this special  message can the President withhold those funds.   Again, the President cannot withhold funds for so long that they can  no longer be used.   I hope that didn't make anyone's eyes glaze over, but the details of  the Impoundment Control Act are at the heart of this administration's  lack of respect for our Nation's separation of powers and rule of law.   Today, nearly 46 years after the ICA became law, Congress confronts a  President and an administration eager to blow past the boundaries of  executive budgetary power and co-opt Congress' power of the purse for  the President's personal gain.   This brings us to 2018 and one the first red flags. My committee's  concerns about ICA violations under the Trump administration actually  started in 2018, when I was serving as the committee's ranking member.   Multiple reports warned that the Trump administration was considering  a late-in-the-year recisions package that would have effectively  started that 45-day clock close to the end of the fiscal year. As you  recall, the ICA requires congressional approval before funds can be  canceled. By withholding funds through their expiration date, President  Trump and OMB aimed to game the system and create a backdoor recission.  The White House had to abandon this scheme in the face of bipartisan  condemnation.   To send a clear message to the White House and to put an end to any  future attempts at backdoor recisions, then-Chairman Womack and I, in  October of 2018, requested GAO's legal opinion on whether an ill-timed  recision package from the White House would violate the ICA.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the letter that then-Chairman  Womack and I sent to the GAO.                                           House of Representatives,                                         Committee on the Budget,                             Washington, DC 20515, October 31, 2018.      Hon. Gene L. Dodaro,      Comptroller General, U.S. Government Accountability Office,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Dodaro: We are requesting clarification in the       form of a legal opinion on the issue of proposed rescissions       of funds submitted close to their expiration date. It is       important that Congress remain at the center of the decision       of whether to withhold funds. To that end Congress should       have adequate time to receive, consider, and act on any       rescission message sent by the President.        Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA), the       President may submit a special message proposing the       rescission of budget authority and may withhold funds from       obligation for a period of 45 calendar days of continuous       session following transmission of the special message. Public       Law No. 93-344, as amended, 1012; 2 U.S.C. Sec. 683. If       Congress does not pass a rescission bill within the 45-day       period, the ICA requires that the funds be released for       obligation. Specifically, section 1012(b) states: ``Any       amount of budget authority proposed to be rescinded or that       is to be reserved as set forth in such special message shall       be made available for obligation unless, within the       prescribed 45-day period, the Congress has completed action       on a rescission bill rescinding all or part of the amount       proposed to be rescinded or that is to be reserved.''        As you know, the rescission process has been used this year       for the first time since the Clinton Administration.       Naturally, some questions have arisen. One question of       particular importance to Congress concerns whether the       executive can use the rescission process to withhold funds       from obligation for the duration of the 45-day period, even       if the funds expire before the end of that period.        GAO has never issued an opinion on the legality of       withholding funds in this circumstance. We now request GAO's       legal opinion regarding whether the ICA allows funds to be       withheld from obligation in this situation.        Thank you for your attention to this matter.            Sincerely,                                                      Steve Womack,                                                          Chairman,                                                      John Yarmuth,                                                    Ranking Member.     In December 2018, GAO issued a decision, which I will  include in the Record, concluding that, while the ICA does, under  limited circumstances, allow the President to withhold money for up to  45 congressional session days, the President cannot freeze the money  for so long that it can no longer be used.   GAO confirmed Congress' constitutional role, saying: ``A withholding  of this nature would be an aversion both to the constitutional process  for enacting Federal law and to Congress' constitutional power of the  purse, for the President would preclude the obligation of budget  authority Congress has already enacted and did not rescind.''   Mr. Womack and I both welcomed this opinion from GAO, calling it an  important confirmation of Congress' constitutional authority over  funding decisions.   While GAO was deliberating, OMB submitted their views, as is  customary. A letter from OMB's general counsel seems to assert the  belief that the President can do whatever he wants, that he doesn't  have to respect our separation of powers or the will of Congress to  cancel funds he doesn't want to spend, that he is above the law.   As GAO stated in their opinion: ``The President has no unilateral  authority to withhold funds from obligation.''   ``The President cannot rely on the authority in the ICA to withhold  amounts from obligation, while simultaneously disregarding the ICA's  limitations.''   This deliberate disregard for our laws undermines our democracy. The  executive branch is not a monarchy, but this attitude is a pernicious  problem with this administration.   Less than a year later, in August of 2019, a document, a letter  apportionment from OMB, was leaked. An apportionment is a legally  binding budget document used by OMB to set the rate at which an agency  spends its funds over the course of a fiscal year.   For example, we wouldn't want an agency to come to Congress in March  saying that it has already spent its entire annual operating budget and  must cease operations unless Congress provides more money. To prevent  this, OMB apportions agencies money. However, this leaked letter from  August 3, 2019, raised multiple red flags.   First, this letter apportionment, sent to officials at the State  Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, put an  abrupt freeze on billions in foreign aid less than 60 days before the  end of the fiscal year.   OMB put a legally binding hold on 15 key accounts that covered a  spectrum of assistance, international control,  [[Page H625]]  peacekeeping operations, global health programs, foreign military  financing programs, and more.   Similar to 2018, reports were circulating that President Trump  planned a late-in-the-year recisions package, despite GAO's decision  just 9 months earlier rebuking the tactic as an end run around  Congress.   On August 19, Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sanders and I  wrote a letter to President Trump's Acting Chief of Staff and OMB  Director Mick Mulvaney urging him to follow the law and to respect  Congress' constitutional authority.   Second red flag, this apportionment was signed by Michael Duffey, an  administration political appointee. Since OMB's inception, career  officials with knowledge and expertise of the apportionment process and  impoundment law, not political appointees, have signed these highly  technical budget documents. This means that OMB took the unprecedented  step of stripping career officials of their normal role in the  apportionment process and, instead, gave this responsibility to someone  who had been appointed by the President. This was, to say the least,  suspicious.   Third red flag, under current law, apportionments are not public  documents. OMB sent no special message to Congress to flag this hold on  foreign aid, as the law requires; they kept Congress in the dark. If  the document had not been leaked, Congress might not have ever  discovered this suspicious funding freeze.   What else were they hiding?   While this leaked August 3 letter apportionment is what first alerted  Congress to the President's willingness to break the law, at that time  we could not have guessed how nefarious it really was. A few weeks  later, the Budget Committee would uncover a pattern of abuse of the  apportionment process, our separation of powers, and current law.   As part of our investigation, my committee asked OMB for documents  and answers detailing their involvement in the withholding of foreign  aid. After review of the materials provided to us, it was clear that  this was an intentional and willful abuse of power.   To lay this out as plainly as I can, I will outline what happened  chronologically.   It all starts on May 23, 2019, when the Pentagon sent a letter to  Congress certifying that the Government of Ukraine had met Congress'  anticorruption requirements and was, therefore, eligible to receive the  critical security assistance it needed. Most importantly, the Pentagon  notified lawmakers of its plans to spend the money.   Keep in mind that this is critical funding Ukraine needs to protect  itself from Russia, our shared adversary.   The first sign of trouble came almost a month later, on June 19,  2019. In response to our request for answers, OMB asserts that this is  when they first reach out to the Department of Defense to ask about the  Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, or USAI, funds.   Mark Sandy, an Afghanistan veteran and top career OMB official who is  responsible for managing the flow of Pentagon funds, testified that OMB  officials were told the President wanted the Ukraine aid paused, but he  didn't understand why.   So, while reaching out to the Pentagon to learn more about the aid  package, he also repeatedly pressed Mr. Duffey about why President  Trump imposed the hold. But Mr. Sandy didn't get a clear answer. He  testified that Mr. Duffey ``didn't provide an explicit response on the  reason. He simply said, `We need to let the hold take place'--and I'm  paraphrasing here--`and then revisit this issue with the President.' ''    Just about a week later, on June 27, Mick Mulvaney was flying on Air  Force One with President Trump when he fired off a quick email to an  aide back in Washington. The email said: ``I'm just trying to tie up  some loose ends. Did we ever find out about the money for Ukraine and  whether we can hold it back?''   The aide, Robert Blair, replied that, while they could carry out the  President's request, the move to withhold aid passed in a bipartisan  spending deal would not go over well with Congress. ``Expect Congress  to become unhinged,'' he wrote back.   I don't know about unhinged, but Congress was not going to let this  abuse of executive overreach go unanswered.   These early conversations are critical to our timeline because they  show that this administration's abuse of our laws and plans to  blackmail a foreign nation into helping President Trump cheat our  elections was premeditated.   President Trump, Mulvaney, and Duffey abused OMB's authority to  withhold Ukraine security assistance at the same time President Trump  directed his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and his associates to  solicit foreign interference in our elections.   In July, they set their plans in motion. During an interagency  meeting on July 18, an OMB staffer relayed President Trump's order to  freeze all Ukraine assistance to the State Department and the Pentagon.  This stunned and infuriated our own top Ukrainian diplomats, who  understood the necessity of strong American support for Ukraine in  their fight against Russia. Later that day, the House Foreign Affairs  Committee was warned about the hold by administration sources, urging  them to investigate.   But the bottom line was that there was no legal way for President  Trump to withhold aid to Ukraine without Congress' approval. Since it  was a politically motivated hold, it would not even qualify for a  deferral under the ICA. If the President was going to hold this aid  hostage, he had to find a way to go behind Congress' back and secretly  impound hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Sandy testified that, on July 19, Mr. Duffey proposed using the  apportionment process to implement the hold, that is, to use a legally  binding budget document to withhold security assistance to Ukraine.   Mr. Sandy also testified that, while approving apportionment  schedules for agencies is routine, attaching a footnote to block  spending was so unusual he did not recall another event like it in his  12 years of service at OMB.                                time  1900    There is a reason for that. It could be considered a violation of the  Impoundment Control Act.   As you will recall, the ICA prohibits the President and his  administration from withholding aid unless it is done under the  authorities of the Impoundment Control Act, which require notification  to Congress, which OMB did not want to do.   A week later, on July 25, President Trump had his now-infamous call  with Ukrainian President Zelensky, where he asked a foreign government  to dig up dirt on a political rival. Just 90 minutes after the  President hung up the phone, Mr. Duffey emailed the Pentagon, putting a  hold on the Ukraine aid.   In his email, which was only obtained under the Freedom of  Information Act, Mr. Duffey shared OMB's plan to ``formalize the pause  with an apportionment footnote'' that would come later that day. In  another red flag, Mr. Duffey asked Pentagon officials to keep this  ``hold'' decision as secret as possible.   According to documents obtained by the House Budget Committee, at  6:44 p.m. Eastern time, just hours after the ``perfect call,'' Mr.  Sandy signed an apportionment that officially imposed what OMB claimed  at the time to be a ``brief pause'' in USAI funds.   OMB inserted a footnote into the apportionment that froze all  remaining USAI funding until August 5. The footnote states that the  funds are being held ``to allow for an interagency process to determine  the best use of such funds,'' but also that ``DOD may continue its  planning and casework for the initiative during this period.''   Why would OMB allow the Pentagon to continue working on current plans  and casework if they were claiming they needed to freeze the funds to  review those same plans and casework? Because this hold was never about  a policy review. This hold was this administration's attempt to get  around Congress and secretly undermine the law, to freeze foreign aid  so that they could use it to pressure Ukraine into helping President  Trump cheat to win reelection in 2020.   It is the same hold that Mulvaney referenced in his June email to Mr.  Blair while flying on Air Force One with the President, and it is the  same hold that would ultimately lead to grounds for impeachment.  [[Page H626]]    The July 25 apportionment would be the last one Mr. Sandy would sign.  The White House needed to make sure the aid remained frozen while they  kept up their pressure campaign on President Zelensky. But OMB career  officials were becoming uneasy about the freeze and the illegality of  using apportionments to create secret impoundments.   In an unprecedented move, Mr. Sandy was stripped of his authority to  oversee the management of Ukraine aid, and the apportionment authority  was transferred to President Trump's political appointee, Mr. Duffey.   Remember that leaked letter apportionment that raised red flags? When  that apportionment leaked in early August, Congress still didn't know  about the plot to withhold the Pentagon's $250 million in Ukraine aid.  So here we have 15 State and USAID foreign aid accounts on hold, one of  which includes $26.5 million in Foreign Military Financing funds for-- you guessed it--Ukraine. On top of that, this apportionment is the  first one with Mr. Duffey's signature.   August was a busy time for Mr. Duffey. Someone who had never before  signed apportionment documents started signing all the apportionment  documents in both the National Security Division and the International  Affairs Division instead of career officials. On August 6, Mr. Duffey  signed the first extension of what was supposed to be the brief  withholding of the Pentagon's USAI funds, using another footnote to  freeze the funds until August 12.   Separately, on August 9, our documents show Mr. Duffey signed another  apportionment affecting the State Department and USAID foreign funds  included in the leaked apportionment. This time, OMB said the agencies  are only allowed to spend 2 percent of the funds each day, and it  withholds the rest from the agencies. That is not a programmatic, funds  management, or even a policy decision.   The State Department doesn't send a couple thousand dollars to  support international peacekeeping missions one day and then a couple  thousand dollars to support international narcotics control the next.  That is not how it works.   Limiting agencies to such a minuscule amount effectively prevented  these funds from being spent at all, while at the same time, the  apportionment continued to withhold the majority of remaining funds. It  was another backdoor attempt to freeze funding and possibly rescind it  completely by running out the clock.   On August 19, Senator Sanders and I sent our letter to OMB and the  White House, calling on the administration to stop impounding funds, to  respect GAO's legal opinion from the previous December, stating that a  late-in-the-year rescission request that prevents congressional action  and withholds funds until they can no longer be used would violate the  ICA.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the letter Senator Sanders and  I sent to Director Mulvaney.         Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, August 19 2019.      Hon. Mick Mulvaney,      Director, Office of Management and Budget,      Washington, DC.        Dear Director Mulvaney: We write to express our profound       concern regarding the Administration's reported plan to       submit a rescission request to the Congress just a few weeks       before the end of the fiscal year.        Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA), the       President may submit a special message proposing the       rescission of budget authority and may withhold funds from       obligation for a period of 45 calendar days of continuous       session following transmission of the special message. In       keeping with Congress's constitutional power of the purse,       however, such funding must be released absent approval by       Congress within the 45-day period. Specifically, section       1012(b) of the ICA states:         Any amount of budget authority proposed to be rescinded or       that is to be reserved as set forth in such special message       shall be made available for obligation unless, within the       prescribed 45-day period, the Congress has completed action       on a rescission bill rescinding all or part of the amount       proposed to be rescinded or that is to be reserved.         Submitting a rescissions request and withholding funds from       obligation this late in the fiscal year could result in       funding being withheld through its expiration date. In       December 2018, at the request of the House Budget Committee,       the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a       legal opinion that addressed this circumstance. GAO found       that ``the ICA does not permit the withholding of funds       through their date of expiration.'' Further, GAO determined       that absent Congressional action to rescind the funds,         amounts proposed for rescission must be made available for       prudent obligation before the amounts expire, even where the       45-day period for congressional consideration provided in the       ICA approaches or spans the date on which funds would expire:       the requirement to make amounts available for obligation in       this situation prevails over the privilege to temporarily       withhold the amounts.         The authority provided by the ICA to the Executive Branch       to withhold funds temporarily is necessarily limited. The GAO       opinion states:         It would be an abuse of this limited authority and an       interference with Congress's constitutional prerogatives if a       President were to time the withholding of expiring budget       authority to effectively alter the time period that the       budget authority is available for obligation from the time       period established by Congress in duly enacted appropriations       legislation.         As the chairman and ranking member of the respective House       and Senate committees with jurisdiction over the Impoundment       Control Act, we affirm our strong agreement with the legal       analysis and conclusions reached by GAO. We strongly urge the       Administration to refrain from sending a rescission message       to the Congress; however, in the event the Administration       submits such a message, it must take measures to ensure that       the affected funds will be prudently obligated in the event       the Congress does not approve the rescission, as required by       law. To withhold these funds until they can no longer be       prudently obligated or until they expire, in the absence of       Congressional approval of the rescission, would violate the       ICA and flout an important constitutional check. We trust       that you will comply with the law and respect the       constitutional role of the Congress to remain at the center       of funding decisions.        Thank you for your attention to these concerns.            Sincerely,      John Yarmuth,        Chairman, House Committee on the Budget.      Bernard Sanders,        Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Budget.     At this time, we did not understand that the President  and OMB actually had learned from their 2018 attempts to circumvent  Congress. But they learned the wrong lesson. Now, they were just trying  to bypass Congress completely.   By the second week of August, Mr. Duffey was issuing holds on USAI  funds every couple of days to block the Pentagon from sending aid. OMB  was doing what it could to keep the President's hold on Ukraine aid  active, but on August 28, a senior administration official told  Politico about the hold on USAI funds. The President's scheme was  unraveling.   On August 29, our documents show Mr. Duffey signed another letter  apportionment releasing 25 percent of the remaining State Department  and USAID funds each Sunday in September. With this latest trick, it  was clear these agencies were not going to be able to spend all the  funds Congress appropriated before they expired on September 30. And in  fact, they didn't, which was apparently OMB's intention all along.   Meanwhile, Mr. Duffey was still signing apportionments to freeze USAI  funds until September 12. During this time, DOD warned that OMB's  ongoing hold on Ukraine assistance would prevent them from using all  the funds Congress appropriated before they expired on September 30.  And, of course, DOD was right.   On September 18, Chairwoman Lowey and I wrote to OMB, expressing deep  concerns about OMB's escalating abuses of its apportionment authority  and its blatant attempts to undermine Congress' power of the purse.  Basically, we told them to stop their pretty obvious attempts to evade,  invalidate, and violate congressional appropriations laws and the ICA.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record that letter of September 18.                                           House of Representatives,                                         Committee on the Budget,                                 Washington, DC, September 18, 2019.      Hon. Mick Mulvaney,      Acting Chief of Staff, The White House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Russell Vought,      Acting Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Vought: We write to express our       deep concerns about the Office of Management and Budget's       (OMB's) increasingly dubious and politicized applications of       budget law, as well as the role they have played in impeding       other agencies' ability to use their enacted appropriations.  [[Page H627]]       OMB's actions have already damaged important government       programs, diminished our country's security and standing       abroad, and if continued, threaten to permanently undermine       fundamental checks and balances in our constitutional       republic.        Specifically, during the last year, OMB has demonstrated a       growing willingness to abuse its Presidentially-delegated       apportionment authorities and impermissibly disrupt the       balance of powers between the branches. The agency's       apportionment authorities may not be used as a form of       executive control or influence over agency functions. Rather,       they may only be exercised in the manner and for the purposes       prescribed in the Antideficiency Act (ADA) and in compliance       with other appropriations and budget laws, including title X       of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of       1974 (Impoundment Control Act). None of those laws give the       Executive Branch the unilateral power to invalidate duly       enacted statutes through the apportionment process.        Nevertheless, OMB continues to abuse those authorities, and       the apportionment process, to flout the Constitution's       assignment of the power of the purse to Congress. OMB's       inexplicable and unprecedented apportionment actions have       withheld critical funding provided for the Department of       State and United States Agency for International Development       (USAID) in a manner inconsistent with long-standing policies       and procedures. Those OMB actions are deleteriously impacting       the prudent obligation of foreign assistance intended to       support U.S. interests, and are hindering the efficient and       effective management of U.S. funds and programs. Indeed,       those actions seem to be specifically designed to obstruct       the agencies' ability to use their appropriations for their       Congressionally-approved purposes in the final weeks before       they expire. We have serious legal concerns that those       actions will result in de facto impoundments, and we are       deeply troubled that this may be OMB's unstated goal.        The apportionment actions at issue also undermine important       programs and policies that Congress funded, to among other       things:        Fulfill U.S. treaty obligations and support the nation's       international allies and partners;        Counter Russian aggression and Chinese influence across the       globe;        Respond to humanitarian crises all over the world,       including in Venezuela, Syria, and Burma;        Counter violent extremism in the Sahel, Yemen, and       elsewhere; and        Enable important initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific       Strategy and Power Africa.        Withholding funds through the apportionment process until       they can no longer be prudently obligated is a back-door       rescission without Congressional approval. A year ago, OMB       retreated from its plan to illegally impound State Department       and USAID appropriations through a cynically-timed       rescissions proposal--a misguided scheme that OMB threatened       again this year, even after clear warning from the Government       Accountability Office (GAO) that such attempts were in       violation of the Impoundment Control Act. We are concerned       that OMB's intransigence on these issues has led it to try to       accomplish through the apportionment process what it had       hoped to accomplish with a rescissions proposal.        OMB has continued to push this unlawful agenda and       perniciously broadened its sights to target funding provided       by the Congress to the Department of Defense to counter       Russian aggression. In particular, OMB withheld funding       provided for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a       vital form of Congressionally-directed assistance that helps       Ukraine defend its sovereign territory. As with the State and       USAID funding, this funding also expires at the end of this       month, and recent estimates indicate that at least tens of       millions--and potentially over one hundred million--in funds       will expire as a result of OMB's attempts to stifle the       Department of Defense's access to this lawfully provided       funding. This apparent impoundment has interrupted the       Defense Department's work on security programs that have been       in place with a partner nation for years.        OMB also took the unusual and perhaps unprecedented step of       delegating the authority to execute these apportionments to a       political appointee, in lieu of career civil servants who       have historically been the designated officials responsible       for overseeing and executing these technical budget       documents. More than that, the apportionment actions taken by       this political appointee have no justifiable policy, program,       or funds management rationale.        We are deeply troubled by this pattern of OMB interference       with agencies' use of appropriations for authorized purposes.       All the funding for the programs and policies mentioned above       was negotiated in good faith between, and subsequently       approved by, bipartisan majorities in the Congress, and was       signed into law by President Trump. Moreover, we are deeply       concerned that OMB has intended that these actions take place       without Congressional oversight or transparency to the       public, given that OMB has been unwilling to provide       apportionments even pursuant to written requests by our       committees.        We assure you that our committees will remain focused on       OMB's use of apportionments and that we will respond       forcefully to Executive Branch actions that seek to override       the Congress' most fundamental constitutional power. We are       actively pursuing a range of options to ensure that OMB is       held accountable for any improper apportionment actions and       to ensure that the Congress remains at the center of funding       decisions. In the meantime, we urge you in the strongest       possible terms to return OMB to its function of administering       enacted laws, to immediately release for use all remaining       expiring funds, and to cease further attempts to evade and       invalidate the laws passed by the Congress. We sincerely hope       you can be successful in restoring the trust that OMB has       historically held as a valuable institution and good steward       of federal funding.      John A. Yarmuth,        Chairman, House Committee on the Budget.      Nita M. Lowey,        Chairwoman, House Committee on Appropriations.     But then, Madam Speaker, the whistleblower report was  made public. The report outlined how President Trump instructed his  administration and OMB officials to put a hold on almost $400 million  in Ukraine security assistance ahead of his July 25 phone call with  President Zelensky. The President abused his power and betrayed the  oath he took before the American people to defend our national security  and honor our Constitution.   As the plan unraveled, the picture became clear. The administration  was abusing the apportionment process to secretly and illegally impound  funding provided by Congress to protect our national security, to use  this leverage against a foreign nation to help the President cheat our  elections, and they couldn't hide it any longer.   On September 24, Speaker Pelosi announced a formal impeachment  inquiry into the shady dealings of the Trump administration.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of September 27 that  Chairwoman Lowey and I sent to OMB, seeking answers and documents  related to the withholding of the Ukraine aid, State and USAID funds,  and abuse of the apportionment process.                                  Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, September 27, 2019.      Hon. Mick Mulvaney,      Acting Chief of Staff, The White House, Washington, DC.      Hon. Russell Vought,      Acting Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Vought:        The Committees on the Budget and Appropriations are the       primary committees charged with overseeing and writing       federal budget and appropriation laws. Consistent with our       authority, we are continuing our efforts in the 116th       Congress to pursue productive improvements and reforms to the       laws and authorities governing federal financial management       to ensure that the Congress remains at the center of funding       decisions. Specifically, our committees are considering       legislative proposals related to the apportionment process       and the withholding of funds, including in the context of the       lmpoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA) and the annual       appropriations acts.        As we stated in our September 18th letter, we have serious       concerns that recent apportionment actions by the Office of       Management and Budget (OMB) to withhold military aid for       Ukraine and other foreign assistance constitute unlawful       impoundments in violation of the ICA and are an abuse of the       authority provided to the President to apportion       appropriations. In the short time since we sent that letter,       additional reports have emerged detailing the circumstances       surrounding the withholding of funding for Ukraine and OMB's       involvement in that withholding.        According to those reports, at least a week prior to a July       25th phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian       President Zelenskyy, President Trump told Mr. Mulvaney to       withhold almost $400 million in military aid and foreign       assistance for Ukraine, and ``[o]fficials at the Office of       Management and Budget relayed Trump's order to the State       Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in       mid-July.'' The reporting also indicates that ``[t]here was       concern within the administration that if they did not spend       the money [appropriated for Ukraine], they would run afoul of       the law'' and that, eventually, Mr. Vought released the       money.        On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, at the United Nations       General Assembly, the President confirmed the withholding and       added his reasoning, stating:        As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They       were fully paid. But my complaint has always been--and I'd       withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time       as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine. Because       they're not doing it.        The recently declassified complaint submitted to the Office       of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG)       on Monday, August 12, 2019 provided similar confirmation of       OMB's withholding of appropriated funding for Ukraine. The       complaint, which appeared credible according to a letter from       the ICIG, stated among other things:  [[Page H628]]         On 18 July, an Office of Management and Budget (OMB)       official informed Departments and Agencies that the President       ``earlier that month'' had issued instructions to suspend all       U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. Neither OMB nor the NSC       staff knew why this instruction had been issued. During       interagency meetings on 23 July and 26 July, OMB officials       again stated explicitly that the instruction to suspend this       assistance had come directly from the President, but they       still were unaware of a policy rationale. As of early August,       I heard from U.S. officials that some Ukrainian officials       were aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy, but I do not       know how or when they learned of it.        As reports continue to emerge, we have deepening concerns       that OMB continues to demonstrate a pattern of impeding       agencies' ability to use their enacted appropriations; that       recent apportionment actions taken by OMB to withhold       military aid and foreign assistance funding administered by       the Department of Defense, Department of State, and U.S.       Agency for International Development constitute unlawful       impoundments; and that OMB took the unusual and seemingly       unprecedented step of delegating the authority to execute       these apportionments to a political appointee, in lieu of       career civil servants who have historically been the       designated officials responsible for overseeing and executing       these technical budget documents. These actions have       collectively undermined the longstanding application and       predictability of federal funds management processes and       require closer examination by our committees to inform       appropriate legislative responses and reforms.        Therefore, to support our committees' efforts, we request       that OMB produce written responses to the committees, no       later than Tuesday, October 1, 2019, to the following       questions:        (1) a. When did OMB first instruct agencies to withhold       assistance for Ukraine, including amounts appropriated in       section 9013 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act,       2019 for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and any       applicable amounts provided in other appropriation acts for       the Foreign Military Financing Program?        b. In which Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol(s) (TAFS or       account) were amounts withheld?        c. When was the first apportionment action executed for       (each of) the relevant account(s) to withhold those funds?        d. Were the withheld funds made available for immediate use       by the agencies during fiscal year 2019, and if so, when?        (2) a. When did OMB first instruct agencies to withhold       funding in the accounts referenced in the letter       apportionment effective as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight       Time on Saturday, August 3, 2019 (``August 3, 2019 Letter       Apportionment'')?        b. When were the first apportionment actions executed to       withhold those funds?        c. Were the withheld funds made available for immediate use       by the agencies during fiscal year 2019, and if so, when?        No later than Tuesday, October 1, 2019, we also request       that OMB produce the following documentation to the       committees:        (3) All apportionments or reapportionments for fiscal year       2019 that were executed in the last quarter of fiscal year       2019, including documentation of the approval date of each       such apportionment action and any footnotes, for any       applicable TAFS used for assistance for Ukraine or the       Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative appropriation,       including the Department of Defense, Operation and       Maintenance, Defense-wide account, 97-0100/2019 and       account(s) for any applicable amounts provided in other       appropriation acts for the Foreign Military Financing       Program.        (4) All apportionments and reapportionments for fiscal year       2019 that were executed in the last quarter of fiscal year       2019, including documentation of the approval date of each       such apportionment action and any footnotes, for each TAFS       referenced in the August 3, 2019 Letter Apportionment and any       applicable child accounts.        Finally, we request that OMB produce documentation to the       committees, no later than Friday, October 11, 2019, on the       following:        (5) Documentation sufficient to show the obligational       status of the relevant assistance funding to Ukraine by       account, including all amounts appropriated in section 9013       of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019 and any       applicable amounts provided in other appropriation acts for       the Foreign Military Financing Program, as of June 30, 2019       and as of September 30, 2019, including the specific amounts       that were (a) unobligated, (b) obligated but not expended,       and (c) obligated and expended.        (6) Documentation sufficient to show:        a. when OMB first instructed agencies to withhold       assistance for Ukraine, including amounts appropriated in       section 9013 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act,       2019 and any applicable amounts provided in other       appropriation acts for the Foreign Military Financing       Program;        b. the amount of funding that was withheld from obligation,       and in which account(s);        c. when the first apportionment action was executed to       withhold those funds;        d. the period over which the funds were withheld;        e. whether the funds were, subsequent to those       withholdings, made available for immediate use by the       agencies during fiscal year 2019, and if so, when;        f. the factual, legal, and policy bases upon which these       actions were taken; and        g. whether requests were made by the affected agencies to       reapportion the funding at issue, or to alter the conditions       of the apportionments in effect, and if so, whether those       requests were granted.        (7) Documentation sufficient to show:        a. whether there was an ``interagency process'' related to       the withholding or use of amounts appropriated in section       9013 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019,       and the basis for initiating such interagency process,       including its stated purposes and goals;        b. what entities or agencies were involved in such       interagency process;        c. when that process began; and        d. the conclusions reached through that process and when       they were reached, including the outcomes of any interagency       meetings that occurred on July 23, 2019 and July 26, 2019       related to the disposition of the funding.        (8) Documentation sufficient to show the obligational       status of all amounts apportioned as unavailable in the       August 3, 2019 Letter Apportionment. This documentation       should show the status of those funds as of June 30, 2019 and       as of September 30, 2019, and should show, at a minimum, the       specific amounts by account that were (a) unobligated, (b)       obligated but not expended, and (c) obligated and expended.        (9) Documentation sufficient to show:        a. when OMB first instructed agencies to withhold funding       in the accounts referenced in the August 3, 2019 Letter       Apportionment;        b. how much funding was withheld from obligation in each       account, and over what period the amounts were withheld;        c. when the first apportionment actions were executed to       withhold those funds;        d. whether the funds were, subsequent to those       withholdings, made available for immediate use by the       agencies during fiscal year 2019, and if so, when;        e. the factual, legal, and policy bases upon which these       actions were taken; and        f. whether requests were made by the affected agencies to       reapportion the funding at issue, or to alter the conditions       of the apportionments in effect, if any, and whether those       requests were granted.        (10) Documentation sufficient to show the timeline and       basis for the delegation of apportionment authority to the       Associate Director for National Security Programs, any       related delegation actions, and any other delegations of the       apportionment authority to a political appointee during       fiscal year 2019.        (11) All apportionments and reapportionments for fiscal       year 2019 that were executed in the first three quarters of       fiscal year 2019, including documentation of the approval       date of each such apportionment action and any footnotes, for       any applicable TAFS used for assistance for Ukraine or the       Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative appropriation,       including the Department of Defense, Operation and       Maintenance, Defense-wide account, 97-0100/2019 and       account(s) for any applicable amounts provided in       appropriation acts for the Foreign Military Financing       Program.        (12) All apportionments and reapportionments for fiscal       year 2019 that were executed in the first three quarters of       fiscal year 2019, including documentation of the approval       date of each such apportionment action and any footnotes, for       each TAFS referenced in the August 3, 2019 Letter       Apportionment and any applicable child accounts.        Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.            Sincerely,      John A. Yarmuth,        Chairman, House Committee on the Budget.      Nita M. Lowey,        Chairwoman, House Committee on Appropriations.     Madam Speaker, while we received a partial production of  documents from OMB, they left out large batches of requested materials.   Meanwhile, the House committees involved in the impeachment inquiry  were getting completely stonewalled by the administration. If they did  nothing wrong, why wouldn't they turn over documents or allow officials  to testify? If the President could clear his name, don't you think he  would have done it by now?   Instead, the President and his Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, have  gone on national television and confessed to the very thing Congress  caught them doing. Mulvaney's response? ``Get over it,'' and, ``We do  it all the time.''   In December 2019, the House Budget Committee released a report, which  I intend to put in the Record, outlining three main takeaways from the  documents produced by OMB.   Number one, the timeline of actions taken by OMB, as seen in the  provided apportionments, shows suspicious activity and document a  pattern of abuse of the apportionment process, OMB's authority, and  current law.   Number two, OMB took the seemingly unprecedented step of stripping  career officials of their normal role in  [[Page H629]]  the apportionment process and instead vested a political appointee with  that authority.   And, three, OMB's actions hindered agencies' ability to prudently  obligate funds by the end of the fiscal year, bypassing Congress and  creating backdoor rescissions in violation of the ICA.   Weeks after our report was published, the House of Representatives  impeached Donald J. Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of  justice.   On January 16, 2020, GAO issued a legal opinion, stating that the  actions taken by OMB to withhold foreign aid to Ukraine violated the  ICA. The nonpartisan watchdog even went so far to say: ``OMB's  assertions have no basis in law.''   GAO found the White House's action to withhold security assistance  funding constituted an illegal deferral of funding in violation of the  ICA. The ICA permits deferrals only for very limited purposes and  requires advanced congressional notification. But this was not just a  notification violation. GAO determined that this deferral was  prohibited under the ICA, period.   As GAO emphasized: ``The ICA does not permit deferrals for policy  reasons. . . . OMB's justification for the withholding falls squarely  within the scope of an impermissible policy deferral.''   So even if the President had notified Congress in advance of the  deferral, it still would have been illegal.   The White House has taken a disturbing sense of pride in its  obstruction of Congress so it is no surprise that they failed to fully  cooperate with GAO as well. In its decision, GAO called out the Trump  administration, stating: ``We consider a reluctance to provide a  fulsome response to have constitutional significance.''   The House Budget Committee repeatedly warned the Trump administration  about the ICA. The Department of Defense warned them. The State  Department warned them. Even people in the Executive Office of the  President called out this flagrant abuse of Federal law. But the  President ignored the warnings.   Instead, he used the powers of his office to subvert our laws,  solicit foreign interference to help him cheat in his next election,  and then try to cover it all up.   While the House has taken action to show that no one, including the  President, is above the law, OMB is still scheming. President Trump's  administration continues to abuse its authority and infringe on  Congress' power of the purse--for example, holding up disaster relief  to Puerto Rico. I would wager it is because the President couldn't  handle some criticism from one of their mayors. We shall see.   Last March, my colleagues and I wrote a letter to OMB, which I intend  to put in the Record, calling out this administration for declaring  bogus national emergencies to steal funds Congress appropriated for  crucial military construction and counternarcotic initiatives to use  for the President's border wall, another decision motivated by the  President's political campaign and not taxpayer interests. There is  more, I am sure, that we just don't know about yet, but we will find  out.   In the face of this administration's clear and present threat to our  democracy, we must defend Congress' constitutional authority, protect  our separation of powers, and strengthen the ICA to prevent such  unilateral actions.   In March, I will introduce legislation that will protect Congress'  power of the purse. It will promote transparency of the executive  branch to limit abuse and ensure no President can hide lawbreaking from  the American people again. It will add teeth to budget law by creating  significant deterrents, including administrative discipline, to create  more accountability for executive branch officials so they won't break  the law, and it will ensure Congress remains front and center in  determining whether emergency declarations made by the President and  the related shifts in funding are justified.   Look, this is a lot of information, and I am normally not one to give  long statements, but in the face of such horrendous attacks on our  democracy, I wanted it all on the Record.   I am also submitting every letter I referenced into the Congressional  Record, as well. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, I felt it  was my responsibility.   It is my hope that these facts help expose this administration's  systemic lawbreaking because if they get away with this and Congress  does not fight back, it will not stop. We all know that.   He could attack specific communities by withholding funds that  support their healthcare. He could retaliate against Senators for their  votes by freezing Federal investments in their States. He could punish  States that he views as unsupportive of his election by withholding the  infrastructure funds.   If we don't stop him, President Trump will use our taxpayer dollars  to punish political adversaries. That creates a destructive precedent  for other Presidents who follow.   I implore our Republican colleagues to join us in this effort to  uphold the oath we all swore and to make it unequivocally clear that,  in the United States of America, no one is above the law.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
