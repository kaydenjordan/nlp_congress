 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the winner of the  2023 Congressional Art Competition for Ohio's 13th Congressional  District, Braewyn Hammontree, an 11th grader from Woodridge High  School.   Art is a powerful medium that transcends boundaries, ignites  emotions, and connects us all. Braewyn's piece brilliantly showcases  the artistic talent of our community. Her work focuses on urban  features and architecture through structure and lighting, and she was  inspired to create her congressional art competition piece after  traveling to Switzerland and Germany last year.   This piece of Ohio 13 is now proudly displayed on the walls of the  Capitol where visitors from across the United States and the world can  see the artistic and creative talent that our community has to offer.   Braewyn's talents extend beyond just the creative arts. She is also a  gifted student-athlete, playing volleyball for her high school. Her  many talents are a testament to her unwavering dedication, tireless  commitment, and incredible passion.   I also recognize Braewyn's parents, Christa and Michael, as well as  her art teacher, Chelby Shay. This achievement would not have been  possible without their unwavering support.   Mr. Speaker, once again, congratulations to Ohio 13's 2023  congressional art competition winner, Braewyn Hammontree. She has  certainly made our community proud, and I look forward to seeing what  she creates next.                            ____________________
