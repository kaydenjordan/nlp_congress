 Mr. President, the joint resolution we are considering  tramples on the right of DC citizens to manage their own affairs, plain  and simple. In fact, it is so intrusive, it provides a compelling  argument for DC statehood.   DC statehood is long overdue. There is no justification for the  denial of rights and representation for the 700,000 citizens of the  District of Columbia. They deserve to have their voices heard in our  democracy; they deserve true self-governance and the right to have a  say in the policies that will affect their lives.   Our Nation's Capital is home to more than 700,000 fellow Americans  who, despite our Nation's founding mantra--``no taxation without  representation''--pay their share of taxes without full voting  representation in either Chamber of Congress. In fact, despite paying  more in Federal taxes per capita than citizens of any of the 50 States,  DC residents have no say in how those taxes are actually spent.   This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue; it is an American issue  because the lack of fair representation for DC residents is clearly  inconsistent with the values on which this country was founded. It is  therefore incumbent upon all of us who enjoy the right and  [[Page S708]]  the privilege of full voting rights and representation to take up the  cause of our fellow citizens in the District of Columbia.   We must use our voices to call out this historic injustice and right  this wrong.   DC has more residents than two States, Wyoming and Vermont. It has a  population comparable to Alaska and Delaware. DC pays more in Federal  taxes than 23 States. Yet it has no representation here in the Senate.  Along with my colleagues who make up the informal ``National Capital  Area'' delegation, I have worked over the years to advance the  District's interests given its proximity to the two States and  significant cross-border commuting and business activity.   Statehood for DC is not about taking away the power and  representation of residents of other States. This is not and should  never be interpreted as a zero-sum game. Instead, what we have here is  a situation that clearly conflicts with our democratic ideals.   The District includes people of all backgrounds. However unique the  District might be, its residents are hard-working people who do not  differ from other Americans in their basic entitlement to  representation. Taxation without representation is a compelling  argument for statehood. It should be enough to move Congress to act.  Instead, we are regressing here.   Rubbing salt into the wound of this intrusion is the fact that  proponents of the joint resolution deliberately mischaracterize what  the Criminal Code revision does, or fails to do. The Revised Criminal  Code Act of 2022--the RCCA--comprehensively revises DC's Criminal Code,  which had not been updated since its creation in 1901. We may agree or  disagree with some of its provisions, but it is a matter that should be  left to the elected officials of the District.   Congress has passed joint resolutions disapproving DC legislation on  three occasions; the last time occurred in 1991. A resolution of  disapproval has not received a floor vote in either Chamber since 2015.   In recent years, it appears that our friends across the aisle have  introduced joint resolutions of disapproval to undermine DC self- governance as a means for advancing partisan policy narratives around  controversial topics such as crime, COVID-19 vaccinations, reproductive  health, and harm reduction programs such as needle exchange.   Although DC Mayor Muriel Bowser vetoed the council's Criminal Code  revision--the Council voted 12-1 to override the veto--she also  indicated her staunch opposition to Congress intervening in the city's  affairs. I agree with Mayor Bowser.   The District's Attorney General, Brian L. Schwalb, sent a letter to  the Senate on February 23, 2023, in which he eloquently stated:         Ironically, many who have expressed support for overriding       these two D.C. local laws have long espoused the virtues of       freedom from federal government interference and respect for       states' rights . . . I am well aware of the Constitutional       power granted to Congress in Article I, Section 8, Clause 17.       However, merely because Congress has the power to act does       not mean that it should exercise that power. Particularly       given Congress' stated intent when passing the Home Rule Act       to empower the District ``to the greatest extent possible''       with the responsibility of ``legislating upon essentially       local District matters,'' I urge the Senate to reject calls       for disapproval of D.C. local laws, and instead, to stand up       for democratic values, stand against disenfranchisement, and       stand with the residents of our Nation's capital.    I agree with Attorney General Schwalb. I deeply regret that Congress  is intervening in the affairs of people who have no representation,  especially here in the Senate, and I urge my colleagues to defeat this  misguided measure.
