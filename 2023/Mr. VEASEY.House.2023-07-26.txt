 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the great tenure  of Reverend Ralph W. Emerson, Jr., who will be conducting his last  sermon at Rising Star Baptist Church on Miller Avenue and Avenue M in  Fort Worth this August before he kicks off his retirement.   Reverend Emerson, better known as Pastor Ralph, was first called to  preach in 1978 and was ordained that very year in December. He became  the assistant pastor of Rising Star Baptist Church in 1989 and after 1  year he was called to be the senior pastor in 1990. During his  illustrious tenure at Rising Star he has really served the community  well. He made sure that kids know how to read, that souls are fed, and  he has done a tremendous job.   Reverend Emerson has worked dutifully in several different capacities  and several cities, including Compton, Houston, and Fort Worth. Prior  to coming to Rising Star, he was an active member of Mount Moriah  Baptist Church in Los Angeles and Faith Baptist in Houston.   Reverend Emerson is involved in so many different endeavors in the  community: JPS, our public hospital, Aids Outreach, different food  banks, and again, he does a tremendous reading program for kids in the  summer.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Reverend Emerson on his retirement and  the community thanks him for his service.                            ____________________
