 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 5060, to  rename the Federal building in my district as the ``Paul D. Wellstone  Federal Building''.   I am proud to honor and celebrate the legacy of the late Senator Paul  Wellstone as an activist, academic, author, and proud Senator from  Minnesota.   Son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, Senator Wellstone was born in  Washington, D.C., and grew up in Northern Virginia. He received his  bachelor, masters, and Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill, and in 1969 went on to be hired as a professor in  Northfield, Minnesota, where he taught until his election to the Senate  in 1990.                                time  1500    While in the U.S. Senate, Wellstone was a proud, progressive in  support of environmental protection, public housing, free school meals,  labor groups, and healthcare reform.   He served in the Senate from 1991 until 2002, when he was tragically  killed in a plane crash with his wife and daughter on board.   Paul Wellstone is a personal hero of mine. He was an organizer to his  core. He showed what it meant to fight unapologetically for working  people. And he showed that it is possible to stay true to your  progressive values and lead a life of public service.   He always said, ``We all do better when we all do better.'' I am  honored to have the Federal building in my district, the same building  where in May  [[Page H9724]]  1970, he was arrested for civil disobedience while protesting the  Vietnam war named after the late Senator from Minnesota.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring his life  and legacy by passing this bipartisan bill.
