 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of one of the great voices for American agriculture here in our  Nation's Capital, Steven L. Kopperud.   His death this past year was sudden and a shock to all of us who knew  him. Steve was always the same, from the first day I met him almost 25  years ago until the last time we talked. He was a great friend, one  whom you could trust to shoot you straight. As are so many in the  agriculture arena, he was a down-to-earth, great guy; the type you  could pick up a conversation with as though you had just talked  yesterday when, in fact, it could have been a year or more; the type  who would always be there for you. And if it was a policy question, he  always, always, had the facts. He believed in his work, and he was  passionate about it.  [[Page H1894]]    After growing up in Minneapolis and attending the University of  Minnesota, Steve started his career in journalism, writing for the  Minneapolis Star Tribune and the San Diego Union-Tribune. He eventually  became the Washington bureau chief for Feedstuffs, which further  introduced him to the world of agriculture.    From there, he launched a long, distinguished career in advocacy,  lobbying on all things animal, everything from food, livestock,  poultry, trade, and animal welfare, to biotech, among countless other  agricultural issues. He was a founder of the Animal Alliance  Association, and eventually started his own firm to represent clients  across the Nation's agriculture sector.   Steve played an instrumental role in the passage of every farm bill  in the past 35 years, from his first in 1985 to his last in 2018. He  could always be found in the Halls of Congress, the White House, or  USDA, making the case for commonsense agriculture policies critical to  our producers and American consumers. And by the fortuitous nature of  events early on in his career, he became a key voice with great  expertise in the animal welfare policy arena.   Steve leaves behind his wife, Judith, of more than 45 years, and  many, many friends. The contributions he made to agriculture were  numerous, leaving a great legacy of advocacy that has benefited  American producers and has helped to feed the world. His was a life  very well-lived, and American agriculture is that much better because  of Steve Kopperud, and so is our country.                          Tribute to Carolyn Justice     Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay particular tribute to  an individual who has been an institution in the Cape Fear region for  decades, my friend and former colleague in the State legislature,  Carolyn Justice.   Carolyn served five terms in the North Carolina House of  Representatives, representing New Hanover and Pender Counties. Before  her service in the State legislature, she served on Pender County's  Board of Commissioners. She has also served as a trustee of New Hanover  Regional Medical Center, Pender Memorial Hospital, and as chair of the  Lower Cape Fear River Program.   Now, I got to know Carolyn while serving in the State Senate. She was  a co-chair of the State House Appropriations Subcommittee on  Agriculture and Natural and Economic Resources, while I was co-chair of  the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee. So we got to know each other  quite well as we went line by line of the State budget, making cuts to  the programs under our purview.   The economic collapse of 2008 and 2009 had left the State budget in  shambles, and it was our job to help balance it. These were not easy  decisions, but, with Carolyn as a key partner, we made the budget  numbers work while doing our best to fund the programs of most value to  the citizens of the State.   Through her service and kindness to others, Carolyn Justice continues  to leave an indelible mark on southeastern North Carolina. This is why  it is so fitting that she was recently named by the Wilmington Star- News in March, which was Women's History Month 2021, as one of 106  women who have made the Port City area a better place.   I don't know of anyone who stands stronger for the Cape Fear region  and the causes in which she believes. This is a well-deserved honor for  a very distinguished public servant and my great friend and colleague.                            ____________________
