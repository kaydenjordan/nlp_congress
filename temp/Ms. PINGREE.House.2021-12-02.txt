 Madam Speaker, I rise to support the continuing  resolution, which extends government funding at current levels until we  pass a full appropriations package for the next fiscal year.   It is my strong hope that this short-term extension will be the last  one and that my colleagues across the aisle will acknowledge our solemn  duty to exercise the power of the purse.   A continuing resolution that lasts a full year does not serve the  American people. As the chair of the Subcommittee on Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies, I can attest that the investments in  the House interior bill would benefit all of our constituents, for  those of us on both sides of the aisle.   The bill makes long-overdue investments to protect human health, to  fight the climate emergency, and to meet our trust obligations to  Tribal nations. It provides critical resources to rebuild the Federal  workforce so that these agencies can meet their missions and better  serve the public.   Failing to complete a full-year bill means no additional investments  in the EPA to research and develop standards for harmful pollutants  like PFAS, no further investments in domestic renewable energy, and  insufficient resources for the healthcare of nearly 2.2 million  American Indians and Alaska Natives.   Regardless of whether we pass a full-year bill, we can be certain  that millions of Americans will be exposed to pollution, that  healthcare costs will rise, and that our window for mitigating climate  change will shrink.   To ignore these threats is not in the Nation's best interest, nor any  of ours. We were sent to Congress to improve the lives and livelihoods  of our constituents.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, but I  encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to finish the  bill.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from The Ad Hoc Group  for Medical Research.                                                   The Ad Hoc Group                                            for Medical Research,                                                  November 15, 2021.      Hon. Rosa DeLauro,      Chair, Committee on Appropriations,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kay Granger,      Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick Leahy,      Chair, Committee on Appropriations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Shelby,      Vice Chair, Committee on Appropriations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman DeLauro, Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member       Granger, and Vice Chairman Shelby: Thank you for your past       leadership in championing sustained, real growth in medical       research funding. As Congress begins to draft a final fiscal       year (FY) 2022 spending package, the 314 undersigned members       of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research urge you to invest       robustly in agencies and programs to improve the nation's       health and well-being, including base funding for the       National Institutes of Health (NIH), as a key national       priority and to finalize the appropriations process as       expeditiously as possible. The Ad Hoc Group for Medical       Research is a coalition of patient and voluntary health       groups, medical and scientific societies, academic and       research organizations, and industry, dedicated to enhancing       the federal investment in biomedical, behavioral, social, and       population-based research supported by the NIH.        We greatly appreciate that both the House-passed (H.R.       4502) and Senate draft Labor-HHS-Education spending bills       include strong increases for the NIH base in FY 2022, which       would provide greater hope and opportunity for every patient       awaiting a cure, every researcher working toward the next       breakthrough, and every aspiring scientist considering a       career in the lab. To maximize the potential of medical       research to make rapid progress toward these goals, we urge       you to provide at least $46.4 billion for NIH's base, as       included in the House-passed bill. Continuing the momentum of       the prior six years of bipartisan support for meaningful       funding growth in the NIH's existing institutes and centers       is key to ensuring that the nation can continue to accelerate       the development of life-changing cures, pioneering treatments       and diagnostics, and innovative preventive strategies.        Additionally, we appreciate that both bills ensure that the       new investment for the proposed Advanced Research Projects       Agency for Health (ARPA-H) supplements, rather than       supplants, the NIH's base. While complementary, NIH and ARPA-      H have distinct and important missions. As such, investment       in ARPA-H must not come at the expense of the NIH base.       Instead, to fully realize the benefits of the envisioned new       entity while simultaneously allowing NIH to keep pace with       discovery, an FY 2022 appropriation of at least $46.4 billion       for NIH's base budget is needed. Prioritizing strong       investments for foundational research discoveries funded by       the NIH will be critical to the success of the visionary new       research initiative, particularly as it builds its       operational capacity in its inaugural year and beyond.       Likewise, avoiding further delays in finalizing funding       determinations will enable both ARPA-Hand NIH's planned and       existing programs to be maximally efficient and strategic in       their work in FY 2022.        To that end, our organizations strongly support an approach       to the final FY 2022 spending package that avoids additional       CRs past December. Aside from the budget implications, CRs       create inefficiencies and add uncertainty to a system that is       already  [[Page H6881]]       under stress with the continued reverberations of the ongoing       COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly urge you to work swiftly in       securing bipartisan, bicameral agreement on topline       discretionary spending allocations and to ensure any final       budget agreement reflects a strong commitment to the nation's       health.        Once again, we commend you for continuing to recognize the       incomparable value of the federal investment in the NIH, and       we look forward to working with you to secure $46.4 billion       for the agency's base in FY 2022, in addition to funding you       provide for ARPA-H.
