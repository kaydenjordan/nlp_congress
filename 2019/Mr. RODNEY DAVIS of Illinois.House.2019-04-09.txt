 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize one of  the most well-known landmarks along Route 66 in Illinois, the Ariston  Cafe, on its 95th year of operation.   After opening in 1924 along Route 4 in Carlinville, the Ariston  actually predates Route 66. In 1935, it moved to its current location  along the Mother Road in Litchfield, Illinois.   The Ariston Cafe is a member of the Route 66 Association Hall of Fame  and Museum and is in the National Register of Historic Places in  Illinois and the National Park Service.   The Ariston is one of the oldest restaurants along Route 66 and is  the fifth-longest running restaurant in the entire State of Illinois.   Later this spring, the Ariston will be holding a relighting ceremony  to celebrate the replacement of its classic neon sign, thanks to a  grant from the National Park Service.   The Ariston Cafe is a treasure within central Illinois and along  Route 66, and I look forward to many more years of success for this  great restaurant.                            ____________________
