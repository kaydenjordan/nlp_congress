 Mr. President, in February, the HELP Committee passed a  bill to reauthorize the animal drug and animal generic drug user fee  programs at FDA. That bill was the result of months of bipartisan work.  During markup, we worked together to put aside differences and adopted  an amendment from Senator Murphy increasing innovation in animal drug  trial designs to advance more medicines for our pets and livestock-- similar to the work we did for humans in the 21st Century Cures Act-- and an amendment from Senator Paul to clarify the regulatory process  for animal feed additives.   We worked together because this bill has to pass by August 1 to avoid  disruption to the hard-working employees at FDA who ensure our pets and  food-producing animals have safe and effective drugs.   Last month, the House Energy and Commerce Committee took our  bipartisan bill that we worked on together and added a controversial  amendment that expands the conditional approval pathway for animal  drugs. Currently, the FDA can conditionally approve an animal drug for  a minor species or for an uncommon disease in a major species. This  narrow category of drugs can be approved, for a limited time, and sold  to customers while the company collects data to determine whether the  drug actually works. This pathway was supposed to spur innovation, but  only four drugs have ever been conditionally approved in the pathway's  14-year history, and only one of those four was actually effective and  gained full approval.   That is not a very good track record. Nonetheless, the House bill  expands that pathway to any difficult-to-develop animal drug that can  address an unmet need and doesn't even define what qualifies as  difficult.   I have been very concerned that the undefined scope of this pathway  sets a terrible precedent and, more importantly, doesn't uphold the  gold standard of FDA approval that our public relies on. However, today  Dr. Gottlieb has made public assurances to both me and our chairman  that he intends to implement this provision with additional caution and  restrictions, according to congressional intent.   FDA has committed to promulgating regulations to define what it means  for a study to be ``difficult.'' Importantly, FDA has publicly agreed  that conditional approval is not an appropriate pathway for any human  medical products or antibiotics.   Antibiotic resistance is a large and growing global public health  problem, and the rampant overuse of medically important antibiotics in  our food supply compounds that problem. I am very pleased this bill  requires FDA to report on its work to bring all medically important  antibiotics under veterinary supervision, but there is more to do.   I thank Senators Warren, Feinstein, Gillibrand, and Blumenthal for  their leadership on reducing the nonjudicious use of antibiotics in  animals. On Friday, Senator Warren sent a letter to FDA asking for  additional actions and commitments to bring all medically important  antibiotics under veterinary supervision and reevaluate duration limits  for antibiotic abuse.   I thank Mr. Gottlieb for his quick response to Senator Warren and his  clear commitment to work with us on these issues, including greater  transparency into the progress of removing unlimited durations of  antibiotic use. I sincerely hope we can avoid these situations in the  future, where deals struck between FDA and the industry, with little  transparency, are then somehow demanded of Congress.   Senator Alexander and I included language in this year's agricultural  appropriations bill that makes clear Congress does not find this  appropriate, and I hope the FDA and its regulated industries take that  language seriously in future user fee negotiations.   I support moving this bill forward today, but I do plan to conduct  careful oversight into the implementation of this law and hold FDA  accountable for any deviations from the commitments made to me today.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter addressed to  Senator Alexander and myself from Scott Gottlieb and Steve Solomon be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                U.S. Food & Drug Administration,                                                      July 31, 2018.      Hon. Lamar Alexander, Chairman,      Hon. Patty Murray, Ranking Member,      Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, U.S.           Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray: We are writing       to share with you the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or       the Agency) current views on how it would implement the       proposed expanded conditional approval pathway in H.R. 5554,       the ``Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments       of 2018.'' The Agency's staff were directed to review the       possibility of expanding the conditional approval pathway by       the previous reauthorization of the Animal Drug User Fee Act       (ADUFA) and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA)       programs in 2013, and we are prepared to implement the       expansion of the pathway as outlined in H.R. 5554, if       enacted, with appropriate regulatory caution and       restrictions.        FDA currently has conditional approval authority for animal       drugs intended to treat a minor species or for diseases or       conditions in major species that would constitute a minor       use, which was granted by the addition of section 571 to the       Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) in 2004 by       the Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act (MUMS Act).       To receive conditional approval, an animal drug sponsor must       meet the same safety and manufacturing standards as a new       animal drug for which full approval is sought under section       512. The main advantage of the conditional approval pathway       for sponsors is that they can make their drug available after       demonstrating a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. The       pathway requires an annual review of the conditional approval       to determine if the sponsor is making sufficient progress       toward meeting the effectiveness standard for full approval.        FDA believes conditional approval offers a unique pathway       to address specific challenges of certain aspects of       veterinary medicine that human medicine does not face.       Therefore, FDA does not believe this pathway would be       suitable for human medical products. For example, variability       in response to therapies among animals means that one product       is not likely to meet the needs of all animals. Even within a       single species (e.g., canine), it is well-documented that       there can be significant variability among animal breeds in       how drugs are metabolized (e.g., ivermectin is toxic for       collies, but safe for other breeds). Despite the need,       incentivizing new product development continues to be a       challenge for the industry given the limited market for       veterinary drugs. Based on experience, we believe this       pathway would be used uncommonly, as a sponsor must make a       substantial investment of time and resources to obtain the       conditional approval. In addition, the sponsor  [[Page S5473]]       must be confident that they will ultimately be successful in       meeting the substantial evidence of effectiveness standard       required for full approval under section 512(b). FDA's review       of its active pending animal drug products in various phases       of development indicates that 16 products might qualify for       the new pathway. FDA's best current estimate is that 12 to 20       animal drugs might seek conditional approval during the 10-      year authorization period provided in H.R. 5554.        FDA has acted to withdraw conditional approval when       sufficient progress towards meeting the effectiveness       standard for full approval has not been met. For example, FDA       withdrew the conditional approval of the drug Paccal Vet-CAI       in 2017, after it was conditionally approved in 2014, for       this reason. Since the MUMS Act was enacted in 2004, only       four drugs have received conditional approval, and FDA has       only granted a full new animal drug approval to one of these       drugs. We want to assure you that FDA will make certain there       are appropriately defined parameters for this expansion of       the conditional approval pathway, which will be developed       through a public process.        The proposed expansion of the pathway in H.R. 5554 would       allow certain animal drugs that are not intended to treat       minor species or minor uses in major species to qualify for       conditional approval, but only if they meet two key       requirements. The first proposed requirement is that the drug       must be ``intended to treat a serious or life-threatening       disease or condition or addresses an unmet animal or human       health need.'' FDA considers serious or life-threatening       diseases or conditions to be those that, if untreated, are       likely to lead to an animal's death, such as congestive heart       disease and lymphoma. FDA intends to define ``unmet need''       similarly to how the term is defined in FDA's Expedited       Programs guidance for human medical products. FDA intends to       provide more details to clearly define this first requirement       in the guidance or regulation it would be required to issue.        The second key requirement for eligibility would be that       ``a demonstration of effectiveness would require a complex or       particularly difficult study or studies.'' FDA believes use       of the conditional approval pathway should and will be       limited to situations in which effectiveness is in fact       particularly difficult or complex to demonstrate, and would       only be granted after demonstrating a reasonable expectation       of effectiveness. FDA intends to consider whether the       clinical end-points of the disease or condition are       particularly difficult to evaluate. FDA also intends to       consider factors such as the need of a sponsor to use complex       adaptive or other novel investigation designs, real world       evidence, and the difficulty of enrolling trials. To clarify       the limited scope of new animal drug applications for which       this pathway would be available, FDA intends to issue       regulation to describe the elements it would consider in       determining whether an effectiveness study would be difficult       or complex to complete.        The proposed conditional approval expansion requires FDA to       issue guidance or regulation by September 30, 2019, to       clarify these criteria; FDA expects to finalize these       documents before accepting applications for the expanded       conditional approval pathway. We can assure you that FDA       believes this expanded pathway should be used only in very       limited cases, since its goal is to bring new veterinary       therapies to market for which there have not been sufficient       incentives to do so through the traditional new animal drug       approval pathway. FDA does not believe the age conditional       approval pathway should be available to new animal drugs that       easily could use the traditional new animal drug approval       pathway. If H.R. 5554 is enacted, we will keep your staff       closely updated on our efforts to clarify in guidance and       regulation the statutory restrictions on use of the expanded       conditional approval pathway.        H.R. 5554 also contains language that will provide Congress       the opportunity to reconsider conditional approval. The       proposed pathway will sunset after 10 years, to coincide with       the reauthorization of the user fee programs in 2028. In       addition, the language requires a Government Accountability       Office study to be completed prior to this date so that       Congress, the Agency, and stakeholders can evaluate the       expanded conditional approval pathway prior to its sunset.       The sunset provision would create an incentive for the Agency       and stakeholders to demonstrate that this pathway's       implementation is appropriately implemented and judiciously       utilized. Finally, H.R. 5554 further restricts this pathway       by prohibiting any drug that contains an active antimicrobial       ingredient from utilizing the expanded pathway.        In closing, we want to remind you that if H.R. 5554 is not       reauthorized before August 1, 2018, we must initiate the       process of adjusting animal drug review activities and the       personnel engaged in those activities, including identifying       and notifying 115 full time equivalent federal employee       positions of a reduction in force no later than 60 days prior       to their expected release. This could not only result in 115       full time employees being terminated, but would disrupt work       and morale--not only for hundreds of other employees at the       Agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine, but for their       colleagues in other Agency centers as well.        We hope that we have been able to alleviate any concerns       you have with the temporary, limited expansion of the       Agency's existing conditional approval pathway for animal       drugs in H.R. 5554, and that you will support timely passage       of this bill to avoid any reductions in force and disruptions       at the Agency. Again, you have our personal commitment to       keep your staff informed as we implement this provision, if       it is enacted.            Sincerely,      Scott Gottlieb, M.D.,        Commissioner of Food and Drugs.      Steve Solomon, D.V.M, M.P.H,        Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine.     Mr. President, although President Trump has spent the  majority of his Presidency undermining workers and their economic  security, today President Trump is taking a small step in the right  direction by signing the Strengthening Career and Technical Education  for the 21st Century Act into law.   This doesn't undo President Trump's actions to roll back health and  safety protections for workers or his efforts to make it easier for  corporations to take advantage of their workers or his continued  attempts to gut workforce training programs, including WIOA and our  registered apprenticeships, but this bill makes clear that, when  Republicans and Democrats work together and put the needs of students,  workers, businesses, and educators at the forefront, even President  Trump would not stand in the way.   Now, I want to talk about what went into passing this law, what is  included in it, and why that is so important. As we were working to  reauthorize the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, we heard  from employers, workers, students, educators, advocates, and our own  colleagues on the need to update this law.   While I agreed reauthorizing Perkins was critical to giving workers  and students the tools and skills they need to get better jobs and  higher wages, we could not pass a law for the sake of passing a law; we  needed to ensure this law improved the current Perkins program and was  able to adapt to a changing 21st century economy.   That meant putting aside partisanship and working together, across  party lines, with the goal of improving career and technical education  programs for the communities we represent.   I am pleased we were able to move away from attempts to voucherize  this program, an idea that was widely rejected by the CTE community  because it would mean programs teaching career and technical education  would receive less funding, and though the theory of privatization has  been championed by some in this administration, including Secretary  DeVos, it has never worked in practice.   We also rejected attempts to change Perkins funding to competitive  grants, which would make it significantly harder for communities to  apply for and receive funding.   Instead we worked together and focused on what businesses, educators,  and students were asking for.  [[Page S5508]]    The details here are so important, and I want to make it very clear  where we landed in this agreement.   To better improve career and technical education for students,  workers, local businesses, and communities, this bill will require  States, schools, and training programs to update education and job  training programs to meet the needs of the local economy, ensuring  students are being provided with the skills they need to find high- skill, high-wage, or in-demand jobs where they live.   Because the economy is constantly changing, and new equipment,  technology, and curriculum are needed to help students and workers keep  up with technological advancements, this bill would authorize a new  innovation grant program to allow States to explore new and creative  ways to improve career and technical education that use evidence-based  measurements to ensure students are still receiving high quality  education and training.   Updating career and technical education programs and promoting  innovation is important, but we cannot lose sight of our top priority:  improving the quality of the career and technical education students  are receiving.   For that reason, this bill appropriately balances State and local  flexibility with protections and guardrails to ensure our students are  receiving the best possible education and training.   I want to dig a little deeper into these protections today because it  is so important we get this right.   First, on the role of the Secretary of Education, I want to be very  clear: This bill does not prohibit the Secretary's authority to oversee  this law in any new way.   The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century  Act gives States the ability to determine what education and training  is most needed in their communities and what accountability levels  those programs have to meet.   At the same time, it ensures the Secretary has the ability and the  authority to implement and enforce the law as we intended.   This bill allows the Secretary to issue rules to implement the law,  including notifying Congress before a rule is issued and allowing  Congress to provide input on those proposed rules.   Second, this bill includes a number of measures to support States and  ensure their top priority is student success.   Because regions of the country have different needs and economies,  this bill will allow States to set their own levels of performance, but  each State must meet minimum requirements when they set those levels of  performance, including ensuring our most vulnerable students are making  meaningful progress and performance gaps in the States are closing.   Under current law, we have data on performance gaps and disparities,  but no one is required to do anything about those gaps. So for the  first time, in this law, States and local recipients will not only have  to report data on performance gaps and disparities, they will have to  describe how they will address those disparities and gaps.   We also improved the quality of data in this bill. Right now, there  are not many common definitions in the Perkins law, so it is hard for  local businesses and communities to know which career and technical  education programs are high quality and which programs need more  resources to improve. This law establishes more common definitions so  that the data collected going forward will be more meaningful and  comparable among localities and States and will provide more actionable  data to help local communities improve these programs.   As I mentioned before, this bill gives States and local CTE providers  flexibility to design their own improvement programs for States or  locals failing to meet 90 percent of the goals they set for themselves,  but it also includes basic requirements to ensure low-performing  programs improve in the specific areas they are underperforming,  something all parents, educators, and community members want for the  programs that serve their children--because, if programs don't have to  improve and help the students and workers who need it most, there is no  way our communities will be ready for the economic challenges the 21st  century holds for us all.   Our bottom line should always be that we support students to succeed.  If we aren't, then we have a responsibility to do better. This new law  maintains the authority of the Secretary to hold States' feet to the  fire to do just that.   Finally, I want to thank my negotiating partners in this legislation,  Chairman Alexander, Senator Casey, and Senator Enzi, for working with  me on a bipartisan bill that makes important, needed updates to career  and technical education, while maintaining guardrails to ensure States  and programs receiving Federal money are focused on providing students  and workers with the skills they needy and providing businesses with  workers they need to compete in the 21st century economy.   I also want to take a moment to recognize the hard work and long  hours our staff put in to make this a bill we were all proud to  support.   I want to thank David Cleary, Bob Moran, Jake Baker, and Richard  Petty from Senator Alexander's office, Garnett Decosimo from Senator  Enzi's office, and Julia Sferlazzo from Senator Casey's office.   I want to thank members of my own staff, including my staff director  Evan Schatz, my deputy staff director John Righter, and my education  policy director Kara Marchione.   I also want to thank Amanda Beaumont, Katherine McClelland, Katharine  Parham, Manuel Contreras, and Mairead Lynn for their hard work and  support.   This law shows that, if we keep students, workers, and businesses at  the forefront, we can work together and build an economy that works for  all.   Thank you.                            ____________________
