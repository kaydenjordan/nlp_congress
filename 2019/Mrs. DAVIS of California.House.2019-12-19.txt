 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for  yielding.   Trade negotiations are not for the faint of heart. Few votes have  generated more passion in this Chamber than votes on trade agreements.  That is why I am so glad that we finally have an agreement that Members  from both sides of the aisle can support.   It is no secret why that is. This is an agreement that sets up, for  the first time, facility-level inspections to make sure that workers'  rights are being honored, and it removes the onerous IP provisions that  have made their way into far too many trade agreements in recent years.   Finally, as a Member from the San Diego region, it is important to  have an agreement like this that both preserves and improves the  binational partnership that defines the larger community.   This agreement lays the groundwork for the Federal Government to  finally address the longstanding pollution flowing from the Tijuana  River into San Diego Bay, which impacts both the health of our  community and our military.
