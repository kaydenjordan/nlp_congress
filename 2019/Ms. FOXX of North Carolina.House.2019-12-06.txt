 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin) very much for yielding, and I very much  appreciate his work on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the Republican Foreign Affairs Committee  staff and Ranking Member McCaul for their tireless defense of Israel.   Furthermore, I want to state that I have a long history of working in  a bipartisan fashion with my dear friend, the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel. That is why it pains me to be here  today debating a partisan resolution, a resolution that purports to  defend a negotiated two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict, but that is simply not what this resolution is about. If it  were, it would be bipartisan.    This is a partisan resolution because it makes pointed criticisms of  the Israeli Government on delicate, divisive, internal issues. It does  so at a time when our Israeli counterparts struggle through the  democratic process of forming a new government.   House Democrats would only move this unconstructive resolution to the  floor if it achieved aims of radical leftists in scoring points against  the Trump administration.   But, Mr. Speaker, I ask this majority, at what cost? At what cost are  we voting on this?   Moving forward to this vote risks the bipartisan support that a  negotiated settlement leading to a sustainable two-state solution has  enjoyed for decades.   That is why I offered an alternative resolution at the Rules  Committee, one that would support the peace process without alienating  our major strategic partner and ally of the United States, the nation  of Israel.   If there is any imperative for Congress, it should be to hold the  Palestinian Authority to account for its efforts to bypass negotiations  and unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.   For decades, the Palestinian Authority has undermined the peace  process by appealing to the United Nations and other international  organizations to impose its own solution and impose parameters for  negotiations with Israel.   In 2000, Israel offered them full statehood on territory that  included roughly 92 percent of the West Bank and all of Gaza, along  with a capital in Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority rejected it.   If there is any story that deserves more attention from this  Congress, it is that Israel has made numerous concessions in the  pursuit of peace while seeking only the right to exist, and this  despite the continued efforts by Palestinian leadership to evade direct  negotiations for peace.   That is the story this House should be telling, and that is why I  oppose this partisan resolution that politicizes and, therefore,  jeopardizes the sacred issue of Congress' support for Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''                                time  0945
