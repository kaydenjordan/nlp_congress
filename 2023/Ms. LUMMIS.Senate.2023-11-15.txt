 Mr. Chairman, I call up my motion to instruct the  conferees.   The clerk will report the motion.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Ms. Lummis (for herself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Marshall, and       Ms. Warren) moves that the managers on the part of the Senate       at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses       on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 2670 be instructed       to insist that the final conference report include subtitle J       of title X of division A of Senate Bill 2226, 118th Congress,       passed July 27, 2023.    Mr. President, this motion to instruct conferees would  combat bad actors using crypto assets in financial transactions by  preserving in the NDAA my amendment introduced alongside my colleagues  from both sides of the aisle including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand,  Elizabeth Warren, and Roger Marshall.   This amendment would not only combat money laundering, it would crack  down on countries evading sanctions and funding terrorism through  crypto assets.   It does this by requiring the Treasury Department to establish  comprehensive exam standards for financial institutions engaged in  crypto asset activities and requires a study on the use of crypto asset  mixers, tumblers, and other anonymity-enhancing technologies.   Preventing illicit finance in the crypto asset industry is integral  as we work to provide comprehensive regulation to the industry--and  passing these provisions into law will protect our national security  and ensure our adversaries are not using crypto assets to finance those  who would do harm to the  [[Page S5531]]  United States. I strongly urge my colleagues in joining me in support  of my motion to instruct.    I know of no further debate on the motion.                          Vote on Motion to Instruct
