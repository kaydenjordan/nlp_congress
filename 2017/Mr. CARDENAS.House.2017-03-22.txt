 Mr. Speaker, I stand here with this simple explanation  about what TrumpCare really means for Americans: You pay more for less  care.   Twenty-four million Americans will lose the access to health care by  losing their insurance. It is an age tax on older Americans; and it  guts Medicaid that not only goes to seniors now, it goes to young  people as well, young families.   But it is also a huge tax cut for millionaires.   If you look at TrumpCare, you realize the great supposed negotiator  actually has a great reputation of being the great bankrupter.   What this TrumpCare will do: It will affect tens of millions of  Americans, and it will put them into misery, take away the dignity of  health care and put them in a place that no one should ever have to be:  lacking the dignity of being able to see a doctor. This is going to  send us back to the Dark Ages.   You probably think I am exaggerating, but when you look at these  facts, you realize that is just the truth. These are the facts.   Beware of what you are being sold. This is not going to help America.                            ____________________
