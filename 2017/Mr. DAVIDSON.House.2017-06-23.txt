 Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that,  if enacted, would provide additional data on the performance and  effectiveness of the programs created under H.R. 2842, the Accelerating  Individuals into the Workforce Act.   In particular, my amendment would require States to include in their  annual reports to the Health and Human Services Department whether  individuals who participated in this demonstration project still need  additional forms of Federal or State assistance after the fact. The  data point really shows whether they are truly independent of the  safety net.   The most meaningful solution to poverty is a job. I believe the data  point outlined in my amendment will further help Congress measure the  performance of this program in the scope that should apply to all of  our Nation's welfare programs: placing people into meaningful work and  helping them and their families achieve self-sufficiency. We need this  data to ensure the project is truly working.   When I worked in manufacturing, data was a vital component to solving  problems. It showed me what worked best, what failed, and, most  importantly, what needed to be changed and how to get to the root  cause. The same science applies to solving problems here and to this  program.   Too often we measure the success of our safety net programs based on  dollars spent rather than effectiveness. Fixing our welfare system is a  sentiment shared by both sides of the aisle. This is a bipartisan bill,  and I believe this legislation is a great step forward.   Additionally, my office has been working on another bill, the Welfare  BRAC Act, which would create a bipartisan commission to review the 90- plus means-tested programs that spent nearly $850 billion a year. I  hope one day to have a vote on that bill just as we are having one on  this today.   We need more deeds and not just words. This bill is a great step  forward to solving the problem. There is widespread agreement on both  sides of the aisle that our safety net is not accomplishing all it  needs to. If enacted, my amendment would help us here in Congress  identify new methods to help our Nation's most vulnerable by getting  them into the workplace.                                time  1000    It is crucial that everyone has an equal opportunity to engage in our  communities and contribute by earning financial independence through  the dignity of work.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of my amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this.   Sunlight brings truth. Truth will set you free. My hope is truth will  set folks free from the trap that many people find in multigenerational  poverty. We really, truly want to help solve the problem and get the  information that will help us make our systems work effectively.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
