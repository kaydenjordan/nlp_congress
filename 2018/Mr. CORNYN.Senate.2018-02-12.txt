 Madam President, I want to begin my remarks today by  discussing a piece of bipartisan legislation that I have sponsored with  our colleague, the senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein. In  all likelihood, this bill is not something you are going to see  reported on in the evening news. It is rather obscure in its origins,  but it is extraordinarily important, and I will explain that in just a  moment. It is called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization  Act, and it concerns another acronym--the Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS. It is the Committee on  Foreign Investment in the United States.   CFIUS is a multiagency panel headed by the Treasury Department, and  Secretary Mnuchin chairs that panel. Its job is to vet foreign  investments to determine if they pose a threat to our national  security. I am an ardent supporter of free trade, and I strongly  support more foreign, direct investment in the United States.  Unfortunately, some of our adversaries--most notably China--have  altered the strategic landscape and are not playing by the same set of  rules. China has weaponized investment in an attempt to vacuum up our  advanced technologies and simultaneously undermine our defense  industrial base.   As it acquires U.S. firms, technology, and intellectual property, as  well as the know-how to put them to use, the risk is that the Chinese  Government, which has its tentacles not only in state-owned Chinese  companies but also in so-called ``private'' Chinese firms, will get its  hands on these capabilities and use them against us. This has already  been shown to have happened in a number of documented cases.   Standing by and allowing our national security to be compromised  through these continued transfers of certain dual-use technology and  know-how to China would be highly irresponsible. That is why the  CFIUS--the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States-- process needs to be updated and modernized. At its core, the bill I  have introduced would expand the scope of reviewable transactions to  more effectively address national security concerns.   CFIUS's jurisdiction has not been updated in more than 40 years, and  since that time, global threats like the one posed by China have grown  in complexity and scope. China has studied our laws, and it has found  ways to game the export control system and to evade CFIUS review.   This bill has strong support, not just from the White House but also  from Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Ross, and the  Attorney General of the United States, Jeff Sessions. It has also been  endorsed by Secretary of Defense Mattis, as well as three of his  predecessors, two former Directors of National Intelligence, and many  others.   In industry, major U.S. companies are starting to recognize the risks  here, as well, and several have stepped up and endorsed this bill.  However, there is a very small group of other U.S. firms that are  actively opposing CFIUS modernization, having decided their bottom line  is more important than our Nation's security. Unfortunately, they are  starting to release some of their false claims about this legislation  into the press that really don't hold water on further examination. And  their own track records, when it comes to handing over sophisticated,  dual-use technology and know-how to China, undercut the credibility of  their arguments. I would call this a patriotism deficit on their part.   In order to perpetuate the status quo and prevent statutory updates  that are both urgent and necessary, this handful of firms and their  proxies like to point to exaggerated, doomsday scenarios. These are  typified by the words of one detractor, who recently stated that the  new legislation would ``literally paralyze business.''   I urge all of our colleagues to study this legislation more and to  resist these kinds of scare tactics and mischaracterizations. I urge  them to consider the paralysis we would incur by not passing CFIUS  reform. Progress would be stunted and our security jeopardized. We  could see the erosion of our defense industrial base and that means  jobs here in the United States going overseas because they are capable  then of building this cutting-edge, dual-use technology in their home  country and not having it built here in the United States.   Despite the critics' scare tactics, the bill would not sweep up  harmless business transactions with no ties to national security. That  is not the point. But I do want to make that abundantly clear. Under  the bill, there are reasonable safeguards to prevent this from  happening.   For example, CFIUS would be authorized to create a safe list of  certain allied countries for which certain transactions are exempt from  review. Under the bill, CFIUS would also be granted authority to exempt  ordinary, routine transactions where other laws already address  national security risks.   The Treasury Department, as the lead agency for CFIUS, has stated an  [[Page S860]]  intent to use this authority to narrowly tailor the implementing  regulations.   The second thing to note is that existing alternatives, like  multilateral export controls, are not an adequate substitute to what we  are proposing in this bill. It is true that export controls work well  in many cases, but they have inherent limitations and are not enough by  themselves. We simply need a second line of defense, and that is a  modernized CFIUS process. The CFIUS process and the export control  system are designed to be interactive and complementary.   In other words, this bill does not duplicate the export control  system, and, in fact, for pure technology transfers, the export control  system would remain the sole review mechanism. CFIUS wouldn't be  involved in that at all.   Finally, there is a concern that our bill could flood CFIUS with too  much work, and they would be overwhelmed and would lack the resources  and expertise to do the job. But our bill would help provide those  additional resources and allow CFIUS to both charge a modest fee to  help promote its self-sustainability and also submit a unified annual  budget request covering all of its member agencies.   Furthermore, the bill's own provisions guard against an unfunded  mandate, with any expansion taking effect only after CFIUS determines  on its own that the necessary personnel and other resources have been  provided.   Finally our bill exempts certain transactions that are done through  ``ordinary customer relationships,'' ensuring that harmless, day-to-day  activities don't have to be reviewed.   In closing, I will say this: It is certainly appropriate to consider  the potential impacts of this bill on foreign investment, but those  effects shouldn't be considered in a vacuum. We must also ask what the  impacts on our long-term national security will be if we do not take  action. For example, in 10 or 15 years, will our troops still have the  best equipment in the world? Our military superiority is not a  birthright, and neither is our technological advantage over our  adversaries.    I would urge my colleagues to advance this bill and to study it and  to help work with us to improve it. The time to modernize CFIUS is now.  We must not allow ourselves to be the frog in the boiling pot of water,  so to speak. We can't be blind to the growing risks.   Madam President, on another matter, today we will begin to deliver on  an important promise to the American people--debating an immigration  solution for the young adults brought to the United States by their  parents who now find themselves in limbo.   Several weeks ago, our Democratic colleagues recklessly shut down the  Federal Government to placate the extreme elements in their own party.  The majority leader disagreed with this approach. He and the rest of my  Republican colleagues urged them to abandon this shutdown ploy before  it was too late, but they refused to listen, ignoring the majority of  the Americans who were against this approach. The majority leader then  promised what had been the plan all along--that would be to continue  bipartisan discussions that would be followed by open debate on the  floor.   Shortly, this evening, we will take up a vote on a vehicle through  which Members can offer their ideas on how best to solve this problem.  It will be a process that is fair to both sides. Once we vote to adopt  a motion to proceed, my colleagues and I will have the opportunity to  have our proposals considered under regular order. In other words, they  can offer amendments, debate on the amendments, and vote on the  amendments. Amendments, as usual, will have a 60-vote threshold before  they can be adopted. Sixty votes is what we need.   What I am interested in is solving the problem, and that means not  only a proposal that can get 60 votes but one that can pass the House  and be signed into law by President Trump. That is simply critical.  This should not be an exercise in futility or for political  grandstanding purposes; this should be about getting a bill signed into  law, which means it has to pass both Houses and has to be signed by the  President.   Today, led by Chairman Grassley of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a  group of Members from this side of the aisle will put forth a  comprehensive proposal--including the Presiding Officer--that centers  around the four pillars the President has said he would like to see  addressed.   I think most people have been surprised--maybe ``shocked'' is a  better word--at the generosity of the President's offer for the DACA- eligible recipients. Right now, there are 690,000 who have signed up,  but the President's proposal would not only offer them legal status, it  would offer 1.8 million eligible young people a pathway to  citizenship--far more than President Obama ever offered.   It provides a real opportunity for us to keep our commitments when it  comes to border security--utilizing more boots on the ground, better  technology, and additional infrastructure. It reallocates visas from  the diversity lottery system in a way that is fair. It continues the  existing family-based immigration categories until the current backlog  is cleared and then changes to more of a merit-based system.   I am proud to cosponsor this commonsense solution, which I think can  pass the Senate and the House and be signed into law by President  Trump. I know, too, that others have been working hard on their ideas,  and I look forward to reviewing their work product.   I urge my Democratic colleagues this week to remember their  predecessors when it comes to immigration, which includes my fellow  Texan Barbara Jordan. One of the great civil rights leaders of our  time, she was the first southern Black woman to be elected to the U.S.  House of Representatives. She also served as a chairwoman of the U.S.  Commission on Immigration Reform. While serving in that role, she once  said:         For our immigration policy to make sense, it is necessary       to make distinctions between those who obey the law, and       those who violate it.    I think that is a great principle to keep in mind as we begin to sort  out this week's challenges.   Although we all recognize the anxiety of DACA recipients who came to  this country through no fault of their own and now face uncertain  futures, at the same time, we must recognize that many Americans face  certain plights too. They are dreamers, too, as the President has said.  And we need to restore our legacy as a nation that believes in and  applies the rule of law--indeed, equal justice under the law.   Here is the bottom line: I am not interested in a futile exercise of  gamesmanship or political theater or ideas that can't become law. As  the President said 2 weeks ago, the ultimate proposal must be ``one  where nobody gets everything they want, but our country gets the  critical reforms it needs.'' More than 124,000 young people in my State  hope we can rise to the occasion. Indeed, all 28 million of them hope  we can work together in a bipartisan fashion not only to provide relief  to the DACA recipients but also to restore our border security and to  craft immigration laws that serve America's best interests.   Again, one of the two pillars upon which our immigration system has  been built is that we are a nation of immigrants. All of us at some  point in our family came from somewhere else--almost all of us. But we  are also a nation of laws, which distinguishes us from most of the rest  of the world. It is those two great pillars--a nation of immigrants and  a nation of laws--that need to be restored and need to be our focus.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
