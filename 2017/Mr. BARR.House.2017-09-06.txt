 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division H (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement, administer, or enforce--        (1) the final rule entitled ``On-Site Completion of       Construction of Manufactured Homes'', published by the       Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Federal       Register on September 8, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 53712 et seq.);        (2) the ``Interpretative Bulletin for Model Manufactured       Home Installation Standards Foundation requirements in       Freezing Temperature Areas Under CFR 3285.312(b)'', published       for comment in the Federal Register on June 21, 2017 (82 Fed.       Reg. 28279 et seq.); and        (3) the memorandum titled ``Construction of On-Site       Installation of Add-Ons, such as an Attached Garage''       published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development       on June 12, 2014.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Chairman, as many of you know, manufactured homes are  the only form of nonsubsidized housing that is directly regulated by  HUD. Statute dictates that HUD is required to facilitate the  availability of affordable manufactured homes to increase homeownership  for all Americans.   Recently, the Department has imposed excessive and contradictory  regulations on manufactured housing. HUD is impeding on some State  functions, reinterpreting regulations to the detriment of longstanding  and accepted building practices, and implementing rules that  unnecessarily limit consumer choice and increase costs.   As the primary regulator of manufactured housing, HUD should work  with the industry, not against it, to ensure regulations are  streamlined, cost-effective, and applied fairly and transparently,  while also working to keep manufactured housing as an affordable  housing alternative for all American families.   In central and eastern Kentucky and many other parts of rural  America, manufactured housing offers a very affordable option and a  good option for housing for many folks. For the life of me, I do not  understand why the Federal agency charged with the responsibility of  providing affordable housing would be limiting choices and access to  this very affordable and very good option for housing for many rural  Americans.   My limitation amendment would fix three problems where HUD's  regulation of manufactured housing exceeds and, at times, even  contradicts statutes. These three problems are intrusive installation  programs, burdensome and unnecessary onsite completion of construction  rules, and shifting guidelines on alternative construction.   Mr. Chairman, what I am offering here tonight is an important  limitation amendment. Addressing these issues will help mitigate the  ongoing negative impact that these regulations are having on access to  affordable housing across America.   I urge my colleagues to support this important work where Congress  can work together to eliminate impediments to the manufactured housing  market so that all Americans can have access to affordable housing.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment. Our colleague does make solid points about the  importance of manufactured housing, about the serviceability of it,  about the access of it, about the affordability. There are many, many  aspects about manufactured housing that lend themselves to our  constituents at various income levels.   He asks why we would possibly want any kind of consumer protections  enacted at the Federal level in this business, though. I think the  answer to that is pretty obvious: It is about safety and security. It  is about protecting consumers who put good money down for these houses.   That is not to say every rule, every protection is well-conceived.  Possibly some need to be scrutinized and some need to be revised. But  are we going to do it tonight on the floor of the House in an  appropriations bill? I would hope not. That is not a good way to  proceed.   We, for one thing, have colleagues on the authorizing committee who  have not had hearings, as far as I know, on these issues. We have not  had people who live with these regulations in to talk about them or  groups that look out for the consumers come in.   We have very limited debate here tonight, with 5 minutes on each  side. On that basis, we are going to wipe away carefully conceived  consumer protections in the area of manufactured housing?                                time  2145    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues not to go down this path. That is  not to say we shouldn't consider these things.   Congress, including the authorizing committees, and HUD should fully  examine the impact of these individual regulations before we jump the  gun and make sweeping changes to existing policy. I urge defeat of the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's arguments in  opposition. However, I would argue that the best consumer protection is  competition and choice, and what these misguided regulations do is take  away access, take away competition, take away choices for consumers.  That is not consumer protection. It is certainly not consumer  protection to say to rural Americans looking for access to affordable  housing: You can't have access to a manufactured home.   That is not consumer protection. That is hurting consumers.   And what I would say also is that this is a bipartisan amendment.  There are Members of the party on the other side of the aisle who  recognize that in rural America and other places, we need a bipartisan  fix to bureaucratic overreach, and these are new requirements that are  not thoughtfully conceived, as the gentleman would argue.   In fact, these are new requirements imposed without warning, without  any evidence of consumer harm, without any thoughtful process at the  agency.   So, again, I would urge my colleagues to join us in a bipartisan  amendment to fix a bureaucratic overreach, which denies low-income  Americans with access to affordable housing.   Why in the world would we tolerate the agency that is supposed to be  the  [[Page H7061]]  advocates of poor and low-income Americans denying them access to  affordable housing?   Support this bipartisan amendment, support low-income Americans,  support rural Americans, and support manufactured housing.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, it is news to most of us,  I expect, that consumer protections is incompatible with consumer  choice. We offer protections of all sorts. In the case of housing, it  is against predatory practices. As the houses are sold, it is against  shoddy construction, it is against a race to the bottom in terms of  quality that individual buyers may not be able to perceive.   That compatibility of basic consumer protections and consumer choice  is presented every day in our marketplace, and I certainly don't see  why it should be absent here, although, as I said earlier, some of  these rules may be up for scrutiny. It is just not that we are prepared  to do it here tonight.   I would also point out that the only type of housing that moves  across State lines is manufactured housing, so that probably provides  an additional argument as to why we should be particularly diligent in  dismantling Federal protections. I urge rejection of the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).   The amendment was agreed to.              Amendment No. 56 Offered by Mr. Smith of Missouri    The Acting CHAIR.
