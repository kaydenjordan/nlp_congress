 Mr. Speaker, with so much uncertainty in our future,  families shouldn't have the additional burden of worrying about the  state of their healthcare. Unfortunately, though, COVID-19 has only  further exposed the cracks in our healthcare system and forced us all  to face the urgency with which we must work to address them.   As we continue to respond to the public health crisis, I have been  working with my colleagues here in the House to find innovative and  timely solutions for the problems that COVID-19 continues to  exacerbate.   Over the past several months, I have fought for the price of insulin  and other drugs to be lowered immediately because families that are  struggling need access to lifesaving medication. I fought alongside my  colleagues for more supplies for our healthcare workers, for hospitals,  and for community healthcare centers.   We can't let up now. We must continue to take steps that address the  health disparities that place a significant and dangerous burden on  American families.   I would like to join my colleagues and constituents in remembering  the lives tragically lost during this pandemic and recommit to working  together to help families across our country stay safe.                            ____________________
