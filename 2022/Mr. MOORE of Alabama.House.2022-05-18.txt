 Mr. Speaker, as a Christian and father of four,  the issue of abortion is personal to me. I believe an unborn child is a  human life, fearfully and wonderfully made and worth protecting.   In the last 50 years, scientific advancements have taught us a great  deal about the early stages of life. As early as 5 weeks, babies in the  womb have a heartbeat.   Roe v. Wade is an inherently flawed opinion. Nowhere in our  Constitution exists the right to abort a child.   Recently, we watched the far left and liberal media attack our  Supreme Court Justices after a leaked draft opinion shows that the  Court might overturn Roe and give the States the power to decide this  issue.   Never content to let a crisis go to waste, the Senate Democrats tried  to advance a radical and inhumane bill that would guarantee the right  to abort a baby up until the moment of birth--until the very moment of  birth.   Shouldn't a debate like this take place in the States, where citizens  will have more input on this important issue?   I will continue fighting for the unborn, as well as the radical  propaganda coming out of Washington. We must stop extreme attacks and  protect the sanctity of life at all costs.                            ____________________
