 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor  Specialist Rene J. Rodriguez of El Paso, Texas, for his courage and  heroism while stationed with the 25th Infantry Division at Schofield  Barracks in my district.   Earlier this month, Specialist Rodriguez was awarded the Soldier's  Medal, the highest individual decoration the United States Army can  give for an act of valor in a noncombat event.   He received that award for defending a local woman who was being  violently assaulted outside of a coffee shop in Wahiawa last October.  With disregard for his own safety, Specialist Rodriguez put himself in  the middle and took the brunt of the attack, giving the woman space and  time to get to safety in his vehicle.   Specialist Rodriguez' actions that day represent the very best of our  soldiers and the highest values of courage and sacrifice in the United  States Army. We are so very proud of him and so grateful for his  service and commitment to our Hawaii community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am definitely out of breath. I ran here  from my other hearing because this was just such an important hour that  we participate in.   Patsy Takemoto Mink is the mother of Title IX. She had a vision and a  dream for her daughter and for all of our children, to live a life free  from the kind of discrimination she suffered as a woman of color.   Her groundbreaking advocacy and reforms have since paved the way to  allow all of our children to fully participate and engage in their  education, in sports, and in all other forms of learning as their true,  authentic selves.   Removing discrimination and inequity on the basis of sex was personal  for Congresswoman Mink. Throughout her pursuit of higher education, she  faced racial discrimination, segregation, and limited opportunities  simply because she was a woman.   Many of us serving here in Congress on both sides of the aisle are  here because of Patsy's perseverance and courage, and I am humbled to  serve in the seat that she held with such grit and such grace. Like  Patsy, I see every action or inaction we take here in Congress through  the lens of a mother.   While we cowardly delay action on gun legislation, I leave home each  week terrified that one day an active shooter drill at my sons' school  might not be a drill at all.   As we fight book bans and the perverse culture wars of the far right,  I wonder how my boys will feel when they see less and less of  themselves in what is represented as history, and in the books that are  on the library shelves.   While we watch as bullies in Congress try to push our loved ones back  into the closet through guilt and shame, I hug my babies, now  teenagers, every single chance I get, and I remind them, as I have  since they were little, of my unconditional love for them and my only  wish for them to be whomever they seek to be.   As we fight in this Chamber, kicking and screaming against what is  nothing less than a movement to use our children as a means to  institutionalize racism, legitimize discrimination, and oppress  marginalized people and communities of color around our country, I  often sit and ask myself: What would Patsy say? What would Patsy do?   I cannot speak for this great tower of a woman, but I know in my  heart that she would not stand for this kind of politicization of our  children. She would stand shoulder to shoulder with all of us and say:  Hell, no, not today. Not today.
