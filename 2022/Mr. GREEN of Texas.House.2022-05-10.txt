 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Raskin for the time,  and I thank Mr. Levin for what he has done to bring this resolution to  fruition.   Madam Speaker, today I rise to defend the rights of our staff to  organize. This really is about respect. We should respect their rights:  Their right to have a decent day's pay for a hard day's work, their  right to have the best healthcare that we can afford.   I respect them, I support them, and I respect the right of all  workers to organize. Hence, I will vote for the legislation.
