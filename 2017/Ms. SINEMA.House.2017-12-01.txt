 Mr. Speaker, thank you to Chairman Hensarling and  Congressman Barr for working with me to make housing more affordable  for Arizona families.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1699, the Preserving Access to  Manufactured Housing Act. Manufactured housing is an important form of  affordable housing in Arizona, particularly for rural and underserved  communities. More than 300,000 families in Arizona live in manufactured  homes. Low- and moderate-income families count on manufactured homes as  an affordable choice.   Just last week, we had the honor of working with Habitat for Humanity  to help Ed, a Vietnam veteran living in Tempe, spread gravel and  improve his front yard. Ed first moved to the Valley in 1950 and bought  a manufactured home a few years ago.   If Ed wanted to use his VA eligibility to purchase a home, the  realtor would be able to connect Ed with a number of lenders who offer  VA home loans. However, if Ed wanted to purchase a manufactured home,  he would be instructed to go to a table by himself and sift through the  countless brochures and loan programs to decide which lender is best.  This is a daunting and discouraging process for most borrowers,  especially for first-time homebuyers.   Current regulations harm existing manufactured homeowners and  potential buyers by curtailing consumer access to manufactured home  loans or assistance in the home-buying process. These regulations  unintentionally make it more difficult to match borrowers with lenders  who can help them in a timely and efficient manner.   H.R. 1699 is a commonsense fix for Ed and the hundreds of thousands  of Arizonans who own or are looking to own manufactured homes. The bill  ensures that regulations give homebuyers more options, better advice,  and greater confidence when buying a new home. The bill also amends the  definition of a high cost mortgage and corresponding thresholds to  ensure that consumers of small-balance mortgage loans will have the  opportunity to access mortgage credit.   It was a privilege to meet Ed and thank him for his service to our  country. We should make it easier, not harder, for veterans and fellow  Arizonans like him to purchase a home of their choice. I urge members  of both parties to join me in supporting H.R. 1699.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 635, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. In its current form, I am.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Ms. Maxine Waters of California moves to recommit the bill       H.R. 1699 to the Committee on Financial Services with       instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith       with the following amendment:        Add at the end the following:       SEC. 4. PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM EXCESSIVE HOUSING COSTS AND                     PREDATORY LENDERS.         (a) In General.--No lender or other person may make use of       the amendments made by this Act if the lender or person has       either been--        (1) found to have committed or engaged in an unfair,       deceptive, or abusive act or practice under Federal law in       connection with any transaction with a consumer for a       consumer financial product or service; or        (2) convicted of fraud under Federal or State law in       connection with a residential mortgage loan or the extension       of any loan in connection with a manufactured or modular       home.        (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the terms       ``State'' and ``consumer financial product or service'' have       the meaning given those terms, respectively, under section       1002 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I  ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from California?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simple.  It would prevent bad actors from being able to use the exemptions in  the underlying bill and evade the consumer protections in the Truth in  Lending Act.   If a lender has committed or engaged in an unfair, deceptive, or  abusive act or practice under Federal law in connection with any  transaction with a  [[Page H9584]]  consumer for a consumer financial product or service; or if they have  been convicted of fraud under Federal or State law in connection with a  residential mortgage loan or the extension of any loan in connection  with a manufactured or modular home, they cannot avail themselves of  the bill's decreased scrutiny.   As I have already mentioned, Clayton Homes has nearly a monopolistic  grip on manufactured housing lending. In 2010, Vanderbilt Mortgage-- Clayton's lending arm--paid a $2.8 million settlement to home buyers in  North Carolina, after the State attorney general and commissioner of  banks accused them of fraud for utilizing inaccurate information to  obtain loans for consumers and for inflating the prices of manufactured  homes.                                time  1030    This is the type of abuse that my amendment seeks to address. Making  sure that lenders who have engaged in abusive practices abide by the  rules set forth in Dodd-Frank and carried out by the Consumer Bureau is  especially important now that the Trump administration is attempting to  undermine the independence of the agency.   After the illegal move to install Mick Mulvaney as acting Director  and then his quick move to freeze all the hiring, the supervision, and  new regulations at the Consumer Bureau, it is clear that abusive  financial institutions that simply rip off consumers will have free  rein to continue harming them. That includes not only conglomerates  like Clayton Homes, but repeat offenders, such as Wells Fargo, an  institution that has illegally modified mortgages, charged fraudulent  mortgage rates, and steered borrowers into predatory mortgage loans.   American families deserve better.   At an absolute minimum, a lender who has already proven that they  cannot be trusted to originate responsible loans should not be awarded  with diminished standards, particularly in an industry like  manufactured housing, which is typically the only affordable option for  many financially vulnerable consumers.   Mr. Speaker, time and time again, my colleagues on the opposite side  of the aisle talk about how they are for Main Street America and for  the rural communities that Democrats have forgotten. So why is it that  they want to allow bad actors to prey upon rural families?   According to the Housing Assistance Council, while manufactured  housing only makes up 6 percent of all housing nationally, it makes up  14 to 15 percent in rural and small town communities. We need to be  doing more to help rural families, not making it easier for bad actors  to just rip them off.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
