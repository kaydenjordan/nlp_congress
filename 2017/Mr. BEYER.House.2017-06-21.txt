 Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to the bill.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        At the end of the bill, insert the following:       SEC. 3. NO LOSS OF FUNDS FOR WILD-FIRE SUPPRESSION.         Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act       shall detract from the availability of funds or other       resources for wild-fire suppression.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 392, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I believe the bill before us today is a  well-intentioned attempt to create a process which would minimize the  risk of fire along electrical utilities' rights-of-way. Yes, there are  some problems with the bill, but my most significant objection is that  this bill, our Natural Resources Committee, and this Congress refuse to  act on the urgent need to address how our U.S. Forest Service deals  with wildfires.   The Forest Service burned through more than half of its budget last  year fighting wildfires. Yet our leadership won't bring to the floor  for a vote a bipartisan legislation that deals with the problem of  ``fire borrowing.''   In the 114th Congress, just such a bill, the Wildfire Disaster  Funding Act had 151 cosponsors--67 Republicans, 84 Democrats--but it  never even got a committee hearing. So that is disappointing, and even  irresponsible.   So, once again, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management  are going to go into this fire season knowing that they don't have the  resources to do the work necessary to mitigate wildfire damage on U.S.  public lands.   In a recent report on fire suppression costs, the Forest Service  reported that funding available for recreation, heritage, and  wilderness had fallen 15 percent; funding for roads is down 46 percent;  facility spending, off 68 percent; deferred maintenance outlays have  been slashed by a disastrous 95 percent.   Mr. Chairman, in my two terms on the Natural Resources Committee, we  often debate and fret about how little money is available for  maintenance of our public lands, the deferred maintenance. The  diversion of these funds for wildfire suppression is among the many  causes.   Non-fire-related staff has been cut by 39 percent since 1998, and  over the last two decades, the cost of fire preparedness and  suppression activities has grown from 62 percent of the Forest  Service's total budget, to more than half--52 percent.   That shift has come at the expense of programs and staff that every  American wants: staff on recreation, permits, timber sales, hunting,  and fishing. Everything else is suffering because of our inability to  deal in a constructive way with wildfire mitigation.   So now is the time that we address wildfires to be treated as the  major disasters they are and for the efforts to put them out, to be  eligible for disaster assistance, and not subtract it from funds that  land managers need to do their daily jobs.   So my very simple one-sentence amendment simply says that no money in  this bill--this bill will not divert legitimate wildfire mitigation  money more to wildfires than is already there.   I urge you to vote ``yes'' on my amendment so, at the very least, we  can prevent this bill from detracting from further Federal wildfire  suppression efforts.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank my friend from Florida for his  support for this sensible amendment, and I hope that we can proceed.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Carbajal    The CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a recorded vote  on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr.  Carbajal) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the  noes prevailed by voice vote.   The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.   The Clerk redesignated the amendment.                                Recorded Vote    The CHAIR. A recorded vote has been demanded.

Under the rule, the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Donovan) having assumed the chair, Mr. Womack, Chair of the Committee  of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1873) to amend  the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to enhance the  reliability of the electricity grid and reduce the threat of wildfires  to and from electric transmission and distribution facilities on  Federal lands by facilitating vegetation management on such lands, and,  pursuant to House Resolution 392, he reported the bill back to the  House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.   (By unanimous consent, Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ was allowed to speak out  of order.)                     Congressional Women's Softball Game    Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you with your  congressional women's softball team, who are tanned, rested, and ready  to beat the press tonight.   Our bipartisan team has been practicing for the last 3 months at 7 in  the morning, two to three mornings a week, with batting practice at  night at the cages at the Nationals training academy.   We have been singularly focused on two things--I know it doesn't make  sense, because that would mean it wasn't singularly--making sure that  we can continue to raise awareness about the risk that young women face  of breast cancer and to make sure that we can shine a spotlight on the  fact that young women can and do get breast cancer.   This is our ninth annual game. It is the eighth time that we are  playing the common ``enemy''--we say that affectionately--the female  Capitol press corps. They have been incredible partners in helping this  year cross the incredible milestone of raising more than $1 million for  the Young Survival Coalition. We are so proud of that.   We want to thank our coaches who have been remarkable through all  these years. Of course, we have our head coach, Torie Barnes, Jo Ann  Emerson's daughter, who was the cofounder of this game 9 years ago; our  own House favorite, Natalie Buchanan, who is an amazing new mom who has  [[Page H5032]]  been out there with us, in spite of just having a baby a few short  months ago; Coach Jim, who has been amazing as well; and, of course,  our very own colleague, Coach Ed Perlmutter from the great State of  Colorado.   Come on out tonight at 7 p.m. at Watkins Recreation Center, 420 12th  Street, SE. Turn right at the CVS.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby), my  cocaptain, friend, and fellow appropriator.
