 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, the  proponents of antitrust laws are famously zealous in their desire to  eradicate the curse of bigness. To them, big is always bad except, of  course, when it comes to the size and scope of government. The same  people who supposedly fear the concentration of power in the  marketplace celebrate the concentration of power in the State--a State  that asserts itself into and nullifies private contracts, breaks up  companies it deems too large, and inflicts punishment on those who  succeed in the competition for customers. In short, antitrust seeks to  cap the amount of success any company or business can enjoy and the  benefits reaped by customers.   As economist Yale Brozen wrote, antitrust law seems to say that firms  should compete but should not win; firms should be efficient enough to  survive but should not share the fruits of greater efficiency with  their customers.   And that is the fatal defect of antitrust policy.   Antitrust fails to accept the lessons of economic history that  voluntary exchange is a win-win proposition and that consumers are  incredibly powerful in a free market system. A company that continues  to reward its customers with superior products and innovations will, in  turn, be rewarded with greater market share--with more--and will do  better than their competitors and they will grow in size. Size is not  necessarily a bad thing. The size of a business reflects its ability to  please its consumers.    But no company can achieve a strong position in the market and rest  on its laurels. Consumers are too demanding, and competitors will arise  to steal customers away from any firm that ceases to treat its clients  well. Unlike players in the marketplace who must take note of consumer  trends to survive, antitrust enforcers often fail to see what it is  that is right in front of their faces.   Just take the issue of video services. In 2005, when Netflix was  already several years old and growing in popularity, the FTC--believe  it or not--busied itself in blocking a merger between Blockbuster and  Hollywood Video. So this is the inside of government. Netflix is  beginning to take off, and the antitrust busters--the trust busters-- are breaking up VCR companies and DVD companies. They are going after  Blockbuster. This is the incompetence of government, and we should not  encourage this. Blockbuster and Hollywood Video no longer exist. Even  now, Netflix is one they are worried about. So Netflix was the  competitor that put Blockbuster out of business. They wanted to get  Blockbuster in order to forbid them from merging. It makes no sense at  all.   No such fear exists today, though, that Netflix will be a monopoly  since they are competing with Hulu, Peacock, Amazon Prime Video,  Disney+, HBO Max, Apple TV, Paramount+, and others, but 5 or 6 years  ago, you might have thought: Netflix is going to take over the world,  that we have got to break them up. No. If companies please their  consumers, let them get bigger. Bigger means they are giving their  customers something they want.   We didn't need government to break up Netflix. We didn't need  government to interfere to ensure competition and innovation. All we  needed to do was to let the marketplace work, but standing in the way  of the benefits of the market are the antitrust zealots. The U.S.  Chamber of Commerce has pointed out that enacting this bill would  stymie legitimate business transactions between sectors and industries,  create needless new bureaucracy, and spur unwarranted litigation.   The package is even more nefarious than that. It will take money out  of the productive sector--the private sector--and give it to  bureaucrats in Washington. As Americans for Tax Reform correctly points  out, this legislation would give the Biden administration hundreds of  millions of dollars in new funds to pursue a progressive social agenda.  They are talking about critical race theory and all of this craziness  and injecting this into whether a company can merge or not. This is not  something we need to give them more money to do; we need to give them  less money.   The package of bills here is just the first step to reinvigorating  antitrust law. There is no lack of bills designed to empower government  control over the marketplace. Take just one bill called the Competition  and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act, which would presume that any  merger of a certain size violates the law and shifts the burden of  proof to the merging parties. The government doesn't have to prove that  your merging and becoming bigger is bad; you have to prove that your  merging is somehow a benefit. People merge--they get bigger--to provide  a lower cost and gain market share to gain profit for the consumers.  That is what capitalism is based on. That is what Adam Smith really  wrote about.   According to Robert Bork, Jr., the antitrust bill would enact so many  potential ways to prosecute, abuse, and torment companies that  government would, in essence, become the real board of directors, and  every major company would be ruled by the Federal Government.   That is what is coming. That is what they are proposing. This bill  today is a small step in that direction, but what they have in the  pipeline is more government control of business. The package today is a  mere precursor to designating the Department of Justice and the FTC as  the central planners of the American economy. This bill seeks to take  the power out of the hands of the consumers and hand it to the  antitrust bureaucrats.   Therefore, I object.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Napier Brothers Clothing of Lancaster, KY, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Mr. Lonnie Napier is a lifelong resident of Garrard County, KY, and  he remembers when the county did not look quite like it does today. Mr.  Napier grew up in a rural part of Garrard County, and as a boy, he did  not know the comforts of running water, telephones, electricity, and  in-door plumbing. However, as Mr. Napier grew older, he continued to  leave his mark on the community. In 1966, at the age of 26 years old,  Mr. Napier was elected to the Garrard County Fiscal Court, the youngest  man to ever be elected to such group. From that day forward, Mr. Napier  would continue his involvement with local government, even as he began  his career in the clothing business.   Lonnie Napier opened Napier Brothers Clothing back in 1990, and he  has been working at the same location in Lancaster square ever since,  making it the oldest small business on the town square. As one might  gather from the store's name, Lonnie's business is a family business,  having named the store after his two sons, both of which worked in the  store during their youth. Today, the store sells all sorts of clothing,  ranging from casual wear to clothes suited for working outside, and  shoes, ranging from men's and ladies' footwear to work boots suitable  for outdoor conditions. According to Lonnie Napier, the most popular  item that his store sells is blue jeans, which is no wonder considering  the wide selection of blue jeans Mr. Napier keeps stocked in his  collection of shelves along the store's wall. Mr. Napier ensures that  all products in his store are top quality and that the customer service  of Napier Brothers Clothing far exceeds that of his corporate  competitors.   Given Garrard County's location within central Kentucky, agriculture  enjoys a large influence on their surrounding communities. Large  businesses such as Tractor Supply directly compete with Mr. Napier's  customer base, but corporations simply cannot match the sense of  familiarity and geniality that a customer feels when walking into  Napier Brothers Clothing. Mr. Napier has a knack for taking care of his  customers, always answering their questions and hearing whatever  concerns they may have. His amiability as a business owner is one of  the many traits that led him to find success in local governance. A  highlight of Mr. Napier's political career occurred back in 1984 when  he was running for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives.  Initially thinking it was a prank, Mr. Napier finally paid a phone call  to a telephone number his friends kept insisting he dial. That phone  call led to Lonnie Napier receiving an in-person campaign endorsement  from then President Ronald Reagan. In addition to having met former  President Reagan, Mr. Napier also had the pleasure of meeting former  Presidents George Bush, Sr., and Bill Clinton.   Though he occasionally rubbed shoulders with politicians in the big  leagues, Mr. Napier never lost sight of his mission to run the best  small business in Lancaster. From a country-born boy who grew up having  to walk 5 miles to school each day, to a successful Main Street  entrepreneur who has consistently looked out for the citizens of  Lancaster, Mr. Napier has enjoyed a long and fruitful career in his  corner of Kentucky. Congratulations to Lonnie Napier and to the whole  team at Napier Brothers Clothing. I look forward to seeing their  continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
