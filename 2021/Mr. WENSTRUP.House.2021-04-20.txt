 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mount Notre  Dame High School girls basketball team on winning the Ohio High School  Athletic Association championship.   Mount Notre Dame captured the Division 1 State championship title  after beating Newark in a 2-point double overtime thriller. This  championship was the eighth championship for the Mount Notre Dame  basketball program--the most in Ohio school history.   Coach Scott Rogers led his team to a 28-0 record, a number two  national ranking, and has won 72 consecutive games.   Among the team's many talented athletes is junior guard KK Bransford  who was recently named Ohio's Ms. Basketball.   I commend Coach Scott Rogers and the entire Mount Notre Dame girls  basketball team for this historic accomplishment and tradition of  excellence.   Congratulations, again, to the Mount Notre Dame players, to Coach  Rogers and his staff, and to the Mount Notre Dame faithful.                            ____________________
