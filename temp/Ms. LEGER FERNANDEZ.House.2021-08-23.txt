 Madam Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 4. I  stand in support of democracy. Earlier this month, the House  Administration Subcommittee on Elections, on which I  [[Page H4348]]  serve, released a report documenting voter suppression following the  Shelby decision. We detailed the ongoing onslaught on our freedom to  vote.   To those that claim that voting is already accessible to all, read  the report, open your eyes to the experience of minority communities  who face endless barriers to the ballot box.   After Latinos, Native Americans, and Black Americans voted in  historic numbers, State legislators moved to restrict voting in State  after State. We have a constitutional duty to act. We must pass H.R. 4  to restore the promise and power of the Voting Rights Act.   Madam Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to join us. Taking  away equal access to the polls and defending voter suppression is not  partisan, it is un-American.                            ____________________
