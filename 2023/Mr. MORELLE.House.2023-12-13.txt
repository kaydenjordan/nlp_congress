 Mr. Speaker, it is with deep sorrow I rise to  acknowledge the loss of U.S. Air Force Major-Select Terrell K. Brayman  of Pittsford, New York.   On November 29, Major-Select Brayman, an Osprey pilot and flight  commander, perished during a training exercise off the coast of Japan  along with seven of his fellow airmen.   Major-Select Brayman, who would have celebrated his 33rd birthday a  week from today, grew up in Rochester and was described as hardworking  and hilarious by those closest to him.   Following his graduation from high school, he enrolled in Ohio  State's ROTC program, successfully becoming  [[Page H6875]]  an officer in the United States Air Force. He went on to serve with  great distinction, demonstrating commitment to a cause greater than  himself. For that, our community and Nation will be forever grateful.   My heartfelt condolences go out to his family and all who knew him. I  hope they take comfort in knowing Major-Select Brayman's profound sense  of duty, patriotism, and dedication to our country will forever remain  his legacy.                            ____________________
