 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Griff Doyle, who retired as the University of Georgia's vice president  of government relations on Friday, March 22. Mr. Doyle dedicated 40  years to good government throughout Georgia, and a large part of his  career has been crucial to UGA becoming a premier public university in  this country.   Before he started with the university, he worked with the Georgia  Public Policy Foundation, with former Governor George Busbee, and as an  assistant U.S. attorney in the State.   Experiences like these gave him a priceless breadth of knowledge that  enabled him to be one of the most important figures at the University  of Georgia.   While at the university, he educated Members of Congress on the  latest research projects and secured funding necessary to move those  projects forward, keeping UGA itself, the State of Georgia, and our  entire Nation as global research leaders.   He also contributed directly to the students by placing 40 interns  annually in congressional offices and even teaching seminars in  government.   Thank you, Griff, for your personal friendship and for your  dedication to our State and our beloved University of Georgia. Your  work has truly been invaluable. Enjoy your retirement.                            ____________________
