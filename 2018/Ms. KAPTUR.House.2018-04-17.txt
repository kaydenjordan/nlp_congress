 Mr. Speaker, as certain as March 20 is the first day of  spring, today, April 17, at midnight, is the tax filing deadline for  2017 returns. Months after passing the $1.8 trillion deficit-busting  tax giveaway, Republicans are still trying to sell their trickle-down  tax scam.   In fact, Republicans are so desperate to spin the tax scam that a  GOP-sanctioned PAC group will spend $1 million on TV ads to convince us  of what we know isn't true. The American people aren't buying it.   Republicans' huge tax bonanzas to corporations and billionaires is  not trickling down to the American people. It is billions of dollars in  tax givebacks to major corporations, but 12 cents to the average  worker.   Instead of stuffing the tax scam with corporate giveaways, we should  have closed the carried interest loophole, one of many promises  President Trump made during his campaign and then broke. That loophole  lets hedge fund managers pay a 20 percent tax on their investment  profits instead of the 37 percent individual income tax.   The Republican tax plan is pure greed, and we should reverse it at  our first opportunity.

There ought to be a statue at Seneca Falls that honors her service to  America. It was astounding.   She became one of only 288 women in American history to be elected to  this House of Representatives, and she, as with all women Members who  have served as House Members, was vividly aware she was an American  pioneer, as only 3 percent of individuals who have ever served here to  date have been women.   What a marvelous person she was to be with. We had the privilege of  serving together for over three decades. Her acuity, her passion, her  perseverance, and her sparkling humor and keen mind brought new life  and direction to our republic and to every Member here.   She was a treasured friend and, yes, dean of the New York delegation.  She also became the first woman to ever chair the exclusive Rules  Committee, a committee whose unusually round-the-clock schedule  required members to work through the night and into the wee hours of  the morning, often past midnight, or convening at the crack of dawn. It  wasn't an easy job. That committee is a place of grueling endurance,  and yet she traversed that brutal track day in and day out without a  whimper.    How she could remain crisp on subsequent floor debates on hundreds  and hundreds of bills and amendments managing thousands of details is a  vivid testimony to her mental and physical strength which she devoted  to our Nation.   She was gracious to a fault. I recall her inviting Members to her  Rules Committee office always helping Members to feel at home here.   As the eldest woman in the House with 88 years of experience, Louise  Slaughter brought wisdom that served America superbly. She was  dedicated to the working people of our country and to the rights of  women. She never stopped giving.   The daughter of a blacksmith who worked in a Kentucky coal mine, she  was a tireless advocate for workers in Rochester in places like Kodak  or Xerox, and she stood shoulder to shoulder with her community and  fought with full soul against bad trade deals that she correctly feared  would hollow out her community's jobs and in turn the American middle  class. She was right, and she never gave up fighting for them.   She coauthored the Violence Against Women Act and fought full bore  for equal pay for equal work and stood tall her whole career in our  effort to make our Nation more just and equal.   Last night, I attended an event at the United States Holocaust  Memorial Museum, and one of the women docents took me around. I told  her what happened to Louise, and she said: Oh, my goodness. I am from  upstate New York. I was her constituent. She gave me a  [[Page H3388]]  ticket when I was a Girl Scout to come to Washington, and look what I  am doing now, a very high-level person at that museum.   I said: Louise's gifts keep on giving.   A grateful Nation thanks Louise Slaughter and her husband, Bob, who  was at her side for so many, many years, and her beautiful daughters,  grandchildren, and all the constituents from the greater Rochester  area. She will be truly, truly missed.   Through her passionate and loving work for America and commitment to  liberty, she has helped make America a much more just and equal nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Paul Tonko, for his love of Louise  and for always sitting with her and for enjoying and sharing these  years. He has done a superb, masterful job this evening of paying full  tribute to her and her life.
