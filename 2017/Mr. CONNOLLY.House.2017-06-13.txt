 Mr. Speaker, I strongly support increased  accountability and whistleblower protection at the Department of  Veterans Affairs. And I recognize that S. 1094 represents a compromise  approach that was crafted specifically to address severe, long-standing  problems at VA hospitals.   But a number of S. 1094's provisions concern me. As Vice Ranking  Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, these  concerns would be amplified if these provisions were applied to other  contexts or across the federal government in future legislation.   A partial list of problematic provisions includes:   The bill requires a lower standard of evidence that would allow  removal, demotion, and other disciplinary actions even if the majority  of evidence is exculpatory.   The bill supersedes existing collective bargaining agreements.   The bill provides for the clawback and forfeiture of bonuses and  pensions under a standard that is broad and susceptible to abuse.   The bill denies senior executives of the right to appeal to the Merit  Systems Protection Board, which they have under current law.   The bill imposes unreasonable timelines on the ability of employees  to respond to allegations that may lead to discipline and eliminates  the ability of the Merit System Protection Board to mitigate penalties  that may have been overly harsh and raise due process concerns.   The bill prohibits the use of administrative leave for employees  challenging demotions. This provision could also force employees to use  their accrued sick or annual leave while on appeal, which Courts have  considered a taking in violation of the Constitution.   While S. 1094 is a bipartisan compromise aimed at dealing with a  specific and troubled department, a number of its provisions are  problematic and would not serve as an example for future civil service- related legislation.
