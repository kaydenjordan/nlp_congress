 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for  her tremendous leadership. I also thank Chairwoman McCollum and Ranking  Member Joyce for working with me on this very important amendment.   In my congressional district in North Carolina resides the Uwharrie  National Forest, which many of my constituents call home. This national  treasure is a pillar of our community and brings folks from all across  the Nation and the world to North Carolina every year. But for those  who live in the Uwharrie National Forest, it looks a lot different.   My constituents in the Green Gap community have had to contend with  dangerous roads in the Uwharrie National Forest for years while the  Forest Service has neglected their maintenance. As someone who has seen  firsthand how dangerous these roads are, I can attest to the critical  need to pave these roads.   One of my constituents had a heart attack, and the ambulance couldn't  get down the road because of ruts and the washouts. Thankfully, the  desperate but resourceful paramedics got out of the ambulance and  sprinted down the road with a stretcher.   Another one of my constituent's house burned to the ground because  the road was so impassable, the fire truck couldn't get to the house to  put out the blaze.   Put yourself in the shoes of my constituents. Imagine living with  this fear every day.   Working with me, the State of North Carolina has stepped up with  financial assistance and agreed to maintain these roads. I am asking  this Congress to also step up to ensure my constituents are not  forgotten and they have access to critical lifesaving services they  deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
