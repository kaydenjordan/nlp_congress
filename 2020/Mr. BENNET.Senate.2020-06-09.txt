 Madam President, I rise to honor the career of Dwight  Gardner, who recently announced his retirement after providing decades  of service to the State of Colorado. He most recently served on my  staff as the regional director for southeast Colorado. Dwight has been  a tireless advocate for the farmers, ranchers, and communities across  our State. For decades, he has worked on behalf of communities  throughout the region, from Pueblo to Raton Pass on the New Mexico  border, and from the headwaters of the Arkansas River in Leadville,  high in the Rockies, to the town of Holly in Prowers County.   Early in his career, Dwight worked alongside his brother to support  the farmers of the Arkansas Valley as a cropduster. Living through the  era of ``buy and dry'' land purchasing to divert water to meet the  needs of a growing Front Range, Dwight understood early the value of  advocacy for rural Colorado.   In 2000, he was elected to the first of two terms as a Crowley County  Commissioner, and in that role, he was selected as chairman of the  Southern Colorado Economic Development District to represent the  interests of the 14 counties in the region. In 2007, my predecessor,  Senator Ken Salazar, asked Dwight to join his office. I was fortunate  that Dwight agreed to continue his service in my office in 2009.   Dwight employs a formidable array of skills to serve the southeast  region of Colorado effectively. He builds strong relationships with  people; he possesses a deep knowledge and respect for the heritage of  Colorado; and he provides a constant presence when the issues demand  it. He has engaged in the battle for Federal funds to build the long- promised Arkansas Valley conduit. He was witness to the important  preservation of our national heritage at Camp Amache and Sand Creek. He  helped shepherd the critical economic opportunity represented by the  continuation of the Southwest Chief railroad line.   From local food production to manufacturing, from the decommissioning  of the Pueblo Chemical Depot to establishing good neighbor relations at  Fort Carson's Pinon Canyon Maneuver site, Dwight has been a steady  presence and road warrior as he has advanced the common good across  hundreds of miles of beautiful southern Colorado.   Going forward, I will miss Dwight's humility, his candor, and his  keen understanding of what it means to be a son of rural America,  attributes so needed as we work our way toward a better future. I am  comforted to know that the next generation, represented by his  grandsons Noah, Devlan, and Gatlan, have the benefit of his guidance.  Colorado is grateful for his service.                            ____________________
