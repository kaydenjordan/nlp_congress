 Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.   The Clerk will report the motion.   The Clerk read as follows:   Mr. Hoyer moves to lay the resolution on the table.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I have had the honor of serving in this House for over  38 years. I have served during six Presidencies. I have been here  through moments of tremendous progress and terrible tragedy. I have  seen periods of rank partnership and patriotic bipartisanship. I have  seen our two-party system work, and I have seen it break down.   Never in all my years of serving in this great institution that I  love and the people of my district did I ever expect to encounter such  an obvious wrongdoing by a President of the United States, nor did I  expect to witness such a craven rationalization of Presidential actions  which have put our national security at risk, undermined the integrity  of our elections, and defined the constitutional authority of the  Congress to conduct oversight.   We have heard from Republicans that this impeachment really has to do  with policy differences or how we feel personally about the President,  about his temperament or that we simply dislike him.   Throughout the Trump Presidency, Democrats have resisted pursuing  impeachment even as we watched with dismay and disgust at a pattern of  wrongdoing. That pattern included:   Ordering Federal agencies to lie to the public;   Firing the FBI Director for refusing to end investigations of his  campaign;   Siding with Vladimir Putin against our intelligence agencies;   Taking funding away from the military to put towards an ineffective  border wall; and   Setting policies that have led to the separation of families and  caging of children.   We have, to be sure, deep disagreements with the policies and actions  taken by this President.   There has been a lot of talk about the 63 million people who voted  for Mr. Trump, little talk about the 65 million people who voted for  Hillary Clinton.   The policy difference, or those votes, this President was elected  legitimately because we have an electoral college. But none of these  are reasons to pursue what Chairman Schiff has called a wrenching  process for the Nation.   In fact, Democrats rejected that process emphatically in three  specific votes:   In December of 2017, Democrats overwhelmingly voted against pursuing  Articles of Impeachment, including the Speaker and me.   We did so again in 2018, with over 60 percent of the Democrats  rejecting pursuing Articles of Impeachment.   And again just months ago, in July of 2019, 60 percent of the  Democrats said no to pursuing Articles of Impeachment just days before  the infamous July 25 telephone call. We did the same with 60 percent of  Democrats voting not to proceed.   Credible witnesses, many of whom were appointed to office by  President Trump, have corroborated the details and timeline of his  abuse of Presidential power, which forms the basis of the first Article  of Impeachment in this resolution. I will not recount all of the  witnesses or abuses that have occurred.   I congratulate my colleagues and Mr. Nadler and his committee and Mr.  Schiff and his committee for setting forth a compelling case. They have  been laid out fully in the articles before us and by colleagues in  their remarks.   What I will do is remind Americans that the House provided President  Trump every opportunity to prove his innocence, but the witnesses were  precluded from coming forth.   The witnesses who had personal knowledge did not come, either at the  President's request, in which he refused to show up because he thought  it was a sham, as so many of you have said, or to the committees.  Instead, he ignored congressional subpoenas for documents and for  testimony by White House officials and ordered his subordinates not to  cooperate. Perhaps they could have exonerated him.   This, itself, I suggest to you, is unprecedented. When Presidents  Nixon and Clinton were asked to hand over documents and allow officials  to testify, ultimately, both complied because it is the law.   Such actions of the President can be taken as further evidence of his  obstruction and abuse of power. It is, in and of itself, impeachable  conduct, the subject of the second Article of Impeachment.   These two articles, of course, concern two very profound  constitutional issues about the abuse of power in our Republic:   First, whether it is acceptable for the President of the United  States--any President--to solicit foreign interference in our  elections.   There is a difference as to whether he has done that, and the place  to try that is in the United States Senate. But we believe strongly  there is probable cause to conclude that, to undermine our national  security, the integrity of our elections, and the integrity of our  democracy.   Secondly, whether it is permissible for the President to obstruct  Congress and act as if he is above the law and immune from  constitutional oversight.   On December 4, the Judiciary Committee heard the testimony of  constitutional law experts who weighed in on these points.   Some 1,500 historians have said the same thing as Professor Noah  Feldman said: If we cannot impeach a President who abuses his office  for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy. ``We live in  a monarchy or we live under a dictatorship.''   The votes we are about to take concern the rule of law and our  democracy itself.   Let us not forget the words of John Locke, so influential to the  Founders of our Republic. John Locke, a millennia ago, said this:  ``Wherever law ends, tyranny begins.''                                time  1930    This impeachment asks whether we are still a republic of laws, as our  Founders intended, or whether we will accept that one person can be  above the law.   In America, as we have said over and over again, no one is above the  law, but only as long as we hold every person accountable for breaking  the law, even a President, will that be true.   If the House does not act, if we wait and delay, we run the risk of  allowing the President's misconduct, if we believe it to be so, to be  repeated at the expense of the integrity of our elections, our national  security, and our constitutional system of separation of powers.   Democrats did not choose this impeachment. We did not wish for it.   We voted against it. We voted against it once, we voted against it  twice, we voted against it three times, as recently as July.   We did not want this.   However, President Trump's misconduct has forced our constitutional  Republic to protect itself.   These votes that we are about to take and the process that will  follow in the Senate are not only an assessment of the President's  commitment to the Constitution or to his oath of office; it is, as  well, a test of our own.   Damning evidence of the President's high crimes has emerged.   Nevertheless, Republican Members of this House and of the Senate have  continued to defend the President, whose actions seem to many of us to  be indefensible.   All of us feel a sense of loyalty to party. It is what makes our two- party system function. It is what helps hold Presidents and majorities  accountable. But party loyalty must have its limits.   And as evidence of the President's impeachable offenses have mounted  daily as the witnesses testified, it has become increasingly clear that  the limits of partisanship have been reached and passed.   Now, Democrats and Republicans together face a test before our  constituents, our countrymen, and our creator.   The New York Times on October 18 summarized the question now posed to  House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats: ``Compromise by  compromise, Donald Trump has hammered away at what Republicans once saw  as foundational virtues: decency, honesty, responsibility,'' and, yes,  even civility.   It went on to say: ``Will they commit themselves and their party  wholly to Mr. Trump, embracing even his most antidemocratic actions, or  will they take the first step toward separating themselves from him and  restoring confidence in the rule of law?''   Madam Speaker, we have seen Republican courage throughout our  history, from the Civil War to the Cold War.  [[Page H12191]]    In 1950, Margaret Chase Smith, the Senator from Maine, a Republican,  spoke bravely against the cancer of McCarthyism in her party, leading  six of her Republican colleagues in a ``Declaration of Conscience''  against their own leadership.   ``We are Republicans,'' they declared. ``But we are Americans  first.''   In 1974, one Congressman took the brave and principled step of  becoming the first Republican on the Judiciary Committee to support  impeaching President Nixon.   He said to his colleagues and to the country: ``It is not easy to  align myself against the President, to whom I gave my enthusiastic  support . . . on whose side I have stood in many a legislative battle,  whose accomplishments in foreign and domestic affairs I have  consistently applauded.   ``But it is impossible,'' he went on to say, ``for me to condone or  ignore the long train of abuses to which he has subjected the  Presidency and the people of this country. The Constitution and my own  oath of office,'' he said, ``demand that I `bear true faith and  allegiance' to the principles of law and justice upon which this Nation  was founded,'' he concluded, ``and I cannot, in good conscience, turn  away from the evidence of evil that is to me so clear and compelling.''   My colleagues, that Congressman's name was Larry Hogan, Sr. He  represented the Fifth District of Maryland, which I now represent. His  son is presently the second-term Republican Governor of our State.   When Larry Hogan, Sr., died in 2017, every obituary led with praise  for his act of political courage.   Who among us, many years from now, will receive such praise as a man  or woman of courage?   Who will regret not having earned it?   We have talked a lot about partisan differences.   There is one person who has spoken today who is neither a member of  the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party. His name is Justin  Amash, who represents a Republican district. He left the Republican  Party, and in doing so, he admonished his colleagues that: ``This  President will only be in power for a short time, but excusing his  behavior will forever tarnish your name.''   He spoke on this floor in support of the two articles that we will  consider this evening, neither a Democrat nor a Republican.   Representative Amash, of course, is the only Member of this House who  has no allegiance to either party, but to his country. He is  supporting, as I have said, both articles.   We need not ask who will be the first to show courage by standing up  to President Trump.   The question we must now ask is: Who will be the last to find it?   The pages of our history are filled with Americans who had the  courage to choose country over party or personality, but as President  Kennedy wrote: ``The stories of past courage . . . can teach, they can  offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But they cannot supply  courage itself. For this,'' President Kennedy said, ``each man''--each  woman--``must look into their own soul.''   Madam Speaker, I urge my fellow colleagues in the House and, yes, in  the Senate, to look into your soul, summon the courage to vote for our  Constitution and our democracy.    I understand we will all not see the same conclusion, but to do less  betrays our oath and that of our Founders, who pledged their lives,  their fortune, and their sacred honor.   Let us neither turn away from the evidence, which to me seems so  clear, nor from our good conscience, which compels us to do what, in  our hearts, we know to be right.   Let us not allow the rule of law to end or for tyranny to find its  toehold.   With our votes today, we can bear true faith and allegiance to the  vision of our Founders and we can show future generations what it truly  means to be Americans first.   Vote ``yes.''
