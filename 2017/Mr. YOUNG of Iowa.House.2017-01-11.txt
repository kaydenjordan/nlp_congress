 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 33, line 10, strike ``agencies and'' and insert       ``agencies,''.        Page 33, line 11, insert after ``easy to understand,'' the       following: ``and issues guidance in a manner sufficient to       provide at least 90 days for affected entities to take steps       to comply with such guidance,''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Young) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.    I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his help  and leadership on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is designed to make an already very good  bill even better. Regulators regulate. That is what they do. Regulators  regulate businesses, large and small, State and local governments,  nonprofits, individuals, et cetera. These regulated entities often rely  on guidance from agencies to become compliant with a new rule or  regulation; but, occasionally, this guidance is offered far too late in  the process, leaving entities with the decision to either move forward  without guidance and face possible penalties, litigation, losses, or to  wait until guidance is offered and then scramble to implement changes  before the deadline, increasing the likelihood for mistakes and  failure.   My amendment seeks to ensure guidance is offered and available in a  timely manner by instructing agencies to the Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs to issue guidance at least 90 days before a rule or  a regulation goes into effect so that affected entities have time to  comply.   As an example, companies recently experienced the hardships of late  guidance from HHS through CMS. There is a company in Iowa and similar  companies from around America that produce forms, using post acute  healthcare reimbursements, including skilled nursing and home care,  both of which receive funding through Medicare.   CMS is responsible for setting rules for the reimbursement forms.  Okay. Fine. CMS specified a new set of rules for forms going into  effect at the beginning of the year. Okay. Great. This company and  other companies waited for CMS guidance before printing and sending  reimbursement forms to its customers, and this company waited and  waited and waited; but 3 weeks before the effective date, this company  and others like it hadn't heard anything from CMS on guidance or  directions--crickets.                                time  1615    So at this point, they had to make a business decision. That is the  reality. Either wait for CMS and fail to have the required forms to its  customers in time for the new year or send the forms to print, cross  your fingers, say a prayer, roll the dice, and hope they will later be  found in compliance.   They sent the forms to print knowing full well they would eat the  cost if the forms did not comply. Losses, penalties, litigation, a  soiled reputation--those are the real things the lack of guidance and  notice causes. Thankfully, everything worked out in this situation, but  in other situations, things haven't worked out. A few days after they  sent the forms to print, CMS finally approved.   However, this situation illustrates a broader problem that occurs too  often transcending in other instances through the economy and needs to  be addressed. We need to make sure that when we give agencies the power  to effectively write law, we ensure compliance guidelines are clear- cut, timely, and enforcement is fair.   Allowing the regulatory process to continue as is and agencies to  issue needed guidance at the last minute, we only further burden  Americans in their organizations, businesses, these individuals in our  districts.   So I want to be clear what the amendment does not do. This amendment  does not change a rule or regulation in any way. It does not direct the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to do or speak to anything  else other than the timeliness issue I just described. It is pretty  plain language. My amendment says, when guidance is forthcoming, it  arrives in a timely manner.   Mr. Chairman, it is past time for Congress to rein in and approve  this process so our constituents aren't left with uncertainty, wringing  their hands waiting for Washington, and can, instead, get to work.  Let's get this fixed right now, Mr. Chairman.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying  bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 1 minute remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young).   The amendment was agreed to.               Amendment No. 8 Offered by Ms. Castor of Florida    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8  printed in part A of House Report 115-2.
