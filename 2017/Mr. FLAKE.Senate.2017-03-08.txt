 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, within a matter of days, our national debt  will top $20 trillion, notching another ominous milestone in our  Nation's long-running addiction to spending. How did we get here?   A decade ago, taxpayers learned that many of their elected  representatives were complicit in an insidious practice that rotted the  legislative branch to its core, and that is congressional earmarking.  Called a ``gateway drug'' by our distinguished former colleague from  Oklahoma, Senator Tom Coburn, earmarks have long exacerbated the  Federal Government's spending addiction.   As old as the Republic, earmarks have always been used by generations  of politicians as currency to curry favor with well-connected special  interests. After public outrage reached a critical mass, both the House  and the Senate instituted bans on earmarking, ending what had been a  corrupt pay-to-play culture in Congress.   In order to preserve this important check against the corrupting  influence of earmarks, I recently sent a letter to President Donald  Trump respectfully urging him to veto any legislation containing  earmarks that reaches his desk. I thank my colleagues, Senators John  McCain, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Ben Sasse, for cosigning  this letter.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the following letter.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, March 7, 2017.      President Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Trump: With our national debt set to top $20       trillion within days and growing at a rate of over half-a-      trillion dollars a year, bringing fiscal sanity to the       federal budget requires immediate attention and action. We       write today to urge opposition to any efforts by Congress to       return to earmarking.        While cutting unnecessary and wasteful spending may be       commonsense to most taxpayers, behind every dollar spent is a       boisterous special interest group with the loudest being       Congress itself. Even with a full agenda that includes       repealing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, easing the       regulatory burden, and strengthening our nation's security,       some lawmakers are focused on reviving the corrupt practice       of earmarking that was ended in 2011 after what seemed like       an endless series of corruption scandals.        Fondly described as a ``favor factory'' by a lobbyist       convicted of exchanging gifts for government grants, earmarks       represent the pay-to-play culture you have pledged to end. It       is unfathomable to those of us who fought to end earmarks and       witnessed our colleagues go to jail for corruption that pork       barrel politics would return, especially at this time when       Americans are clearly fed up with business-as-usual. However,       despite the success of the current moratorium enacted in both       chamber of Congress, there are efforts underway seeking to       revive the disdainful practice.        President Reagan vetoed a highway bill in 1987 because it       was larded up with 152 earmarks. Escalating exponentially,       the over-budget transportation bill signed into law in 2005       contained more than 6,300 earmarks. Earmark proponents are       trying to reassure that this time will be different,       promising fewer projects and even rebranding them as       ``congressionally-directed spending.'' With the serious       fiscal problems facing our nation, processing thousands or       even hundreds of pork requests will only distract and delay       addressing pressing national needs and push spending       decisions once again into the murky shadows.        We respectfully urge you to make it clear that you will       veto any bill Congress sends to you containing earmarks       within the legislative text or the accompanying report. We       look forward to working with you to make Washington more       accountable and stop wasteful spending where it starts, which       is often right here in Congress.            Sincerely,        Jeff Flake.        Mike Lee.        John McCain.        Rand Paul.        Ted Cruz.        Ben Sasse.     To explain the urgency behind my letter to the President,  I wish to remind my colleagues in this body, many of whom were not in  the Congress before enactment of the moratorium, just how bad the  earmarking epidemic became.   For the uninitiated, the term ``earmark'' is a euphemism for when  lawmakers work to circumvent the regular, normal appropriations process  in order to secure special funding for projects in their home districts  or their States. This resulted in Federal tax dollars being doled out  to Members of Congress on a whim, bypassing normal rigorous Federal and  public vetting.   Instead of focusing on oversight responsibilities or devising  legislative solutions for the Nation's most pressing challenges,  lawmakers and staffers devoted thousands of man-hours toward filling  earmark requests. Congressional appropriators and appropriations  committees transformed into what were termed ``favor factories,''  abandoning oversight responsibilities to focus on rationing out pork.  To me, that was one of the most insidious parts of the whole earmarking  era.   We have oversight responsibilities in Congress. There is a huge  Federal budget on which we should be providing oversight, but instead  of poring over agency spending and searching for waste in our trillion- dollar discretionary budget, Members and staff devoted countless hours  to roughly 2 or 3 percent of the Federal budget. There was so much  focus on just doling out what represented 1 or 2 or 3 percent of the  Federal budget that we basically neglected the rest of the Federal  budget in terms of oversight.  [[Page S1657]]    In less than 20 years, the number of earmarks in the Transportation  bill alone grew from 152 to 6,300. President Reagan, I believe, in 1988  famously said that he vetoed the highway bill because he hadn't seen  that much pork since he handed out ribbons at the county fair. There  were 152 earmarks in the Transportation bill that year, and by 2005 it  was 6,300. That is an increase of more than 4,000 percent.   Examples of earmarks range from a quarter billion dollars for a  bridge to nowhere in Alaska--everybody became familiar with that one;  $50 million for an indoor rainforest in Iowa, paid for by taxpayers  across the country; and half a million dollars for a teapot museum in  North Carolina. All of these earmarks added up, eventually totaling  about $29 billion a year.   It was in this environment that, along with a small group of like- minded colleagues, I set out to put an end to this form of  transactional politics that had infected the Halls of Congress. Our  mission was to place a permanent moratorium on congressional earmarks.   It took unprecedented revelations of widespread corruption and  illegality and ultimately the jailing of lawmakers, staffers, and  lobbyists before the public's outrage forced Congress to clean up its  act. But even brazen instances of public corruption didn't stop  Congress from dragging its feet on reforms, and the majority party, my  party, paid the price at the polls in 2006.   The dominant mood of the electorate at that time--that of mistrust in  government institutions--is strikingly reminiscent of the drain-the- swamp mentality that permeated last November's election. But despite  this surging anti-insider sentiment across the ideological spectrum,  there is now a chorus of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle working  behind the scenes to lift the congressional earmark moratorium. These  earmark defenders will trot out arguments ranging from constitutional  prerogative to the insignificance of earmarks relative to the entire  Federal budget. They will say: It is OK to earmark. We are only  earmarking 1 percent of the Federal budget.   But all of these defenses ring hollow. The constitutional power of  the purse is not a blanket mandate for Congress to spend freely;  rather, it is a fundamental duty to prevent the executive branch from  wasting taxpayer dollars. By using earmarks to funnel billions of  dollars to special interests, Congress ceases to be a check on the  executive branch. We have become no better than the free-spending  bureaucrats whom we rail against.   While we were ultimately successful in securing earmark bans in both  the House and the Senate, today we are seeing far too many cracks in  those foundations. With so many in Congress now willing to sacrifice  fiscal discipline, we have to remain vigilant against the return to  business as usual. We can't afford to forfeit the hard-fought progress  we have made.   The Senate Republican conference's vote earlier this year to preserve  the earmark ban was an important step in the right direction, but we  need to do more. That is why I sent the letter to President Trump, and  it is why, should earmarks return, I intend to challenge each one of  them on the Senate floor. Just as I did in my time in the House, I will  file amendments to force debate and force votes on these earmarks. That  way, Members can publicly defend their earmarks to the hard-working  taxpayers they represent.   As we look forward to the future, I have been encouraged by the  President's recognition of Washington's addiction to spending and his  administration's commitment to finally doing something about it. I look  forward to working with the administration to make the Federal  Government leaner, more transparent, and more accountable to the  taxpayers it serves.                            Border Adjustment Tax    Mr. President, I take the floor today to express my concern with the  border adjustment tax. The border adjustment tax is quickly becoming  the centerpiece of a planned overhaul of our tax and trade policies. I  am certain that I am not the only one hearing that this approach could  make everyday consumer products more expensive at the very places  middle-class families shop the most. From the aisles at big-box stores  to the checkout lines in grocery stores, household staples could be  pushed out of reach for those who can least afford it.   In addition, there are concerns that this new policy could disrupt  global supply chains and make it harder for our country's largest  private sector employers to grow and to do business.   There are those who suggest that the known downsides to the new tax  will be a wash because the U.S. dollar will be stronger; however,  others are not so comfortable gambling the purchasing power of the  average consumer on the unpredictability of international currency  markets.   At first glance, the plan seems simple enough: Tax companies in the  United States less and tax goods made overseas more. That seems simple.  According to supporters, this would boost our exports, incentivize  companies to locate operations here in the United States, and it would  reduce our trade deficit. Unfortunately, it turns out that is not so  easy. Looking inward, we simply do not produce everything we need here  in the United States. That is why we trade with other countries in the  first place. And for the things we do make here, those products often  require inputs from all over the world. In fact, whether it is raw  material or specialty parts, roughly 50 percent of our Nation's imports  consist of inputs for U.S. production and manufacturing. Let me say  that again. Roughly 50 percent of our Nation's imports consist of  inputs for U.S. production and manufacturing, many times for products  that are then shipped overseas.   Because of our trade deals with other nations, these inputs are  cheaper than they would be otherwise. Cheaper inputs mean lower  production costs for U.S.-based businesses, which in turn allows these  companies to expand production and to reduce prices.   What will happen if we place a 20-percent tax on all imports? Looking  beyond our borders, we should also consider the reaction such a tax is  sure to trigger amongst our trading partners. If the protectionist  trade policies of the past have taught us anything, it is that  countries tend to retaliate when they believe trade obligations have  been violated. When we increase barriers to trade, nobody wins.   Do I agree that we should work to make U.S. businesses more  competitive? Absolutely. Do I agree that we need to reform our Tax  Code? You bet. Tax reform and pro-growth trade policies have been at  the top of my list of priorities throughout my tenure in Congress.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to lower corporate and  individual tax rates, eliminate costly tax earmarks, and make our Tax  Code flatter, simpler, and more conducive to growth. There will always  be winners and losers in a robust debate on reforming the Tax Code. We  ought to make sure the middle class isn't in the losing column.   I yield back the remainder of my time.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
