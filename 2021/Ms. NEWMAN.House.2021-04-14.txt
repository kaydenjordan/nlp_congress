 Madam Speaker, I rise today, excitedly, on behalf of the  millions of small businesses across our Nation that are truly suffering  from the pandemic and struggling to keep their doors open because  support is simply not reaching them.   As a former small business owner, I know firsthand how loans can make  an absolutely life-changing difference for an entrepreneur.   However, the reality is that too many small businesses, especially  those led by women, or minorities, or those in rural communities, don't  have access to the primary lending programs offered by the Small  Business Administration or private sector.    Microloans are designed to help start-ups and new small businesses  that don't have banking relationships with access to larger capital.  But for too many businesses, these microloans have been unreachable.   That is why I am proud to co-lead the Microloan Improvement Act to  ensure that, regardless of background or location, every business has  equitable access to capital.   With this legislation, we are expanding the number of community-based  lenders eligible for the lowest interest rates on loans. That means  these lenders can offer lines of credit to more small businesses.   Now more than ever, we have an obligation to remove barriers that  prevent small businesses from receiving microloans. With this  legislation, we are cutting bureaucratic red tape that has restricted  growth and job creation.   From mom-and-pop shops, to family-owned stores, to every small  business, they will all benefit. That is why this legislation is  supported by Democrats and Republicans, and I am so glad to partner  today with my Republican colleagues. I am happy to work in a bipartisan  fashion to help our intermediaries provide assistance to our local  entrepreneurs.   Let's pass this legislation so we can support the smallest of the  small businesses in all of our communities.
