 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, everybody now in the Senate remembers  Senator Hatch. I want to tell you how he is still on the job, reminding  Americans of our traditions.   Recently, my friend from Utah, former Senator Orrin Hatch, wrote  about American academia and our so-called cancel culture. I encourage  all Americans to read his essay that was published in the Wall Street  Journal. Senator Hatch calls for a ``renewed commitment to intellectual  diversity'' and for a ``radical overhaul of campus culture.''   I agree with Senator Hatch.   Our institutions of higher learning need to wake up and welcome the  open exchange of ideas in the classrooms and across campuses, and if  that isn't what universities and colleges are for, I don't know what  they are for. Silencing or shaming students from sharing divergent  views is antithetical to the American way.   Our next generation of leaders deserves better. As colleges begin the  school year, they should focus on keeping their students safe from the  virus, but--and a big ``but''--they shouldn't worry one bit about  keeping students safe from the free exchange of ideas or prevent  professors from teaching different schools of thought. The herd  mentality limits intellectual curiosity, and that is bad for freedom,  particularly academic freedom.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
