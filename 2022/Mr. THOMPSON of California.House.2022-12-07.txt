 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of  thousands of California wildfire survivors.   Following the disastrous wildfires in 2015, 2017, and 2018, a court- ordered trust was established to compensate survivors for their loss of  property. These funds are nowhere near enough to fully compensate for  the loss of a home. Even worse, I have heard from countless  constituents concerned that the funds they receive from the trust will  be taxed.   That is why I, along with Congressman LaMalfa, introduced H.R. 7305,  to make clear that settlement proceeds like these are nontaxable.   This legislation is absolutely essential to wildfire survivors, many  of whom still cannot return to a home on their property.   The sad reality is that more natural disasters, including fires, will  happen in the future. It is critical that Congress pass this  legislation now.   This bill ensures Americans impacted by disasters do not owe unfair  taxes.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to include this legislation in any  omnibus or spending bill moving forward.                            ____________________
