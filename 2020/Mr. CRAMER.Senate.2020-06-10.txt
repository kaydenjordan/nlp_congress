 Mr. President, I want to recognize four talented  North Dakota students whose artwork will be on display in my State  offices this year.   They are the winners of the State of the Arts Awards in this year's  North Dakota Juried Student Art Show. Hosted by the Taube Museum of Art  in Minot, this year's contest had more than 300 entries from students  across North Dakota. The four State of the Arts awards are among 116  awards presented to our State's young artists in this competition.   The students whose art was selected for my offices are: Matthew  Upton, Artwork Title: ``Eagle,'' Grade 8, South Middle School, Grand  Forks; Ashlynn  [[Page S2875]]  Hartsell, Artwork Title: ``Heart Sunset,'' Grade 5, Washington  Elementary, Valley City; Sydney Nelson, Artwork Title: ``Welding in the  Fall,'' Grade 12, Valley City High School, Valley City, and Olivia  Dorsher, Artwork Title: ``Good Boring Days,'' Grade 11, Grand Forks  Central High School, Grand Forks.   I congratulate these students and thank them for sharing their  talents with my North Dakota constituents who will visit my State  offices this year. They are an inspiration to all of us who appreciate  the gift artists have for capturing the beauty all around us. I also  commend those who judge this annual competition and the teachers and  parents who have nurtured the emerging skills of these young North  Dakota artists.                            ____________________
