 Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration's proposal to  federally limit milk options to the unpopular fat-free and low-fat  types and prohibit students from drinking flavored milk only starts our  children off on the wrong foot.  [[Page H6947]]    Whole milk contains 3.25 percent fat, making it 96.75 percent fat- free as compared to the common 2 percent or 1 percent or skim that we  see. This is not an incredibly great amount of fat for what the  perception would be out there.   Whole milk is nutritious and simple. Whole milk doesn't contain any  more sugar or carbs than skim or low-fat milk, but it does contain  essential nutrients that children need to grow.   Mr. Speaker, 8 ounces of whole milk provides 8 grams of protein. That  is 16 percent of the daily recommended value. This high-quality protein  builds and repairs muscle, keeps us fuller longer, provides energy and  focus, and helps maintain bone health and a healthy weight while  supporting a healthy immune system.   An 8-ounce serving of milk, flavored or not, gives children the same  amount of calcium as 10 cups of spinach, the same amount of potassium  as in one small banana, the same amount of vitamin A as in three- quarters of a cup of broccoli, and the same amount of vitamin D as in  three-quarters of an ounce of cooked salmon. Parents of picky eaters  know how hard it is to convince their kids to eat that every day.   Whole milk is a good thing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Calvert, for  leading this appropriate time here today.   Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I come forward to be part  of this. It is also with optimism because I have known Kevin for 21  years, and he was always and is always the optimistic one in the room.  He always sees what we can do.   He always sees the vision for each of us as elected Representatives  and, more importantly, the country. He always thinks of the country. He  always thinks how we are going to better the institution, whether it  was in the California State Assembly as we were cutting our teeth in  politics there or here on this national and international stage.    Mr. Speaker, I am somber right now because what has happened really  is a waste, as my good friend and colleague, Mr. McClintock, mentioned.  There were only 269 days of what could have been a really great thing.   Kevin will be part of everything we do in a different form and in a  different venue because he still loves and cares about this country. He  still is a great friend to his colleagues, even though he exits this  area for a time.   I am grateful to him for his friendship. Anything I have ever asked,  he has always helped in his leadership role for me as a Member in  either one of the bodies, the State Assembly or here. He is always  optimistic and has a smile. He has a lot of funny stories to go with it  that I can't tell here.   He has always reached out to our families, making sure they are  included. He always thinks of everybody. He is an amazing talent and  will go far in leading his next enterprise, which is going to be based  on our values and making our country stronger yet again. We will get  there.   I am proud to call him a friend. I hope I can always have his  friendship, his guidance, and his playing a major role as we go forward  in saving and strengthening our great country.   Kevin McCarthy, I thank you for everything you have ever done for me,  and for all of us, as a friend. I am blessed to know you.   To Judy, Connor, and Meghan, the sacrifice has been big, but we are  always very grateful. My family understands that, as well. God bless  you.    Mr. Speaker, I know my colleague has been covering a lot  of very important subjects here. I know he is frequently in the area of  immigration and the invasion of our border, so I appreciate Mr.  Grothman's strong efforts on highlighting that so the American people  understand.   It really boils down to when we are looking at the border invasion  that we have quite a battle. I do not understand why the Biden White  House is simply sitting by watching it happen, even having personnel  propping the gates open to allow this to happen.   We do not understand fully who is coming in. It is not just people  from Mexico or even Central America. There is a lot of very dangerous  people coming across the border. They apprehend many people on the  known terrorist or mayhem list, at the very least, and I wonder whose  side are they on. Whose side is the administration on when they allow  this to happen? Whether it is the drugs coming across, the fentanyl,  the people who are setting up and going to be the potential terrorist  cells that are going to hit this country at some point, and we see all  these protests going on over Palestine.   Mr. Speaker, they are just waiting for the green light on this. It is  completely irresponsible and antithetical to the constitutional vows we  take what is going on with the Biden administration and their  nonenforcement of the border. Much work needs to be done.
