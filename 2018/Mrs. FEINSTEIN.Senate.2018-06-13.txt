 Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator  Reed's amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.   The Reed amendment would restore congressional oversight of the  development of new, low-yield nuclear weapons.   Since 1994, Congress has limited the Department of Energy's work on  low-yield weapons. We have done so for two reasons.   First, many of us believe the true purpose of low-yield nuclear  weapons is not to deter nuclear attack, but rather to fight unwinnable  nuclear wars. We are only fooling ourselves if we believe nuclear wars  can be won.   Second, we already have sufficient low-yield capabilities. They  include nuclear cruise missiles and the B-61 gravity bomb. In fact,  today, we are modernizing both.   We are developing the LRSO, a nuclear cruise missile, at a cost of  nearly $20 billion, and we are modernizing the B-61 gravity bomb at a  cost of $8 billion. That is nearly $30 billion toward new, low-yield  capabilities; yet some in this body would go further.   During the Senate Armed Services Committee's markup of the NDAA,  Senator Cotton offered an amendment to eliminate all existing  restrictions on the development of new, low-yield weapons. His  amendment, which passed on a party line vote, would allow the Secretary  of Energy to develop new weapons simply by requesting funding to do so.   That is an abdication of our constitutional responsibility to oversee  spending on the world's most dangerous weapons. I cannot support this  action and will oppose this NDAA if Senator Cotton's amendment is  retained.   It was not long ago that we debated this very issue. We would be wise  to recall what happened. In 2002, the Bush administration's Nuclear  Posture Review urged Congress to loosen congressional restrictions on  low-yield weapons. I worked with Senator Kennedy to stop those efforts.  With the help of Senator John Warner, we decided that we would allow  basic research, but advanced development of new low-yield nuclear  weapons would require congressional authorization. That position  carried the day by a vote of 96-0 here in the Senate.   Senator Reed's amendment before us today would preserve Congress's  existing role to oversee the development of new nuclear weapons.   I believe it is absolutely critical that we retain our authority, and  I urge my colleagues to support the Reed amendment.                              Amendment No. 2366
