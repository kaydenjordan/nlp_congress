 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 76.   Students defrauded by predatory, for-profit colleges can be left with  crushing debt, useless degrees, and none of the job opportunities they  were promised.   Secretary DeVos could provide immediate relief to students who were  defrauded. Instead, she has halted student loan relief and written a  new rule under which defrauded borrowers could be denied debt relief,  even when predatory colleges clearly violated the law.   Earlier this year, bipartisan majorities in the House and the Senate  voted together to reject that rule, but President Trump has vetoed our  legislation--yet another of his actions that will hurt students and  taxpayers.   More than 7,000 Pennsylvanians are suffering while their applications  for financial relief are sitting in limbo at the Department of  Education. If Congress does not override the President's veto, student  borrowers will be harmed, and predatory colleges will receive another  giveaway.   I am proud to stand with students and to vote to override the  President's veto of H.J. Res. 76.
