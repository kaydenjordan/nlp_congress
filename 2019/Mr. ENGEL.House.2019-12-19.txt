 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 5377, to begin  to repair some of the damage from the GPO's tax scam legislation which  passed this House 2 years ago.   I said it at the time, and I say it again: It is one of the worst  bills I have ever seen, and it blows a hole in the budget.   So much for fiscal responsibility on the other side of the aisle.   One of the more egregious provisions in that bill was capping State  and local tax deductions at $10,000. This deduction has been part of  our tax code for over 150 years.   This cap hurts my constituents, who often have property, income, and  sales taxes exceeding $10,000.   New Yorkers already pay more to the Federal Government as a donor  State than we receive back. We receive only 84 cents for every dollar  we send to Washington. This imbalance is greater than any other State  and grows because of the SALT cap. Homeowners are already seeing home  values decline because of the SALT cap.   Earlier in this year, I introduced H.R. 515, with 20 of my  colleagues, to repeal this harmful tax provision. I am pleased to see  my New York colleague Mr. Suozzi's measure containing much of my bill  here on the floor today.   In conclusion, let me say we need to reverse some of the harm the  GPO's tax scam bill has inflicted on so many Americans, especially my  New York constituents. Support H.R. 5377, and let's be fair once and  for all.                                time  1500
