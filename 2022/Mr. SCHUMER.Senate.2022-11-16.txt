 Madam President, today, the Senate has a chance to live  up to its highest ideals by taking up legislation that will protect the  rights of all Americans, regardless of who they choose to marry.   In many ways, the story of America has been a difficult but  inexorable march towards greater equality for all people. Throughout  our history, sometimes we have taken very important steps forward;  other times, unfortunately, we have taken steps backward. But today,  the Senate is taking a truly bold step forward in the march towards  greater justice, greater equality, by advancing the Respect for  Marriage Act.   It is a simple, narrowly tailored, but exceedingly important piece of  legislation that will do so much good for so many Americans. It will  make our country a better, fairer place to live.   Passing this bill is as personal as it gets for many of us in this  Chamber, myself included. My daughter and her wife, my daughter-in-law,  are expecting a baby next spring. I want to do everything possible to  make sure their rights are protected under Federal law. I want them and  everyone in a loving relationship to live without the fear that their  rights could one day be stripped away. There are many of us who are  deeply invested in seeing this bill succeed.   Originally, it was our intention to take action on the Respect for  Marriage Act back in September, fresh off the House's strong bipartisan  vote for the summer. Remember, 47 House Republicans joined Democrats to  pass this bill. But at the urging of my colleagues from both sides of  the aisle, I agreed to hold off on scheduling a vote in order to make  sure we had enough support to move forward. My job at the end of the  day will always be to prioritize getting things passed through this  Chamber, and marriage equality is too important an issue to risk  failure. So I made the choice to trust the Members who have worked so  hard on this legislation and wait a little bit longer in order to give  the bipartisan process a chance to play out. It is much better to pass  this legislation and move equality forward than simply have a showboat,  which would bring political reckoning, but no real change for the  American people.   I want to thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who have  led the charge in getting this bill ready for the floor and, hopefully,  soon onto the President's desk--including our two leaders on our side,  Senators Baldwin and Sinema, who have done a fabulous job and have  worked this bill so hard and so well and so consistently. I want to  thank Senators Portman and Tillis, and Collins on the other side who  are part of this bipartisan team. They managed this process  stupendously and I am optimistic their efforts will prove successful  later today.   To the rest of my colleagues and to all Americans who are watching  what the Senate does, this is a great chance to do something very  important for tens of millions of Americans. No one--no one--in a same- sex marriage should have to worry about whether or not their marriage  will be invalidated in the future. They deserve peace of mind knowing  their rights will always be protected under the law. With this bill, we  can take a significant and much-needed step in that direction.   The majority of Americans support us in this endeavor. They are  joined, not only by hundreds of major American companies who support  this bill, but also religious organizations who affirm that the Respect  for Marriage Act is a sound and a commonsense piece of legislation.   So if both parties can come together, today could be truly one of the  highlights of the year for this body. This has been an incredibly  productive year in Congress, full of many significant achievements, but  I think that passing the Respect for Marriage Act would be one of the  more significant accomplishments of the Senate to date.   Like so many other bills this year, it will be an unequivocal  bipartisan win. So I urge my colleagues: Think about those who you know  and love who are in a same-sex marriage, maybe it is your friends,  maybe it is your family, maybe it is someone on your staff. I hope with  them in your heart, you will support this bill.   There is every reason under the Sun to move forward and begin  debating this important legislation for the sake of ensuring equal  justice under law, for the sake of millions of married couples who want  to live their lives without discrimination, and for the sake of every  person out there, young and old alike who wonder if they, too, deserve  to be treated with fairness and dignity and basic decency.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote yes on moving forward with the  Respect for Marriage Act later today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, before the Senate finishes this evening,  there is one more important piece of legislation we are passing today,  which I want to tout: the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research  Expansion Act.   I have to give great credit to Senator Feinstein, Senator Grassley,  and Senator Schatz. They have championed this legislation and worked  hard to see that it has gotten support of all the Senators. It would  eliminate the redtape that hinders cannabis research, opening the door  for new, innovative treatments derived from cannabis.   Now, if you are one of the millions of Americans who deal with  conditions like Parkinson's or epilepsy or post-traumatic stress, or  any number of other conditions, cannabis might hold promising new  options for managing these diseases, but we need to do research first.  And the Federal government, sadly, has been woefully behind the times  on this front.   This bill will help fix that and, equally important, I hope that  after passing this bill, the Senate can make progress on other cannabis  legislation too. I am still holding productive talks with Democratic  and Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate on moving  additional bipartisan cannabis legislation in the lameduck, and we are  going to try very, very hard to get it done. It is not easy, but we are  making good progress. So I thank my colleagues for the excellent work  on this bill and hope it portends more good cannabis legislation to  come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a second matter, on rollcall No. 355,  I voted yea.
