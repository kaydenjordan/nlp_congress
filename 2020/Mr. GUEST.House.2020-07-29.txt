 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize retiring  Mississippi State University Dean of Libraries, Frances Coleman, for  her outstanding contributions to Mississippi's higher education and to  the Starkville community. Over the course of her career, Dean Coleman  championed unprecedented expansions of facilities, technologies, and  programming throughout the MSU library system. She was instrumental in  the transfer of the Ulysses S. Grant collection to Mississippi State's  Mitchell Memorial Library, which established the university as one of  only six campuses to hold a Presidential library.   Dean Coleman has received numerous recognitions for her service to  our State, including the G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery Excellence in  Leadership Award, and the lifetime achievement honor bestowed by the  Mississippi legislature.   In addition to her professional achievements, she is also active in  her community through the Rotary Club, the Starkville Chamber of  Commerce, and the Aldersgate United Methodist Church.   Please join me in recognizing Dean Frances Coleman for her  significant contributions to the great State of Mississippi.                            ____________________
