 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for  pulling this vital package together.   I speak as a father of four who is heartbroken and still processing  Uvalde, Buffalo, and the unending string of mass shootings; a longtime  gun reform advocate and a member of the Gun Violence Prevention Task  Force who demands real, commonsense gun reform to save lives now.   That is why I support the Protecting Our Kids Act in this moment of  profound grief and collective loss. When it comes to the epidemic of  gun deaths, there is no panacea. We must pass meaningful reforms,  evaluate our work, and then keep on passing more legislation.   Though I am extremely supportive of this long-overdue package, I am  concerned about criminal penalties for safe storage violations. Over- criminalization too often harms Black and Brown communities.   As a warrior for racial justice, I urge all of us to investigate how  disparate communities would be impacted before this bill heads to the  President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill.
