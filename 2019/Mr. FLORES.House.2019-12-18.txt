 Madam Speaker, on March 11 of this year, the Speaker of  the House said the following in an interview with The Washington Post:  ``Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's  something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think  we should go down that path, because it divides the country.''   I think most Americans would agree with that statement because it  sounds thoughtful and reasonable.   So here we are today to vote on the Articles of Impeachment.   How did the majority party do in meeting the objectives set forth by  the Speaker?   Here are the answers: First, the only compelling attribute about this  sham  [[Page H12170]]  is the lengths the majority has gone to appease the radical, Socialist  wing of their party.   Second, the only overwhelming feature about this sham is the abuse of  power by the majority and the reckless disregard for fairness by the  majority throughout this entire circus.   Finally, the only bipartisan activity related to this sham will be  the votes against these flimsy Articles of Impeachment.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing these  deplorable Articles of Impeachment and to demand that the House get  back to working on the priorities that hardworking American families  care about the most.
