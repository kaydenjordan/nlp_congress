 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this en bloc  package of amendments to H.R. 2740, which includes my simple amendment  that would prohibit funding for International Military Education and  Training (IMET) for Saudi Arabia--restating a prohibition included in  the FY 2019 funding bill.   As its name suggests, IMET assistance provides grants to foreign  military personnel to access training and education at U.S. military  facilities.   But this program is also a portal to a major discount on military  training that a foreign country purchases from the United States.   Traditionally, Saudi Arabia had received a nominal $10,000 in IMET  assistance annually--but that funding unlocked a discount for Riyadh,  enabling the Kingdom to save up to $30 million per year on its purchase  of defense services.   In the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder, rising civilian casualties  in Yemen, and increasing oppression of political dissent inside and  outside Saudi Arabia, provision of IMET assistance--and the significant  savings it unlocks--to Riyadh is no longer tenable.   The United States must take stock of our strategic interests and  reexamine our relationship with Saudi Arabia to ensure that U.S. policy  is rooted in American values, particularly respect for human rights.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to this bill and ensure  that we hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its gross violations of human  rights.
