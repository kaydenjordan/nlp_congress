 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, consent of the governed is the cornerstone of our  democracy. In America, the people are sovereign, and we govern through  the votes that we cast. At the very core of this process are fair and  free elections.   Every citizen should be free to express themselves and to vote, and  no citizen should ever be muzzled or have their legitimate vote  canceled out by a fraudulent one.                                time  1600    By definition, one side is always going to be disappointed with the  outcome. That is why it is essential that both sides are confident that  they were treated fairly.   Democracies die when one party seizes control of the elections  process, eliminates the safeguards that have protected the integrity of  the ballot, places restrictions on free speech, and seizes the earnings  of individual citizens to promote candidates that they may abhor.   That is precisely what this bill does today. It destroys the  bipartisan composition of the Federal Election Commission and places a  partisan majority in control of every aspect of our Federal elections.  It imposes limits on free speech, and that has earned the opposition of  the American Civil Liberties Union. It matches a contribution of $200  given to a candidate with $1,200 taken from others who may oppose that  candidate.   Worst of all, it undermines the integrity of the ballot and opens the  floodgates to fraud. The purpose of registration periods is to allow  parties to canvass the rolls and challenge improper registrations,  while ensuring candidates know exactly who is going to be voting.   The reason we require election day voting at a polling place is to  ensure voters cast their ballots in secret after they have heard the  entire debate and after verifying their identity to their neighbors.  This bill sweeps away these few remaining vestiges of ballot integrity.   Democracies die by suicide, and we are now face-to-face with such an  instrument.
