 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the bill,  and with great compassion for the women being lied to by the  deceptively named Women's Health Protection Act.   Madam Speaker, let's be clear, this bill is not about healthcare. It  is an extreme bill that would impose abortion on demand nationwide up  until birth and override commonsense pro-life laws at the State level,  laws like those intended to prevent abortion discrimination based upon  a child's sex or based on whether the child has Down syndrome, laws  that provide parental notification for minor girls, informed consent  for patients, and health and safety protections specific to abortion  facilities. All would be banned under this bill.    The bill before us would ban virtually all conscience protections for  medical personnel and enable the use of taxpayer money to fund abortion  procedures, violating sincerely held beliefs of millions of Americans  on the sanctity of human life.   The abortion on demand act ignores the humanity of the baby and the  health of the mother. It ignores the reality that life is sacred. It is  a precious, God-given gift that must be cherished and protected.   While it is comforting to know that God is loving, He is also just.  We destroy innocent life at our own peril. What God condemns, we must  not condone. May God heal our land.
