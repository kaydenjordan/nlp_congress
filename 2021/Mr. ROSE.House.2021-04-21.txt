 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to a critical  need for infrastructure for all of America, and especially in my home  State of Tennessee.   I believe it is past time that we build new transportation systems  and refurbish structures to accommodate our modern economy and our  growing workforce. I am a strong proponent of fixing our crumbling  roads and bridges and expanding access to broadband internet in  unserved areas.   In Tennessee, over half a million residents only have access to one  internet service provider, and 274,000 Tennesseans still have no access  at their place of residence. These are real infrastructure projects  that desperately need our attention.   Unfortunately, President Biden's most recent multitrillion-dollar  giveaway has little to do with actual infrastructure, with only 6  percent of this bill going to projects that fund roads, bridges, or  highways.   Even if we use the most expanded definition of infrastructure, which  might include upgrading wastewater and drinking water systems,  expanding high-speed broadband internet service to 100 percent of the  Nation, modernizing the electric grid, and improving infrastructure  resilience, infrastructure in this plan is only 24 percent of its total  cost.   President Biden is attempting to redefine infrastructure to include  all of the Democratic Party's pet projects and extreme priorities. In  this case, it means enacting Green New Deal-style programs  and implementing job-killing tax hikes on Americans and their  businesses.    Since this proposal has little to do with infrastructure and grossly  inflates the number of jobs it would actually create, we should call  this proposal what it really is, a con job.
