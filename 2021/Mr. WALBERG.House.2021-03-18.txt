 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the upcoming  retirement of a legend in Michigan broadcasting, Frank Beckmann.   For the past 48 years, Frank has been a pillar of the WJR airwaves.  Frank has been inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and  Michigan Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame, and he has a list of  professional accolades longer than the time we have today.   The Maize and Blue faithful know him as the voice of Michigan  football for over three decades. His weekly listeners, the best  informed in all of talk radio, know him as a clear and compelling  proponent of commonsense values. Nonprofits and charities across the  State know his generosity in using his microphone to support many  worthy causes. I am blessed to know him as a friend.   Congratulations, Frank, on a long and storied career.   I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Frank Beckmann a wonderful  retirement filled with family, lots of golf, and coolers full of fresh  Lake Erie walleye.                            ____________________
