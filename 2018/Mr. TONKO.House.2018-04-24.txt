 Mr. Speaker, last year, this Chamber rammed through a tax  cut for billionaires and wealthy corporations, paid for on the backs of  America's middle class. You don't hear them talk about it much anymore  though because it was a very bad deal.   This year, the President's budget includes $1.5 trillion in cuts to  Medicare, and Republicans want to eliminate Medicare and turn it into a  voucher. That is a bad deal.   The President's budget includes a $1.4 trillion cut to Medicaid. My  Republican colleagues have tried to cut Medicaid time and time again  with ACA repeals. Those are a bad deal.   Today, more than half of our seniors would live in poverty without  Social Security. They rely on Medicare and Medicaid to care for them in  their golden years--from doctors' visits to prescription drugs to  nursing homes. After all, seniors pay toward these programs through  their entire working life.   Democrats have plans to strengthen Social Security, strengthen  Medicare, and strengthen Medicaid. That is a better deal, and America  and her people deserve a better deal.                            ____________________
