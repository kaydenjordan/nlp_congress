 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  would like to begin by thanking Chairman Takano for his incredible  leadership on this legislation and tireless work on behalf of veterans  all across our country.   H.R. 3967, the Honoring our PACT Act of 2021, recognizes the full  range of military toxic exposure, from contaminated water at military  bases and airborne hazards from burn pits, to radiation from atomic  testing. It upholds and recognizes the promise we made to every  servicemember that we would care for them should they become wounded or  sick while risking everything to protect this country.   This legislation is long overdue, and it is the least we can do for  the more than 3.5 million veterans who are currently suffering without  the healthcare they need and deserve.   These veterans and their loved ones should never have been forced to  come to Congress demanding that we and the VA provide the care they  have so clearly earned, which is why I am glad that this bill ensures  that future veterans will be able to get the help they need without  waiting decades for help by streamlining the VA's toxic exposure  presumptions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill.
