 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I just left the  Supreme Court where people were chanting: liberate abortion everywhere.   Earlier today and right now the Supreme Court is hearing a case  challenging Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban. During oral arguments,  the State of Mississippi repeatedly asked the Court to overturn its own  long-held precedent for 58 years in Roe v. Wade.   Should that happen, more than 36 million people in 26 States would  immediately be deprived of the right to abortion overnight. These  restrictions mostly harm people of color, young people, and people of  low-income.   Earlier this year, in anticipation of this Court case, the House  passed the Women's Health Protection Act which would establish a  statutory right to abortion care across our country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues and the Senate to pass this  legislation immediately so that all people are free to make their own  decisions about their bodies. There is no democracy in this country if  women cannot make decisions about their own healthcare and their  bodies.                            ____________________
