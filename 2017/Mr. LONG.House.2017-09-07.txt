 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very straightforward. It  would  [[Page H7154]]  make clear that two laws enacted several decades ago to manage the  aftereffects of industrial toxic waste spills would not apply to  everyday emissions that are simply a way of life on family farms.   A court decision earlier this year overturned the EPA exemption for  agriculture from reporting requirements under the Superfund and  emergency planning and community right-to-know laws. This court  decision means that over 100,000 farmers and ranchers will be forced to  report odor emissions from livestock and poultry manure.   If farmers and ranchers don't submit these reports, they face  potential lawsuits from the government and any citizen who wishes to  sue them, subjecting them to penalties as high as $53,907 per day for  not filing paperwork. Farmers will lose time and money that would  otherwise be spent growing our Nation's food supply.   Mr. Chairman, I think that it is important that I note that the Obama  administration as well as the Bush administration defended this  exemption. This is not a partisan issue. This is simply a case of  reaffirming congressional intent under the law, as the EPA already  tried to do several years ago.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote in favor of my amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I say this is a nonpartisan issue, and I  would like to point out that the organization, National Association of  SARA Title III Program Officials, back in 2012, in an earlier version  of a similar amendment, had opposed this. Back on May 28 of this year,  they announced that they are no longer in opposition. So I don't really  think it is controversial at all.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
