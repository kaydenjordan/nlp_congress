 Mr. Speaker, as a mother myself, I rise today in support  of the Lactation Spaces for Veteran Moms Act, a bipartisan bill that  would ensure every medical facility managed by the Department of  Veterans Affairs contains a lactation space.   Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler joined me in introducing this  bill in 2021, and I thank her for her leadership on this issue. This is  an issue where Congress has worked together in a bipartisan manner, and  we know that more work like this needs to be done.   In 2019, the Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act was signed into  law. That legislation required public buildings containing public  restrooms to also provide a hygienic space, other than a restroom, for  mothers to express milk, not only for employees, but for members of the  public as well.   Today, there are 90 VA facilities across the country with designated  nursing rooms, but today these spaces are for employees of the VA only,  not veteran mothers as well.   The bipartisan Lactation Spaces for Veteran Moms Act expands access  to clean, safe, and convenient lactation spaces for all VA medical  facilities throughout the country for women who have served our Nation  and our military families.   My legislation requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure  that every medical facility managed by the VA contains a lactation  space which is a hygienic place, other than a restroom, is shielded  from view, is accessible to disabled individuals as well, contains a  chair and a working surface, and is available for use by female  veterans, employees of the Department, and members of the public.   Congress must do more to support our veteran mothers and the  Lactation Spaces for Veteran Moms Act will improve the quality of life  for many of the women who have served our Nation and our military  families, while they are accessing VA facilities.   I am grateful for the overwhelming support from my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle for this important issue, and I advise my colleagues  to advance this legislation favorably and ensure that the resources are  available for every woman who visits VA facilities.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the survivors of  military sexual trauma, or MST, who struggle to access the medical  care, mental health services, and the compensation that they deserve.   Sexual assault in the military continues to be a pervasive issue.  These assaults are often unreported and can culminate in post-traumatic  stress disorder, depression, and even suicide.   When a veteran has the courage to report the impact of that trauma to  the VA, it is essential that we treat these claims with the utmost  empathy, compassion, and concern.   For many veterans, submitting the claim means opening themselves up.  For those who have not filed a report while in the military, this is  the first opportunity for their experience to be acknowledged. And far  too often, MST survivors encounter bureaucratic processes when filing  their claims through the VA, which can be re-traumatizing, and further  delays access to critical healthcare and mental healthcare services.                                time  1245    My bill is one in a series of bills drafted to improve the veteran's  experience during the MST claims process. It would require the VA to  provide guidance to help veterans understand what mental health  resources and other supports are in place and available to support them  as they go through the claims process.   By ensuring veterans who file an MST-related claim are given  information on the Veterans Crisis Line, how to make appointments with  mental healthcare providers, and connect them with VHA MST  coordinators, we empower veterans to access the network of trauma- informed care that the VHA provides.   For veterans who already have access to the VHA system of care, my  bill would, with the veteran's consent, allow for relevant healthcare  providers  [[Page H5107]]  to be notified when a veteran in their care has filed an MST claim, has  an examination related to the MST claim, or been notified of a decision  or a determination. This notification can be especially helpful when a  claim has been denied or the decision is lower than the veteran feels  is warranted.   We must ensure that survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment  in the military are treated respectfully and receive proper care at all  stages of the process, including mental healthcare services.   It is especially critical in light of the August 2021 VA Office of  Inspector General report which showed that claims were still being  inappropriately denied. Thus, ``veteran survivors of military sexual  trauma remain at risk of not receiving the VA benefits to which they  are entitled and experiencing additional distress when claims are  improperly handled or denied.''   That is why I introduced the MST Claims Coordinator Act, to improve  communication and coordination in the claims process between the  Veterans Benefits Administration and the Veterans Health  Administration.   As a 20-year Navy veteran, I am proud to have worked with my  colleagues in a bipartisan fashion to introduce this legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to support its final passage.
