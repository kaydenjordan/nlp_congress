Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy  Vietnam Veterans Act of 2018, which was introduced by Representative  Valadao of California.   H.R. 299, as amended, would finally extend the presumption of  exposure to Agent Orange to blue water Navy veterans. I am grateful to  Mr. Valadao for introducing this long overdue bill, but I also thank my  colleagues on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for working with  us in a bipartisan manner to find an acceptable way to pay for this  bill.   As many of you know, Agent Orange was used in Vietnam to defoliate  areas in the jungle where enemy forces would come and ambush our  troops. Unfortunately, many Vietnam veterans have developed diseases as  a result of their exposure to Agent Orange.   Currently, VA only extends a presumption of exposure to Vietnam  veterans who actually set foot in Vietnam or served in the inland  waterways, or the brown water Navy, we call it. Blue water Navy  veterans who served offshore of Vietnam were excluded from the  presumption. VA denies these benefits because it claims there is not  enough scientific information to determine whether blue water Navy  veterans came into contact with herbicides in amounts meaningful to  cause disease.   Mr. Speaker, I have read the science, and, unfortunately, we will  never be able to prove whether blue water Navy veterans were harmed by  herbicides. But I have said this before and I will say it again: When  too many years have passed--over four decades, in this case--to  meaningfully determine the science, the presumption should be heavily  in favor of the veteran.   Moreover, I am pleased that the bill would help veterans who may have  been harmed by exposure to herbicides while serving areas outside the  Republic of Vietnam.   H.R. 299, as amended, incorporates a proposal authored by  Representative Tom MacArthur, which would extend the presumption to  veterans who served in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone beginning  on September 1, 1967, which is the month when the military began  testing herbicides in that area. The end date of the presumption period  would remain the same as it is now, which is August 31, 1971.   This legislation would also require VA to identify U.S. military  bases located in Thailand where Agent Orange was used and when it was  used.   Additionally, this bill includes a proposal authored by  Representative Westerman of Arkansas, which would require VA to provide  benefits for children who were born with spina bifida if one or both  parents may have been exposed to Agent Orange while serving in  Thailand, just as VA does for children with spina bifida if their  parents served in Vietnam or the Korean DMZ while Agent Orange was  used.   The manager's amendment makes some technical changes to ensure that  [[Page H5615]]  all Vietnam naval veterans who served within 12 miles offshore of  Vietnam during the war are eligible for the presumption. The manager's  amendment also makes technical changes to clarify the intent of this  bill, including ensuring surviving spouses are eligible for retroactive  benefits and authorizes VA to start paying benefits before the final  regulations are issued.   Additionally, H.R. 299, as amended, would include several  improvements to the VA's home loan program, introduced by several  Members, including changes to VA's home appraisal system, which was  introduced by Representative Arrington; and expansion of the conforming  loan limit, which would allow veterans to use their earned VA loan  benefits in more expensive areas, if they qualify. This provision was  introduced by Representative Zeldin.                                time  1645    Extension of the waiver of home loan funding fees to recipients of  the Purple Heart who are still serving on Active Duty was introduced by  Representative Herrera Beutler, and temporary increases to VA's home  loan funding fees for nondisabled veterans, to offset the cost of this  bill.   I want to thank all of our VSO partners for their support and for  helping us craft a bill that finally addresses the plight of blue water  Navy veterans. Specifically, I want to thank the Veterans of Foreign  Wars of the United States, the Disabled American Veterans, the American  Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Fleet Reserve Association,  the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the Paralyzed Veterans of  America, the Blue Water Vietnam Veteran Association, Military Veterans  Advocacy, and the Military Officers Association of America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 299, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the kind words from  my friend Mr. Takano. We worked together closely on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Valadao), the lead sponsor of this bill, who has doggedly pursued this.  This issue has been a problem for decades. Finally, tonight, on the  House side, we are going to come to a conclusion.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), vice chair of the committee and one of  the most ardent supporters of our Nation's veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen), one of the senior  members of our Veterans' Affairs Committee and an incredible support  for our Nation's heroes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), chairman of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee and a Vietnam veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), a former member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), an Air Force career  officer.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers and am  prepared to close, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. 299  from the 10 veterans service organizations I mentioned earlier.                                            Veterans of Foreign Wars                                            of The United States,                                       Kansas City, MO, May 7, 2018.      Hon. Johnny Isakson,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walz,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Isakson and Roe, Ranking Members Tester and       Walz: On behalf of the men and women of the Veterans of       Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) and its Auxiliary, we       are proud to offer our support for H.R.299, the Blue Water       Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2017, as amended, which would       expand benefits for veterans who were exposed to toxic       substances during their military service.        The VFW strongly agrees with the Court of Appeals for       Veterans Claims that it is arbitrary and capricious for       veterans who have served aboard ships in the coastal waters       of Vietnam to be denied presumptive benefits associated with       Agent Orange exposure. For this reason, we support this       legislation to end this injustice and ensure Blue Water Navy       veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve.        The VFW supports expansion of benefits for Korean DMZ       veterans who suffer from diseases and illnesses directly       linked to Agent Orange. While many of these veterans receive       presumptive disability compensation for their service-      connected disabilities, hundreds of them are unjustly       required to prove individual exposure. This legislation would       provide them the benefits they have been unjustly denied.        This legislation would also expand coverage for those       children suffering from spina bifida because of their       parents' exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Thailand       during the Vietnam War. This expansion makes equal the level       of benefits that other children receive if they have parents       who were exposed to Agent Orange.        The VFW also supports the reporting and outreach       requirements in this legislation. Research related to Gulf       War Illness is vital to ensuring veterans receive the care       and benefits they have earned as a result of illnesses and       injuries caused by their service. The outreach and reporting       components related to the Blue Water Navy portion of this       bill would ensure veterans receive the retroactive payments       they have earned and allow Congress to oversee proper       implementation of the legislation. We must never again allow       these veterans to have their earned benefits taken away.        Ensuring equality between the active, Guard, and Reserve       components of the military is a key goal of the VFW. For the       past decade and a half, our country has been sending National       Guardsmen and Reservists into harm's way at an unprecedented       level, and some of them have been wounded in the line of       duty. The VFW is pleased that H.R. 299, as amended, will end       arbitrary differences in home loan fees and show that service       in uniform earns equal opportunity to be a homeowner.        We applaud the efforts that you and your staff have made to       ensure veterans receive the benefits they have earned and       deserve. The VFW has been a longtime advocate for the       expansion of these benefits and we join you in celebrating       this legislative victory which equalizes benefits for those       who have worn our nation's uniform. We look forward to an       expeditious process that will lead to this legislation's       passage into law as soon as possible.            Sincerely,                                              Carlos U. Fuentes,                                                           Director,      VFW National Legislative Service.                                   ____                                       Military Officers Association                                                      of America,                                        Alexandria, VA, May 7, 2018.      Hon. Phil Roe,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Tim Walz,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: On behalf of the       over 350,000 members of the Military Officers Association of       America, I am writing to you about H.R. 299, the Blue Water       Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, and the ``discussion draft'' that       I understand will be introduced imminently. MOAA appreciates       the open dialogue you have both maintained in the process of       formulating this solution to a decades old injustice to our       Vietnam veterans.        MOAA has always supported restoring the presumption of       herbicide exposure to Blue Water Navy Veterans. MOAA further       supports the extension of the presumption to veterans who       served on the Korean DMZ from September 1, 1967, to August       31, 1971, as well as benefits to children born with spina       bifida of veterans who served in Thailand during the Vietnam       conflict.        I was disappointed with the understanding the ``pay for''       of this disability benefit was raising VA home loan fees.       This resource option places the financial burden solely on       that 1% of the U.S. population who served their nation in       time of conflict and relieves the remaining 99% of our       nation's population of bearing any financial responsibility       or liability. In short, those who sacrificed will continue to       sacrifice and subsidize a solution to resolve the toxic       exposure of veterans who provided our nation's security and       defense.        I am, however, grateful that you have included a provision       that MOAA proposed to use a portion of these funds towards a       report on a follow-up study on certain Gulf War illnesses. I       also sincerely appreciate your commitment to address       additional toxic exposures impacting our veterans in the       upcoming terms of Congress. For those reasons, MOAA supports       H.R. 299 with the proposed amendments discussed above.            Sincerely,                                          Lt Gen Dana T. Atkins,                                                         USAF (Ret),      President and CEO.                                   ____                                      Vietnam Veterans of America,                                  Silver Spring, MD, April 20, 2018.      Hon. Phil Roe,      Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walz,      Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Dr. Roe and Congressman Walz: On behalf of the       members, officers, and Board of Directors of Vietnam Veterans       of America, we are writing to you to again voice our support       for H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act. This       legislation would restore presumptive coverage for service-      connected ills that afflict several thousand naval personnel       who served in the Vietnam theatre of operations--coverage       that the Department of Veterans Affairs abruptly ended in       March 2002.        During the Vietnam War, some 20 million gallons of ``Agent       Orange'' and other toxic substances was sprayed to remove       jungle foliage around fire bases and to deny the enemy the       ability to grow or harvest crops. As you know, toxic       chemicals in these herbicides have been linked to several       afflictions, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, various       cancers, Type II diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. The Agent       Orange Act of 1991 empowered the VA Secretary to declare       certain illnesses presumptive to exposure to Agent Orange,       enabling veterans who served in Southeast Asia to receive       health care and disability compensation for these       afflictions. In March 2002, however, the VA ceased awarding       benefits to so-called blue water veterans, limiting those       eligible only to ``boots on the ground'' in-country vets.       There was no scientific basis for this move by the VA, nor       any involvement of real scientists in this money driven       bureaucratic decision. It is time that this wrong done to       Blue Water veterans of Vietnam, and their families be set       right. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) firmly established the       biological plausibility for the exposure of these faithfully       serving sailors.        The addition of those who served on the DMZ in Korea at any       time corrects another injustice of the VA bureaucratic       decision-making that also had no basis in fact. After the       spraying of the herbicides in heavy doses along this limited       area, nothing was ever done to clean up the soil or the       groundwater, so that all who served later were exposed, and       therefore should be eligible for benefits and health care as       well.        Blue water veterans suffering with any of the presumptive       service-connected maladies that the VA acknowledges to be       associated with exposure to Agent Orange ought not be       excluded from receiving healthcare services and disability       compensation for which their boots-on-the-ground brother and       sister veterans are eligible. They, too, served honorably and       well, and Congressman Valadao's bill, once it is enacted into       law, will accord them benefits that they have earned.        All of us at Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) are grateful       for your bipartisan leadership to find an offset, and to at       last correct the injustice to these veterans and their       families.            Respectfully,                                                        John Rowan,      National President/CEO.                                   ____                                    Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                     Washington, DC, April 20, 2018.      Hon. Phil Roe,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Roe: On behalf of Paralyzed Veterans of       America (PVA), I am writing to express our support for the       House Veterans' Affairs Committee's efforts to amend title       38, United States Code to extend presumption of exposures to       herbicides containing dioxin, including Agent Orange, to       veterans who served in ``blue water'' areas.        Before 1997, Vietnam Veterans were eligible for a       presumption of exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides       if ``during active military, naval or air service they had       served in the Republic of Vietnam'' unless there was evidence       they had not been exposed to Agent Orange. This policy was       later amended so that service on the ground in Vietnam and       service in inland waterways ``brown water'' was required to       receive a presumption of exposure.        PVA applauds you for making the necessary amendments to       include veterans who had served in ``blue water'' areas.            Respectfully,                                                        Carl Blake,                                                Executive Director.

Dear Chairman Roe: On behalf of the Military Order of the       Purple Heart (MOPH), whose membership is comprised entirely       of combat wounded veterans, I am pleased to offer our support       for your draft legislation to extend presumptive service       connection for diseases associated with exposure to Agent       Orange to Vietnam veterans of the Blue Water Navy, and       veterans who served m the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ)       from September 1, 1967 to August 31, 1971.        Under the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Congress established       presumptive service connection for Vietnam veterans suffering       from illnesses associated with exposure to herbicides. Since       2002, however, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has       chosen to interpret that law to exclude veterans who served       on ships off the coast of Vietnam, commonly known as Blue       Water Navy veterans. Like you, MOPH recognizes that Blue       Water Navy veterans have always suffered from illnesses       associated with Agent Orange exposure at high rates, and this       decision by VA represents an injustice that should be       corrected immediately.        MOPH also supports the provision of your bill that would       extend the same presumptive service connection to veterans       who served on the Korean DMZ from September 1, 1967 to August       31, 1971, as they were similarly exposed to Agent Orange       while performing their duties.        MOPH thanks you for your leadership on this issue, and your       continued commitment to veterans and their families. We look       forward to working with you to ensure the passage of this       important legislation.            Respectfully,                                                      Neil Van Ess,      National Commander.                                   ____                                Military--Veterans Advocacy, Inc.,                                 Slidell, Louisiana, April 20, 2018.      Re Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act.       Hon. Phil Roe,      Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, Military--Veterans Advocacy       has consistently supported legislation to correct the plight       of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans. In 2002. the VA       Secretary implemented a policy that divested these veterans       of the presumption of Agent Orange exposure. H.R. 299 is the       current version of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act       which will partially restore this presumption. This bill is       widely supported by the veterans community and has 329 co-      sponsors in the House.        I appreciate the fact that you held a Legislative Hearing       on the bill in April of 2017 and attempted a mark-up this       past November. I also understand the constraints of the Pay       As You Go Act of 2010 which requires an offset Military--      Veterans Advocacy's position is that we will support any       offset required to correct this injustice. I know that your       Committee staff has been working tirelessly to craft an       offset acceptable to all parties and I assure you that we       appreciate and thank them and you for this hard work.        Our understanding is that H.R. 299 will be scheduled for       another mark-up hearing on April 26th. Please feel free to       represent to the Committee that the bill, and its discussion       draft, have the complete support of Military--Veterans       Advocacy and the veterans we represent. I have been informed       of the planned offset and I believe it is an equitable avenue       for financing this bill.        It is imperative that H.R. 299 become law. Blue Water Navy       veterans are dying every day, often leaving their families       destitute. This bill has been pending for seven years and we       must restore the presumption to those who served in       Vietnamese bays. harbors and territorial seas.        Again thank you for your effort on our behalf and I look       forward to working with you on other toxic exposure issues in       the future.            Sincerely,                                                  John B. Wells,                                            Commander USN (Retired),      Executive Director.                                   ____                                             DAV, National Service &                                        Legislative Headquarters,                                     Washington, DC, April 20, 2018.      Hon. Dr. Phil Roe,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans Affairs, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Roe: On behalf of DAV and our more than one       million members, all of whom were injured or made ill during       wartime service, I write to offer our support for approving       legislation that would provide a presumption of service       connection for ``Blue Water'' Navy veterans who served in the       vicinity of the Republic of Vietnam as well as veterans       exposed to Agent Orange near the Korean demilitarized zone       (DMZ).        The Agent Orange Act of 1991 required the Department of       Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide presumptive service       connection to Vietnam veterans with illnesses that the       National Academy of Sciences directly linked to Agent Orange       exposure. Yet, in 2002, the VA decided to cover only veterans       who could prove that they had ``boots on the ground'' during       the Vietnam War. Because of this decision, thousands of       Vietnam veterans were excluded from receiving benefits       although these ``Blue Water'' Navy veterans had significant       Agent Orange exposure from drinking and bathing in       contaminated water just offshore. It is simply inequitable       that veterans who served on ships no more distant from the       spraying of herbicides than many who served on land have been       arbitrarily and unjustly denied benefits because they are       excluded from the presumption of service connection for       herbicide-related disabilities.        DAV strongly supports Section 1 (Clarification of       Presumptions of Exposure for Veterans Who Served in Vicinity       of Republic of Vietnam) of the discussion draft dated April       16, 2018, based on DAV Resolution No. 18, which calls for       legislation to expressly provide that the phrase ``served in       the Republic of Vietnam'' include service in the territorial       waters offshore.        Enactment of this legislation would provide ``Blue Water''       Navy Vietnam veterans the disability and health care benefits       they earned as a result of exposure to Agent Orange.       Eligibility for VA benefits under this legislation would be       retroactive to September 25, 1985, the date VA began       providing disability compensation to veterans with medical       disorders related to Agent Orange providing long overdue       justice to thousands of veterans who were excluded by the VA       in 2002.        In accordance with DAV Resolution No. 25, we also support       Section 2 of this discussion draft, to recognize September 1,       1967 as the earliest date for exposure to herbicides on the       Korean DMZ. This change will provide veterans greater equity       with respect to herbicide exposure and the presumptive       diseases associated therein.        Currently, VA regulations provide that any veteran who,       during active military, naval, or air service, served between       April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, in a unit that, as       determined by the Department of Defense, operated in or near       the Korean DMZ in an area in which herbicides are known to       have been applied during that period, shall be presumed to       have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent.       Section 2 would define the exposure to herbicides as a       veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service,       served in or near the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ), during       the period beginning on September 1, 1967, and ending on       August 31, 1971.        DAV does not have a resolution specific to Section 3 (Loans       Guaranteed Under Home Loan Programs of Department of Veterans       Affairs) or Section 4 (Information Gathering for Department       of Veterans Affairs Home Loan Appraisals) and takes no       position on these sections.        Chairman Roe, thank you for introducing and moving this       important legislation and for your continued efforts to       support our nation's veterans disabled in their service.            Respectfully,                                             Garry J. Augustine,                                                 Executive Director,      Washington Headquarters.                                   ____                                             Blue Water Navy Vietnam                                            Veterans Association,                                                     April 20, 2018.      Dr. Phil Roe,      Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe: On behalf of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam       Veterans Association (BWN), we plead with the United States       Congress to allow the proposed pay for to be used in       supporting the passage of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam       Veterans Act of 2017, which is the sole purpose of our       existence as an Association. This has been our top priority,       and we have worked hard to ensure that our Navy Veterans and       Shipmates receive the benefits that they rightly deserve for       their sacrifices to our nation.        Veteran and Military Service Organizations across this       country should be running to the opportunity to stand for us,       considering we have stood for them for more than 50 years.       While we were proud to stand with them when the original       Agent Orange Act was passed in 1991, in 2002 when our       benefits were stripped from us, we had to go on a 16-year       campaign to get many of them to be on our side again.        The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has failed our       nation's Veterans on this issue, and it is now up to Congress       to provide the requisite medical coverage by passing this       legislation. If there is every any doubt why a group of       service members are all coming down with, and dying from the       same illnesses, then the Department of Veterans Affairs       should have a duty to assist them regardless of the cost.       Many of our Shipmates have died waiting for the day their       benefits would be restored, and so have their widows. As we       approach the final passage of this legislation on Memorial       Day, we send our thoughts and prayers to our fallen Shipmates       and their loved ones!        We ask that you strongly encourage your colleagues to vote       for this legislation once it is brought to the floor for a       vote. We applaud you and your staff who are actively fighting       for a group of Veterans that has long been abandoned by the       VA and deprived of much needed medical care, we can't thank       these saintly people enough.        Thank you for taking an active role in such an important       issue to the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans community by       working to improve the lives of our remaining 90,000 Sailors       who served our great nation.            Very Respectfully,      Mike Yates,        National Commander.      Michael J. Little,  [[Page H5620]]         National Executive Director.                                   ____                                        Fleet Reserve Association,                                                     April 19, 2018.      Hon. Phil Roe,      Chairman, House Veterans Affairs Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe: The Fleet Reserve Association (FRA)       supports the ``Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act'' (H.R.       299) that would clarify a presumption for filing disability       claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for       ailments associated with exposure to the Agent Orange       herbicide during the Vietnam War. FRA believes Congress       should recognize that so-called ``Blue water'' veterans were       exposed to Agent Orange herbicide and authorize presumptive       status for VA disability claims associated with this       exposure.        We understand that the bill will be amended to provide for       a fee on VA home loan mortgages to cover the estimated cost       for providing the presumption for the ``Blue Water''       veterans, and this fee will not apply to any veteran with a       disability rating.        The Association appreciates your strong leadership on this       issue. FRA stands ready to provide assistance in advancing       this legislation.            Sincerely.                                                    Thomas J. Snee,      National Executive Director.                                   ____                                              The American Legion,                                                      June 22, 2018.      Hon. David Valadao,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Valadao: On behalf of the 2 million       members of The American Legion, we heartily support the       provisions of H.R. 299, legislation to amend title 38, United       States Code, to clarify presumptions relating to the exposure       of certain veterans who served in the vicinity of the       Republic of Vietnam, and for other purposes.        This legislation, as written, includes as part of the       Republic of Vietnam its territorial seas for purposes of the       presumption of service connection for diseases associated       with exposure by veterans to certain herbicide agents while       in Vietnam. It also includes American servicemen who served       in the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ) between September 1,       1967 and August 31, 1971.        The American Legion strongly supports legislation to expand       the presumption of Agent Orange exposure to any military       personnel who served on any vessel during the Vietnam War       that came within 12 nautical miles of the coastlines of       Vietnam, as well as in the Korean DMZ between 1967 and 1971.       Our organization feels that our nation's defenders should       receive the full benefits to which they are entitled.        Through Resolution No. 35, Agent Orange, passed at the 2016       National Convention, The American Legion supports legislation       ``to amend title 38, United States Code, section 1116, to       provide entitlement to these presumptions for those veterans       who were exposed to Agent Orange while serving in areas other       than the Republic of Vietnam where Agent Orange was tested,       sprayed, or stored.''        Thank you again for your continued commitment to the men       and women in uniform and the nation's veterans and for your       leadership on this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                      Denise Rohan,                           National Commander, The American Legion.     Mr. Speaker, the VA estimates that there are  6.6 million living Vietnam-era veterans; there are 58,220 who died in  that war; and there only will be about 4.4 million remaining in just 10  short years. That means we will lose 2.2 million Vietnam-era veterans  in the next 10 years, which is an average of about 523 Vietnam-era  veterans per day.   We must now act because, if we don't, blue water Navy veterans may  not be around to receive the benefits they and their loved ones have  been waiting on for so long. We owe it to the brave men and women  veterans who served offshore during the Vietnam era to cease waiting on  perfect science and provide compensation benefits for conditions they  may have developed because of exposure to Agent Orange.   I am not the only one who believes this. H.R. 299 has broad  bipartisan support: 330 cosponsors. I think I can speak for all of us  when I say that H.R. 299, as amended, does the right thing for our blue  water Navy veterans.   Mr. Speaker, this is personal for our Vietnam-era veterans like  myself. I served and walked the territory not long after in Korea, over  40 years ago.   We have done great work on the committee: We passed an accountability  bill this year, a way to speed up disability claims. The Forever GI  Bill funded the Veterans Choice Program. We just passed the VA MISSION  Act, just a few of the things that our committee in a bipartisan way,  has done.   But there is a little inconvenience out there that we have 90,000  blue water Navy veterans who are being left behind--not after today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the other side of the aisle. We worked hand in  hand.   And I thank the staffs--I don't think they get enough credit--for the  hard work that the staffs do behind the scenes. When we seem to find a  blind alley and can't get to a conclusion, they continue to work in a  bipartisan way to find a way to get to yes.   I also thank all of the outside groups that kept this issue in front  of us for decades.   When I got the chairmanship a year and a half ago, I said one of the  things that I will base my chairmanship on is if we can get this solved  and do the right thing for our blue water Navy veterans. Today, we are  going to do the right thing in this House and send it to the Senate,  where they will do the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 299,  as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
