 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Emanuel Cleaver for yielding, and  I thank my subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Hill, for a very good  characterization of the project we are undertaking here.   I will emphasize two things.   Number one, at a moment when we are working hard to find ways to work  in a bipartisan fashion in the public interest, this is landmark  legislation. As Mr. Hill pointed out, we passed it in the last Congress  with a vote of 410-13, and that was the result of a very comprehensive  and fairly technical negotiation around the fine points of insider  trading.   The second thing I would point out is that everyone in this Chamber  should agree that law is to be made in this Chamber, not in the  chambers of unelected judges throughout the land. While Mr. Hill is  correct that there has been a vast body of court-made law around  insider trading developed over the generations, that is far from ideal  and, frankly, an abrogation of the legislative responsibilities of the  United States Congress. So, we are where we are.   We have attempted to make clear and clear up a great deal of the  uncertainty, the reversed convictions, the activities in the Second  Circuit that have overturned convictions and created uncertainty in the  law. This is an effort to make clear what I think everyone understands,  which is that if you trade on information that you know to have been  wrongly obtained or that you wrongly obtained or that you recklessly  disregard was wrongly obtained, you are doing something wrong. In this  case, with the passage of this legislation, it will be clear that you  have violated the law.   I am excited for the passage of this legislation because I am a  believer that it is, in fact, the elected legislators of this country  and not the judges, as important as their role may be, who should  determine what we consider wrong in statute and what we punish people  for doing.   Finally, of course, it is essential that everyone out there have  confidence in our markets. Every time there is another headline about  an insider trader or a reversed conviction of insider trading, that  confidence is damaged. So, I applaud the bringing of this bill to the  floor.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I must say, as much respect as I have for Mr.  Huizenga--I have been around here a little while--I think this may be  the first time I have heard from my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle that the regulators deserve deference on this, that the  regulators are not asking us to make a statutory change. I have never  heard that in this Chamber--this Chamber--which, under Article I of the  Constitution, is charged with writing the laws of this country.   Apparently, my Republican friends, who don't typically defer to  regulators, are now saying the SEC is, at best, neutral on this law.   Is there damage?   I would urge anybody who wants to know about that to read the  activities of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in the overturning of  conviction after conviction of hedge fund managers and others around  points of technical complexity.   We make the laws. We don't ask the regulators whether they would like  us to, or whether they would cheer us on in making laws. We make the  laws. If we are going to send people to jail, if we are going to stop  the confusion of judge-made law, let's do our job and pass this  legislation.
