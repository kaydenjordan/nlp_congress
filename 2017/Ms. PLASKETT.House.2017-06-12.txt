 Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today  to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour.   I would like to acknowledge the great work and the leadership of our  chair, Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, and, of course, my coanchor, Marc  Veasey of Texas, as we lead the discussion for the next 60 minutes.   In these next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the  American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional  Black Caucus, Congress, and the constituents that we represent.   In this hour, we would like to discuss racism and discrimination in  America and, specifically, hate crimes and the radicalization and the  domestic terrorism that they present to the American people.   The conclusion of Dylann Roof's trial a few month's ago is the latest  reminder that homegrown terrorism has become part of the fabric of life  in America. This problem shows no signs of fading yet reveals a threat  that is both rare and more complex than simple explanation suggests.   Solving the issue of domestic terrorism through hate crimes involves  understanding the true nature of the problem--violent domestic  extremism--so that effective steps can be taken to protect the Nation  from it.   It is legitimate to ask whether homegrown terrorists are being  radicalized. We talk about jihadi narratives and Islamic extremism, the  Islamic State group recruiting online; but there are other groups in  this Nation which are radicalizing our youth, radicalizing young people  to be a threat against other Americans. This is a subject and a  discussion that has rarely been discussed and which we believe is very  important.   Since 2001, almost 40 percent of the nearly 150 terrorism fatalities  in the United States were related to domestic motivations, not jihadi  narratives. It is my hope that in the discussion we will have this hour  we are able to discuss in depth the effect that these hate crimes and  this domestic violence has on the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that was written June  7, 2017, by the Congressional Black Caucus to the Honorable Jeff  Sessions, Attorney General; Andrew McCabe, Acting Director of the FBI;  and John Kelly, Secretary of Homeland Security, in which we express our  concern over the alarming number of hate crimes reported across the  country, particularly in the wake of the election of President Donald  J. Trump.                                                       Congressional                                                    Black Caucus,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2017.      Hon. Jeff Sessions,      Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.      Andrew McCabe,      Acting Director, Federal Bureau of Investigations,           Washington, DC.      Hon. John Kelly,      Secretary of Homeland Security, Department of Homeland           Security, Washington, DC.        Dear Attorney General Sessions and Acting Director McCabe:       I write today to express my concern over the alarming number       of hate crimes reported across the country, particularly in       the wake of the election of President Donald J. Trump. In       addition to speaking out against this rising tide of hate,       violence, and intolerance, it is critical that your agencies       proactively investigate each and every incident of a       potential hate crime and aggressively prosecute these cases       to the fullest extent of the law.        During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald       Trump employed starkly divisive rhetoric to connect with a       segment of his base that relished in cultural grievance and       hatred. His tone and the arguments that he made were       incredibly offensive to minority communities, and his       campaign rallies were forums for some of the ugliest public       displays of race-based violence and animus in modern       political times. Numerous Black Americans were assaulted at       his rallies and scenes of deep racial resentment against       Blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, and Muslims were frequently       paraded and celebrated.        Since the election, it seems hate-filled individuals have       been emboldened to terrorize minority communities. In just       the first 34 days after the election, the Southern Poverty       Law Center counted a total of 1,094 bias incidents around the       nation. Disturbingly, the Center also calculated that 37       percent of these cases directly referenced either President-      elect Trump, his campaign slogans, or his infamous remarks       about sexual assault. This data is just from the immediate       aftermath of the election. The numbers have increased since       then, with national news providing coverage. These are not       isolated incidents, but rather a frightening trend forming       before our eyes.        In fact, this is occurring in Congress' own back yard, like       the horrific hate crime that took place just a few miles away       at the University of Maryland when Richard Collins III, a       promising young man, was stabbed to death on the eve of his       graduation from Bowie State University by an admitted white       supremacist. There have also been several reports of nooses       hung throughout the District of Columbia, including in the       African American Museum of History and Culture and on       American University's campus. To add insult to injury, a       Mississippi lawmaker recently called for Louisiana       politicians to be ``lynched'' for supporting the removal of       racist confederate monuments from New Orleans.        Surely there is no greater cause of a government than to       protect the lives of its citizens, particularly those       uniquely vulnerable to hate, intolerance, and violence. The       federal hate crimes statutes were designed with that mission       in mind and serve as a critically important tool in       combatting the most insidious elements of our society. That       is why I implore you to dedicate additional resources within       your respective agencies to address the increasing frequency       of these deplorable acts. you should and must investigate       each and every potential hate crime and prosecute offenders       to the fullest extent allowed under the law. You should also       ensure that community leaders, including state and local law       enforcement, understand the federal resources available to       investigate and prosecute hate crimes.        Your leadership is required to not only bring justice to       the victims of hate crimes, but also to send a clear message       that these acts of domestic terrorism will never be tolerated       in this country.            Sincerely,                                                   Cedric Richmond,                                 Chair, Congressional Black Caucus.     In addition to speaking out against the rising tide of  hate, violence, and intolerance in this country, it is critical that  those agencies--the FBI, the Department of Justice, as well as Homeland  Security--speak out and proactively investigate each and every incident  of potential hate crime and aggressively prosecute these cases to the  fullest extent of the law.   Since the election, it seems that hate-filled individuals have been  emboldened to terrorize minority communities. In just the first 34 days  after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted a total of  1,094 bias incidents around the Nation. Disturbingly, the center also  calculated that 37 percent of these cases directly referenced either  President-elect Trump at the time, his campaign slogans, or infamous  remarks about sexual assault. This data is just from the immediate  aftermath of the election. The numbers have increased since then.   It is the responsibility of this Congress as well as those agencies  to stem this flow of violence that is occurring in this Nation. We know  that our President would not tolerate these sorts of matters, and we  are hopeful that he, the Justice Department, the FBI, and Homeland  Security will do whatever is necessary to protect American lives from  hate crimes that are occurring, domestic terrorism, and the  radicalization of our young people to exert hate against other  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), my  coanchor, to speak on this issue. Then we will have an opportunity to  hear from other members of the Congressional Black Caucus about this.    Congressman Veasey, I think it is important, one of the  things you talked about is what is going on in our homes and the fact  that our children can be radicalized outside of the home. This is an  opportunity for us as Americans to see the victimization even of those  children who become a part of the alt-right, who become a part of neo- Nazi groups; that they are, in fact, being radicalized by these very  disturbing groups, and that we, as leaders in America, have a  responsibility.   That is why I am asking unanimous consent to have the letter that was  written by Chairman Cedric Richmond put into the Record--the letter of  June 7 that went to the FBI, to Homeland Security, as well as to the  Justice Department to ask them to investigate and take proactive  stances; not just to protect those individuals who are victimized when  violence occurs, but to protect those young people and others who may  be untowardly influenced by social media to become part of these  groups.   I think that is a great point that you bring up, as well as our  President becoming someone who can lead the charge against this. We see  the rise of this activity during his campaign and after his election.  Well, then our President needs to be the one to be Presidential and to  stem this influence and this rise of hate crimes that are taking place.   Mr. Speaker, at this time I am asking that our colleague, Donald  Payne, from the great State of New Jersey, who has done an amazing  amount of work in his own community in the area of Newark in trying to  stem violence and criminal justice, the reform work that he is doing,  to speak on this matter this evening. I thank him so much for the time  that he is giving us. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Payne).    Thank you so much, Mr. Payne, for your words, your  enlightenment, and for sharing that very personal piece of you and your  own experience. There are so many African Americans and so many people  of color in this country who have those exact same experiences.   Whether it is us, personally--I know I have mine exactly like that.  You know, I have four sons, and each one of them have had that kind of  experience here in this country.   With the rise of hate that is occurring, we have to be careful for  every American and we need to be concerned that this country is no  longer becoming a safe place for groups of individuals; that there are  people that are rising up and attempting to terrorize other Americans.  This should be of concern to Congress. This should be of concern to our  President.   I thank Mr. Payne again for that.   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee  from Texas, who sits not only on the Budget Committee, but, very  relevant to our discussion this evening, is one of the senior members  of the Judiciary Committee, as well as Homeland Security Subcommittee,  where so many of these issues form a confluence.   Thank you so much for being with us this evening, Congresswoman  Jackson Lee. We look forward to your remarks and to the enlightenment  that you will be giving us here in this Chamber as well as the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for her  leadership on issues related to the Judiciary Committee and to others.   At this time, I would like to invite the Congressman, not just from  New York, but from, of course, what I believe is the best, most  illustrious borough in New York City--Brooklyn, of course, which is  where I was born and raised.   Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries, for your leadership on the  Judiciary Committee, your discussions about the issues that we are  discussing here this evening, and I am waiting to hear what you are  going to not only present to us here in this Chamber but to the  American people on this issue.   I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    I thank Congressman Jeffries and I really appreciate  his remarks. I know that this House has rules and is concerned about  decorum in here. We at the Congressional Black Caucus are also very  concerned about decorum. While we uphold the position of the President  of the United States, many individuals--particularly constituents, the  underserved within our communities--are fearful about us actually  speaking out, specifically to the personage and to the person of  President Donald Trump.   What we are trying to do in this Special Order is speak unrefutable  facts; not about the personality, not subjective discussion about the  President, not our feelings, and not our fears, but the actual facts of  what has happened in this country and what is happening in this country  because that is life for our children, that is the very essence of us  continuing, and that is what democracy is about.   If we cannot critique the actions of our President, then that is very  fearful  [[Page H4843]]  to us as Americans and very fearful to this House, which is supposed to  be a separate branch of government and which I recall maybe a year ago  it speaking very vehemently against the person who was in the White  House at that time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson  Coleman), who is my classmate. I thank Congresswoman Watson Coleman for  her work, particularly in working with other Congressional Black Caucus  women to found the Caucus for Black Women and Girls, which is very  important right now because this is a forgotten group quite often here  in the United States, and the gentlewoman is advocating and speaking  out for those individuals.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for her  inspiring words and motivation to us all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).  We always bring up the fact that Congressman Dwight Evans is a  freshman, but he isn't really a freshman. Everybody acknowledges his  leadership in his work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the State  house that transcends him as a freshman. We call the gentleman a  superfreshman in that respect because he comes with a great deal of  experience and wisdom here to the House floor. I am very anxious to  hear what the gentleman has to speak about related to hate crimes and  the rise of domestic terrorism against people of color and against  minorities here in this country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his  remarks and continued work to discuss middle communities, middle  neighborhoods, and the importance of these communities and how they  need to be protected.   Congressman Veasey, we have had a discussion here this evening about  so much of the rise in hate crimes and the rise of racial tensions. I  know that this weekend Puerto Rico had its plebiscite in which they  talked about becoming a State.   One of the things that I often talk to people about is the Virgin  Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto  Rico, all of us are territories now after 100 years.   It was never the intent of Congress for areas of the United States to  be a territory for 100 years except for the fact that these are now  people of color. These are communities of people of color. So based on  the insular cases 100 years ago which said that the people living in  the territories and offshore territories were people of alien races who  couldn't understand Anglo-Saxon principles of law, that is why we were  not able to have the full-fledged rights of American citizens.                                time  2015    Now we are seeing, even here on the mainland, individuals, people of  color, who are being treated as second-class citizens and who are not  afforded the full protection of this country.   When you have incidents like on May 20 with Richard Collins, on May  26 with Jeremy Joseph Christian, who began shouting racial slurs at two  women on a Portland, Oregon, train, and as the two men stepped in to  de-escalate the situation, those two great men were stabbed to death,  and a third man was wounded, much needs to be done.   We have our moments of silence when there are mass shootings. We  mourn for the families of Pulse nightclub and for what happened in  those areas. But it is not enough for us to have Special Order hours,  to have discussions, or even have moments of silence. Action must be  taken by this administration.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order  hour.    Mr. Speaker, I know that there were other issues that  the gentleman wanted to discuss with regard to some of these and  examples that he wanted to give as well, and I yield to the gentleman  from Texas.    I think he knows now.    That was in the 1970s, I believe.    Actually, they weren't men at the time. They were  teenagers.    Part of leadership is expressing your shortcomings and  using that as an opportunity to move forward and to move the Nation  forward. So many people look to our President for his leadership and  for his thoughts and his out-of-the-box thinking. This would be  tremendous not only to the people who are being oppressed, but to  others as well.   One of the things I wanted to leave us with was a quote and some work  that the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is working on,  that has a mission to secure equal justice for all through the rule of  law, targeting, in particular, the inequities confronting African  Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities.   In December 2016, Kristen Clarke, who is the president, stated:  ``Hate  [[Page H4845]]  crimes and hate-filled incidents stand as a dark cloud over our  democracy. The recent spike in hate crimes is attributable, in part, to  racially charged rhetoric that characterized the 2016 election cycle  and the rise of `alt-right' white nationalist extremism. This is a  moment that calls for Federal, State, and local officials to use every  tool in their arsenal to fully investigate and prosecute these  incidents when they occur.''   And we from the Congressional Black Caucus say, as well, to eradicate  this from our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
