 I call up my amendment No. 1078 and ask that it be  reported by number.    Mr. President, I want to urge passage of an amendment to  reauthorize this critical housing law for American Indians, Native  Hawaiians, and Alaska Natives, NAHASDA. This amendment would  reauthorize NAHASDA for 7 years, promote greater local control over  NAHASDA programs, streamline environmental reviews for Native housing  projects, and incentivize private partnerships.   Senator Murkowski and I introduced a stand-alone bill to reauthorize  NAHASDA, which cleared our committee unanimously.   This amendment is an important win for Native communities to address  their urgent housing needs. It has gone through regular order and has  been well studied for years.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this important measure.
