 Madam President, yesterday the Senate voted to advance  the pending criminal justice legislation. As I noted, at the request of  President Trump and after improvements were secured, we are considering  the bill on the floor this week.   Particular credit for this belongs to Senator Cornyn, who has  carefully and impressively balanced his role as majority whip with his  own personal support for the legislation. His leadership has benefitted  everyone who shares his position and would like to see this bill become  law, and he deserves every bit of their gratitude.   With respect to the substance of the legislation, a number of Members  continue to have outstanding concerns that the bill currently leaves  unaddressed. Members will have an opportunity to debate and vote on the  pending germane amendments before we vote on final passage.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, to the untrained  eye, it might seem that I have completed my thanks and farewells to all  my Republican colleagues who will depart at the end of this Congress,  but I would be remiss if I did not also mention the junior Senator from  Arizona, our good friend Jon Kyl.   When Senator Kyl bid farewell to this body in 2012, it took me quite  a while to come to terms with the prospect that we had cast our final  votes together. I went through stages of grief. Eventually, I came to  acceptance, but, as it turned out, the great State of Arizona was not  quite finished with this distinguished leader after all. If Jon had  planned on a relaxing, undisturbed post-Senate career, then, his  biggest mistake was leaving a record as one of the most earnest and  effective legislators this body had seen in recent memory, because when  the people of Arizona needed to step in and honor the towering legacy  of our friend John McCain, through the end of this Congress, his  counterpart of 18 years was the natural choice.   As the entire Nation mourned the loss of a decorated hero and  statesman, Jon Kyl volunteered his even keel and sound judgment to fill  the void, and while the Senate may have changed in some small ways in  the 6 years since Jon left us, he has likely noticed over the past few  months that some things never do. This floor remains the stage for the  most important policy challenges facing our country. There is still an  urgent need for hard-working public servants with expertise to enter  the fray, and he is still the junior Senator from Arizona.   From his first day back, Jon has smoothly continued Senator McCain's  habit of making an outsized impact for his State. He cast his vote to  confirm a well-qualified Supreme Court nominee.  [[Page S7738]]  He has joined in advancing major legislation, and he has continued his  advocacy for improving our Nation's military readiness.   As we say good-bye one more time, I know every Member of this body  will join me in gratitude that Jon answered the call when his  experience and talents were needed.   Like the others who have been lucky enough spending 18 years with Jon  already, I am especially grateful for this opportunity to work  alongside such a dear friend. So I want to thank Jon for his abiding  commitment to service. We wish him and his wonderful wife Caryll much  health and happiness in the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, bidding farewell to our departing  colleagues is never easy. Neither is seeing off a number of colleagues  beyond the Senate with whom we have had the privilege of working  closely.   For the past 2 years, America has been treated to a brilliant example  of public service on one of its highest possible stages. First, as  Secretary of Homeland Security, and then, as White House Chief of  Staff, John Kelly has served the President and the Nation with great  distinction, but this was far from the first chapter. His entire career  and life have been utterly oriented around his deep patriotic  commitment.   John Kelly spent the better part of four decades in the Marine Corps,  stationed far from Washington. As thousands of his peers waited to be  drafted into military service, John took the initiative. He enlisted.  Then he completed Officer Candidate School.   He earned a reputation as a loyal brother in arms and an outstanding  leader of marines. He commanded infantry units at Camp Lejeune,  Quantico, and Camp Pendleton. He served at the Supreme Allied Command  in Europe and as Commander in the U.S. Southern Command.   He took on real hardship postings, like the House of Representatives.  He served there in the Commandant's liaison office.   When the call came, he led marines into combat in Iraq. As his  marines would tell anyone, he leads with a confidence that comes with  decades of dedicated preparation. He leads with a resolve that comes  from deep-rooted patriotism, and he leads with an understanding--as  personal and painful an understanding as could be possible--about the  sacrifice that our freedom requires.   General Kelly once said this to a gathering of his fellow Gold Star  parents:         Those with less of a sense of service to the nation will       never understand it when men and women of character step       forward and look danger and adversity straight in the eye,       and refuse to blink or give ground even to their own deaths.       The protected can't begin to understand the price paid so       they and their families can sleep safe and free at night.    John Kelly and his family know that price. They have paid that price  as fully as anyone has, but as is so often the case, it is those who  have already given so much who seem the most willing to give even more.   John's service as Secretary of Homeland Security and now as White  House Chief of Staff reflected the values and instincts that made him  such an effective leader of marines. It was only by working closely  with him and his team that this Congress has been able to record so  many substantial accomplishments for the American people.   The Marine Corps is stronger for John Kelly's years of leadership.  America is better for his distinguished career of service.   As he departs the White House this month, I extend my deep gratitude  for a job well done.    I ask the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to go  ahead and propound his unanimous consent request.                Unanimous Consent Request--Amendment No. 4132     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now vote in relation to the divisions of the Kennedy amendment No. 4109  in the regular order; further, that there be 4 minutes prior to the  vote, equally divided between the opponents and the proponents.    So for the information of Senators, the vote order  will be division I, division II, and, then, division III.        Vote on Division I of Amendment No. 4109 to Amendment No. 4108     Mr. President, I call up Cruz amendment No. 4131 to  amendment No. 4108.    I ask that the reading be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time be considered expired; that the Senate vote on  amendment No. 4131; further, that following disposition of the  amendment, the Senate vote on the motion to concur with further  amendment.    Mr. President, earlier this year the Knott County, KY,  community lost a beloved member with the passing of Burl Bowen at the  age of 98.   Born in Wheelwright, Burl grew up in southeastern Kentucky and later  joined the Civilian Conservation Corps to plant trees in the region.  Like so many of his generation, Burl earned his place in the ``greatest  generation'' by serving in the U.S. Army during World War II. He  carried his patriotism and love for his country throughout the rest of  his career and his life, inspiring those around him. Burl spent a  number of years in Detroit, working in a steel mill and operating a  barber shop. He returned to Kentucky upon his retirement with his wife  Anita.   Later in his life, Burl made a particularly large impact on the young  men of the Knott County Central High School's basketball team. Known as  the team's No. 1 fan, Burl could always be found in the front row of  the stands cheering on his team. He was 95 when the team won the 14th  region championship, and Burl proudly climbed the ladder to help cut  down the net. At his funeral, the players paid their respects by  serving as Burl's pallbearers.   Along with the Knott County community, Elaine and I send our  condolences to Anita, their family, and all  [[Page S7782]]  who loved Burl. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in paying  tribute to such a remarkable Kentuckian.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in September the community of London,  KY, lost one of its treasured residents with the passing of Don  Wattenbarger at the age of 81. Don's remarkable life will be remembered  for his kindness, his service to others, and his dedication to helping  Kentucky's children celebrate Christmas. Overcoming a childhood bout  with polio, Don never let his physical difficulties stop him from  helping others, and as a fellow survivor of the disease, I admire him  for it.   I would especially like to remember Don's work with the Laurel County  Sheriff's Department, which he joined as a part-time deputy in 1986.  His official responsibilities included working as a bailiff in court,  but this community will remember him for his boundless care and  generosity outside of his job description. Even after his retirement in  2007, Don hardly slowed down, continuing to be a force for good in his  community.   Working with the Cumberland Valley Fraternal Order of Police, Don was  instrumental in leading and maintaining the Shop with a Cop program in  Laurel County. Every year, Don and his wife Virginia would collect  donations to help children in need have a joy-filled Christmas. It is a  heart-warming program that helps so many children in this community.  One of Don's friends, Karlyle Young, remembered a particular family  with several children who participated in the Shop with a Cop program.  Their father had recently lost his job, and money was tight around the  house. The children asked if they could use some of the money to buy  food, instead of Christmas toys. Don and the other volunteers collected  extra donations to help buy this family food and make sure the children  also received Christmas presents. Working with the sheriff's department  for more than 20 years, Don helped spread Christmas cheer to more than  5,000 local children.   Don also served as a longtime board member of the Laurel County Drug  Abuse Resistance Education, D.A.R.E., program, teaching children about  the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse. For his dedication to this  cause, North and South Laurel high schools present an annual  scholarship to a graduating senior in Don's honor. He was also an  active member of the local Shriner's Club, the masonic lodge, and  several other service organizations that helped those in need in Laurel  County.   In 2018, the city of London recognized Don's incredible lifetime of  service by honoring him as a ``Living Treasure.'' His respect,  compassion, and charitable nature will continue to be remembered and  appreciated by the thousands of lives he made better. I would ask my  Senate colleagues to join me in expressing our gratitude and deep  condolences to Don's family, especially his beloved wife of 51 years  Virginia, his friends, and the Laurel County community that cherished  him.                            ____________________
