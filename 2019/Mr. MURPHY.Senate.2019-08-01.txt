 Madam President, I am on the floor today to talk about a  crisis overseas.   Before I do, I just want to take one moment. The Senator from Georgia  talked about the increases in defense spending that we have done on a  bipartisan basis and suggested that it was the prior administration  that had gutted defense spending. That is not true. I think we should  clear the record about that.   In fact, in the first 3 years of the Obama administration, defense  spending was on the rise. It was the election of a Republican Congress  that led to what we call sequestration--the downward descent of  discretionary spending of both defense and nondefense dollars.   To the extent that my colleagues are worried about what happened to  defense spending in the last 10 years, there is only one explanation  for that; that is, the election of Republicans to the House of  Representatives in 2010 and their demand that in order to vote for an  increase in the debt ceiling, discretionary spending had to be slashed.  In the first several years of the Obama administration, defense  spending was on the rise.                                    Yemen    Madam President, I am on the floor to once again talk about a dire  humanitarian nightmare happening on the other side of the world in a  country called Yemen, the U.S. complicity in that horror, and the  national security disaster that comes with staying involved in this  war.   I could have brought a bunch of much more disturbing charts to the  floor to talk about the world's worst humanitarian disaster--a country  in and on the brink of famine and with a cholera epidemic that the  world has never ever seen before in recorded history. Instead, I chose  to bring you a picture of a child with his back turned to you in order  to spare you the worst of this nightmare.   Before we break, I am here to make an urgent plea to my colleagues  because, as bad as the situation is today,  [[Page S5286]]  it is about to get much worse over the course of the summer and this  fall. There are millions of Yemenis who are going to die if we don't  make some decisions and pressure our allies to make some decisions in  the coming days. The reason for this is simple.   At the beginning of this year, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which are  the primary military partners with the United States in Yemen, made a  pledge they have made in the past, which is that while they would be  dropping bombs and fighting battles on the ground in Yemen, they would  be putting up money to make sure that people would be fed and that  children would be immunized. They made that pledge at the beginning of  this year. We are now halfway through the year, and the UAE and the  Saudis have reneged on that pledge.   Saudi Arabia pledged $750 million to the United Nations. It still  owes, today, $630 million. The UAE pledged $750 million. It still owes,  today, $500 million. They have always been tough negotiators and have  been difficult to get the money from, but this year is different. This  year, 6 months in, the Saudis and the Emirates are essentially saying:  We are not giving the U.N. its money.   If you meet with them, they will tell you that they are spending that  money in other ways, that they are working with other partners inside  Yemen to do the same kind of work. Don't let them put that argument  over on you. There is no one in Yemen who can do the nutrition work,  the healthcare work, or the anti-cholera work that the U.N. can and  does. There are no other partners who have the capacity to keep people  alive like the U.N. You can't just create and stand up that capacity  outside of the United Nations.   If Saudi Arabia and the UAE were not planning on giving the U.N. the  money, then they shouldn't have promised it at the beginning of the  year. The U.N. went out and built infrastructure. It hired partners  based on those pledges. If the Emirates and the Saudis were not  planning on giving the money, then they shouldn't have promised it at  the beginning of this year.   Let me tell you what is happening right now inside Yemen.   Work has been suspended on 30 new feeding centers in the most famine- stricken parts of Yemen.   Vaccinations have been suspended for 13 million people, which  increases the risk for things like measles and malaria.   The procurement of new medical supplies and equipment has been  suspended.   UNICEF has stopped its clean water and sanitation services for 8.4  million people, including 3 million kids, which means more cholera, and  cholera is already on the rise. There have been more cholera cases  reported in the first half of this year than had been reported in all  of 2018. There have been half a million new cases of cholera just in  the first 6 months of this year.   A U.N.-supported treatment plant that purifies water for agriculture  has started to shut down as well, meaning an additional 4 million  people could be eating vegetables that are irrigated with dirty water.   Starting very soon, the World Food Programme will not be able to buy  vouchers for 3 million people.   Sixty more feeding centers will close in the coming weeks.   The World Food Programme has stopped providing nutrient bars to 2.6  million malnourished women and children, which will tip them now into  the category of ``severely malnourished,'' just like this child is.   The U.N. is going to have to stop providing fuel for hospital  generators.   There are 35,000 cancer patients who will stop receiving treatment.   I could go on and on and on.   Why are we standing here? Why aren't we all pressing our friends--the  Saudis, our allies, the Emirates--to come up with this money? While we  all enjoy our August recess, there are going to be millions of children  in Yemen who will look like this who don't look like this today. There  will be hundreds of thousands who will either die or reach the brink of  death all because of a war that the United States has perpetuated and  because of funding commitments that can't keep all of these people  alive, that can't save all of these children's lives but that could  save tens of thousands of lives if our friends, our allies, would  simply do the right thing.   I am furious about this, my colleagues, because I don't know what the  Trump administration is getting for this bear hug it has put around  Saudi Arabia. After the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, we transferred to it  more nuclear technology and sold it more weapons. Maybe the hope was,  in exchange for that, Saudi Arabia would do something about the  humanitarian nightmare, but it is making it worse. Saudi Arabia is  getting everything from us, and it is not even feeding the people on  the ground in Yemen who are dying as we speak.   At a 2015 campaign rally in Alabama, the President said: I get along  great with the Saudis. They buy apartments from me. They spend, like,  $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them  very much.   From 2016 to 2017, a lobbying firm connected to the Saudi Government  paid $270,000 to the Trump International Hotel in DC. In 2018, a 5-day  visit from Saudi officials to the Trump International Hotel in New York  City helped to boost the hotel's quarterly revenue by 13 percent.   Boy, I hope this isn't the reason the administration isn't pressing  the Saudis harder to come up with their funding commitment, but the  President has been pretty clear that the Saudis send him and his family  a lot of money. He has been open about that. I hope this is not the  reason for our not forcing our partners to step up. This is life-or- death time right now. If the administration is not going to do it, then  we will have to do it. Members of Congress will have to do it.   I hope, before my colleagues go home and enjoy some rest and  relaxation over the month of August, they will get on the phone with  their friends in the Saudi Government, that they will get on the phone  with the Emirates Government, and that they will get on the phone with  the Trump administration and tell them that it is time to pony up the  money they have pledged.   The United States is the No. 1 donor, but we could do more. The  Saudis and the Emirates have come through on a quarter of the money  they have promised, and the consequences of that continuing are  absolutely nightmarish. So, before we go home for our break, let's do  something to make sure that a handful more of these kids are alive when  we come back.   I yield the floor.
