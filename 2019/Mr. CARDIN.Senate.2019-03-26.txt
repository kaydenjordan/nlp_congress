 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we shortly will be voting on cloture on a  Senate resolution.   As I understand it, a Senate resolution in regards to a policy issue  is basically trying to express the Senate's collective views on a  policy issue without implementing the legislation itself. If we are  going to take up such a resolution, we should take up one that can get  broad consensus here in the Senate. Although the Green New Deal has  support, it certainly will not have consensus in this body at this  time.   Therefore, I urge the leader to bring up S.J. Res. 9, introduced by  my colleague Senator Carper, which deals with climate change with three  specific issues that I think all of us should be able to agree on: one,  that climate change is real and it is happening; second, that our  conduct here on Earth is a major factor in accelerating climate  change's activities, leading to the types of extreme weather we have  seen around the world; and, third, that it is urgent that we take  action to mitigate the impact of climate change.   Climate change is real. I represent the State of Maryland, with 3,000  miles of shoreline in my State. I see it in flooding and shoreline  erosion. I see the impact it has on the Chesapeake Bay, which is iconic  to my State and to our economy. Climate change is having an impact--a  negative impact. I see it in communities such as Ellicott City, which  experienced two 100-year floods within 20 months, just recently, and  cost loss of life and property. I see the impact it has on our  environment and on our economy.   Clearly, our activities are having a significant impact on  accelerating climate change. Carbon emissions, greenhouse gas  emissions, and the use of fossil fuels have had an impact on  accelerating that. We use too much energy, and we get too much of our  energy from sources that are not friendly toward the issue of  greenhouse gas emissions.   Third is the urgency. An October 2018 report from the United Nations'  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made clear that it is urgent  that we deal with climate change now and that science tells us that we  can reverse the most extreme impact of climate change. We can mitigate  the impact of climate change if we take action--if we act now--on this  issue.   The Trump administration is an outlier in the global community in  dealing with the realities of climate change. Every other nation in the  world--every other nation in the world--has acknowledged that we need  to act as a civilized world, that we need to work together, and that  there is no geographical boundary as to dealing with climate change.   The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met in  December of 2015. I was there with 9 of my colleagues, in Paris, where  195 nations agreed to deal with climate change. I was proud to be part  of the U.S. delegation. Now we have left those discussions, and we are  alone.   This is too important and too urgent of an issue to play partisan  games with, and that is exactly what the majority leader is trying to  do today. We need to commit to work together, Democrats and  Republicans, in the U.S. Senate to restore the U.S. leadership on this  key issue, knowing full well that America's full leadership is  desperately needed in order to deal with these issues, and we need to  make sure that we take action.   More than passing a resolution, let's start with legislation that  will really make a difference on climate change and commit much  stronger to renewable energy, rather than using fossil fuels to the  extent that we do today. Let's put a price on carbon to allow the U.S.  market economy to figure out the solution for reducing the amount of  fossil fuels. Let's commit to conservation in our buildings and the way  we  [[Page S1964]]  deal with auto fuel efficiencies. That type of action will make a real  difference and will follow in the best traditions of the U.S. Senate in  providing leadership for the United States to work with the global  community to solve a global problem.   I urge my colleagues: Let's work together on issues to make a  difference and stop playing partisan politics.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I rise to speak about the  Enhancing Human Rights in Arms Sales Act of 2019, which I was proud to  introduce on  [[Page S1982]]  Monday with my colleagues, Senators Dick Durbin, Ron Wyden, and Ed  Markey. Senators Jeff Merkley, Chris Van Hollen, and Rand Paul also  cosponsored the bill this week. Our bipartisan bill takes critical  steps to ensure that U.S.-manufactured weapons are not used in the  commission of heinous war crimes, the repression of human rights, or by  terrorists who seek to do harm to Americans and innocent civilians  abroad. We do not only have a moral obligation to ensure that U.S.  weapons are used responsibly, but it is clearly in our national  security interest.   As one may be aware, the United States is the world's leading arms  supplier. According to data compiled by the Security Assistance  Monitor, from 2002 to 2016, the United States has delivered more than  $286 billion worth of major conventional weapons and related military  support to 200 recipients. The Cato Institute found that more than 40  percent of nations purchasing these arms are at high risk of  instability, terror, or egregious human rights abuses.   There are far too many examples of what can happen when we sell or  transfer arms without proper vetting. In Yemen, U.S. arms transferred  to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and their coalition have  been linked to more than 1,000 civilian casualties, according to a  recent report from a coalition of local and international human rights  NGOs.   In December 2017, the Trump administration lifted a freeze on weapons  transfers to Nigeria to sell 12 Super Tucano A-29 aircraft and  thousands of bombs and rockets worth $593 million, according to a  Reuters report. Earlier that same year, the BBC reported that at least  115 civilians were killed in a Nigerian military airstrike on an IDP  camp. Twenty Red Cross humanitarian aid workers were among the  casualties.   Reuters reports that, since 2000, the United States has provided  close to $1 billion worth of military equipment to the Philippines,  ranging from surveillance planes, drones, and boats to small arms.  Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 4,000 men, women, and  children have been killed by some of the country's security forces in  the government's anti-drug campaign. President Duterte has openly  encouraged the security forces to engage in extrajudicial killings.  Congress recently prevented the administration from selling small arms  to the Philippines, but insufficient end use monitoring prevents us  from knowing if U.S. weapons were used in the commission of these  abuses.   In Guatemala, according to the Washington Post, authorities used  U.S.-supplied armored J-8 Jeeps to intimidate U.S. Diplomats and  international anticorruption investigators in August 2018. Just weeks  later, the U.S. provided an additional shipment of similar jeeps to the  Guatemalan Government. Just to repeat, our diplomats were threatened by  the weapons that we ourselves provided. This is far from the only  threat American citizens and our partners face from American-made  weapons. Numerous investigations found that the dispersion of American- supplied arms in Iraq made up a significant portion of ISIS's weapons  supply in the country.   This legislation will help curb these dangerous practices by  requiring the Secretary of State to make human rights certifications  for certain arms sales and transfers, specifically those involving  heavy weapons capable of causing mass casualties or destruction, such  as attack aircraft and missile launchers. The bill also requires the  Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, to  develop a strategy to enhance human rights protections in the arms  transfer process. Since we know abuses can take place years after  weapons have been transferred, the bill amends the Arms Control Export  act to ensure stringent end use monitoring with regard to human rights.   America's strength around the world is rooted in our values. Through  this legislation, the Senate can send a strong message that the United  States must not allow U.S. made arms to countries who abuse human  rights, attack civilians, recruit child soldiers, or who are unable to  keep weapons out of the hands of extremist groups. These commonsense  measures ensure any arms transfers take place in a responsible manner  that safeguards our security and protects human rights.                            ____________________
