 Madam Speaker, the GOAT, the Greatest of All Time, that  is how Coach Mike Callan, the winningest women's basketball coach in my  hometown of New Hartford, New York, described junior sensation Kaia  Henderson.   Not only is Kaia one of the top 50 women's high school basketball  recruits in the Nation, she is also a straight-A student, a humble  leader, and a viral sensation. Kaia scored her 2,000th point this week,  even with a dramatically shortened season due to the COVID virus.   Coach Callan describes Kaia as a special player whose work ethic  shows on the court and in the record books, where she holds at least 12  other school records for the Spartans. Kaia herself remains humble,  noting she is focused on winning and helping her team get to sectionals  next season.   Kaia is inspired by her beloved mom, Kristen, who passed away in  2014, who was devoted to Kaia's success. She also credits her dad,  Aurelius, and four big brothers--Troy, Isaiah, and twins Jared and  Jordan--who push her to new limits each day.   But there is more. She has now started a viral 10,000-hour challenge  during the height of the pandemic to inspire others to perfect a craft.  Check out the 10K hours challenge.   Congratulations to Kaia on her incredible success on and off the  court.                            ____________________
