 Mr. President, I rise to talk about the short-term budget  resolution we will be voting on within the next couple of days and a  quote the President made this morning.   The bipartisan agreement we are going to tackle on the floor to  extend the Federal budget past the CR deadline through the end of  September is salutary. It is salutary because the two Houses worked  together to find an agreement.    I can see things in the agreement I like, and I can see things in the  agreement I don't like. That is the nature of budget agreements. My  principal disappointment with the agreement is that we should have done  it in December. I will actually give credit to my Senate colleagues on  both sides of the aisle. We were ready to do this deal in December. The  Appropriations Committees in both Houses had met. We were ready to do a  deal that would then give everybody in government--but, more  importantly, all of our citizens and all of our businesses--some  certainty about what would happen between that vote in December and the  end of the fiscal year, September 30.   The incoming administration, not yet in office, dispatched the Vice  President and others to the Hill and said: Don't do a budget. Don't do  the omnibus bill. We want to have the ability to work on it ourselves.   I think this was against the better judgment of both sides in the  Senate. A decision was made: We won't do an omnibus bill in December.  We recessed on the 10th. We had plenty of time to get work done.  Instead, we would do a CR through April 28.   I think my colleagues were right to want to do it in December.  Nevertheless, we put everybody through the hoops of this: Is there  going to be a shutdown, or what are we going to do?   Now, apparently, we will have a deal. We will discuss it, and I hope  we will vote in favor of it.   We could have gotten the same deal in December. We would have given  people more certainty. They could have adjusted. We could have not  frightened people about a shutdown and done other productive work.  Nevertheless, we have a deal which I plan to support.   But I was very interested this morning--very interested and, I will  be blunt, very disturbed--with the President's words. At 8:07 this  morning, he put out a tweet about the deal, about a bipartisan deal  reached by two Republican Houses, with Democrats included--as we ought  to be, because we represent a lot of the American public. This is the  quote:         Either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the       rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good ``shutdown'' in       September to fix mess!    So what I want to talk about today is whether there is a good  shutdown of the government of the United States--whether there is such  a thing as a good shutdown. Is it right for the President of the United  States to hope for a good shutdown of the government of the greatest  Nation on Earth?   I can't imagine that a CEO--any CEO we would admire--would call for a  shutdown of his own company. That is what President Trump now is. He is  the Commander in Chief and the Chief Executive of the government of the  greatest Nation on Earth. He apparently believes there could be a good  shutdown of this government in September.   I want to take us back to the fall of 2013. In the fall of 2013, the  government was shut down for about 16 days in October. It was my first  year as a Senator. That was bad. It was bad in Virginia, a State with  170,000 Federal employees, who didn't know whether or not there would  be work to do, when they would return to work, or whether they would be  paid for those days. It was bad for veterans whose claims to get a  disability benefit were already too backed up and who couldn't get  their calls and questions answered. It was bad for veterans whose  requests for medical appointments were already too backed up and, in  the uncertainty of a shutdown, they didn't know when they would be  resolved. It was in October, which is the high season of tourism in  Virginia. It was bad for one of my smallest communities, Accomack  County, on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, which is adjacent to the  Chincoteague National Seashore. They count on October tourism as a huge  part of their local economy, but when the Federal parks shut down, it  was bad for their economy. It was bad for economies near Shenandoah  National Park to have that park shut down in the heart of fall leaf  season, which is the time they count on to help their small businesses  succeed. It was bad for people on military bases, when DOD civilians  were being furloughed--civilians like nurses at hospitals, and  childcare workers who provide childcare to military families on  military bases. They didn't know when they would be reopening. I see  nothing good about a shutdown of the Government of the United States.   In fact, it was the first Republican President in the address at  Gettysburg who said: The question that we always have to grapple with  is whether government by, of, and for the people shall perish from the  Earth. I think the answer to that question is that it should not perish  from the Earth--not for a year, not for a month, not for a week, not  for a day, not for an hour. There should not be a shutdown of the  government of the United States. There is no such thing as a good  shutdown.   So I just wanted to come to the floor today and be very, very blunt.  On behalf of anybody in Virginia and in this country who is afraid of  how a government shutdown could impact them or their communities; on  behalf of troops, veterans, military families, and members of our  Department of Defense who keep us safe every day; on behalf of veterans  who fought for this country and who need the Federal Government to cut  the backlog on disability claims or medical appointments at the VA; on  behalf of every senior citizen or disabled person who has a case  awaiting resolution by Social Security or Medicare or CMS; on behalf of  170,000 Federal employees living in Virginia and the people and  communities they serve; on behalf of cities and counties around  Virginia that rely on Federal support for infrastructure projects,  economic development assistance, opioid prevention efforts, export  promotion, and so many other critical programs; on behalf of Virginians  struggling with disease and illness who pray for lifesaving cures  developed through federally funded medical research; on behalf of our  dynamic businesses and all of their workers, who need certainty from  Washington in order to create jobs and expand the economy; on behalf of  Virginia students and families who rely on Head Start Programs or rely  on federally funded work study programs so they can work their way  through college; on behalf of all Virginians and all Americans who  deserve to have clean water, breathable air, beautiful open space, safe  food and drugs, violence-free communities, a functional immigration  system, and protection from cyber threats; and on behalf of the  reputation of this Nation and the values that we proudly claim as  American values, I will do anything and everything in my power as a  U.S. Senator to stop any Trump shutdown, to stop any good shutdown of  the government of the greatest Nation on this Earth, either now or  during September or during the remainder of his term. I call on all of  my colleagues to take a similar pledge.  [[Page S2672]]    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President. In today's increasingly competitive global  market, it is more important than ever that students develop the right  skills and knowledge to succeed in postsecondary education and enter  the workforce. Our nation's future depends on providing students with  an engaging experience that is relevant to the workforce and integrates  partnerships with industry and higher education. Unfortunately, many  high schools currently lack these opportunities, leaving students  unprepared for 21st century careers. In fact, nearly 80 percent of  college instructors and 60 percent of employers indicate that public  high schools fall short in preparing students for postsecondary  education.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S2681, May 2, 2017, in the middle column, the following  appears: Madam President.

This  bipartisan legislation supports funding for innovation in career and  technical education to help redesign the high school experience for  historically underserved students. The bill would support the  integration of rigorous academics with CTE in courses. It would also  authorize grants to partnerships among school districts, employers, and  institutions of higher education in Virginia and other states that help  students earn industry recognized credentials or credit toward a  postsecondary degree or certificate. The bill also places an emphasis  on understanding the relevance of coursework in the context of a future  career by placing an emphasis on teaching workplace skills through job  shadowing, internships, and apprenticeships. Preparing our students for  the careers of tomorrow puts them in the pipeline for the good-paying  jobs that are the future of our workforce.   CTE programs are critical components to every student's education. I  am pleased to be introducing this bipartisan legislation to strengthen  CTE programs in high school so that students are better prepared for  postsecondary studies and the workforce. I hope that my colleagues  consider this legislation as we move to reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins  CTE Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Leahy, and Mr.          Hatch):   S. 1010.
