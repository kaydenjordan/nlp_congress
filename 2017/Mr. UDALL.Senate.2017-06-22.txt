 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blunt). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for the  recognition.   All across my home State of New Mexico, thousands of hard-working  people owe their healthcare and in some cases their lives to the  Affordable Care Act. Since early January, I have received over 10,000  letters, emails, and calls from New Mexicans pleading with me to help  save their access to healthcare. Over 96 percent of my constituents who  have contacted me about healthcare oppose TrumpCare.   Let me say that again because I think it is a very important number.  Over 96 percent of New Mexicans who have contacted me about healthcare  over the past 6 months are opposed to TrumpCare, and they are opposed  to the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   The TrumpCare bill is a disgrace and a disaster. It is a disgrace  that Senate Republicans are trying to force an extremely unpopular bill  on the country in 1 week, and they are doing this even though this bill  affects one-sixth of our economy and even though it would cost hundreds  of thousands of people in New Mexico and millions of Americans to lose  access to healthcare, prescription drugs, drug addiction counseling,  and other lifesaving services.   The Republican plan raids Medicaid, it strips away protections that  prevent insurance companies from canceling your policy for getting  sick, and it reduces the services your insurer has to provide. It does  all this to pay for massive tax cuts for the wealthy.   This bill is a disaster because it would be devastating for older New  Mexicans, families who are struggling to make ends meet, women, people  with preexisting conditions, and New Mexicans in rural areas.   Our rural areas would be particularly hard hit. In some cases, it  would do very severe damage to healthcare in rural areas. Hospital  administrators in rural counties like Guadalupe County and Socorro  County in my home State have told me that losing Medicaid  reimbursements could break their budgets, and that could force the  small, rural hospitals to limit services or even to close. You know,  the last thing you want to have happen in a small, rural community is  to have the hospital close. We all know what happens after that: The  hospital closes, and then a diminution in services takes place, and it  is very hard for communities to stay alive in that situation.   It is no wonder the American people don't want this bill. They don't  want TrumpCare.   I suppose it is no surprise that the Republicans have kept it  hidden--without letting anyone see it. I want to talk about that for a  moment. That is not just a talking point for Democrats. If this bill  passes and becomes law, many people will suffer, and it has been kept a  total secret.   I wish I could read on the Senate floor every story I have gotten  from my constituents who are concerned. If I could, I could hold the  record for the longest floor speech. I have shared several in the past,  but today I would like to read just one, which is from Elena from  Albuquerque.   This is a picture of Elena from Albuquerque, NM. She has a very  moving story that she wrote me about. In this story, I think you see  the story of the Affordable Care Act and the good it does.   Elena is 31 years old.   Earlier this week, I told some of Elena's story in a speech on the  Senate floor, but today I want to tell Elena's full story.   Elena graduated last year from the University of New Mexico Law  School--my alma mater--and she is quite determined and motivated, as  you will hear. She wrote her story in a Facebook post to friends and  gave me permission to share it with the American people and with my  colleagues here in the Senate. Here is her story. This is Elena's story  in Elena's words:         For the past 18 months, I have been carrying around a big       secret. I felt really guilty for not sharing it, yet, try as       I might, I could not work up the nerve to tell you all. Lucky       for me, Senator Udall has helped me to rip off the Band-Aid.        In the spring of 2016, I found out that I have a BRCA-1       mutation, which puts me at a very high risk of developing       breast and ovarian cancer. Women with a BRCA-1 mutation tend       to get breast and/or ovarian cancer very young, sometimes       even in their 20s or 30s.        When you have a BRCA-1 mutation, you have two options: One,       you can get breast screenings every six months and yearly       ovarian screenings and keep your fingers crossed that nothing       pops up. Or two, you can get your breasts and ovaries removed       and significantly decrease the odds of getting cancer.        Needless to say, there's not really a ``right'' decision. A       woman's choice just comes down to what she feels is right for       her body and life.        In the past 18 months, I've gotten to check a whole lot of       things off my ``absolutely not on my bucket list'' bucket       list.        In April 2016, I had my first breast MRI, which revealed a       lump that my doctor thought might be breast cancer. I then       had my first mammogram, my first breast ultrasound, and my       first breast biopsy. These tests thankfully revealed that I       didn't have breast cancer. They also helped me to make the       difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy and       significantly reduce my chances of getting breast cancer.        In August 2016, I had a prophylactic mastectomy. And in       October and February of this year, I had follow-up surgeries       to have my breasts reconstructed.        Since February, I've been focusing on healing, and I feel       great. Obviously, this isn't the end of the road. Doctors       suggest that women with a BRCA-1 mutation get their ovaries       removed around age 40. And of course screening will continue       to be important. But for now, I feel at peace knowing that       I'm doing what I can to protect myself.        As Senator Udall mentioned, at the time that all of this       health stuff came up, I had health insurance thanks to       Medicaid Expansion through the ACA/ObamaCare.        I first enrolled in Medicaid about three years ago when I       was a law student at UNM School of Law. UNM had just given       qualifying students the opportunity to enroll in Medicaid       under the Affordable Care Act. I was a healthy 29-year-old       with no preexisting conditions, and doubted I would ever use       my health insurance. Little did I know, completing the       Medicaid application would be one of the most important       decisions I ever made.        So, a truly genuine #thanksObama to President Obama, his       staff and all our elected leaders who worked to make the ACA       happen and are fighting to keep it alive.        I am so grateful that I qualified for Medicaid at a time in       my life when I unexpectedly needed health insurance more than       I could have ever anticipated. I am so thankful the drafters       of the ACA understood that allowing me to get the preventive       care I needed was better for my health, and also  [[Page S3725]]       more financially sound. The ease with which I have received       my medical coverage has allowed me to focus on my recovery.        While it has been a challenging year and a half, knowing       that I could trust my health insurance made it so much easier       than I'd imagined it would be.        I am so relieved that now I can focus on my future instead       of figuring out how to pay off insurmountable medical debt.        I am fully recovered from my surgeries and am working on       moving my life and career forward. I look forward to paying       taxes (I swear, I really do) to support programs like       Medicaid so that I can do my part to assist other Americans       in staying healthy. If you had told me when I signed up for       Medicaid that I would make such extensive use of it, I       wouldn't have believed it. At times, I have felt guilty for       having to utilize Medicaid at a time in my life that has       proven to be so medically and financially complicated.        Friends and family have been good enough to remind me that       this is what Medicaid is about: ensuring that Americans can       afford to take care of their health, regardless of their       financial state, when an issue strikes. The Affordable Care       Act has made this a reality for more people than ever before;       I am so grateful to be one of them.        I am very scared for what the future will bring for those       many individuals who have received insurance thanks to the       ACA. I worry that if the [Affordable Care Act] is destroyed,       my preexisting condition will make it financially impossible       for me and many others to get health insurance.        I worry for people who couldn't get insurance through their       work and were finally able to get it through the Exchange. I       worry that those who suffer from ailments that constantly       affect their health won't be able to afford the care they       need. I worry about the millions of Americans who are about       to lose so much.        I understand that the ACA is not perfect. It needs some       work, especially for people on the exchange who are paying       premiums that are way too high. But the replacement plan that       is being proposed is going to make it incredibly difficult       for all of us to get quality, affordable coverage.        There are no words to adequately express my gratitude to       all those who worked so tirelessly to make the Affordable       Care Act happen. I am so hopeful that instead of destroying       the ACA, our leaders will work to make it stronger so that       all Americans can get the healthcare that they deserve.    Those are the words Elena posted on her Facebook page, very, very  moving words. Before her surgery, Elena had an 87-percent chance of  developing breast cancer, and now it is less than 10 percent, less than  that of the average woman.   I commit to Elena and to every New Mexican and American that I will  work to make the ACA stronger so that all Americans will get the  healthcare they rightly deserve. But the Senate Republicans cannot  claim the same. Their bill, drafted in secret behind closed doors,  hurts people like Elena who have preexisting conditions. It hurts  people in her situation who have complicated healthcare needs with high  medical costs and those who benefit from Medicaid, from the Medicaid  expansion.   Americans support the Medicaid Program. They understand that even if  they don't need Medicaid, neighbors, friends, family may need it. And  they understand that they may need it unexpectedly in the future, as  Elena did.    Medicaid expansion has meant that over 265,000 New Mexicans have  healthcare coverage that they didn't have before. It is a pretty  remarkable thing. In 6 short years in New Mexico, after the passage of  the Affordable Care Act, we had people who didn't have any healthcare,  and now 265,000 have Medicaid coverage. They could be in a situation  just like Elena's. Many of these are hard-working families--families  living in rural New Mexico and Native American families living in New  Mexico.   The Senate Republican bill, like the House Republican bill, will end  Medicaid expansion in New Mexico for people like Elena.   I want everyone listening to hear: This bill cuts Medicaid overall  more deeply--more deeply--than the House version. And when President  Trump said that the House version was a mean bill, this is a meaner  bill. They are not necessary; these cuts are meaner, and they are not  necessary to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They will hurt millions of  Americans.   They are also devastating to our State economies. New Mexico can't  afford to pick up the tab for those cuts, so the State will be forced  to cut services and reduce payments to doctors. Hospitals might close,  and that would mean healthcare jobs will dry up.   Elena's story is one of millions. Every Senator has hundreds of  thousands of constituents with these stories. We all need healthcare at  some point in our lives.   I urge, I implore my fellow Senators across the aisle to reject the  McConnell TrumpCare bill. Work with Democrats on a bipartisan basis to  improve America's healthcare system so that every American has access  to affordable healthcare.   Don't do this. Don't gut our healthcare system.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
