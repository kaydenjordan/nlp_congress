 Madam President, the Senate has continued to make  headway in the personnel business. This week, we are confirming a  number of President Trump's thoroughly qualified nominees to important  vacancies in the Federal courts and in the administration.   As I have said, it is unfortunate for this institution that our  Democratic colleagues have made it their routine practice to require  not just rollcall votes but cloture votes as well on noncontroversial  nominees for lower profile positions--regular cloture votes on district  judges, cloture votes on Assistant Secretaries, and, later this week, a  cloture vote on an Assistant EPA Administrator.   These are the sorts of important but lower profile positions the  Senate used to quickly process on a voice vote. When these sorts of  people were qualified, they were voice-voted by Senates of both parties  for Presidents of both parties. That was the norm.   New partisan hurdles will not deter the Senate from doing our job. We  will continue to spend the time it takes to put impressive, impartial  men and women on the Federal judiciary and give the President--more  than 2 years into his administration--finally, more of his team in  place in the executive branch.   Yesterday afternoon, we voted to advance the nomination of Daniel  Bress to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr.  Bress comes with strong credentials, the academic pedigree, the legal  experience, and, most importantly, a demonstrated commitment to the  rule of law.   I am glad we voted to advance his nomination yesterday, and I urge  our colleagues to confirm him later today.   Next, we will consider three district court nominees: T. Kent  Wetherell to the Northern District of Florida, Damon Leichty to the  Northern District of Indiana, and Nicholas Ranjan to the Western  District of Pennsylvania.   After them, we will confirm several nominees to serve in the  administration: Robert King to be Assistant Secretary of Education,  John Pallasch to be Assistant Secretary of Labor, and Peter Wright to  be Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.   In each of these cases, the President has presented us with  thoroughly well-qualified individuals to serve the Nation in these very  important roles. This week, the Senate will give them the  straightforward consideration and confirmations they deserve.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, Fourth of July  celebrations weren't the only thing for American families to smile  about last week. We received even more positive news about the strong  U.S. economy that American workers and job creators are building with a  big assist from Republican policies.   More than 200,000 new jobs were created in June alone. The economy is  overflowing with opportunities. American workers are in high demand and  more and more previously sidelined individuals are getting to clock  back in.   The last administration's so-called recovery disproportionately  helped a few major metropolitan areas, but it left whole communities  and whole regions of our country more or less in the dust. Not these  days. The results have been very different under Republicans' pro- growth, pro-opportunity policy agenda. Now we are seeing a real all- American recovery.   As the New York Times reported last week, ``Only recently have the  economic gains filtered down to Black and Hispanic workers, those with  less education, and others who face discrimination or other barriers to  employment.''   So it is all kinds of American workers, all kinds of families, all  kinds of small towns and farm counties and smaller cities and suburbs.  This all-American recovery is benefiting our whole country with job  opportunities, wage growth, net investment, and new optimism.   Two and a half years ago, Republicans started out with a pretty  simple philosophy. It goes like this: The American people can  accomplish great things and build prosperity for their  [[Page S4706]]  families if Washington mostly stays out of the way.   We needed the Federal Government to stop creating so many economic  headwinds and start creating a few tailwinds. So we achieved historic  tax reform, major regulatory reform, and all kinds of economic policies  geared toward helping workers and middle-class families earn more and  then send less to the IRS.   The way Republicans see it, these ideas are actually no-brainers. So  as long as you believe in the promise and potential of American workers  and small businesses, this is clearly the way to go, and the results  continue to speak for themselves.                            ____________________     Madam President, it is always a privilege to honor the  men and women of America's Greatest Generation. They defended our  national values both at home and abroad, and we owe each one of them a  tremendous debt of gratitude for their service and sacrifice. Today, I  would like to recognize one of these intrepid Americans from my home  State of Kentucky. Mary Somers Ballard volunteered to serve in the U.S.  Army Nurse Corps during World War II, providing healing care to wounded  soldiers across the European theatre. This month, Mary will enjoy her  100th birthday at a celebration with friends and family, and I would  like to add my voice to the chorus of those praising her lifetime of  achievement.   When war broke out, Mary lived in Boston working as a nurse and  attending school. Hearing stories from the front, she was called to  leave her studies and put her talents to work for the war effort. At  the age of 23, she joined the Army's 811th Air Evacuation Unit and  sailed from New York City for Europe. Mary was deployed at a hospital  in Manchester, England, where she cared for wounded soldiers flown back  from France and Germany. In the aftermath of the invasion of Normandy,  Mary traveled to the continent to support the Battle of the Bulge, one  of Hitler's last-ditch efforts to stop the Allied advance. After the  liberation of Paris, Mary was sent to the city to care for troops  there. In her many posts, Mary delivered lifesaving care to many Allied  soldiers, often in challenging surroundings.   More than 59,000 Americans joined the Army Nurse Corps during the  Second World War, many serving under enemy fire. Their service  supported the recovery of countless wounded soldiers at evacuation  hospitals like Mary's.   After the war, Mary was stationed in Indiana where she met Al  Ballard, a young surgical resident. The couple married and moved to  Al's native Kentucky, where Mary has lived ever since. Together, they  raised eight children and, like so many other members of the Greatest  Generation, continued to contribute to their community and our country.   Through the years, Mary has been honored for her brave service. To  celebrate her 95th birthday, for example, she threw out the first pitch  at a Lexington Legends minor league baseball  [[Page S4726]]  game. I am glad to join her family and friends in marking Mary's 100th  birthday. With her lifesaving work in the Army and a longtime  commitment to Kentucky, Mary has made a lasting impression on the lives  of countless many. With all of them, I would like to wish her a happy  birthday and thank her for her remarkable service to the United States.  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring this Kentucky hero.                            ____________________
