 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remind every American  that the window to purchase health insurance on healthcare.gov will  close in 10 days. I encourage anyone who doesn't get insurance through  a job or government program to apply before December 15.   Financial assistance is available, and the Department of Health and  Human Services has said before that 8 out of 10 consumers qualify for a  plan that costs less than $75 a month.   Although the signup period was cut in half by the Trump  administration, nearly 2.8 million people have already enrolled so far  this year compared to 2.1 million this time last year. That is an  increase of 33 percent, and this doesn't include numbers from States  that have their own exchange.   Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land,  and I urge my Republican colleagues not to harm the ACA by including  provisions in the tax bill and, instead, work with Democrats to improve  the law.   Millions of Americans depend on us to do the right thing, Mr.  Speaker.                            ____________________
