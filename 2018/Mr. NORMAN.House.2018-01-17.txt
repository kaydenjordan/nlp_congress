 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support my amendment to  H.R. 3326, the World Bank Accountability Act. I also want to thank the  chairman of the full committee and Andy Barr, who is the subcommittee  chairman, for introducing this legislation and working with me on this  amendment.   The purpose of the underlying bill is simple: to ensure that the  World Bank is effective in supporting projects abroad that work and  actually reduce poverty. One aspect of the bill requires that the U.S.  may withhold part of its funding from the World Bank unless the  Treasury Department reports that the World Bank is emphasizing proven  antipoverty solutions such as secure property rights, due process under  the law, and economic freedom.   My amendment would make a small and positive change to the bill which  clarifies that the World Bank should also focus on reducing government  barriers to entrepreneurship in addition to the other requirements.                                time  1600    This simple modification is important for a couple of reasons:   First, multiple studies have found that entrepreneurship is an  essential part of reducing poverty abroad because it gives people the  ability to use their skills and God-given talents to foster innovation  and create jobs in their individual communities. Foreign governments  often create barriers to entrepreneurship through excessive fees,  burdensome licensing requirements, and lengthy permitting processes.   Second, this modification is consistent with United States foreign  policy, which, in part, is to promote market solutions to international  poverty. This will ensure that individuals will have the capability to  pull themselves out of poverty without excessive barriers put up by  their government, ultimately improve the efficiency of United States  development assistance and improve the economic situation in  impoverished nations.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I  appreciate the committee's willingness to work with me on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
