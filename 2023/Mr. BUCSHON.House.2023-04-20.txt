 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the passing of my good  friend and mayor of Rockport, Indiana, Donnie Winkler.   Donnie tirelessly led the Rockport community with a smile and a good  sense of humor. For years, his work ethic and sense of duty helped  raise the bar for all those living in Spencer County, Indiana.   His motto: ``Do what you do; do it well and thoroughly,'' is  something he took with him in all aspects of his life.   From his time spent as a farmer, industrial worker, National  Guardsman, husband, father of four sons, entrepreneur, small business  owner, general contractor, riverboat cook, building inspector, jailor,  visionary, and finally as mayor, you saw this motto in all he did.   I am proud to have had the opportunity to know Donnie Winkler. My  heart goes out to his family, friends, and the entire Rockport  community during this trying time.   Godspeed, Donnie.                            ____________________
