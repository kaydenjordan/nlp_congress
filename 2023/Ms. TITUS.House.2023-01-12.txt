 Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss the Protecting America's  Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act which the Republicans  brought to the floor today to fix a mistake that their leadership in  the 114th Congress made. You wouldn't know that, Madam Speaker, to hear  them talking today of blaming other people and not themselves.   Back then, 235 Republicans voted to end our country's 40-year-long  crude oil export ban. When they did that, Trump took full advantage of  it, and under his administration over 391 million barrels went to  China. Now they want to rewrite history. You can't rewrite the history.  The evidence is there.   This bill was a step in the right direction. But like my colleague  from Ohio said earlier: It doesn't go far enough.   Why don't we extend this ban to North Korea, Iran, and Russia?   That way we can prevent all our adversaries and not just China from  using our oil to our disadvantage.                            ____________________
