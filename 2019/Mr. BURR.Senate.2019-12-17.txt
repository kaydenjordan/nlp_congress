 Madam President, this explanation reflects the status of  negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence for the Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young  Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and  2020. This bill is named after two dedicated staffers--Matthew Young  Pollard of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Damon Paul  Nelson of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence--whose  contributions to America will have an enduring, positive impact on our  national security.   The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to the  implementation of this act as if it were a joint explanatory statement  of a conference committee. The explanation comprises three parts: an  overview of the application of the annex to accompany this statement,  unclassified congressional direction, and a section-by-section analysis  of the legislative text.   I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Explanatory Statement for the  Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization  Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020 be printed into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization                 Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, AND 2020         The following is the explanation of the Damon Paul Nelson       and Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for       Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020 (hereinafter, ``the Act'').        This explanation reflects the result of negotiations and       disposition of issues reached between the House Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate       Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) (hereinafter, ``the       Agreement''). The explanation shall have the same effect with       respect to the implementation of the Act as if it were a       joint explanatory statement of a conference committee.        The explanation comprises three parts: an overview of the       application of the annex to accompany this statement;       unclassified congressional direction; and a section-by-      section analysis of the legislative text.                 PART I: APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFIED ANNEX         The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities       prevents the HPSCI and SSCI (collectively, the       ``congressional intelligence committees'') from publicly       disclosing many details concerning the conclusions and       recommendations of the Agreement. Therefore, a classified       Schedule of Authorizations and a classified annex have been       prepared to describe in detail the scope and intent of the       congressional intelligence committees' actions. The Agreement       authorizes the Intelligence Community (IC) to obligate and       expend funds not altered or modified by the classified       Schedule of Authorizations as requested in the President's       budget, subject to modification under applicable       reprogramming procedures.        The classified annex is the result of negotiations between       the congressional intelligence committees. They reconcile the       differences between the congressional intelligence       committees' respective versions of the bill for the National       Intelligence Program (NIP) for Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and       2020. The Agreement also makes recommendations for the       Military Intelligence Program (MIP) and the Information       Systems Security Program (ISSP), consistent with the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, and provides       certain direction for these two programs. The Agreement       applies to IC activities for Fiscal Year 2020.        The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated       into the bill pursuant to Section 5102 of Subdivision 1. It       has the status of law. The classified annex supplements and       adds detail to clarify the authorization levels found in the       bill and the classified Schedule of Authorizations. The       congressional intelligence committees view direction and       recommendations, whether contained in this explanation or in       the classified annex, as requiring compliance by the       Executive Branch.             PART II: SELECT UNCLASSIFIED CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTION         Unclassified Direction related to Subdivision 1 of the Act       relates to Fiscal Year 2020. Unclassified Direction related       to Subdivision 2 originated in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.       The term ``Committees'' refers to both SSCI and HPSCI.               UNCLASSIFIED DIRECTION RELATED TO SUBDIVISION 1       Plans for Operations During Government Shutdowns by All           Elements of the Intelligence Community.        The Committees have an active interest in the impact of       government shutdowns on the intelligence mission. Office of       Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, Section 124,       outlines how agencies are supposed to plan for operations       during government shutdowns, and Section 124.2 provides that       agencies must share those plans with OMB. Additionally,       Section 323 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2014 requires the Office of the Director of National       Intelligence (ODNI), the Central Intelligence  [[Page S7091]]       Agency (CIA), and IC elements within the Department of       Defense (DoD) to share those same plans with specified       congressional committees, including the congressional       intelligence committees.        These requirements, however, omit IC elements that are not       separate ``agencies'' for the purposes of OMB Circular A-11,       Section 124, and are not ODNI, CIA, or elements within the       DoD for the purposes of the IAA for Fiscal Year 2014. As a       result, no such reporting requirement currently exists for IC       elements within the Departments of Justice, Treasury, Energy,       State, and Homeland Security. For that reason, when portions       of the federal government were shut down between December       2018 and February 2019, the Committees had little to no       insight into the effects of the shutdown on these and other       important segments of the IC.        Therefore, the Committees direct IC elements within the       Departments of Justice, Treasury, Energy, State, and Homeland       Security to submit to the congressional intelligence       committees--on the same day as the host department's issuance       of any plan for a government shutdown--the number of       personnel in their respective elements that will be       furloughed.      Program Manager-Information Sharing Environment Review.        Section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism       Protection Act of 2004 (IRTPA) created a Program Manager-      Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE), administered from       within the ODNI, to better facilitate the interagency sharing       of terrorism-related information. Section 1016 also       designated the PM-ISE as a presidentially-appointed position.       Section 6402 of Subdivision 2 of the Act amends the IRTPA, so       that the PM-ISE is subject to appointment by the Director of       National Intelligence (DNI), not the President. Since the       establishment of the PM-ISE, the Federal government has       created entities, procedures, and processes to address       directly the mandate for improved terrorism information       sharing. Accordingly, the Committees find it appropriate to       reconsider the future of the PM-ISE's mission.        Therefore, the Committees direct the ODNI, in consultation       with appropriate Federal departments, agencies, and       components, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, to       conduct a review of the PM-ISE's terrorism information       sharing mission, associated functions, and organizational       role within the ODNI and provide findings and recommendations       on the future of the PM-ISE to Congress.      Leveraging Academic Institutions in the Intelligence           Community.        The Committees encourage the DNI and the Director of the       DIA to ensure that IC elements continue to forge tighter       partnerships with leading universities and their affiliated       research centers in order to enhance mutual awareness of       domestic and international challenges, leverage subject       matter experts from higher education in a manner that uses       cutting edge technologies and methods, and bolsters the       recruitment of top-notch, diverse, and technically proficient       talent into the IC's workforce.        The Committees further believe that IC-sponsored academic       programs such as the Intelligence Community Centers for       Academic Excellence (IC-CAE) should work closely with       educational institutions that offer interdisciplinary courses       of study and learning opportunities in national and       international security; geopolitical affairs, international       relations and national security; interdisciplinary courses of       study in the culture, history, languages, politics, and       religions of major world regions; foreign language       instruction; computer and data science; or cybersecurity.        The DNI shall ensure that such programs are facilitated via       the streamlining of the security clearance process for       graduating students from such universities who receive offers       of employment from IC elements, provide for the temporary       exchange of faculty and IC professionals, including as       visiting fellows, and technical training opportunities for       faculty, students, and IC personnel.        Therefore, the Committees direct all IC agencies to support       the IC-CAE effort by tracking recruits and new hires who have       graduated from IC-CAE-designated institutions, promptly       reporting these numbers to the office in charge of IC-CAE       implementation, and increasing all IC agencies' efforts to       recruit from such institutions.      Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities.        The Committees remain concerned about impediments for       companies with appropriately cleared personnel being able to       perform work for government entities and the effects of these       impediments on IC access to innovative products and services.       For example, businesses without access to a Sensitive       Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), which includes       many small businesses and non-traditional contractors, find       it difficult to perform classified work for the IC.       Construction and accreditation of SCIF spaces may be cost-      prohibitive for small business and non-traditional government       contractors.        Additionally, SCIF construction timelines often exceed the       period of performance of a contract. A modern trend for       innovative and non-traditional government contractors is the       use of co-working space environments. Additionally, public       and private entities are partnering to create emerging       regional innovation hubs to help identify technology       solutions and products in the private sector that can be       utilized by the DoD and IC. These innovation hubs currently       produce an agile, neutral, but largely unclassified,       development environment.        Therefore, the Committees direct the ODNI to submit a       report to the congressional intelligence committees on:        1. Processes and procedures necessary to build, certify,       and maintain certifications for multi-use sensitive       compartmented facilities not tied to a single contract and       where multiple companies can securely work on multiple       projects at different security levels;        2. Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of issuing       DoD Contract Security Specification (DD Form 254s) to       Facilities'' as opposed to Contracts'';        3. Options for classified co-use and shared workspace       environments such as innovation, incubation, catalyst, and       accelerator environments;        4. Pros and cons for public, private, government, or       combination owned facilities that can operate at different       classification levels; and        5. Any other opportunities to support companies with       appropriately cleared personnel but without effective access       to a neutral SCIF.      Inclusion of Security Risks in Program Management Plans           Required for Acquisition of Major Systems in the National           Intelligence Program.        Section 5305 of Subdivision 1 of the Act adds security risk       as a factor for the DNI to include in the annual Program       Management Plans for major system acquisitions submitted to       the congressional intelligence committees pursuant to Section       102A(q)(1)(A) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C.       3024(q)(1)(A)). The Committees are increasingly concerned       with the security risks to IC acquisitions. The Joint       Explanatory Statement accompanying the Intelligence       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 directed updates to       Intelligence Community Directive 731, Supply Chain Risk       Management, and Committee leadership has engaged senior       industry representatives about the threats to the national       security industrial base posed by adversaries and       competitors, including China. Over the past few years, the       Department of Defense has been elevating security as a       ``fourth pillar'' (to complement cost, schedule, and       performance) in reviewing defense acquisitions, embodied in       the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence's ``Deliver       Uncompromised'' initiative.        Section 5305 of the Act extends that focus to the IC,       requiring the annual Program Management Plans to include       security risks in major system acquisitions, in addition to       cost, schedule, and performance. The Committees recognize       that security can be applied across a number of areas       (facilities, personnel, information, and supply chain) and       may vary by program, to appropriately ensure system integrity       and mission assurance.        Therefore, for the purposes of implementing section 5305 of       the Act, the Committees direct the Director of National       Intelligence, with the Director of the National       Counterintelligence and Security Center, to develop       parameters for including security risks (and risk       management measures) in the annual Program Management       Plans to assist congressional oversight.      Intelligence Community Public-Private Talent Exchange.        The Committees fully support section 5306 of Subdivision       1's implementation in accordance with applicable federal       ethics laws, regulations, and policies.      Expansion of Scope of Protections for Identities of Covert           Agents.        Section 5303 of Subdivision 1 of the Act removes temporal       and geographic limitations on the definition of ``covert       agent'', as that term was defined by Section 606 of the       Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, P.L. 97-200       (Jun. 23, 1982) (IIPA).        Such limitations originally carved out of the IIPA       unauthorized disclosures of certain kinds of classified       identity information--those generally involving persons who       have not served or acted abroad in the last five years--on       grounds that such disclosures are generally less harmful to       national security, and therefore undeserving of IIPA       protections. But experience since then has proven otherwise.       With the benefit of experience, the Committees have concluded       that any disclosure of currently classified identity       information, without regard to the location or recency of the       activities of the person whose information is disclosed, can       risk serious harm to national security. That being the case,       such disclosures should potentially present a basis, under       appropriate circumstances, for prosecution under the IIPA.        The Committees wish to stress, however, that the change       does not imply any enhanced risk of IIPA liability for       journalists.        In the thirty-seven years since enactment, the statute has       never been used to prosecute members of the media. In fact,       prosecutors have charged violations of the IIPA in only two       cases, both of which involved unauthorized disclosures by       former federal government employees of classified information       obtained during their employment. The Committees view this       spare record, so far as traditional newsgathering and       publication is concerned, as reflecting the heavy,       constraining influence of the First Amendment's Press Clause.       Journalists continue to this day to report aggressively on       intelligence matters.        The IIPA's enforcement history also reflects the narrowness       of Section 601(c), a provision which some have interpreted to       expose  [[Page S7092]]       traditional journalists to the risk of liability under the       statute. But in the Committees' view, that provision does not       cover responsibly investigating and reporting news in the       public interest. There is a high burden for conviction under       Section 601(c). It requires a prosecutor to prove beyond a       reasonable doubt, among other things, that a defendant       engaged in a ``pattern of activities'': a series of acts with       the common purpose or objective of identifying and publicly       exposing covert agents. Such conduct entails ``engag[ing] in       a purposeful enterprise of revealing covert identities'' or       being in the ``business of naming names,'' as the Conference       Report to the IIPA put it in 1982. H.R. Rep. No. 97-580, at 9       (1982).        Traditional news gathering and publication--including on       abuses of power, violations of law and civil liberties, and       other controversial activity--does not require, or even       typically involve, such conduct. Indeed, as the Conferees       illustrated the point:        The reporters who have investigated the activities of       Wilson and Terpil, former CIA employees who allegedly       supplied explosives and terrorist training to Libya, would       not be covered even if they revealed the identity of covert       agents if their pattern of activities was intended to       investigate illegal or controversial activities, and not to       identify covert agents. Similarly, David Garrow would not be       within the scope of the statute even though he purported to       give the identity of covert agents in his book, ``The FBI and       Martin Luther King, Jr.: from `Solo' to Memphis.'' His intent       presumably was to explain what drove the FBI to wiretap       Martin Luther King and not to identify and expose covert       agents.        H.R. Rep. No. 97-580, at 10. The same holds true for       traditional, responsible journalists today. Even after       amendments made by the Act, their work does not risk       liability under the revised IIPA.        Furthermore, section 5303 has no effect on what information       may be withheld under the Freedom of Information Act, 5       U.S.C. Sec. 552 (FOIA). Section 5303 expands the universe of       ``covert agents'' whose classified relationship with the       United States Government is protected by the criminal law.       All of the people protected by the expanded ``covert agent''       definition have a relationship with the United States       government that is already classified. If an individual's       relationship with the government is classified, it may be       withheld under FOIA. Consequently, even before passage of       section 5303, identifying information for all of the       individuals covered by the IIPA expansion could already have       been withheld under FOIA's (b)(1) exemption for national       security information. In general, when justifying withholding       under FOIA information that tends to identify covert agents,       agencies should use (b)(1) classification exemptions, not       (b)(3) exemptions regarding the IIPA and other statutes. 5       U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 552(b)(1), (3).        Section 5303 is not intended to--and does not--affect       Congress' authority to oversee the IC. Section 5303 is not       intended to--and does not--affect the protections afforded to       whistleblowers to disclose violations of law and waste,       fraud, and abuse to Inspectors General or to Congress.      Intelligence Community Cooperation with the Government           Accountability Office.        The Committees believe the Government Accountability Office       (GAO) adds significant value to the Committees' oversight       efforts. For example, the GAO's designation in 2018 of the       government-wide Personnel Security Clearance process to its       high-risk list of federal areas needing reform to prevent       waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, was important to the       Committees' efforts to legislate on security clearance       reform, including in this Act. The Committees expect that all       IC elements will fully and promptly comply with requests from       the GAO made to support studies requested by, or of interest       to, the Committees.      Clarification of Death Benefits for Survivors of Central           Intelligence Agency Personnel.        The Committees concur with the Executive Branch that       section 5341 of Subdivision 1 of the Act shall apply       retroactively from the date of enactment of this Act.      Intelligence Community Leave Policies.        The Committees find it imperative that the federal       government, to include the IC, recruit, hire, and retain a       highly qualified workforce. That depends in part on offering       federal personnel a competitive benefits package--including       with respect to parental leave and related benefits. Toward       that end, the Committees strongly believe the federal       government must align such benefits to the fullest extent       possible with those of leading U.S. private sector companies       and other industrialized countries.        In furtherance of that objective, the Committees in their       respective bills supported a provision to provide twelve       weeks of paid parental leave to all IC employees. The       Committees further support the succeeding provision in the       National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year       2020 that provides government employees, to include those in       the IC, with twelve weeks of paid administrative leave in the       event of birth of a child, or the placement of a child for       purposes of adoptive or foster care. This is consistent with,       and supersedes, provisions that were contained in the House-      passed and Senate-passed Intelligence Authorization Acts for       Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Importantly, that NDAA       provision does not modify or otherwise affect the eligibility       of an IC employee for benefits relating to leave under any       other provision of law, to include the provisions of the       Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2601, et       seq.        Moreover, so far as concerns the provision's       implementation, the Committees direct the DNI, within 180       days after enactment of this Act, to provide a briefing for       the Committees on how each element of the IC will implement 5       U.S.C. section 6382(d)(2), as provided by this Act.      Transfer of National Intelligence University.        The Committees have been closely watching the evolution of       how the IC provides for advanced intelligence education. The       Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has hosted an intelligence       college since 1962, which has been academically accredited       since 1983. When the ODNI was created in the Intelligence       Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, ODNI created a       separate National Intelligence University (NIU) under its       auspices as a complement to DIA's intelligence effort. In       response to a report from the President's Intelligence       Advisory Board that accused the ODNI of being inadequately       focused, the ODNI in 2011 transferred the NIU to DIA's       intelligence college and rebranded the new combined       institution as NIU.        Pursuant to the Joint Explanatory Statement to the       Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, an       independent panel offered alternative governance models to       enhance NIU, to include a more prominent role for ODNI. In       parallel, analyses of DIA by the Secretary of Defense and the       HPSCI during the 115th Congress concluded that DIA would       benefit from moving NIU elsewhere in the IC.        The Committees believe transferring NIU to ODNI is now       appropriate if certain conditions, contained in section 5324       of Subdivision 1 of the Act, are met. The Committees believe       that clear commitment from the DNI and Principal Deputy DNI       is critical to NIU's success at ODNI. The Committees look       forward to working with ODNI and DoD on the successful       transfer of NIU.      Associate Degree Program Eligibility.        The Committees are concerned that students enrolled in, or       who have graduated from, Associate Degree programs have       insufficient opportunities to gain employment in the IC.       Therefore, the Committees direct the ODNI to submit a report       to the congressional intelligence committees on how to expand       the number of opportunities for students pursuing or having       earned an Associate Degree eligible for IC academic programs.       The Committees also direct the ODNI to make information about       these academic programs publicly available.      Exposing Predatory and Anticompetitive Foreign Economic           Influence.        The Committees are concerned about the significant threat       posed by foreign governments that engage in predatory and       anticompetitive behaviors aimed to undercut critical sectors       of the United States economy. Therefore, the Committees       direct the DNI, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary       of the Treasury for Intelligence and Analysis, to submit to       the congressional intelligence committees a report       identifying top countries that pose a substantial threat to       the United States economy regarding technology transfer       issues, predatory investment practices, economic espionage,       and other anticompetitive behaviors. The report shall be       submitted in unclassified form to the greatest extent       possible, but may include a classified annex.        Furthermore, the DNI, in consultation with the Department       of the Treasury and other agencies that the Director deems       appropriate, shall submit a report to the congressional       intelligence committees assessing the costs and benefits of       requiring a foreign person or entity that invests in the       United States (and is subject to the jurisdiction of a       country that poses a substantial threat to the United States       economy) to submit annual disclosures to the Federal       Government. Such disclosures would include all investments       that the foreign person or entity made in the United States       during the preceding year; the ownership structure of the       entity; and any affiliation of the entity with a foreign       government. The report should detail how such information       could be used by the IC and other elements of the Federal       government working to identify and combat foreign threats to       the United States economy, and the appropriate scope and       thresholds for such disclosures. The report shall be       submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified       annex.      Increasing Data Security.        The Committees are aware the IC faces challenges while       trying to balance mission and enterprise needs with IT       modernization, including the migration of data and       applications to the cloud. With this in mind, the Committees       encourage the IC to identify and utilize technologies that       increase the security posture of data and workloads and       reduce cyber risks.        The Committees further recommend that:        1. IC elements identify, develop, and implement tools for       bi-directional data migration and division interoperability       between data center and cloud environments;        2. These tools include, but are not limited to, encryption       of data while both at rest and in motion, and micro-      segmentation of networks and workloads; and        3. IC elements prioritize shifting resources towards       automation as a way to respond more quickly to cyber threats.  [[Page S7093]]           Anonymous Annual Survey Regarding Workplace Climate.        IC elements obtain mission-critical information from the       results of anonymous, annual surveys of their employees, on       issues related to workplace climate and retention. As       necessary as they are to the elements' own activities, survey       results are also vital to the Committees' continuing       oversight of elements' efforts to address workplace climate       and retention issues, and to propose legislative and other       remedies where appropriate.        The need for reliable information is especially acute with       respect to sexual harassment and discrimination, given that--      established policy and legal protections notwithstanding--an       employee may fear that directly raising concerns about such       matters risks exposing the employee to retaliatory personnel,       security clearance, or other actions. The anonymous survey       affords the element, and the Committees, a mechanism for       inquiring further about the extent of this well-documented       chilling effect against reporting; and about the       effectiveness (or not) of ongoing programs to uncover and       root out sexual harassment, discrimination, and other illegal       and/or inappropriate activities at the workplace.        Therefore, the Committees direct that no later than 180       days after enactment of this Act, the DNI must certify in       writing to the congressional intelligence committees that:        1. At least once a year, each element of the IC submits a       survey to its employees regarding workplace climate and       retention matters, and affords employees completing such       surveys the option to remain anonymous;        2. Such survey includes questions regarding employees'       experiences with sexual assault, discrimination, harassment,       including sexual harassment, and related retaliation,       including, at a minimum, the questions covering the following       topics:        a. Have you witnessed sexual harassment or sexual assault?        i. Did you report it?        ii. If not, why not?        b. Have you experienced sexual harassment or sexual       assault?        i. Did you report it?        ii. If not, why not?        c. Have you experienced retaliation for reporting       harassment, discrimination, or sexual assault?        i. Have you faced retribution for taking leave for family,       medical, or other personal reasons?        ii. Did you fear retribution for taking leave?        3. Each element includes in its survey questions regarding       the job series, position, age, gender, race or ethnicity,       field, and job location at the time of the survey's       completion;        4. Each element tracks employees' responses according to       job series, position, age, gender, race or ethnicity, field,       and location at the time of the survey's completion; and        5. Each element reports the results of its survey annually       to the congressional intelligence committees.      Report to Congress on the Representation of Women and           Minorities in the Workforce.        The Committees continue to strongly support IC efforts to       identify, recruit, and retain a highly diverse and highly       qualified workforce--including, in particular, its efforts to       increase the representation within elements of the IC of       women and minorities.        This is a data driven exercise. Bolstering and adjusting IC       workforce diversity programs depends in part on the       Committees' regularly obtaining current, detailed, and       reliable information, and about specific matters relevant to       the broader subject of workforce diversity--such as rates and       areas of promotion of women and minority employees. However,       some elements may produce such information only from time to       time; others may make regular submissions to the Committees       but include only general information.        Therefore, the Committees direct that every six months, the       head of each element of the IC shall submit to the Committees       a written report that shall include, at a minimum:        1. The total number of women and minorities hired by that       element during the reporting period and a calculation of that       figure as a percentage of the agency's total hiring for that       period;        2. The distribution of women and minorities at that element       by grade level and by job series in the element's total       workforce during the reporting period, together with       comparisons from the immediately preceding two years;        3. The number of women and minorities who applied for       promotion at the element and the final number selected for       promotion during the reporting period;        4. The proportion of the total workforce of the element       occupied by each group or class protected by law, as of the       last day of the reporting period;        5. The numbers of minorities and women serving in positions       at the element requiring advanced, specialized training or       certification, as well as the proportion of the workforce       those groups occupy; and        6. To the extent that such element deploys civilian       employees to hazardous duty locations, the number of women       and minority employees who departed government service       subsequent to a deployment undertaken by an employee in the       previous two years.      Report on Geospatial Commercial Activities for Basic and           Applied Research and Development.        The Committees direct the Director of the National       Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), in coordination with       the DNI, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency       (CIA), and the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office       (NRO), within 90 days of enactment of this Act, to submit to       the congressional intelligence and defense committees a       report on the feasibility, risks, costs, and benefits of       providing the private sector and academia, on a need-driven       and limited basis--consistent with the protection of sources       and methods, as well as privacy and civil liberties--access       to data in the possession of the NGA for the purpose of       assisting the efforts of the private sector and academia in       basic research, applied research, data transfers, and the       development of automation, artificial intelligence, and       associated algorithms. Such report shall include:        1. Identification of any additional authorities that the       Director of NGA would require to provide the private sector       and academia with access to relevant data on a need-driven       and limited basis, consistent with applicable laws and       procedures relating to the protection of sources, methods,       privacy and civil liberties; and        2. Market research to assess the commercial and academic       interest in such data and determine likely private-sector       entities and institutions of higher education interested in       public-private partnerships relating to such data.      NRO Contracting Restrictions.        The Committees continue to be very concerned that NRO       imposes unnecessary contractual restrictions that prohibits       or discourages a contractor from contacting or meeting with a       congressional intelligence committee or intelligence       committee Member offices. Therefore, the Committees direct       NRO to remove all restrictions that impacts contractors from       contacting or meeting with the congressional intelligence       committees or member offices in all current and future       contracts to include pre-coordination with executive branch       agencies.      Enhancing Automation at the National Geospatial-Intelligence           Agency.        The Committees strongly support efforts to leverage       commercial advances in automation of imagery such as electro-      optical, infrared, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), Full       Motion Video (FMV), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)       products to reduce manual processing and improve information       flow to users. However, the Committees are concerned that NGA       does not dedicate adequate resources to integrate new       automation techniques, which have resulted in years of       research into the issue, but limited operation gains during       day-to-day imagery processing.        Therefore, the Committees direct NGA, within 90 days of       enactment of this Act, to brief the congressional       intelligence and defense committees on an updated plan to       reduce manual processing of imagery such as electro-optical,       infrared, WAMI, FMV, and SAR to improve information flow to       users. The briefing shall also address:        1. NGA's strategy to leverage commercial advances;        2. The various GEOINT automated exploitation development       programs across the National System for Geospatial-      Intelligence, and the associated funding and specific purpose       of said programs;        3. Any similar efforts by government entities outside the       National System for Geospatial-Intelligence of which NGA is       aware; and        4. Which of these efforts may be duplicative.      Redundant Organic Software Development.        The Committees are concerned that NGA is developing       software solutions that are otherwise available for purchase       on the commercial market. This practice often increases the       time it takes to deliver new capabilities to the warfighter;       increases the overall cost of the solution through expensive       operational and maintenance costs; and undermines the U.S.       software industrial base.        Therefore, the Committees direct NGA, within 60 days of       enactment of this Act, to brief the Committees, to identify       all NGA developed software programs and explain why they are       being developed organically instead of leveraging       commercially available products.      Critical Skills Recruiting for Automation.         Although cutting edge sensors have provided the IC and       Department of Defense with exquisite imagery, full motion       video (FMV), and wide area motion imagery (WAMI),       intelligence analysts are unable to keep pace with the volume       of data being generated. This demands a transformation in the       way the intelligence enterprise processes, organizes, and       presents data. For that reason, the Committees fully support       the NGA's efforts to attract, recruit, and retain a highly       competent workforce that can acquire and integrate new data       automation tools.        Therefore, the Committees direct NGA, within 60 days of       enactment of this Act, to brief the congressional       intelligence and defense committees on NGA's efforts to       recruit critical skills such as mathematicians, data       scientists, and software engineers that possess critical       skills needed to support NGA's objectives in automation.      Common Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility.        The Committees have become aware of several major       impediments to companies performing work for agencies and       organizations  [[Page S7094]]       like the NRO. For example, businesses without ownership of a       SCIF find it very difficult to perform classified work.       Additionally, these small businesses are challenged with       basic obstacles such as becoming aware of classified work       opportunities because it is difficult to obtain access to the       IC's and DoD's classified marketplaces such as the       Acquisition Resource Center (ARC). Construction and       accreditation of SCIF spaces is cost-prohibitive for small       business and non-traditional government contractors.       Additionally, construction timeline often exceeds the       period of performance of a contract.        A modern trend for innovative and non-traditional       government contractors is the increased use of co-working       space environments. Additionally, public and private entities       are partnering to create emerging regional innovation hubs to       help identify technology solutions and products in the       private sector that can be utilized by the IC and DoD. These       innovation hubs currently produce an agile, neutral, but       largely unclassified development environment.        Therefore, the Committees direct the DNI, within 90 days of       enactment of this Act, to brief the congressional       intelligence committees on the following:        1. Steps necessary to establish new `Common SCIFs' in areas       of high demand;        2. What approaches allow for SCIF spaces to be certified       and accredited outside of a traditional contractual       arrangement;        3. Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of issuing       Department of Defense Contract Security Specification (DD       Form 254s) to ``Facilities,'' as opposed to ``Contracts'';        4. Options for classified co-use and shared workspace       environments such as: innovation, incubation, catalyst, and       accelerator environments;        5. Pros and cons for public, private, government, or       combination owned classified neutral facilities; and        6. Any other opportunities to support those without       ownership of a SCIF effective access to a neutral SCIF.      Improving Use of the Unclassified Marketplaces.        Another area where the Committees have become aware of       major impediments for companies to perform work for agencies       and organizations like the NRO are unclassified marketplaces       such as the Acquisition Resource Center (ARC). Instead of       posting data to unclassified marketplaces, unclassified NRO       postings often refer to the classified side for critical yet       unclassified information. If the NRO is serious about       embracing commercial innovation, unclassified marketplace       postings should remain on the unclassified side.        Therefore, the Committees direct NRO, within 90 days of       enactment of this Act, to brief the Committees on options for       improving the unclassified marketplace process.      Satellite Servicing.        No later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the DNI, in consultation with the Secretary of       Defense, shall jointly provide the to the congressional       intelligence and defense committees a briefing detailing the       costs, risks, and operational benefits of leveraging       commercial satellite servicing capabilities for national       security satellite systems. The briefing shall include the       following:        1. A prioritized list, with a rationale, of operational and       planned assets of the Intelligence Community that could be       enhanced by satellite servicing missions;        2. The costs, risks, and benefits of integrating satellite       servicing capabilities as part of operational resilience; and        3. Potential strategies that could allow future national       security space systems to leverage commercial in-orbit       servicing capabilities where appropriate and feasible.      Commercial RF Mapping and SAR.        U.S. commercial companies are now offering space-based       geolocation and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) analysis of       radio frequency (RF) emitters as well as synthetic aperture       radar (SAR) products. These companies can identify, locate,       and analyze previously undetected activity, providing new       insights for U.S. national security and defense. The IC       currently has contracts that leverage commercial electro-      optical satellites, however it does not have a program in       place to take full advantage of these emerging commercial       space-based RF GEOINT and SAR capabilities.        Therefore, the Committees direct the NRO and NGA to brief       the Committees on how it will leverage these commercial       companies in Fiscal Year 2020 and beyond, to include funding       for, as well as testing and evaluation efforts.      Commercial Remote Sensing.         The Committees support efforts to establish a light-touch       regulatory structure that enables the rapidly evolving       commercial space-based imagery, RF sensing, and radar       industry markets to promote U.S. leadership in these areas.       However, the Committees also support the needs of the U.S.       Government to protect both IC and DoD personnel and assets.       The Committees believe there can be a balance that supports       both national security interests and the promotion of U.S.       innovation and leadership.        Therefore, the Committees direct the DNI, in consultation       with the Secretary of Defense, to brief the Committees within       60 days of the date of enactment of the Act, on efforts that       help address this balance and which streamline the IC and DoD       involvement in the rapidly evolving U.S. commercial space-      based imagery, RF sensing, and radar industries.      Deception Detection Techniques.        The U.S. Government does not have sufficient security       screening capabilities available to determine deception in       individuals that intend to harm the United States. The       polygraph has been an effective investigative tool to detect       deception, but the cost and time required to administer a       polygraph examination is a major cause for security clearance       backlogs, and often limits the frequency of periodic       examinations to every 5-7 years. Entities within DoD and the       IC including DIA, Special Operations Command, NGA, Defense       Counterintelligence and Security Agency, U.S. Air Force and       others have expressed a desire to begin piloting new systems       such as ocular deception detection systems. However, progress       is being hindered by DoD Directive 5210.91 and ODNI Security       Agent Directive 2, which direct some oversight of new       deception detection technologies to the DoD National Center       of Credibility Assessment (NCCA), which does not have       sufficient budget or other resources to expeditiously       evaluate non-polygraph technologies.        Therefore, the Committees direct the DNI in coordination       with the DoD to provide the congressional intelligence and       defense committees with a briefing on what steps they are       taking to ensure pilot programs are established to evaluate       these new technologies to help reduce our backlog, improve       efficiency, and reduce overall cost. Pilot programs shall       evaluate current and emerging technologies to efficiently and       rapidly verify the accuracy and truthfulness of statements of       candidates for employment within the DoD/IC, including for       interim security clearances, for periodic screening of       cleared DoD/IC personnel, to screen foreign national       collaborators and contractors overseas to prevent ``Green-on-      Blue'' attacks, for immigration screening and for other       purposes.      List of Foreign Entities That Pose a Threat to Critical           Technologies.        The Committees direct the DNI, in consultation with the       Secretary of Defense, to identify, compose, and maintain a       list of foreign entities, including governments,       corporations, nonprofit and for-profit organizations, and any       subsidiary or affiliate of such an entity, that the Director       determines pose a threat of espionage with respect to       critical technologies or research projects, including       research conducted at institutions of higher education.        Maintenance of this list will be critical to ensuring the       security of the most sensitive projects relating to U.S.       national security, such as defense and intelligence-related       research projects. The initial list shall be available to the       head of each qualified agency funding applicable projects and       will include the following entities already identified as       threatening: Huawei Technologies Company, ZTE Corporation,       Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital       Technology Company, Dahua Technology Company, and Kaspersky       Lab. The DNI and the Secretary of Defense, or a delegate from       each agency, shall brief the findings to the congressional       intelligence and defense committees no later than 180 days       after the enactment of the Act.      Protection of National Security Research.        The Committees believe that institutes of higher learning,       laboratories, and other entities and organizations play       critical roles in advancing national security within the U.S.       science and technology ecosystem that is charged with       delivering the best capabilities to the warfighter in the       near, mid, and long-term. The Committees understand that       near-peer competitors such as China and Russia attempt to       exploit and benefit from the open and collaborative global       research environment created by the Reagan Administration's       National Security Decision Directive 189 on the National       Policy on the transfer of Scientific, Technical and       Engineering Information. This directive established that the       products of ``fundamental research''--defined as ``basic and       applied research in science and engineering, the results of       which ordinarily are published and shared''--should remain       unrestricted.        The Committees are also aware that academia is not always       kept apprised by the interagency of a complete picture of       potential activities and threats in the research community,       such as improper technology transfer, intellectual property       theft, and cyber-attacks directly attributed to nation-state       governments. Elsewhere in this bill and report, the       Committees include measures to promote increased information       sharing across the interagency and with academia.        Therefore, the Committees direct the Secretary of Defense       to provide the congressional intelligence and defense       committees, within 90 days of enactment of the Act, a report       listing Chinese and Russian academic institutions that have a       history of improper technology transfer, intellectual       property theft, cyber espionage, or operate under the       direction of their respective armed forces or intelligence       agencies. The report should be in unclassified form, but may       contain a classified annex.      Investments in Scientific and Technological Intelligence.        The Committees remain interested in the continued efforts       of the DoD to improve scientific and technological       intelligence (S&TI) capabilities and tradecraft across the       Defense Intelligence Enterprise (DIE). The Committees       recognize S&TI is critical to strategic competition with       near-peer competitors by ensuring comprehensive understanding       of adversary capabilities and ability to inform development       of joint force  [[Page S7095]]       fifth-generation advanced weapons systems and other emerging       technologies.        Therefore, the Committees direct the USD(I) in       collaboration with the Director of the DIA, to provide a       briefing to the Committees and the congressional defense       committees within 75 days of enactment of the Act, on the       alignment of current and planned DIE S&TI investments and       activities to DoD operational and strategic requirements.        The briefing shall also include information on how the DoD       will continue the maturation of S&TI capabilities and       tradecraft across the DIE.      Intelligence Support to Defense Operations in the Information           Environment.        The Committees support DoD efforts to improve capabilities       and tradecraft to operate in the information environment. The       Committees are concerned about the Defense Intelligence       Enterprise's (DIE) ability to provide the information       operations community with all-source intelligence support,       consistent with the support provided to operations in other       domains.        Therefore, the Committees direct the USD(I), in       coordination with the Joint Staff's Director for Intelligence       and the DNI, to provide a briefing to the congressional       intelligence and defense committees within 30 days of       enactment of the Act, on intelligence support to information       operations. The briefing should include standardized defense       intelligence lexicon for intelligence preparation of the       battlefield for information operations, efforts to develop a       process to ensure the full scope of emerging defense       information operations threat requirements are structured to       be addressed through the entirety of DIE capabilities, and       how the DIE perceives the future of defense operations in the       information environment.        The briefing shall also include a description of how the       IC, through the National Intelligence Priorities Framework,       will account for a more dynamic use of defense intelligence       capabilities to augment and enhance support to DoD operations       in the information environment.      ROTC IC Recruitment Trial Program.        The Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program,       with units or affiliates at approximately 1,600 U.S. colleges       and universities, is DoD's largest commissioning source,       providing approximately 6,500 new active duty officers to the       military each year.        Officer candidates enrolled in ROTC programs must meet all       graduation requirements of their academic institutions,       enroll in military, naval, or aerospace education courses,       and attend summer military training, making them ideal       candidates for IC placement. Currently, ROTC cadets only have       the option to utilize their training by joining one of the       military services. The Committees believe the government can       find cost savings and provide a wider range of opportunities       to ROTC recruits by leveraging the ROTC's existing training       program for the IC.        Therefore, the Committees direct the USD(I), in       coordination with ODNI, to conduct a feasibility study on       creating a pathway for ROTC recruits to find employment in       the IC, on a reimbursable basis. The study should examine:        1. Pros and cons of instituting an ROTC IC recruitment       pipeline;        2. Approximate reimbursement cost per recruit; and        3. Legislative requirements for program execution.        The Committees direct that the study results be submitted       via report to the Committees and the congressional defense       committees within 90 days of enactment of the Act.      Explosive Ordinance Disposal Intelligence.        The Committees are concerned that the expertise of       Explosive Ordinance Disposal        (EOD) personnel is not adequately accessible and therefore,       not sufficiently utilized by the Defense Intelligence       Enterprise and IC to provide the combatant commands with the       required intelligence to identify, combat, and deter violent       extremism and other asymmetric threats.        Explosive ordnance includes all munitions, improvised       explosive devices, devices containing explosives,       propellants, nuclear fission or fusion materials, biological,       and chemical agents. The primary consumer of this information       are military tactical explosive ordnance disposal units that       employ the data for threat identification and neutralization.       However, the required analysis to determine appropriate       render-safe capabilities requires operational and strategic       intelligence to process and analyze the data, and data       management processes to promulgate the resulting information.       The Committees believe DoD should modernize the processes and       procedures to more comprehensively track, manage, and       coordinate the capability and capacity of EOD intelligence       within the IC and the DIE to support all levels of render-      safe capabilities.        Therefore, the Committees direct the USD(I), in       coordination with the ODNI, to provide a briefing to the       congressional intelligence and defense committees within 120       days of enactment of the Act on the capability and capacity       of EOD intelligence expertise across the DIE and IC. The       briefing shall include:        1. An assessment of the coordination and integration of       defense and national intelligence capabilities against EOD       intelligence requirements, to include a mitigation strategy       to address any identified gaps or deficiencies, information-      sharing challenges, or any other impediments to integration       of EOD expertise across the defense and intelligence       communities; and        2. An assessment of the technical skills needed to address       EOD intelligence requirements, while identifying any gaps or       deficiencies in current personnel hiring and training       structures, and a long-term plan to develop proficiency of       EOD intelligence expertise in the defense and intelligence       communities.      Information-Sharing Arrangements with India, Japan, and the           Republic of Korea.        International alliances and partnerships are critical to       the pursuit and sustainment of the United States national       security objectives, built upon foundations of shared values       and intent. The Committees recognize the importance of the       DoD sharing information with international allies and       partners in support of the planning and execution of the       National Defense Strategy, as allies and third-party       international partners enhance strategic stability across the       Department's purview while increasing effectiveness of       operations. The Committees believe the mechanisms to share       information across the ``Five Eyes'' alliance continue to       mature through established exercises, exchange of personnel,       and virtual data sharing, while that cooperation is       potentially less robust with third-party partners.        The Committees support the roles and contributions of       third-party partners such as India, Japan, and the Republic       of Korea, and recognizes their ongoing contribution toward       maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.       The Committees are interested in understanding the policies       and procedures governing the collaboration and information       sharing with India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the       ``Five Eyes'' allies, and whether opportunities exist to       strengthen those arrangements.        Therefore, the Committees direct the Under Secretary of       Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)), in coordination with the       ODNI, to provide a briefing to the congressional intelligence       and defense committees within 60 days of enactment of the       Act, on the benefits, challenges, and risks of broadening the       information-sharing mechanisms between India, Japan, the       Republic of Korea, and the ``Five Eyes'' allies.      Transitioning the Function of Background Investigations to           the Department of Defense.        Executive Order 13869 transitions the background       investigation functions of the Federal Government from the       Office of Personnel Management (OPM), National Background       Investigations Bureau, to the DoD, Defense       Counterintelligence and Security Agency. The Committees       recognize the importance of ensuring timely and efficient       background investigations to overcome workforce staffing       challenges of cleared individuals across the whole of       government and private sector, and to vet personnel who come       into contact with the Department's personnel, installations,       and technology. The Committees are aware of the temporary       establishment of the Personnel Vetting Transformation Office       in the OUSD(I) to manage the transition of this activity from       OPM to the Department and improve the processes and       procedures related to vetting personnel for clearances across       the whole of government and private sector.        However, the Committees are concerned about the potential       risks to personnel management and mission such a transfer may       present, and believes that appropriate protections of civil       liberties and privacy must be prioritized throughout the       transition, through the implementation of modern and       efficient vetting measures. The Committees recognize the       Department's leadership, through sharing best practices with       ODNI, in reforming the vetting process using modern       techniques such as continuous evaluation, and expects regular       updates on the Department's progress in addressing the       current background investigations backlog.        Therefore, the Committees direct the USD(I), in       coordination with the Director of the Defense       Counterintelligence and Security Agency, to provide a       briefing to the congressional intelligence and defense       committees within 90 days of enactment of the Act, on how the       DoD will transfer the background investigation mission and       establish an effective personnel vetting capability to       provide for the security of the Department, while maintaining       the civil liberties and privacy protections of personnel       under consideration to receive a clearance.      Joint Intelligence Operations Center Staffing.        The Committees recognize the evolving operational and       strategic priorities of the DoD will impact Defense       Intelligence Enterprise capabilities and resources. The       Committees recognize the ongoing efforts by the USD(I) to       comply with direction specified by the John. S. McCain       National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019       (Public Law 115-232) to reduce and prevent imbalances in       priorities and mitigate against insufficient or misaligned       resources within the Defense Intelligence Enterprise.        While the Committees support the efforts by the USD(I) to       create efficiencies across the Defense Intelligence       Enterprise organizations, to include the Service Intelligence       Centers and combatant command Joint Operations Intelligence       Centers, and enable those elements to plan and posture       staffing requirements accordingly, the Committees are       concerned that the shifts in current and future resourcing       lack coherence to support the global mandate of the       Department.        Therefore, the Committees direct the USD(I), in       coordination with DIA, to provide  [[Page S7096]]       a briefing to the congressional intelligence and defense       committees within 90 days of enactment of the Act on how the       OUSD(I) and DIA are managing resourcing requirements to the       combatant command Joint Intelligence Operations Centers to       meet current and future needs of the combatant commanders and       DoD.      China's Biological Weapons Program.        The Committees remain interested in ensuring the Defense       Intelligence Enterprise is providing timely, accurate, and       effective intelligence to support information needs of the       DoD, and are aware of a recent GAO report on long-range       emerging threats facing the United States that highlighted       potential pursuit by near-peer competitors of biological       weapons using genetic engineering and synthetic biology.        Therefore, the Committees direct the USD(I), in       coordination with the Director of the DIA, to provide a       briefing to the congressional intelligence and defense       committees within 30 days of enactment of the Act with an       assessment of China's current and projected biological       weapons program, the risks presented to the joint force, and       the mitigation strategies to protect U.S. military forces       against said threats.      Machine-assisted Analytic Rapid Repository System Government           Accountability Office Review.        The re-emergence of great power competition will stress       DIA's ability to provide foundational military intelligence       for the IC and warfighters. As such, the Committees are       supportive of DIA's intent to replace the Modernized       Integrated Database (MIDB) with the Machine-assisted Analytic       Rapid Repository System (MARS).        However, the Committees are concerned that MARS's       development and procurement will entail a complex and       extensive transformation that will impact the DIA's delivery       of foundational military intelligence.        Therefore, the Committees direct the GAO to provide a       report to the congressional intelligence and defense       committees within one year of enactment of the Act that       describes:        1. The envisioned users and customer base and how they will       use MARS;        2. An assessment of the transition plan from MIDB to MARS       with input from current and historic MIDB users, as well as       customers;        3. An assessment of the resources necessary to fully       implement MARS, to include funding and personnel       implications;        4. An assessment of DIA's acquisition strategy for MARS to       include the use of any rapid acquisition or prototyping       authorities; and        5. The challenges DIA has identified that it will face in       transitioning from MIDB to MARS and whether its migration       plans are sufficient for addressing these challenges.        The Committees expect DIA's full cooperation with the GAO       study.      Update on the DIA Strategic Approach.        In September 2018, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)       adopted a Strategic Approach to enhance workforce       development, improve foundational military intelligence data       management, address perennial intelligence issues and realign       roles and missions. Improvements in these issue areas will       enhance the Agency's ability to support both the National       Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy.        The Committees support the DIA's initiative to improve       those structures it assesses are critical to providing       warfighters the information needed to prevent and, if       necessary, decisively win wars, such as intelligence on       foreign militaries' capabilities.        Therefore, the Committees direct DIA to provide quarterly       briefings, beginning 45 days after enactment of the Act, to       the congressional intelligence and defense committees on its       efforts to enhance workforce development, improve       foundational military intelligence data management, address       perennial intelligence issues, and realign roles and       missions.      Report on Chinese Efforts Targeting Democratic Elections and           U.S. Alliances and Partnerships and Strategy to Counter           Chinese Election Interference.        The Committees direct the DNI, in coordination with the       Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the       Secretary of Homeland Security, to provide a report to the       Committees, the congressional defense committees, the House       Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Senate Committee on Foreign       Relations, the House Committee on Homeland Security, and the       Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs on the Chinese government's influence operations and       campaigns targeting democratic elections.        The report shall be divided into two sections, which       respectively address influence operations and campaigns       targeting: (1) recent and upcoming elections in the United       States (dating back to January 1, 2017), and (2) military       alliances and partnerships of which the United States is a       member. The report should also include a strategy to counter       these activities. The Committees further direct the Secretary       of Defense to provide an interim report within 30 days of       enactment of the Act, and a final report within a year of       enactment of the Act.        The report shall be unclassified and appropriate for       release to the public but may include a classified annex. At       a minimum, the report should include:        1. An assessment of China's objectives in influence       operations and campaigns targeting democratic elections and       military alliances and partnerships of which the United       States is a member, and how such objectives relate to the       China's broader strategic aims;        2. The United States' strategy and capabilities for       detecting, deterring, countering, and disrupting such Chinese       influence operations (including recommended authorities and       activities) and campaigns and a discussion of the DoD's and       the IC's respective roles in the strategy;        3. A comprehensive list of specific Chinese state and non-      state entities involved in supporting such Chinese influence       operations and campaigns and the role of each entity in       supporting them;        4. An identification of the tactics, techniques, and       procedures used in previous Chinese influence operations and       campaigns;        5.

An identification of countries with democratic elections       systems that may be targeted in future Chinese influence       operations and campaigns and an assessment of the likelihood       that each such country will be targeted;        8. An identification of all U.S. military alliances and       partnerships that have been targeted by Chinese influence       operations and campaigns since January 1, 2017;        9. An identification of all U.S. military alliances and       partnerships that may be targeted in future Chinese influence       operations and campaigns and an assessment of the likelihood       that each such country will be targeted; and        10. An identification of tactics, techniques, and       procedures likely to be used in future Chinese influence       operations and campaigns targeting democratic elections and       military alliances and partnerships of which the United       States is a member.      Report on Russian Efforts Targeting Democratic Elections and           U.S. Alliances and Partnerships and Strategy to Counter           Russian Election Interference.        The Committees direct the DNI, in coordination with the       Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the       Secretary of Homeland Security, to provide a report to the       Committees, the congressional defense committees, the House       Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Senate Committee on Foreign       Relations, the House Committee on Homeland Security, and the       Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs on Russia's influence operations and campaigns       targeting democratic elections.        The report shall be divided into two sections, which       respectively address influence operations and campaigns       targeting: (1) recent and upcoming elections in the United       States (dating back to January 1, 2017) and (2) military       alliances and partnerships of which the United States is a       member. The report should also include a strategy to counter       these activities. The Committees further direct the Secretary       of Defense to provide an interim report within 30 days of       enactment of the Act, and a final report within a year of       enactment of the Act.        The report shall be unclassified and appropriate for       release to the public but may include a classified annex. At       a minimum, the report should include:        1. An assessment of Russia's objectives in influence       operations and campaigns targeting democratic elections and       military alliances and partnerships of which the United       States is a member, and how such objectives relate to       Russia's broader strategic aims;        2. The United States strategy and capabilities for       detecting, deterring, countering, and disrupting such Russian       influence operations (including recommended authorities and       activities) and campaigns and a discussion of the DoD's and       IC's respective roles in the strategy;        3. A comprehensive list of specific Russian state and non-      state entities involved in supporting such Russian influence       operations and campaigns and the role of each entity in       supporting them;        4.

UNCLASSIFIED DIRECTION RELATED TO SUBDIVISION 2       Management of Intelligence Community Workforce.        The Committees repeat direction from the Intelligence       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 that IC elements       should build, develop, and maintain a workforce appropriately       balanced among its civilian, military, and contractor       workforce sectors to meet the missions assigned to it in law       and by the president. Starting in Fiscal Year 2019, the       Committees no longer authorize position ceiling levels in the       annual Schedule of Authorizations.        The Committees look forward to working with the ODNI as it       develops an implementation strategy and sets standards for       workforce cost analysis tools.      Countering Russian Propaganda.        The Committees support the IC's role in countering Russian       propaganda and other active measures. The Committees are       committed to providing the appropriate legal authorities,       financial resources, and personnel necessary to address these       hostile acts. The Committees specifically find that language       capabilities are important to the IC's efforts in countering       Russia's hostile acts. The Committees encourage the IC to       commit considerable resources in the future to bolstering       officers' existing Russian language skills, recruiting       Russian language speakers, and training officers in Russian,       in particular key technical language skills. This effort will       require strategic planning both in recruiting and rotating       officers through language training. The Committees expect to       see these priorities reflected in future IC budget requests.      Protection of the Supply Chain in Intelligence Community           Acquisition Decisions.        The Committees continue to have significant concerns about       risks to the supply chain in IC acquisitions. The Committees       encourage the Supply Chain and Counterintelligence Risk       Management Task Force recommendations to support continued       efforts to develop an open, interoperable information       security-sharing platform to enable real-time cross-domain       sharing for the IC to effectively share and analyze       information on supply chain, cybersecurity vulnerabilities,       and counterintelligence risks.        The report to accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act       for Fiscal Year 2017 directed the DNI to review and consider       changes to Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 801       (``Acquisition'') to reflect the issuance of ICD 731       (``Supply Chain Risk Management'') in 2013 and the issues       associated with cybersecurity. It specifically recommended       the review examine whether to: expand risk management       criteria in the acquisition process to include cyber and       supply chain threats; require counterintelligence and       security assessments as part of the acquisition and       procurement process; propose and adopt new education       requirements for acquisition professionals on cyber and       supply chain threats; and factor in the cost of cyber and       supply chain security. This review was due in November 2017,       with a report on the process for updating ICD 801 in December       2017. The report was completed on June 18, 2018.        As a follow-on to this review, the Committees direct DNI to       address three other considerations: changes in the Federal       Acquisition Regulation that may be necessary; how changes       should apply to all acquisition programs; and how security       risks must be addressed across development, procurement, and       operational phases of acquisition. The Committees further       direct the DNI to submit a plan to implement necessary       changes within 60 days of completion of this review.      National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency use of VERA and VSIP           Authorities.        The Committees encourage the use by the National       Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) of Voluntary Early       Retirement Authority (VERA) and Voluntary Separation       Incentive Program (VSIP) offers to meet future goals of       building a workforce more attuned to automation of data       production, automation of analytic processes, and       establishment of development and operations (DevOps)       software development processes.        Therefore, the Committees direct the NGA to report to the       Committees, within 120 days of enactment of the Act, on its       use to date of VERA and VSIP incentives, to include how they       have been used to develop an acquisition cadre skilled in       ``DevOps'' software development processes, as well as a plan       for further use of these incentives. The report should       specify metrics for retooling its workforce, including how it       measures data literacy and computational skills in potential       hires, and an accounting of the numbers of new hires who have       met these higher standards.      Report on Engagement of National Reconnaissance Office with           University Community.        The Committees recognize that the survivability and       resiliency of United States satellites is critically       important to the United States intelligence and defense       communities. While the NRO engages with the university       community in support of basic research and developing an       education workforce pipeline to help advance new technologies       and produce skilled professionals, it can do more in this       regard to focus on space survivability.        Therefore, the Committees direct the NRO to report, within       120 days of enactment of the Act, on NRO's current efforts       and future strategies to engage with university partners that       are strategically located, host secure information       facilities, and offer a strong engineering curriculum, with a       particular focus on space survivability and resiliency. This       report should provide a summary of NRO's current and planned       university engagement programs, levels of funding, and       program research and workforce objectives and metrics. The       report should also include an assessment of the strategic       utility of chartering a University Affiliated Research Center       in this domain.      National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Facilities.        Consistent with section 2401 of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, the Committees       authorize the President's request for $447.8 million in       Fiscal Year 2019 for phase two construction activities of the       Next National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency West (N2W)       facility in St. Louis, Missouri. The Committees are pleased       that the second phase of this $837.2 million project was       included in the Fiscal Year 2019 President's budget.      Clarification of Oversight Responsibilities.        The Committees reinforce the requirement for all IC       agencies funded by the NIP to respond in a full, complete,       and timely manner to any request for information made by a       member of the congressional intelligence committees. In       addition, the Committees direct the DNI to issue guidelines,       within 90 days of enactment of the Act, to ensure that the       intent of section 501 of the National Security Act of 1947       (50 U.S.C. 3091) is carried out.      Clarification on Cooperation with Investigation on Russian           Influence in the 2016 Election.        The Committees continue to reinforce the obligation for all       IC agencies to cooperate in a full, complete, and timely       manner with the Committees' ongoing investigations into       Russian meddling in the 2016 Presidential election and       cooperation with the declassification process.      Supervisory Feedback as Part of Continuous Vetting Program.        The Committees direct the DNI to review the results of       ongoing pilot programs regarding the use of supervisory       feedback as part of the periodic reinvestigation and       continuous vetting process and report, within 180 days of       enactment of the Act, on the establishment of a policy for       its use across the IC.      National Security Threats to Critical Infrastructure.        The Committees are aware of significant threats to our       critical infrastructure and industrial control systems posed       by foreign adversaries. The sensitive nature of the       information related to these threats make the role of the IC       of vital importance to United States defensive efforts. The       Committees have grave concerns that current IC resources       dedicated to analyzing and countering these threats are       neither sufficient nor closely coordinated. The Committees       include provisions within this legislation to address these       concerns.      Framework for Cybersecurity and Intelligence Collection           Doctrine.        The Committees direct the ODNI, in coordination with       appropriate IC elements, to develop an analytic framework       that could support the eventual creation and execution of a       Government-wide cybersecurity and intelligence collection       doctrine. The ODNI shall provide this framework, which may       contain a classified annex, to the congressional intelligence       committees, within 180 days of enactment of the Act.        This framework shall include:        1. An assessment of the current and medium-term cyber       threats to the protection of the United States' national       security systems and critical infrastructure;        2. IC definitions of key cybersecurity concepts, to include       cyberespionage, cyber theft, cyber acts of aggression, and       cyber deterrence;        3. Intelligence collection requirements to ensure       identification of cyber actors targeting U.S. national       security interests, and to inform policy responses to cyber-      attacks and computer network operations directed against the       United States;        4. The IC's methodology for assessing the impacts of cyber-      attacks and computer network operations incidents directed       against the United States, taking into account differing       levels of severity of incidents;        5. Capabilities that the IC could employ in response to       cyber-attacks and computer network operations incidents,       taking into account differing levels of severity of       incidents;        6. A policy and architecture for sharing cybersecurity-      related intelligence with government, private sector, and       international partners, including existing statutory and       other authorities which may be exercised in pursuit of that       goal; and        7. Any necessary changes in IC authorities, governance,       technology, resources, and policy to provide more capable and       agile cybersecurity.  [[Page S7098]]           Inspector General of the Intelligence Community Role and           Responsibilities.        The position of the Inspector General of the Intelligence       Community (IC IG) was codified by the Intelligence       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. Among other things,       the IC IG's statutory purposes include ``conduct[ing]       independent reviews investigations, inspections, audits, and       reviews on programs and activities within the responsibility       and authority of the Director of National Intelligence;''       keeping the Committees fully and currently informed of       significant problems and deficiencies; and leading efforts of       inspectors general within the IC.        The Committees have included provisions intended to       strengthen the IC IG's role. The Committees will insist on       full cooperation from the Director, ODNI offices, as well as       those of inspectors general across the IC, in ensuring that       the IC IG's prescribed functions are carried out to the       fullest extent possible. The Committees further reiterate       Congress's intent that the IC IG is obligated to identify and       inform the Committees of significant problems and       deficiencies ``relating to'' all intelligence programs and       activities.        The Committees also remain seriously concerned about the       undermining of protections and rights afforded to       whistleblowers within the IC and the level of insight       congressional committees have into the handling of lawful       disclosures. Without exception, the Committees must be made       aware of lawful disclosures made to any inspector general       within the IC, consistent with provisions added to Title 50       by sections 5331-5335 of Subdivision 1 of the Act; and of all       lawful disclosures made pursuant to ICWPA and Title 50       procedures, which Intelligence Community personnel intend to       be submitted to the Committees. The Committees underscore in       the strongest terms that all elements of the IC are       obligated, as a categorical matter, to comply with both       existing law as well as direction provided elsewhere in the       Act and this Explanation, with respect to inspector general       and whistleblower matters.      Space Launch Facilities.        The Committees continue to believe it is critical to       preserve a variety of launch range capabilities to support       national security space missions, and encourage planned       launches such as the U.S. Air Force Orbital/Sub-Orbital       Program (OSP)-3 NRO-111 mission, to be launched in 2019 on a       Minotaur 1 from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at       Wallops Flight Facility. In the Intelligence Authorization       Act for Fiscal Year 2017, the Committees directed a brief       from the ODNI, in consultation with the DoD and the U.S. Air       Force, on their plans to utilize state-owned and operated       spaceports, which leverage non-federal public and private       investments to bolster United States launch capabilities and       provide access to mid-to-low or polar-to-high inclination       orbits for national security missions.        The Committees direct that the ODNI supplement this brief       with how state investments in these spaceports may support       infrastructure improvements, such as payload integration and       launch capabilities, for national security launches.      Acquisition Research Center Postings.        The Committees support a flexible NRO acquisition process       that allows the NRO to choose the most appropriate       contracting mechanism, whether for small research and       development efforts or large acquisitions. The NRO's       Acquisition Research Center (ARC), a classified contracting       and solicitation marketplace that NRO and other agencies use,       enables this flexible acquisition process for classified       efforts.        The Committees direct the NRO, within 60 days of enactment       of the Act, to brief the congressional intelligence and       defense committees on options for modifying ARC posting       procedures to ensure fair and open competition. Those options       should include ensuring that unclassified NRO solicitations       are posted on the unclassified FEDBIZOPS website, and       identifying ways to better utilize the ARC to encourage       contract opportunities for a more diverse industrial base       that includes smaller and non-traditional companies.      Ensuring Strong Strategic Analytical Tradecraft.        The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Office of       Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) has taken steps to improve       the quality of its analysis, to identify its core customers,       and to tailor its production to meet customer needs. The       Committees concur with I&A's implementation of analytic       standards and review mechanisms that have improved the       tradecraft behind I&A products. The bedrock of these efforts       has been the development of a yearly program of analysis       (POA) and key intelligence questions, which are essential       tools for providing a roadmap and boundaries for the office's       production efforts.        Therefore, the Committees direct the Office of I&A to       continue to prioritize, develop and hone its strategic       intelligence capabilities and production, including the       annual development of a POA. Within 90 day of enactment of       the Act, and on an annual basis thereafter for two years, I&A       shall brief the congressional intelligence committees on the       development and execution of its POA. These briefings should       provide an overview of the POA, how customer needs have been       incorporated into the POA, and an update on execution against       the POA.      Cyber/Counterintelligence Analysis.        DHS's Office of I&A's Counterintelligence Mission Center       analysis focuses on counterintelligence threats posed by       foreign technology companies and fills a gap in IC       intelligence production. Advanced technologies are       increasingly ubiquitous and necessary to the function of       modern society. Consequently, the scope of the threats from       countries intent on using these technologies as a vector for       collecting intelligence from within the United States will       continue to expand. The Office of I&A is positioned to       conduct a niche analysis critical to national security that       combines foreign intelligence with domestic threat       information.        The Committees strongly support I&A's Counterintelligence       Mission Center's continued focus on these topics and the       increased resources dedicated to this analysis in Fiscal Year       2019. Therefore, the Committees direct the I&A, in       coordination with ODNI, to provide an update within 90 days       of enactment of the Act on its recent analytic production       related to counterintelligence threats posed by foreign       technology companies, including a review of the countries and       companies that present the greatest risks in this regard.      Intelligence Support to the Export Control Process.        The Committees have significant concerns that China poses a       growing threat to United States national security, due in       part to its relentless efforts to acquire United States       technology. China purposely blurs the distinction between its       military and civilian activities through its policy of       ``military-civilian fusion,'' which compounds the risks of       diversion of United States technology to the Chinese       military.        The Committees conclude that the United States Government       currently lacks a comprehensive policy and the tools needed       to address this problem. China exploits weaknesses in       existing U.S. mechanisms aimed at preventing dangerous       technology transfers, including the U.S. export control       system, which is run by the U.S. Department of Commerce's       Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). The Committees have       specific concerns about the lack of adequate and effective IC       support to BIS's export license application review process       and believe more robust IC support could have prevented many       of the ill-advised technology transfers that have occurred in       recent years.        Therefore, the Committees directs the DNI to submit a plan,       within 120 days of enactment of the Act, to describe how the       IC will provide BIS with, at a minimum, basic but timely       analysis of any threat to U.S. national security posed by any       proposed export, re-export, or transfer of export-controlled       technology. The plan shall include detailed information on       the appropriate organizational structure, including how many       IC personnel would be required, where they would be located       (including whether they would be embedded at BIS to       coordinate IC support), and the amounts of necessary funding.       In formulating the plan, the DNI should study the ``National       Security Threat Assessment'' process that the National       Intelligence Council uses to inform the actions of the       Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The DNI       shall submit the plan to the congressional intelligence       committees in classified form.      Social Media.        The Committees encourage the IC, notably the Federal Bureau       of Investigation (FBI), to both continue and enhance its       efforts to assist in detecting, understanding, and warning       about foreign influence operations using social media tools       to target the United States. Additionally, within the scope       of the IC's authorities, and with all necessary protections       for U.S. person information, the Committees encourage the IC       to augment and prioritize these ongoing efforts.      Trade-Based Money Laundering.        Threats to our national security posed by trade-based money       laundering are concerning. Therefore, the Committees direct       the DNI, within 90 days of enactment of the Act, to submit a       report to the congressional intelligence committees on these       threats, including an assessment of the severity of the       threats posed to the United States' national security by       trade-based money laundering conducted inside and outside the       United States; an assessment of the scope of the financial       threats to the U.S. economy and financial systems posed by       trade-based money laundering; a description of how terrorist       financing and drug trafficking organizations are advancing       their illicit activities through the use of licit trade       channels; an assessment of the adequacy of the systems and       tools available to the Federal Government for combating       trade-based money laundering; and a description and       assessment of the current structure and coordination between       Federal agencies, as well as with foreign governments, to       combat trade-based money laundering. The report shall be       submitted in classified form with an unclassified summary to       be made available to the public.      Expansions of Security Protective Service Jurisdiction of the           Central Intelligence Agency.        The Committees direct the CIA, in connection with the       expansion of its security protective service jurisdiction as       set forth in section 6413 of Subdivision 2 of the Act, to       engage with Virginia state and local law enforcement       authorities to ensure that a memorandum of understanding,       akin to those in place at other agencies setting forth the       appropriate allocation of duties and responsibilities, is in       effect.  [[Page S7099]]           Unauthorized Disclosures of Classified Information.        The Committees are concerned by the recent widespread media       reports that purport to contain unauthorized disclosures of       classified information. Protecting the nation's secrets from       unauthorized disclosure is essential to safeguarding our       nation's intelligence sources and methods. An unlawful       disclosure of classified information can destroy sensitive       collection capabilities and endanger American lives,       including those individuals who take great personal risks to       assist the United States in collecting vital foreign       intelligence.        Federal law prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of       classified information, but enforcement is often lacking or       inconsistent. Accordingly, the Committees desire to better       understand the number of potential unauthorized disclosures       discovered and investigated on a routine basis. Moreover, the       Committees have little visibility into the number of       investigations initiated by each IC agency or the number of       criminal referrals to the Department of Justice. Accordingly,       section 6718 of Subdivision 2 of the Act requires all IC       agencies to provide the congressional intelligence committees       with a semi-annual report of the number of investigations of       unauthorized disclosures to journalists or media       organizations, including subsequent referrals made to the       United States Attorney General.        Additionally, the Committees wish to better understand the       role of IGs within elements of the IC, with respect to       unauthorized disclosures of classified information at those       elements.        Therefore, the Committees direct the IC IG, within 180 days       of enactment of the Act, to provide the congressional       intelligence committees with a report regarding the role of       IGs with respect to investigating unauthorized disclosures.       The report shall address: the roles of IC elements' security       personnel and law enforcement regarding unauthorized       disclosures; the current role of IGs within IC elements       regarding such disclosures; what, if any, specific actions       could be taken by such IGs to increase their involvement in       the investigation of such matters; any laws, rules or       procedures that currently prevent IGs from increasing their       involvement; and the benefits and drawbacks of increased IG       involvement, to include potential impacts to IG's roles and       missions.      Presidential Policy Guidance.        The Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG) dated May 22, 2013,       and entitled ``Procedures for Approving Direct Action Against       Terrorist Targets Located Outside the United States and Areas       of Active Hostilities'' provides for the participation by       elements of the IC in reviews of certain proposed       counterterrorism operations. The Committees expect to remain       fully and currently informed about the status of the PPG and       its implementation.        Therefore, the Committees direct ODNI, within five days of       any change to the PPG, or to any successor policy guidance,       to submit to the congressional intelligence committees a       written notification thereof, that shall include a summary of       the change and the specific legal and policy justifications       for the change.      Centers for Academic Excellence.        The Committees commend the commitment demonstrated by the       program managers of the IC's Centers for Academic Excellence       (IC-CAE), IC agencies that sponsored CAE interns, and all       other personnel who contributed to the inaugural edition of       the CAE Internship Program in summer 2017.        The Committees expect the IC-CAE Program to build on this       foundation by showing measurable, swift progress, and       ultimately fulfilling Congress's intent that the Program       serve as a pipeline of the next generation of IC       professionals.        Therefore, the Committees direct that the IC take all       viable action to expand the IC-CAE Program by increasing, to       the fullest extent possible:        1. The number and racial and gender diversity of IC-CAE       interns;        2. The number of IC-CAE academic institutions and their       qualified internship candidates participating in the IC-CAE       Program; and        3. The number of IC elements that sponsor IC-CAE interns.      Report on Violent Extremist Groups.        Violent extremist groups like ISIS continue to exploit the       Internet for nefarious purposes: to inspire lone wolves; to       spread propaganda; to recruit foreign fighters; and to plan       and publicize atrocities. As a former Director of the       National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) has stated publicly:        [W]e need to counter our adversaries' successful use of       social media platforms to advance their propaganda goals,       raise funds, recruit, coordinate travel and attack plans, and       facilitate operations. . . . Our future work must focus on       denying our adversaries the capability to spread their       messages to at-risk populations that they can reach through       the use of these platforms.        Section 403 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2017 required the DNI, consistent with the       protection of sources and methods, to assist public and       private sector entities in recognizing online violent       extremist content--specifically, by making publicly available       a list of insignias and logos associated with foreign       extremist groups designated by the Secretary of State. The       Committees believe the IC can take additional steps.        Therefore, the Committees direct the Director of NCTC, in       coordination with other appropriate officials designated by       the DNI, within 180 days of enactment of the Act, to brief       the congressional intelligence committees on options for a       pilot program to develop and continually update best       practices for private technology companies to quickly       recognize and lawfully take down violent extremist content       online. Such briefing shall address:        1. The feasibility, risks, costs, and benefits of such a       program;        2. The U.S. Government agencies and private sector entities       that would participate; and        3. Any additional authorities that would be required by the       program's establishment.      South China Sea.        The South China Sea is an area of great geostrategic       importance to the United States and its allies. However,       China's controversial territorial claims and other actions       stand to undercut international norms and erode the region's       stability. It is thus imperative the United States uphold       respect for international law in the South China Sea.       Fulfilling that objective in turn will require an optimal       intelligence collection posture.        Therefore, the direct the DoD, in coordination with DNI,       within 30 days of enactment of the Act, to brief the       congressional intelligence and defense committees on known       intelligence collection gaps, if any, with respect to       adversary operations and aims in the South China Sea. The       briefing shall identify the gaps and whether those gaps are       driven by lack of access, lack of necessary collection       capabilities or legal or policy authorities, or by other       factors. The briefing shall also identify IC judgments that       assess which intelligence disciplines would be best-suited to       answer the existing gaps, and current plans to address the       gaps over the Future Years Defense Program.      Policy on Minimum Insider Threat Standards.        Executive Order 13587 and the National Insider Threat Task       Force established minimum insider threat standards. Such       standards are required for the sharing and safeguarding       of classified information on computer networks while       ensuring consistent, appropriate protections for privacy       and civil liberties. The Committees understand there are       policies in place to attempt implementation of such       standards; however, the Committees have found that several       elements of the IC have not fully implemented such       standards. Therefore, given the several high-profile       insider threat issues, the Committees emphasize the       importance of such minimums by statutorily requiring the       DNI to establish a policy on minimum insider threat       standards, consistent with the National Insider Threat       Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider       Threat Programs, and IC elements should expeditiously       establish their own policies and implement the DNI       guidance.        Further, referring to the directive language found in the       committee report accompanying H.R. 5515, the Fiscal Year 2019       NDAA reported by the House Armed Services Committee (HASC),       the Committees direct the Chief Management Officer to provide       a briefing to the congressional intelligence and defense       committees, no later than 90 days after enactment of the Act,       on the outcomes of its cost and technical analyses required       by this report, and the DoD's efforts to implement       enterprise-wide programs and policies for insider threat       detection, user activity monitoring, and cyber-attack       detection and remediation.      Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment.        The Committees remain supportive of the goals of       Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC       ITE) and the importance of the common, secure sharing       infrastructure it creates. The Committees further understand       that the path to implement a complex, technical environment       such as IC ITE needs to be sufficiently flexible and agile.       However, the Committees remain concerned with the lack of       consistency and substance in previous reports and briefings       on IC ITE. Therefore, section 6312 of Subdivision 2 of the       Act requires a long-term roadmap, business plan, and security       plan that shall be reported to the congressional intelligence       committees at least quarterly with additional notifications       as necessary.      Intelligence Community Chief Financial Officer.        The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 mandated       best practices for decision-making and accountability, as       well as improved decision-makers' access to reliable and       timely financial and performance information. The CFO Act, as       amended, requires that the chief financial officers of 24       departments and agencies ``report directly to the head of the       agency regarding financial management matters.'' Section 6404       of Subdivision 2 of the Act brings the ODNI in line with the       best practices implemented in the CFO Act.      Intelligence Community Chief Information Officer.        As codified in 44 U.S.C. 3506(a)(1)(A), each federal agency       head is responsible for ``carrying out the information       resources management activities to improve agency       productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness.'' Accordingly,       section 6405 of Subdivision 2 of the Act expresses the       Committee's intent to emphasize the importance of the IC       Chief Information Officer (CIO), as defined in 50 U.S.C.  [[Page S7100]]       3032(a), in assisting the DNI with information resource       management by requiring the IC CIO to report directly to the       DNI.      Central Intelligence Agency Subsistence for Personnel           Assigned to Austere Locations.        Section 6411 of Subdivision 2 of the Act permits the       Director of the CIA to allow subsistence for personnel       assigned to austere locations. Although the statute does not       define ``austere,'' the Committees believe that utilization       of this authority should be minimal. Therefore, within 180       days after the enactment of the Act, the CIA shall brief the       Committees on the CIA's definition of ``austere'' and the CIA       regulations in place governing this authority.      Collocation of Certain Department of Homeland Security           Personnel at Field Locations.        The Committees support DHS I&A's intent to integrate into       operations across the broader DHS enterprise. Accordingly,       section 6434 of Subdivision 2 of the Act requires I&A to       identify opportunities for collocation of I&A field officers       and to submit to the Committees a plan for their deployment.      Limitations on Intelligence Community Elements'           Communications with Congress.        Effective oversight of the IC requires unencumbered       communications between representatives of the agencies,       members of Congress, and congressional staff. The Committees       direct the DNI not to limit any element of the IC from having       interactions with the congressional intelligence committees,       including but not limited to, preclearance by the DNI of       remarks, briefings, discussions of agency resources or       authorities requirements, or mandatory reports to the DNI on       conversations with the Committees.      Intelligence Community Support to the National Vetting           Center.        On February 6, 2018, the President issued National Security       Policy Memorandum (NSPM)-9, ''Presidential Memorandum on       Optimizing the Use of Federal Government Information in       Support of National Vetting Enterprise.'' The memorandum       directs the DHS, in coordination with the ODNI and other       agencies, to establish the National Vetting Center. The       memorandum also requires agencies to ``provide the Center       access to relevant biographic, biometric, and related       derogatory information.'' It further directs DNI, in       coordination with the heads of relevant IC elements, to       ``establish a support element to facilitate, guide, and       coordinate all IC efforts to use classified intelligence and       other relevant information within the IC holdings in support       of the center.'' The Committees wish to obtain regular       updates and the most current information about the activities       of that support element.        Therefore, no later than 180 days after the enactment of       the Act and annually thereafter, the Committees direct the       DNI and the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at       DHS to brief the Committees on the status of IC support to       the National Vetting Center, as established by NSPM-9.      Update on Status of Attorney General-Approved U.S. Person           Procedures under Executive Order 12333.        The Committees acknowledge the difficult, labor-intensive       work undertaken by certain IC elements, to ensure the current       effectiveness of, and in some cases to substantially revise,       final Attorney General-approved procedures regarding the       collection, dissemination, and retention of United States       persons information. The Committees wish to better understand       the status of this project, throughout the IC.        Therefore, the Committees direct that, not later than 60       days after enactment of the Act, the DNI and the Attorney       General shall brief the Committees on the issuance of final,       Attorney General-approved procedures by elements of the IC.       Specifically, the briefing shall identify (1) any such       elements that have not yet issued final procedures; and (2)       with respect to such elements, the status of the procedures'       development, and any interim guidance or procedures on which       those elements currently rely.      Homegrown Violent Extremists Imprisoned in Department of           Defense Facilities.        The Committees are concerned about an evident gap in       information sharing about individuals imprisoned in DoD       facilities who are categorized by the FBI as homegrown       violent extremists (HVEs). A recent FBI report underscores       this gap, highlighting the case of an individual who has been       convicted and sentenced to death by a U.S. military court       martial and remains incarcerated in a U.S. military facility.       The Committees understand that, despite his incarceration,       this inmate openly communicates with the outside world       through written correspondence and has continued to inspire       extremists throughout the world. The Committees further       understand that the FBI is unable to determine the full scope       of this inmate's contacts with the outside world because only       a portion of his communications have been provided by the       DoD.        Therefore, no later than 180 days after the enactment of       the Act, the Committees direct the FBI to work with the DoD       to create a process by which the DoD provides to the FBI the       complete communications of individuals imprisoned in DoD       facilities and who are categorized by the FBI as HVEs.      Naming of Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters.        According to statute enacted in 1972, the current FBI       headquarters building in Washington, D.C. must be ``known and       designated'' as the ``J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building.'' That       tribute has aged poorly. It should be reconsidered, in view       of Hoover's record on civil liberties--including the effort       to disparage and undermine Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Even       today, Hoover's name evokes the FBI's sordid ``COINTELPRO''       activities.        The Committees believe Congress should consider repealing       the provision requiring the existing Pennsylvania Avenue       building to be known as the ``J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building.''       A new name should be determined, through a joint dialogue       among Bureau leadership, law enforcement personnel, elected       officials, and civil rights leaders.      Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math careers in Defense           Intelligence.        Referring to the directive language found in the committee       report accompanying H.R. 5515, the HASC-reported Fiscal Year       2019 NDAA, the Committees direct the Director of DIA to       provide, within 90 days after enactment of the Act, a       briefing to the congressional intelligence committees and the       congressional defense committees on a plan to develop a       Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math career program       that attracts and maintains the defense intelligence cadre of       Science and Technical Intelligence analysts to meet       tomorrow's threats.      Security and Intelligence Role in Export Control.        Referring to the directive language found in the committee       report accompanying H.R. 5515, the HASC-reported Fiscal Year       2019 NDAA, the Committees direct the Under Secretary of       Defense for Policy, in coordination with the USD(I), within       60 days of enactment of the Act, to brief the congressional       intelligence and defense committees, on security support to       export control.      Security Clearance Background Investigation Reciprocity.        Referring to the directive language found in the committee       report accompanying H.R. 5515, the HASC-reported Fiscal Year       2019 NDAA, the Committees direct the Secretary of Defense, in       coordination with the DNI and the Director of the Office of       Personnel Management, within 60 days of enactment of the Act,       to brief the Committees and the congressional defense       committees on efforts to ensure seamless transition of       investigations between authorized investigative agencies, as       required by law.        Further, referring to the directive language found in the       committee report accompanying H.R. 5515, the HASC-reported       Fiscal Year 2019 NDAA, the Committees direct the Secretary of       Defense, in coordination with the DNI and the Director of the       Office of Personnel Management, within 90 days of enactment       of the Act, to brief the congressional intelligence       committees on efforts to ensure reciprocity is a       consideration for implementation of continuous evaluation and       continuous vetting across the federal government.      Foreign Influence Task Force.        The IC has warned of active measures taken by foreign       actors to interfere with and undermine the U.S. democratic       process, most recently and brazenly by the Russian       Federation. The Committees appreciate FBI efforts to confront       this challenge in part through creation of its Foreign       Influence Task Force. The Committees believes that       confronting foreign influence directed at the United States       is of fundamental importance, and thus desire to engage in a       close and regular dialogue with the FBI about the task       force's activities.        Therefore, the Committees direct the FBI to provide       detailed, quarterly briefings to the Committees regarding the       task force's activities, to include its progress and any       significant challenges.      Enhanced Oversight of IC Contractors.        A topic of sustained congressional intelligence committee       interest has been improving the federal government's       oversight of IC acquisition and procurement practices,       including activities by poorly performing IC contractors.        A framework exists to ensure that IC elements do not award       IC contracts to businesses that engage in negligence or even       gross negligence, consistently fail to appropriately       safeguard classified information, maintain poor financial       practices, or other issues. For example, an IC element may       maintain a list of contractors of concern, in order to ensure       that proposals from such contractors are rejected or       subjected to additional scrutiny. The Committees wish to       build on these practices and are concerned about the existing       framework's adequacy.        Therefore, the Committees direct all elements of the IC, to       the fullest extent consistent with applicable law and policy,       to share with one another information about contractors with       track records of concern--such as the commission of       negligence or gross negligence in the performance of IC       contracts, or the repeated failure to appropriately safeguard       classified information in a fashion that the contractor       reasonably could have been expected to prevent.        Additionally, no later than 30 days after enactment of the       Act, the DNI shall brief the Committees on the authorities of       IC elements with respect to contractors with track records of       concern -- before, during, and after procurement. An       objective of the briefing will be to discuss information       sharing practices in this regard, and to identify specific       areas where the oversight framework can be strengthened.

Section 5303. Expansion of scope of protections for           identities of covert agents.         Section 5303 amends the definition of ``covert agent'' in       the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3126(4)) to       protect the identities of all undercover intelligence       officers, and United States citizens whose relationship to       the United States is classified, regardless of the location       of the individuals' government service or time since       separation from government service.

Section 5306. Intelligence community public-private talent           exchange.        Section 5306 requires the DNI to develop policies,       processes, and procedures to facilitate IC personnel       rotations to the private sector and vice versa, to bolster       skill development and collaboration. Section 5306 further       sets forth requirements with which agreements governing such       rotations must address, including terms and conditions,       including termination, duration, employment status, pay, and       benefits.
