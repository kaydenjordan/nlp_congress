 Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the special occasion  of having our Navy chaplain, Rear Admiral Todd, appear to give the  invocation, and I do so noticing a ministerial hat trick in our  Presider and our Senate Chaplain and our Navy chaplain all being on the  floor as we open the session on this wonderful Thursday.   The Navy Chaplain Corps was created on November 29, 1775, with an  order by the Continental Congress that there would be divine services  on the ships of the U.S. Navy, and that was 248 years ago.   And often in the Senate, around the anniversary of the establishment  of the Navy chaplaincy, the Navy chaplain is invited to come and open a  Senate session. We are a little bit after November 29, but it is a very  nice occasion to welcome Admiral Todd here.   Admiral Todd is a special individual. All chiefs of Navy chaplains  are special, as we know from our own Senate Chaplain Reverend Black,  but--get this--here is a little bit about Admiral Todd's career: He is  a native of Seattle. He joined the Navy Reserves in 1986 and then was a  reservist at the same time as he was pastoring churches. He superseded  to Active Duty in 1994 and has been in the Navy chaplaincy business  since then--a distinguished career.   But here is a mark that he holds that I am not sure anyone has or  ever will hold. He has been the chief chaplain not only of the Navy but  the 10th chaplain of the U.S. Coast Guard and the 20th chaplain of the  U.S. Marine Corps before becoming the 28th chaplain of the U.S. Navy-- truly a servant whose service has spread far and wide to incorporate  not only those who are in our military but also our civilians--and  especially their families.   So this is a special occasion and a good one that we should do  annually to allow the Navy chaplain to open the Senate session in  memory of this 248-year tradition. But in particular, I want to express  my gratitude to Admiral Todd for the great service that he has provided  to thousands and thousands of our sailors, of our marines, of our  coasties, and their families.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
