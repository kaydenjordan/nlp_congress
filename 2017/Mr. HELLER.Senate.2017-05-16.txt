 Mr. President, I, too, stand in honor of National Police  Week. I want to thank my two previous colleagues from Utah and North  Dakota for their heartfelt tributes to the men and women in blue and  the hard work they do in protecting us every day.   National Police Week was established in Congress in 1962. National  Police Week is an opportunity to pay tribute to law enforcement  officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. It is also an  opportunity to recognize and thank the members of our law enforcement  community in Nevada and throughout the country.   Each day our law enforcement officers put themselves at risk to  protect our families and to protect our communities. Their courage,  selflessness, and commitment to serve is a reflection of what makes  this country so great; that is, their willingness to answer the call-- without being asked--to put the welfare of others over themselves.   This commitment doesn't come without tremendous sacrifice. I was  reminded of that earlier this month at the 30th annual James D. Hoff  Peace Officer Memorial in Reno.   The James Hoff Peace Officer Memorial is a tribute to Nevada law  enforcement officers killed in the line of duty.  [[Page S2953]]  The memorial also recognizes officers who were placed in danger and  survived. Named after Reno Police Officer James Hoff, who was killed in  1979 by the suspects he was investigating, the memorial hosts an annual  ceremony attended by State and local officials and members of the law  enforcement community. It is always a privilege to attend this annual  event honoring the heroism of fellow Nevadans whose names and legacies  are enshrined in this memorial.   At this year's ceremony, we honored and celebrated the life of  Detective Chad Parque, who served with the North Las Vegas Police  Department for 10 years. At just 32 years old, Detective Parque  tragically lost his life after his department vehicle was struck head- on by another vehicle earlier this year. Detective Parque is survived  by his wife, children, and siblings, and mourned by all of those who  had the privilege to know him.   In describing Detective Parque, a fellow law enforcement officer  said:         He was a ten-year officer and you could see the fire in his       eyes as if he had just signed on. He loved his community.    He served with passion and dignity. He will never be forgotten for  the many contributions to North Las Vegas and to our great State.   His plaque is now alongside other members of Nevada's law enforcement  community who were enshrined on this memorial from past years and whose  stories continue to inspire all of us.   In 2016, at least 144 law enforcement officers across this country  lost their lives in the line of duty, a sharp increase from the  previous year.   Let's not forget that behind the names--the many names--of those who  have fallen are the people, spouses, children, and parents who may not  have had a chance to say good-bye. Most of us will never know their  pain, but we are deeply appreciative of their unwavering support for  their community. While there is nothing we can do to bring back those  who died in the line of duty, I am committed to doing everything I can  at the Federal level to try to prevent it from happening to one more  officer and one more family.   I am proud to support the Back the Blue Act, legislation that  increases penalties for killing law enforcement officials. The bill  ensures that anyone who purposely targets law enforcement should, and  would, face justice for that crime.   The Nevada law enforcement community has my full support this Police  Week--and every week and every day, each year they are on the job.   To all our law enforcement officials, we are all indebted to you and  your families for all your sacrifices, and I am personally and  sincerely grateful for your dedication to the people of Nevada.   To our protectors, our peacekeepers, and those who are first to  answer the call for help and who run toward, not away, from danger, we  thank you, and we honor you.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
