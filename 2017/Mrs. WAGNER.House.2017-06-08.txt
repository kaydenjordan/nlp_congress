 Mr. Chairman, I am proud to stand before you today to  speak on H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act.   I would like to thank Chairman Hensarling and all my colleagues on  the House Financial Services Committee for their hard work on this  legislation, including holding 145 hearings on Dodd-Frank and the  CHOICE Act.   For nearly 10 years following the financial crisis, our country  witnessed one of the weakest recoveries of our lifetimes as Dodd-Frank  held small businesses and families hostage and prevented our economy  from growing. Now it is harder for families to qualify for a mortgage,  obtain an auto loan, and access other forms of credit that they depend  on every single day.  [[Page H4720]]    The only beneficiaries from Dodd-Frank have been Washington  bureaucrats, who have grown more powerful; and big banks have only  grown bigger at the expense of your personal freedoms and your freedom  to make your own financial decisions. Dodd-Frank has failed the  American people.   Instead, the CHOICE Act, which stands for creating hope and  opportunity for investors, consumers, and entrepreneurs, represents a  better way from this Republican Congress that will provide Americans  with the financial opportunities that they deserve. The CHOICE Act is  about helping Main Street, not Wall Street, and will increase lending  in our communities, open up our economy, end taxpayer-funded bank  bailouts, and hold Wall Street and Washington accountable.   It will allow us to impose the toughest penalties on Wall Street  executives who engage in fraud, deception, and self-dealing. Unlike  before, executives who commit financial crimes will be held  accountable, rather than innocent taxpayers and shareholders.   Americans deserve relief from the regulatory burden and lack of  financial options that Dodd-Frank has created. Americans deserve the  ``Right'' CHOICE Act.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 10.
