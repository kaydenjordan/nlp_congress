 Mr. Speaker, I am so delighted to be joined  this evening by women members of the Democratic Women's Caucus.   The chairwoman, Lois Frankel, is here with us this evening. Vice  Chairs Ayanna Pressley and Kathy Manning and other members of the  Democratic Women's Caucus, Representatives Sydney Kamlager-Dove and  Emilia Sykes, are with us here this evening, as well.   We are celebrating Women's History Month. What we thought we would do  today is talk about many of the women who have come to Congress and  made history and a big difference in this very male-oriented  institution.   We call your attention to this chart. It starts here at about 1917,  quite frankly, when Jeannette Rankin was the first woman elected to  Congress, all the way back to 1789. We finally elected a woman in 1917.  She served 1 year, not even one term, because she voted against the  war.   Here we are today. Within 1 hour, Mr. Speaker, we won't have a chance  to talk about all of these women, but I think that the women we have  chosen to speak about are women who found that they had the same  profound challenges in this institution. They were highly educated and  very intelligent, yet they faced tremendous hurdles. They overcame them  and made a big difference in our institution.    We are going to talk about Bella Abzug from New York tonight. We are  going to talk about now-Senator Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin, who was a  Member of this body. We are going to talk about Patsy Mink and now- Secretary Marcia Fudge from Ohio, who was Representative Fudge. We are  going to talk about Shirley Chisholm. We may mention a thing or two  about Nancy Pelosi from California, who is our Speaker Emerita.   We are going to talk about Barbara Jordan; Lucille Roybal-Allard;  Stephanie Tubbs Jones; Senator Mazie Hirono, who was a Member of this  body before she went over to the Senate; Pat Schroeder, who just  recently passed; and Geraldine Ferraro.   We are going to talk about now-Secretary Deb Haaland, who was a  former House Member, as the first Native American Cabinet Secretary but  also one of the two first Native Americans to be elected to this body,  along with Representative Sharice Davids.   We are going to talk about the first Muslim women to join our body,  Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois  Frankel), the chairwoman of the Democratic Women's Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, that was great. I thank  Representative Frankel so much for that. I must say that from afar  Bella Abzug influenced me. I knew who she was. I knew about her helping  to create the feminist movement, and it empowered me as a woman.   With regard to Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, let me just say,  not only was she--it was pointed out, of course, she was the first  Mexican woman to enter this institution, but it is not enough to just  be the first. She came here and she led the way on things like the  Violence Against Women Act. She fought and used her post as a cardinal  to protect the interests of children, all children. We will truly miss  her.   She mentioned Senator Tammy Baldwin--no, she didn't mention her. She  mentioned Senator Mazie Hirono. She was a former House Member, now in  the Senate. She went to the Senate and was the first Asian woman  elected to the Senate. She is also the first Buddhist who entered this  body.   Diversity is important so that all voices are heard in this body. I  thank Lois Frankel for lifting up these women.   Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased at this time to introduce one of the  people who is younger than me, but that I get so much--much younger  than me. I guess people are laughing because that is really not hard to  tell. She is someone who inspires, someone who has already made her  mark in this body, and she is one of our vice chairwomen of the  Democratic Women's Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Pressley).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Pressley  so much, what a great tribute to a great woman.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that I am so happy to welcome to the podium  another woman who is fairly new, but I tell you, she's a powerhouse and  full of energy and ideas, here ready to do the work from North  Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Manning), one of our vice chairs of the Democratic Women's Caucus.                                time  2000     I thank Representative Manning so much for  that eloquent presentation, and I just want to thank the gentlewoman  for sticking around and believing that someday we would get around to  her.   Mr. Speaker, I am so delighted to introduce a new Member from  California. She has succeeded our former colleague, Karen Bass, who is  now the mayor of Los Angeles. When Karen Bass left, she told us: Don't  worry, don't bother trying to miss me, because I am sending in the best  and the brightest from my community, and she is going to hit the ground  running.   She certainly has been a great colleague.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative  Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove. Let me just say I knew all of those women  from California, and they were California dreams, all of them. I  remember when Ambassador Diane Watson became an ambassador, wherever  she would take you, she would never ever, ever meet a stranger.   She could stay up all night and all day. I don't know where she got  the energy from, but she was a people person. When she left, she told  us: Don't worry, I am sending you someone great, and she gave us Karen  Bass . Just like Karen Bass said: Don't worry, I am sending you someone  great, and we got Representative Kamlager-Dove. We are very, very  pleased.   I am so delighted to introduce our next speaker. I met her when she  was a candidate. I knew immediately that she would win her race in Ohio  because of her determination and her resolve to do it. She didn't have  a lot of people at that time who were saying: Oh, yeah, come on. She  didn't have a big fundraising base. But I knew that she was resolute to  get here. Already she is speaking up, asking questions, and taking  names.   Mr. Speaker, this is not the last time you will see Representative  Emilia Sykes, so let me be the first to introduce you to her.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Sykes).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Sykes for  that very enlightening presentation of the 13 women who have been  elected to Congress from the great State of Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, we have spoken about most of the women that we have on  this poster board here. We named this little session ``A Dozen Women  and Then Some'' because, as you have heard this evening, there are  many, many, many more women that we could have talked about but we  could not squeeze it all into one hour.   I would be remiss if I did not mention a couple of other women.  Senator Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin. Senator Tammy Baldwin served in  this body before she was elected to the State senate. She was the first  openly LGBTQ person to be elected to Congress. Being her authentic  self, not shying away from who she was, and still she was elected to  the United States Senate, to the U.S. Congress.  [[Page H1401]]    Before then, ladies and gentlemen, Tammy Baldwin served on the county  board in Madison, Wisconsin, and before that she was appointed to the  Common Council to fill an aldermanic vacancy because of someone's  absence, and didn't have to face the voters because that is just how  much they trusted Tammy Baldwin.   Tammy Baldwin has a resume that is too long to share with you this  evening, but let me tell you some of the things that I rejoice about.  Tammy Baldwin was the key legislator that put the provision into the  Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, to allow parents to keep  their children on their insurance plan until they were age 26.   She did that because of her own lived experience as a person who was  in the custody of her grandparents, and her grandparents were unable to  put her on their insurance. They had to pay out of pocket thousands and  thousands of dollars while Tammy Baldwin was in the hospital for  months. It is that lived experience that gave Tammy Baldwin a passion  for healthcare that she brought here to this body.   Now millions of young people who are struggling to get an education,  to go to college, who perhaps don't have careers that have come  together yet, can have health insurance because of the Affordable Care  Act. We can thank Tammy Baldwin for that.   Tammy Baldwin was also able just recently to pass a bill that was  signed into law to provide for same-sex marriage, something that has  been a controversial issue in Congress for years, but Tammy Baldwin  with her very soft demeanor and very understated presentation was able  to bring together. I thank Tammy Baldwin for being who she is.   Another person who was not an openly gay person was Barbara Jordan,  but Barbara Jordan really spoke truth to power during the Nixon  administration. Unlike what we have gone through recently, her service  on the Judiciary Committee at that time was one of the most powerful  voices that enabled the country to realize that they needed to end this  Presidency on a bipartisan basis. Mr. Speaker, I thank Barbara Jordan  for speaking truth to power.   A person who just passed away recently was Pat Schroeder. I mean, she  was Ms. Feminist. She was someone who kept things on boiling hot all  the time in this body. She was very antiwar, and she ran on an antiwar  platform. She ran on a platform of providing childcare for women, and  far before it was talked about, she spoke out on the environment.   She was one of the first people to actually have very small children  when she was elected, and someone asked her, ``Pat, how can you raise  children and be a Congresswoman?'' She said, ``Well, you know, I have  got a uterus and a brain, and I use them both.''    She spent 24 years in the House from Colorado. She was the first  person to help get family and medical leave passed, and I think that  that was probably her signature achievement in this body. After she  left, she wrote a book, ``24 Years of House Work . . . and the Place Is  Still a Mess.'' We ought to lean into Pat Schroeder and get busy  cleaning up the House.   Geraldine Ferraro was another Member of this body; and, of course,  she was the first woman who was a Vice Presidential nominee. She was  yet another woman who dared to step into spaces where women had never  tread. I thank Geraldine Ferraro for her fierce belief in women.   I would be remiss if I did not mention a few women who are still  serving in this body. One is Representative Sharice Davids. Sharice  Davids is one of the first Native American women, alongside Deb  Haaland, elected to this body. When I met Deb Haaland when she was  running for Congress, after I hugged her, I looked at her and said: Why  the heck did it take you so long to get here?   The voices of native people were desperately needed in this space.  Deb Haaland, who is now our Secretary of the Interior and the first  native person who has been a Secretary of the Interior, is one of the  people who has filled a huge void with regard to protecting the  sovereignty of the first peoples of these United States, and I am  grateful for their presence.   I also am very grateful for our finally electing Muslims to this  body. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota are  important voices, particularly since there is so much debate around the  world about Muslims and their trustworthiness, reliability, and  religious beliefs.   They have shown us that Muslims care very, very deeply about America.  There are no two people in this body who care more about America than  Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. Ilhan Omar was not only an immigrant, she  was a refugee to this country. She is someone who loves America because  we opened the door of opportunity for her, and she has insights that  none of us can see because of the space that she has occupied.   Mr. Speaker, I give honor to all of these women, and of course I  adore Marcy Kaptur. I think Representative Sykes made a great tribute  to Marcy Kaptur, but I would be remiss if I did not tell you how she  has influenced me. I love Lake Michigan, which I represent in  Wisconsin, and no one is more adamant about protecting this great  resource, our Great Lakes, than Marcy Kaptur.   We have 20 percent of the world's freshwater, more valuable than oil  and gas, which people spend so much time protecting, but we have got  Marcy Kaptur to protect the greatest resource that this country has.   Before I close, I just want to mention one other person on here that  we have not talked about today, and that is Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi.  As you know, Nancy was the first woman Speaker of the House of  Representatives, and I would argue that history will designate her as  the best Speaker ever. I was elected to Congress the term before she  became Speaker.   By the time Barack Obama was elected, the first Black President of  the United States, I still couldn't pick myself up off the floor, I was  just so overwhelmed by what it meant to have this mother and  grandmother be able to deal with all of the different factions in the  Democratic Caucus and to bring them all together to accomplish our  purposes here. I mean, we had the Blue Dogs, the progressives, and the  New Dems, and Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi was the person who could get the  vote. You don't bring bills to the floor unless you have got the vote,  and Nancy was able to do it.                                time  2030    One of her greatest achievements was the Affordable Care Act, the so- called ObamaCare. The Affordable Care Act has provided 20 million  people who were formerly uninsured with affordable, comprehensive  healthcare.   I know President Barack Obama gets credit for that, but Nancy is the  one that got the votes. Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi got the votes for the  ACA. It was difficult.   This signature accomplishment is right up there with the passage of  Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. This safety net program will  be Nancy Pelosi's greatest legacy. After she accomplished her greatest  legacy, she wouldn't stop. She kept going.   She shepherded the American Rescue Plan, which got many people shots  in arms during a pandemic. She shepherded the American Rescue Plan that  kept people from being evicted from their homes, saved small  businesses, and saved our economy.   Thank you, Nancy Pelosi.   It was such a great accomplishment, but she didn't stop then. She got  the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed in a hugely divided Congress.  This bill provided the greatest investment in clean energy that the  world has ever seen. It put us on track for meeting our climate goals  by 2030. Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi presided over that accomplishment.   The Inflation Reduction Act supports our environment, but not only  that. It provides billions of dollars of relief by finally allowing  this Congress to negotiate drug prices for Medicare. One of the biggest  expenses this country has is Medicare, a signature program that  supports our seniors. While everyone is complaining about how we are  going to continue to fund Medicare, this Inflation Reduction Act gives  the ability to do what you do in capitalist countries.   If this were IBM, Dell, Starbucks, Amazon, or any other large  corporation that purchased as much healthcare for their employees as  the United States of America does through Medicare, the VA, and  Medicaid, they  [[Page H1402]]  would be able to sit down and negotiate drug prices based on the  critical mass of people they are serving.   We have lost billions of dollars protecting a rich pharmaceutical  industry where Americans have paid five or six times as much for the  same drug as people in Canada, France, or other places pay because we  were unwilling to deny the fat cats and the shareholders of that  company undue remittance.   Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi, Speaker Emerita--I ran into Nancy in the  bathroom right after she had given up the gavel and yielded to Hakeem  Jeffries to be our new leader, and I said, ``How are you doing,  Nancy?'' She said: I am free.   She didn't leave. She is still a Member of this body, still providing  advice and counsel to our leadership. She didn't leave here in  disgrace. She is leaving with a storied legacy of being a great leader.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you and all the staff who has been here to  listen to the powerful story of women.   When women lead, America is great.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
