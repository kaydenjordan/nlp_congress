 Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague and  classmate, Representative Marc Veasey, for his leadership today; and  the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Cedric  Richmond, for convening us and for the leadership that he has already  shown.   We have a President-elect who, for 5 years, perpetrated the racist  lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America, and  who ran one of the most divisive campaigns in the Nation's history and  then promised that he was going to bring all of us together.   Then you have got his colleagues on the other side of the aisle who  have said: Well, Democrats, people in the civil rights community,  African Americans, we should give the new President a chance.   This is the same group of people who declared war on Barack Obama on  day one of his Presidency and governed themselves under the following  approach: Obstruction today, obstruction tomorrow, obstruction forever.   That should sound familiar to folks from Alabama and the Deep South.   Now they want us to give them a chance. You can't lecture us on  Presidential etiquette. You have no credibility in that area. We will  decide how we want to engage. As it relates to your pick to head the  Department of Justice, it is totally unacceptable, unreasonable,  unjust, and unconscionable, not because of anything that he may have  said 30 years ago, as offensive as that may be, but because of the  positions that Senator Jeff Sessions has taken today.   Today, in 2017, based on his recent track record, he supports the  Confederate battle flag, not 30 years ago, but today. Today he supports  voter suppression efforts that are advanced by his unwillingness to  repair section 4 and section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. That is not 30  years ago. I don't care that you showed up in Selma, Alabama, for a  photo op. Your position on the Voting Rights Act is unacceptable today.                                time  2015    Today you support mass incarceration, the failed drug war, and the  prison industrial complex. And because of your position today,  reasonable Americans should oppose your ascension to the Department of  Justice.
