 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 1934, a bill  that would roll back standards under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for diesel  generating units in ``remote areas'' of Alaska. I understand the  motivation behind this bill, but it could set a precedent for weakening  existing New Source Performance Standards for diesel generators not  just in Alaska, but across the United States.   I am committed to finding ways to help Alaskans in remote areas have  affordable electricity while maintain health protections. Congress  should tackle this issue with an open debate through regular order.    Mr. Speaker, I oppose this last-ditch effort to attach  harmful policy riders to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)  reauthorization. While H.R. 7388 reauthorizes the NFIP through May 31,  2019, House Republicans have attached controversial policy reforms that  have been rejected several times by the House and Senate to a bill that  would keep the NFIP's doors open. This harmful policy change was  recently implemented administratively by the Trump administration.   This policy reverses the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA)  ``Write Your Own'' non-compete clause and would allow private insurance  companies partnering with and servicing NFIP policies to sell their own  competing private policies to unsuspecting consumers. We should not  allow private insurers to cherry-pick the best risk policies for their  own private businesses and force taxpayers to pick up the rest.   The Senate has already unanimously passed a clean extension that does  not include this toxic rider. The House should ensure that flood  insurance remains available to millions of homeowners, businesses, and  renters across the country that rely on it and pass a clean extension.
