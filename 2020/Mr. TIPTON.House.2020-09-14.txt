 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4200.   I would like to thank my colleagues for the kind words in regard to  Sergeant Kinterknecht and the sacrifice that he made on behalf of our  communities.   H.R. 4200 will make a technical correction to prior legislation  signed into law to designate the primary USPS facility in Montrose,  Colorado, after Sergeant David Kinterknecht, who was killed in the line  of duty on July 25, 2009.   Sergeant Kinterknecht was born and raised in Montrose and graduated  from Mesa State College and the Delta Montrose Technical College.   His career in law enforcement began in the 1980s, and throughout his  career, he served in the Telluride Marshal's Office, the San Miguel  County Sheriff's Office, and the Montrose County Sheriff's Office.   Sergeant Kinterknecht was a respected law enforcement officer, a  dedicated public servant, and a family man. His death was mourned  throughout the entire State of Colorado, and the passage of H.R. 4200  will help preserve and honor the memory of Sergeant Kinterknecht in his  community.   I am grateful for the entire Colorado delegation signing on to this  legislation to honor someone who gave his all for his community in  support of all he loved.
