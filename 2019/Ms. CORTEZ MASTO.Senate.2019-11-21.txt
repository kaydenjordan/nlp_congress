 Mr. President, I have spent 3 years in the U.S.  Senate. During this time, I can tell you the No. 1 issue when I am  home--and I suspect it is in your State, as well, and across this  country--is the cost of healthcare in this country and to be sure that  everybody in this country, no matter your party, your religion, where  you live, urban or rural area, has access to affordable healthcare not  only when it is needed but also for preventative purposes to give you  peace of mind.   Unfortunately, what we have seen is high cost; inability to get  access to it, oftentimes when you are in a rural community; and a fight  here in Congress. Instead of working together to solve this problem, we  are too far apart in presenting a solution--in coming together for a  solution.   It is open enrollment season for healthcare right now, which means  Americans have an opportunity to get new healthcare coverage or change  the coverage they have.         In Nevada, the State is running a new exchange website and       working hard to make sure every Nevadan gets covered at       NevadaHealthLink.com. I thank our fantastic exchange       director, Heather Korbulic, and her team for all they are       doing.    I want to encourage all Nevadans to get coverage. I don't think  people realize how much help there is for individuals to get coverage  at Nevada Health Link. If you want healthcare, please, please reach out  by the December 15 deadline to learn more about the opportunities that  are available to you to be able to afford it.   Open enrollment is a good time for us to reflect on how far we have  come, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and to take stock--to take  stock--of the threats to that coverage. Unfortunately, I have watched  in Congress as Members of the Republican Party, particularly this  administration, try to sabotage the Affordable Care Act at every turn.   At the end of October, the Senate held a vote on Senator Warner's  resolution to overturn this administration's damaging and dangerous  rule expanding so-called junk plans. My Democratic colleagues voted in  favor of the resolution because they know how important healthcare is  to our constituents. Yet, unfortunately, nearly all of the Senate  Republicans voted against it. They voted to allow Americans to buy  skimpy, low-benefit plans that send us back to the dark days of health  coverage in America by allowing insurers to sidestep the patient  protections in the Affordable Care Act.   These junk plans don't cover essential services like prescription  drugs, emergency room visits, mental healthcare, and maternity care.  They don't prevent insurers from discriminating against people with  preexisting conditions. There are about 1.2 billion of them in Nevada  alone.   My colleagues on the other of the aisle argue that these junk plans  are low cost. Well, they cost less than some plans, but that doesn't  mean they are cheap. They may have high deductibles or exclude coverage  of costly services, and, by law, more of the money they collect in  premiums can go toward the insurers' profits. But when you realize that  these plans provide barely any benefits, you can see, for most people,  the plans are no savings at all.   What is more, because insurers often use deceptive marketing  practices, people who purchase these plans don't always know just how  skimpy their coverage is. Sometimes patients don't realize that their  plans leave out much needed procedures until after they have racked up  huge bills.   Paving the way for junk plans is just one way Republicans are  undermining the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration and 18  Republican State attorneys general are trying to get the Fifth Circuit  Court of Appeals to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act in a case  called Texas v. United States. This is just the latest and one of the  most dangerous of over 100 Republican attempts to get rid of the  Affordable Care Act in Congress and the courts.   If the Fifth Circuit overturns the Affordable Care Act, Americans  will lose the peace of mind and protections they have told us so many  times that they want. The last thing Americans need is for us to turn  back the clock to a time when they couldn't get healthcare for  preexisting conditions or they couldn't get insurance to cover  essential health needs.   This summer, I met with Ashby Bellows and Charlie Bell, two Nevadans  with juvenile diabetes. Both girls are doing well now, but their  parents worry that when the girls are no longer on their parents' plan,  they might opt to ration their insulin. Think about that--ration their  insulin. Unfortunately, it is a common practice among people who cannot  afford the often sky-high cost of insulin, and it can be deadly. In  fact, one out of seven Americans knows someone who passed away in the  last 5 years because they couldn't afford treatment for a medical  condition.   Senate Republicans have told their constituents that they will  protect Americans' healthcare, and President Trump has said he has a  plan to provide Americans with healthcare. Well, where is it? I mean,  the only plan we have seen is an attempt to sabotage the Affordable  Care Act and rip away coverage from hundreds of thousands in Nevada and  millions across America.   My Democratic colleagues and I are fighting to ensure that everyone  in this country has access to affordable  [[Page S6747]]  healthcare. Unfortunately, what I have seen on the other side of the  aisle and in this administration is that they are fighting to take it  away. There is a clear distinction between the two, and I think the  American public is tired of it.   We all should be working in a bipartisan way to make sure that  everyone in this country has access to affordable healthcare. I will  continue to vote for comprehensive and affordable healthcare in this  country, and I will continue pushing to strengthen the Affordable Care  Act and reduce prescription drug costs for Nevadans. I will keep  fighting to ensure that Americans stay safe and healthy, and I will  assure you that I will keep talking to my colleagues so that,  hopefully, one day we will be fighting for the same thing, which is to  ensure that everyone in this country, no matter your background or  where you live, has access to affordable healthcare when you need it-- when you need that coverage and you want to protect a loved one.   I yield the floor.
