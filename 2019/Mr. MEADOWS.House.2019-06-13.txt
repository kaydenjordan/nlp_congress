 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment withholds an additional $33  million from Pakistan, in addition to the $33 million that is currently  being withheld. This seems like it should not be necessary, but,  indeed, it is.   Dr. Shakil Afridi has been in prison for his role in helping the  United States Government locate Osama bin Laden. The message, Mr.  Chair, needs to be clear that imprisonment, in violation of human  rights, of this fine doctor needs to cease.   Mr. Chair, you probably find the same thing back home in your State  as I do in mine. Many of my constituents question why we are sending  money to Pakistan anyway, let alone if they are going to violate the  human rights of someone who has helped bring justice to a terrorist.   In prison since 2011, Dr. Afridi was almost entirely restricted. He  was prevented from meeting with his lawyers. Indeed, his previous  lawyer was murdered. Dr. Afridi has been tortured, reportedly. He has  been described as now looking like a skeleton.   Mr. Chair, this body needs to stand unanimously together and send a  clear message to the Pakistani Government that we will not tolerate  this kind of behavior and this violation of human rights. We need to  stand with his wife, and we need to stand for freedom.   We appreciate the support of Freedom House in supporting this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), someone I fondly refer to as ``Mr. Chairman,''  who has been a leader on so many of these issues.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his passion.   In the interest of time, I encourage all of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to stand for freedom and to make sure that what we  do is send a clear message to those who will stomp out and try to  eliminate those who are freedom-loving across the globe.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
