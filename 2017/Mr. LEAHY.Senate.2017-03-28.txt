 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the enduring legacy  of a champion of education and equity in my home State of Vermont,  David Wolk.   For the last 16 years, Mr. David Wolk has served admirably as the  president of Castleton University. David's retirement at the close of  2017 will leave a legacy of nearly 17 years of academic excellence,  visionary leadership, and unmatched commitment to community. As the  longest serving president in its history, David has led Castleton  through an extraordinary transformation. David leaves Castleton as a  vibrant, economic engine of the Green Mountain State and a trailblazer  in inclusivity, entrepreneurship, and service learning.   Castleton students have often found a unique kinship with David,  noting his frequency in the student dining halls and at student club  events. As an avid fan of Castleton Spartan Athletics, David is proud  of the accomplishments of the school's student-athletes. The university  more than doubled its varsity sport offerings during David's tenure,  enabling Vermont students to play Division III sports. The largest  community investment was the development of the Spartan Arena, which is  used by both the school and the community as an all-purpose community  center and athletic space.   As a Rutland native, David has always felt a special connection to  his hometown. As president, his focus on integrating Castleton and the  surrounding community has built a lasting alliance that promises  regional prosperity for years to come. Most recently, Castleton has  partnered with the Rutland Economic Development Corporation to open the  Castleton Downtown Office, a publicly accessible space for students and  community members alike. A nexus of the downtown, this space now hosts  the Center for Entrepreneurial Programs, Center for Schools, Center for  Community Engagement, and the Castleton Polling Institute. David's  passion for the arts has also inspired a coupling of the Castleton  Downtown Art Gallery and the historic Paramount Theatre.   As the needs of our students, families, and communities continue to  evolve, David's legacy is his success in elevating education as a key  solution to addressing our most pressing public challenges. As he  transitions to his next venture, I wish David and his wife, Lyn, great  success and hope they will find joy in visiting family and friends  found throughout the world.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement issued by  Castleton University be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                        [From Castleton University]     President Wolk Announces 16th Year Will Be His Final at Castleton       Longest serving president in university history to step down in                                  December         Castleton University President Dave Wolk announced at a       campus assembly Wednesday that he will step down in December       after serving for 16 years as president. Wolk came to the       presidency in December of 2001 after intertwined careers in       education and government, and 2017 marks his 43rd year in       public service. Wolk is the longest serving president in       Castleton history by more than four years.        ``I have been blessed, more than I deserve, to have had so       many leadership opportunities over the last 43 years, and I       am especially grateful for the last 16 at Castleton. Moving       on at the end of 2017 will indeed be emotionally challenging       because I absolutely love our students and staff, I am lucky       to be part of this exceptional community, and I bleed green,       full of Spartan Pride. I will be a Spartan always and       forever.''        Beginning in 2018, Wolk will begin a new startup venture,       Wolk Leadership Solutions, with his wife, Lyn. The Wolks will       work with CEOs and Boards of Directors in business,       government, industry, schools, hospitals, universities and an       array of nonprofits to find solutions to leadership       challenges. The new entrepreneurial venture will specialize       in coaching leaders to achieve greater success, while       offering mediation and conflict resolution services.        ``Our goal will be to help leaders to be more successful.       We will help boards and leaders to find solutions to their       challenges, and to do so in a way that will be effective and       enduring over time through coaching and guiding change. I am       also hoping to do some teaching and writing, including       involvement in a Vermont leadership institute. Helping people       to be better at what they do has always been a passion.''        At his inauguration in the fall of 2002, Wolk addressed a       standing room only crowd  [[Page S2043]]       and promised that together the Castleton community would take       action, and make history. He promised that together they       would attract high quality students, invest in their       education and in their experiences, improve their campus, and       support each other for the benefit of Vermont.        During Wolk's tenure the university invested nearly $100       million in infrastructure improvements, expanded academic       offerings at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and       expanded co-curricular activities, which has transformed what       was once considered a ``suitcase campus'' into a model for       vibrancy and engagement across the state and region.        ``Castleton has never been in better shape, thanks to       President Wolk's visionary and passionate leadership,'' said       VSC Chancellor Jeb Spaulding. ``People who visit the campus       for the first time in a while are amazed at the       transformation that has taken place during his tenure. It       will be impossible to replace Dave and we will miss him       greatly, but he will leave Castleton with a very strong       foundation for success into the future.''        Since 2001 Castleton has increased its enrollment by more       than 75 percent, more than doubled its athletic offerings,       built or renovated every building on campus, and expanded       into nearby Rutland to offer students better connections with       area businesses, schools, hospitals, and non-profits in an       effort to enhance the Castleton student experience. Recently,       the university has taken over operations of the Rutland       Economic Development Corporation, a partnership unlike any       other in the country, which has deepened the university's       commitment to being an economic and intellectual driver in       the community while creating strong outcomes for its       students.        In 2009 Wolk ushered in the Castleton Student Initiative, a       $25.7 million project which reinvigorated student life and       learning and changed the face of campus. The largest       investment in the history of Castleton, and the Vermont State       Colleges, it included improvements and additions to nearly       every aspect of student life including athletics, the campus       center, and the arts. The crown jewel of the project, Spartan       Stadium, is one of the finest multi-use facilities in New       England and has been central to the growth of Castleton's       athletic programs, as well as providing a venue to grow       Castleton's reach throughout the state and beyond.        Currently nearing the midpoint of the university's second       ten-year plan, the Castleton Plan, Wolk has most recently       overseen additions in graduate education, enrollment       increases, a greater presence in Rutland, and a focus on       increasing international recruitment. All of these changes       culminated in what proved to be one of the most historic days       in the institution's storied 230 year history when on July       23, 2015 the VSC Board of Trustees unanimously voted to       modernize the name to ``Castleton University.'' At the time,       Wolk said the name was both aspirational and inspirational,       as the community set forth to achieve the goals of the       Castleton Plan.        ``Dave's leadership, not just at Castleton but also among       the VSC Council of Presidents and Board of Trustees, will be       greatly missed,'' said VSC Board Chair Martha O'Connor. ``He       leads with his heart, cares deeply about the state and its       students, and has positioned Castleton well for far reaching       success now and in the future which will benefit our state       for years to come. The board, and I personally, cannot thank       him enough for his private candor, public support, and       meaningful friendship.''        Wolk was born and grew up in Rutland. He graduated from       Rutland High School and then Middlebury College with a degree       in political science. He earned a master's degree in       educational administration and planning at UVM and a       certificate of advanced graduate study at Harvard University.       During his professional career he has served as a school       principal, superintendent, Vermont's Commissioner of       Education, Vermont State Senator, and on more than 40 boards       and commissions, chairing several of them. He plans to       continue his life of public service in a variety of ways       going forward.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as in so many rural States, small  businesses make up the backbone of Vermont's economy and communities.  Countless Vermont businesses develop and manufacture a wide array of  products, ranging from our thriving craft beer industry to Vermont-made  peanut butter, candles, chocolates, and cheeses. I would like to take  this opportunity to recognize one of Vermont's outstanding small  businesses, Jasper Hill Farm. A small, rural creamery in the Northeast  Kingdom, Jasper Hill Farm exemplifies our State's essential balance of  innovation and tradition. Andy and Mateo Kehler have worked for more  than 15 years to make the best cheese possible, all while remaining  true to their Vermont roots.   Now an award-winning artisan cheese business, Jasper Hill Farm began  two decades ago when the brothers Kehler pooled their resources to buy  a small farm in rural Greensboro, VT. They decided to try a new model  of small-scale, value-added dairy farming that would transform raw milk  into a more valuable product before leaving the farm. To do so, Mateo  and Andy built a creamery with space to age cheese next door to the  barn. After 5 years of hard work, the brothers finally had their first  marketable cheese.   What started as a few racks of cheese with a couple of direct  customers quickly expanded, as did the farm's notoriety. Within 3  years, Jasper Hill Farm took home ``Best of Show'' at the American  Cheese Society Conference. Despite their hard-earned success, Andy and  Mateo continued with their vision of increasing access to value-added  production for all interested farmers. They took new measures to create  opportunities for community success, opening their space to other  cheesemakers. Now, the creamery is home not only to numerous cheese  caves, but to a modern laboratory where scientists work to create  cheese starter cultures. Years of research have enabled the creation of  better cheese, and Jasper Hill Farm has become a magnet for other  artisan cheesemakers along the way.   Andy and Mateo have created an outstanding business that is rooted in  the Vermont values of hard work and perseverance, while emphasizing the  importance of community. Their efforts to reinvigorate the State's  dairy industry have contributed to our State's identity and culture, as  well as our agricultural traditions. I am proud to feature the work of  Jasper Hill Farm at our annual Taste of Vermont event, and I look  forward to seeing what their future brings.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a New York Times article  about Jasper Hill Farm be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Feb. 6, 2017]               Small Cheese Makers Invest in a Stinky Science                           (By Larissa Zimberoff)         Greensboro, VT--There's no sign announcing that you've       arrived at Jasper Hill Farm, a creamery in the Northeast       Kingdom, as Vermonters call that end of their state, but you       can't miss it. The main barn is painted midnight blue with a       giant cheese moon and cows floating happily in space. Blasted       into the hillside is a concrete bunker with seven cheese       caves radiating from a central core.        There's one other surprising detail: a modern two-room       laboratory filled with microbiology equipment and staffed       with scientists.        Why does a small, rural creamery invest in technology for       what has long been a low-tech product? Because it doesn't       have 500 years to learn what its European counterparts       already know: the biological intricacies of how to make the       best cheese in a particular place. And because the same       diversity of microbial cultures is not available in North       America.        ``Building a lab might seem extravagant or of questionable       value, but what we get as a business over two, three, four       generations--it's a no-brainer,'' said Mateo Kehler, who owns       the farm with his brother, Andy.        The making of cheese depends on the contribution of myriad       microbial actors. Both yeast and bacteria are components of       the starter cultures that help turn milk into solids, and       those solids into cheeses with distinctive aromas, flavors       and textures that are hard to resist. The interplay of these       species, while understood in a basic sense, is now receiving       renewed scientific scrutiny and appreciation in the United       States.        Unlike their peers in Europe, who benefit from centuries of       tradition and from government support for research, American       farmstead cheese makers have typically gone it alone. Starter       cultures are a particularly vexing ingredient. The only three       domestic suppliers, including DuPont and Cargill, are       multinational corporations better known for chemicals, which       has limited the number of available cultures and caused       discomfort in a field that strives for individuality.        But now several small cheese producers are working with       scientists to develop their own starters and use microbiology       to create better cheeses.        Murray's Cheese is working with Rockefeller University to       learn more about the microflora in its cheese caves in Long       Island City, Queens. Uplands Cheese Company is working with       the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin       to create a new soft cheese, its first in seven years.        But perhaps none have taken on cheese science as rigorously       as Jasper Hill. Its laboratory, opened in 2013, has become a       hub for other cheese makers seeking help and insight.        When the Kehler brothers began making cheese in 2003, their       aim was to invigorate the local dairy industry, which was,       and still is, struggling. They started on their path to       applied science in 2010, when Rachel Dutton,  [[Page S2044]]       a Harvard scientist, decided to use cheese as a model to       research how small microbial communities interact; she       focused on the composition of cheese rinds.        Her first contact in the cheese business was Mateo Kehler,       who taught her to make cheese and then helped her reach out       to more than 100 other producers for samples. The response       was overwhelming. ``I don't think she realized how excited       the artisan cheese industry was going to be,'' Mr. Kehler       said.        In 2014, Dr. Dutton published her findings in the journal       Cell. Working with Benjamin Wolfe, a postdoctoral researcher,       she reported that the environment (cows, cheese caves,       pastures) and methods (washing, salting, managing acidity)       were as important to the development of cheese rinds, if not       more so, than the ingredients.        This was a revelation. With this new scientific proof in       hand, the Kehlers stopped adding starter cultures to       Winnimere, one of their most popular raw-milk cheeses. ``What       we were adding wasn't growing, and when we stopped adding       that, the cheese ripened more gracefully and deliciously,''       Mateo Kehler said.        Their pasteurized cheeses, though, still needed starters       because pasteurization kills bacteria both good and bad for       cheese. So they began making starter cultures from bacteria       in their own milk supply.        Besides ending their reliance on big business, this has       allowed the brothers to create a cheese that can come only       from a singular place: Greensboro, Vt.        An on-site laboratory has its perks. In addition to having       staff members who deeply understand microbiology, Jasper Hill       Farm has become a magnet for researchers near and far. Now       working there are an engineering intern from Brittany,       France; a local microbiologist; and Panos C. Lekkas, a food       microbiologist who has investigated the best ways to feed,       tend and milk a cow for cheese production.        Dr. Lekkas, who was hired in November to work full time at       Jasper Hill, collaborates with Dr. Dutton, now at the       University of California, San Diego, and with Dr. Wolfe, who       leads a microbiology laboratory at Tufts University.        In addition to helping improve food safety procedures at       the 85-person Jasper Hill Farm, Dr. Lekkas is overseeing the       development of a new cheese--a French Camembert style that       for now the team is calling Wild Moses.        Dr. Lekkas was told that it takes eight months to bring a       new cheese to market. ``Mateo wants me to do it in three,''       he said. With science comes speed.        In order to make a soft pasteurized cheese that does not       rely on corporate additives, the scientists sampled 300       promising strains of yeast and bacteria, all pulled from milk       from Jasper Hill's own 250 cows.        What makes a homegrown starter promising? Sometimes it's       the color of the microbes in a petri dish, but smell, too,       can be telling. The group sniffed the samples and noted any       pleasing aromas: Play-Doh, Concord grapes, tomato juice,       clams, Kraft American Singles. Dr. Wolfe's lab ran a full       genomic sequencing on the 15 top contenders, which will       provide a blueprint for understanding how these strains are       related to, or differ from, other cultures in the cheese       world.        Making funky cheese is tricky, even for scientists. ``There       are subtle variations in flavor and aroma that you perceive       in cheese,'' Dr. Wolfe said. ``We want to understand what       drives that variation.'' With Dr. Wolfe's genomic data, the       team can track the microbes through the entire cheese-making       process.        In November, the first batch of cheese was produced using       five strains from the original 15 parent cultures--two yeast-      based and three bacterial. New batches are being made every       two weeks using different combinations, and every 10 days,       each will be tasted to see whether it is on target for the       ``deliciousness factor,'' Jasper Hill's zero-to-10 grading       system.        Seven or above is pretty good. Eight is out of this world.       Tens are likely to be bestowed only outside the farm: Jasper       Hill's Harbison cheese recently took Super Gold at the World       Cheese Awards in Spain.        ``I will be happy with a seven,'' Dr. Lekkas said.                            ____________________
