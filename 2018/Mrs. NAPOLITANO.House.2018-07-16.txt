 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 66, the Route 66  Centennial Commission Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Rodney Davis, for  introducing this legislation with me; and I thank Chairman Shuster and  Chairman Graves and Ranking Member DeFazio and Ranking Member Norton  for their support in moving this bill along through the committee.   Route 66, as was pointed out, runs east to west through my district  as Foothill Boulevard and Huntington Drive in the cities of La Verne,  San Dimas, Azusa, Duarte, and Monrovia. Our local restaurants, shops,  and businesses, like so many others dotting the interstate from the  heartland to the West Coast, provide rest breaks for travelers,  allowing them to sample the local flavors of our communities that are  proud to be connected by the iconic road. Other cities are doing this  as well.   The city of Duarte celebrates every year in September with a parade  of classic cars, equestrian groups, and marching bands. Along the  highway, there are signs still there from long ago showing Route 66  lives there.   The theme of the Los Angeles County Fair this year, which is a very  popular fair, is Route 66, with memorabilia and Route 66 movie-themed  nights.   States and local governments across the country are reinvesting in  Route 66 as an icon of American history and culture. The Federal  Government should be involved in this effort as well.   H.R. 66 creates a national commission to recommend activities to  commemorate the 100th anniversary of Route 66 in 2026.   The bill will also direct the Department of Transportation, as was  pointed out, to develop a plan on the preservation needs of this iconic  Route 66. The Department is required to consult with eight States  through which Route 66 travels, which include California, Arizona, New  Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, Route 66 is a significant part of America's past, but it  also continues to provide transportation, economic, and community  benefits to our society today. We must continue to improve this  historic road so that many more generations can, in the words of Chuck  Berry, get their kicks on Route 66.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support Route 66, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Will the gentleman yield?    My communities, as of now, are very excited about  this bill and the celebration of the 100th birthday.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, because I rise in support of H.R. 3906, the Innovative  Stormwater Infrastructure Act of 2018.   This bipartisan bill, as was pointed out, was introduced by our  colleague from Washington, Congressman Heck, aimed at addressing one of  the ongoing concerns facing our communities, an unfunded mandate--very  unfunded: how to address and pay for controlling ongoing sources of  stormwater that empty into our local water bodies.   According to EPA, runoff from urbanized areas is a leading source of  water quality impairments on local water bodies. In urban and suburban  areas, buildings and pavement cover much of the land and prevent rain  and snowmelt from soaking into the ground. Instead, these developed  areas rely on storm drains to carry large amounts of water runoff from  roofs and paved areas to nearby waterways, and with it, as was pointed  out again, high levels of pollution, such as oil, dirt, chemicals, and  lawn fertilizers released directly into local streams and rivers.   Congress needs to do more to help communities come into compliance  with the goals of the Clean Water Act, the unfunded mandate. We need to  encourage the development of new technologies and practices for  addressing stormwater runoff. We need to encourage the implementation  of cost-effective, low-impact development and nature-based  infrastructure alternatives.  [[Page H6220]]    Finally, we need to provide additional Federal assistance to  communities to help address their local water quality challenges. Many  of the communities are small and could not afford them. It will  bankrupt them if they have to follow the letter of the law.    Mr. Speaker, while H.R. 3906, as introduced, would have addressed  some of these challenges, the bill was modified by the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure. This modification removed the  authorization of a new EPA stormwater grant program and replaced it  with a new study on how existing sources of Federal, State, local, and  private funds are being used to address local stormwater challenges.   As amended, H.R. 3906 would direct the EPA administration to partner  with Federal, State, and local agencies and stakeholders in the  creation of a new stormwater infrastructure funding task force. This  new task force will look at funding and affordability issues related to  the construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of the  stormwater infrastructure necessary to meet the goals of the Clean  Water Act.   The task force will be required to inventory the available public and  private sources of funding for stormwater infrastructure and to assess  how the use of these sources of funding might affect the affordability  of the infrastructure to a municipality, which sometimes is  floundering.   While there may be several financing options available to communities  to address local stormwater challenges, the actual cost of these  options to a community may vary greatly.   For example, it is far cheaper for a community to obtain a Federal  grant for water infrastructure than a loan, but it may also be more  affordable for a community to borrow from the Clean Water State  Revolving Fund than to borrow the same amount from the private market.  So the question is not simply about whether funding is available to the  community, but is that funding also affordable to the community.   I expect that the results of the task force will show how the Federal  Government needs to be an active player in financing affordable  stormwater infrastructure. Perhaps this information will guide future  Congresses to take a greater role in financing our water infrastructure  challenges.   Mr. Speaker, while I am disappointed that this legislation does not  provide additional Federal resources so desperately needed to address  our local water infrastructure challenges, the bill is a very good  first step in further refining the scope of the stormwater challenges  facing our Nation.   I am pleased to support the bill, and I heartily urge all my  colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Speaker, just one last word, I think this is a  very important bill. We have been dealing with the stormwater issue for  at least 7 years in my area, and because it is an unfunded mandate, the  cities are crying out for help. I think the two cases set forth by my  colleagues point out the need for Federal help.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
