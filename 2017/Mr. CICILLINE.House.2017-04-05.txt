 Mr. Speaker, in the 20th century, good-paying  manufacturing jobs built the middle class in Rhode Island and across  our country. But in recent decades, millions of these jobs have  disappeared. Factories have been shuttered. Bad trade deals have moved  American jobs to other countries.   It is time to rebuild American manufacturing. It is time to support  making things in America again. That is why I have introduced H.R.  1672, the Make It In America Manufacturing Communities Act, a  bipartisan bill that will help revitalize American manufacturing and  promote the creation of good-paying jobs in our country.   This is a commonsense bill that incentivizes communities, together  with the private sector, higher education, and other key stakeholders  to work together to strengthen their manufacturing economies. It  provides targeted investments and support to make regions and local  communities competitive in manufacturing again--communities like those  in my home State of Rhode Island, the birthplace of the American  industrial revolution.   Mr. Speaker, let's put America back to work at good-paying jobs.  Let's get this done and pass H.R. 1672. Let's work to export great  American goods and not great American jobs.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1667, the  ``Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2017.''   In 2008, the United States economy nearly collapsed as a direct  result of lending practices in the housing market that were predatory,  unsafe, and in many cases fraudulent.   Investments in toxic securities created a cycle of failure in the  housing market: the declining health of the market undermined the value  of these securities, which, in turn, devastated the housing market and  caused the failure of several of the nation's largest financial  institutions.   With the financial system in near collapse, large financial  institutions were essentially able to ``blackmail'' the government  because these banks were so large that there was no way to break them  apart, as then-FDIC Chair Sheila Bair testified in 2009.   Although the true hardship caused by this widespread fraud is  incalculable, we do know that it erased $10 trillion of household  wealth and caused 8 million Americans to lose their jobs and 5 million  Americans to lose their homes.   Rhode Island, my home state, was hit particularly hard by the  recession. When I took office, the unemployment rate in Rhode Island  hovered at 11.2%, the fifth highest in the country.   In the wake of this economic disaster, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted  to comprehensively reform the financial system.   Because of this law--which includes some of the strongest consumer  protections passed since the Great Depression--the banking system is  stronger; there is more transparency in consumer lending; and the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) continues to serve as an  important watchdog to protect Americans against predatory lending and  fraud in the financial system.   Title I of Dodd-Frank provides stability in markets by requiring  large financial institutions to have a ``living will'' to serve as a  plan for the ``rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material  financial distress or failure.''   Title II ends taxpayer bailouts of banks that are too big to fail by  providing financial regulators with orderly liquidation authority where  a bank's collapse ``would have serious adverse effects on financial  stability in the United States'' and ``no viable private sector  alternative is available.'' This process expressly requires a finding  by the Secretary of the Treasury that the bankruptcy process would not  be appropriate to resolve a distressed firm.   Leading commentators agree, however, that the U.S. bankruptcy process  is not designed to accommodate the orderly resolution of a large  financial institution that poses systemic risk to the entire economy.   H.R. 1667, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act,'' addresses this  concern by establishing a ``single point of entry'' for the resolution  of an insolvent financial institution with assets exceeding $50  billion. The goal of the bill is to establish a process where a  distressed financial institution could voluntarily seek bankruptcy  relief while its subsidiaries continue to operate.   But while I support H.R. 1667 and am an original cosponsor of this  bill, make no mistake: I will strongly oppose any effort to combine  this measure with a repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act, or any part of this  law for that matter.   Since this law was enacted, the economic recovery has led to the  creation of more than 15 million private sector jobs, a 60% increase in  business lending, and record performance by the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.   It is critical that we build on this progress through education,  training, and other initiatives to promote economic opportunity. Too  many Americans are still unemployed or working two or even three jobs  just to get by while Wall Street has never been better.   We must also preserve and advance the protections established by the  Dodd-Frank Act to ensure transparency and stability in the financial  system while protecting consumers.   The National Bankruptcy Conference agrees with this assessment, and  has previously instructed that the Dodd-Frank Act should ``continue to  be available even if the Bankruptcy Code is amended to better address  the resolution of SIFIs because the ability of U.S. regulators to  assume full control of the resolution process to elicit the cooperation  from non-U.S. regulators is an essential insurance policy against  systemic risk and potential conflict and dysfunction among the  multinational components of SIFIs.''   Moreover, should this legislation become law, Dodd-Frank provides a  valuable backstop to bankruptcy through its Orderly Liquidation  Authority, which empowers the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC) to act as a receiver for large financial institutions that are  ``too big to fail.''   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
