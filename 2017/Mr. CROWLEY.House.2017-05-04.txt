 Mr. Speaker, here we go again. The majority thinks they  have finally found the right combination of political giveaways to pass  their bill, a bill that we have to remember still kicks 24 million  Americans off their healthcare coverage. It still charges seniors more.  It still takes away some of the most basic protections of your health  plan that it should cover. Despite what you hear, this latest Band-Aid  amendment is not going to change any of that.   That is just what we know so far. Since this bill was built by  backroom deals and haphazard guesses, we don't even know how much this  bill will cost America--not just dollars added to the deficit, but the  human cost of how much more damaging this bill will be.   It is the height of irresponsible governing, not just rushing  something through without full and fair consideration. Frankly, we are  getting used to that on our side of the aisle. But to force through a  bill that you know is going to hurt 24 million Americans is more than  irresponsible; it is just plain wrong.                                time  1000
