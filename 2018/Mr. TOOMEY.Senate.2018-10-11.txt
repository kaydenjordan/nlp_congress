 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  nomination of David James Porter, of Pennsylvania, to be U.S. Circuit  Judge for the Third Circuit.   Mr. Porter has deep roots in Pennsylvania. It is where he was born  and raised by two public school educators who taught him and his  siblings the value of hard work and education. Mr. Porter and his wife  Valerie settled in western Pennsylvania and have raised their six  children there during their 28 years of marriage.   He is widely regarded as one of the preeminent attorneys in western  Pennsylvania. Mr. Porter has a wealth of legal experience that will  make him an outstanding judge. Currently, he is a shareholder in the  Pittsburgh office of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, a leading national  law firm. During his 23 years at that firm, he has worked as a  litigator on numerous complex commercial, regulatory, and  constitutional  [[Page S6799]]  matters in both State and Federal courts, including the Third Circuit.  He has represented a diverse set of clients, including the New York  Times and Pennsylvania's former Democratic Governor Ed Rendell.   Prior to joining Buchanan Ingersoll, Mr. Porter served for 2 years as  a law clerk for current Chief Judge D. Brooks Smith of the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Third Circuit, while he was serving as a U.S.  District Judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In addition to  his law firm practice, Mr. Porter has served in numerous professional  service and other organizations. For example, he has been a leader in  the Allegheny County Bar Association. His peers elected him to serve as  the chair of two of that association's preeminent sections: the Federal  court section and the civil litigation section. He also served on the  Pennsylvania State Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights.   During his distinguished legal career, Mr. Porter has developed an  outstanding reputation for professionalism, fairness, and integrity.  His nomination is supported by a diverse group of attorneys and  organizations, including the Pittsburgh firefighters union--IAFF Local  No. 1-- the current president and a past president of the National  Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, and the president of  the Pittsburgh Steelers.   Mr. Porter has all the essential qualities needed to excel as a  Federal judge: experience, intelligence, integrity, and respect for the  limited role of the judiciary in our constitutional system. I am  pleased to support this highly qualified nominee and urge my colleagues  to do the same.                            ____________________
