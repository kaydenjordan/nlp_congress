 Madam Speaker, she was a 14-year-old girl when she  was forced into sex trafficking. Her name is Tina Frundt.   Like so many other trafficking victims, she was lured away from the  safety of her home--a home nearby to this United States Capitol--and  she was lured away by a man she thought she knew, and she trusted him.   He sweet-talked her and promised her a perfect life somewhere far  away. He was a smooth-talking, slick con artist, tempting her with  gifts and affection just to get her into the slave trade.   Her blissful, happy, and trusting world view all came crashing down  when she found herself in a dark motel room surrounded by unfamiliar  men in an unfamiliar city.   The trafficker forced her to have sex with the men for money. When  she refused to have sex, the men just raped her. They stole her  dignity, her self-respect, and her happy spirit.                                time  1215    Tina had become a slave on the marketplace of sex trafficking. These  disgusting predators used the innocence of children to force them into  the horrific life of sex trafficking. Most cannot imagine the depths of  the suffering and abuse Tina suffered during the next year. She was  forced to have sex with over 18 men a day. When she fell short of the  mandatory $500 daily quota, she was beaten and beaten and humiliated.  Her life consisted of cigarette burns, broken arms, broken fingers, and  intimidation. Tina was arrested, treated as a delinquent, and was  shuttled from one jailhouse to another.   Tina and other victims of human trafficking are victims of crime-- they are not criminals; they are not juvenile prostitutes. Under the  law, juveniles cannot commit the crime of prostitution. These victims  do not belong in the criminal justice system. It is the  [[Page H707]]  vile traffickers and buyers who belong behind bars. In fact, we built  jails and prisons for these deviants.   Stories like Tina's are common in our Nation. Sex trafficking just  does not happen in foreign countries. As co-chair of the Congressional  Victims' Rights Caucus, along with my friend Jim Costa and coauthor of  the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, along with Carolyn Maloney,  it seems to me that, in America, human trafficking victims need to be  identified, rescued, and not abandoned.   The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act does three things: it  prosecutes the traffickers--the slave traders--and it locks them up. It  prosecutes the buyers in that it punishes them like the traffickers; it  rescues the victims and treats them as victims, not as criminals;  finally, it establishes a fund that is paid by the traffickers and the  buyers to help treat and restore victims with long-term care.   Let those crooks pay for the system they have created, and let them  pay the rent on the courthouse. America cannot let young girls be  bought and sold on the streets of our Nation. These predators are  everywhere. They are not old men in trench coats but are young, good- looking guys who are well versed in their vile trade. Their next victim  could be anybody's daughter or wife.   No human being should ever have to endure what Tina and other  trafficking victims like her have gone through. Tina was able to escape  her slave trader, and she has become a survivor. Tina, along with many  other survivors, has found a way to turn her darkness of hell into a  light for good.   Recently, I was honored to tour Courtney's House, which is a shelter  right here in Washington, D.C., that Tina founded to rescue and support  trafficking victims. She actively uses her personal experience to  connect with those girls and give them support, nourishment, hope-- things that they need. Since 2008, Courtney's House has helped over 500  victims escape the bonds of sex slavery and become survivors.   In this Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I wish to commend Tina's  leadership and zeal in helping other victims become survivors. Tina is  inspiringly courageous. Victims and survivors should know that we as a  society stand with them and by them; and let the law put the  traffickers and buyers in jail.   Madam Speaker, justice demands such.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, those dastardly deviants that are in  the slave trade of human sex trafficking try to dehumanize their  victim. Victims sometimes lose their self-worth and dignity of  existence.   Last Congress, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, led by  Carolyn Maloney and me, was enacted to go after traffickers and buyers  to rescue victims. Now it is time to expose  [[Page H708]]  the identity of convicted traffickers and sellers of human beings. That  is why Mrs. Maloney and I have introduced the Shame Act.   The Shame Act allows Federal judges to publicly publish the names and  photographs of convicted traffickers and buyers. Shaming works. I  successfully used it as a judge in Texas. Dubbed ``poetic justice'' by  the media, I learned the last thing criminals want are their faces and  crimes exposed to the public.   It is time to let traffickers and buyers know they cannot hide their  evil and the darkness. Put their photographs on billboards. Shame them.  Shame them for their slave trade.   And that is just the way it is.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the names of the organizations  that support the Shame Act.         1. Polaris.        2. The International Organization for Victim Assistance.        3. Shared Hope.        4. The National Organization for Victim Assistance.        5. The Texas Centers for Child Advocacy.        6. The Texas Court Appointed Special Advocates.        7. Stop Child Predators.        8. The Family Focused Treatment Association.                            ____________________
