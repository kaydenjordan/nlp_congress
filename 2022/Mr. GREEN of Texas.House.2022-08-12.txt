 Mr. Speaker, to my friends across the aisle:  Where were you when your twice impeached President was putting billions  of dollars in the pockets of the wealthy?   You complain about drug prices being reduced for seniors, complain  about them having out-of-pocket costs capped at $2,000?   I refuse to allow a bill that is good to be defeated by a perfect  bill that we won't get. I will support this bill, and I ask my  colleagues to do so as well. It is time to take care of our seniors.
