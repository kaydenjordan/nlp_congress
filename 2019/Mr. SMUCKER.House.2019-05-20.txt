 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for the work that  they have done on this bill, and I rise today in strong support of the  Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.   Not only will this bill strengthen our laws to help keep children  safe, but this legislation also makes needed investments to help ensure  children impacted by the opioid epidemic do not face abuse,  maltreatment, and neglect.  [[Page H3990]]    Every one of our communities, sadly, has been impacted by the opioid  epidemic. Sadly, our children are suffering the consequences.   This bill includes a bipartisan amendment that I was pleased to offer  in committee with Representative Underwood to study and learn more  about how parental substance abuse affects the outcomes on adoption.  This study is necessary to help States better serve children in need,  and I was proud to see it unanimously adopted.   Last Congress, I introduced legislation that was passed to reduce  known barriers for foster placement, which was signed into law. This  amendment builds on that important work to help States detect  additional barriers to better serve children caught up by the opioid  epidemic.   Madam Speaker, child abuse is not a partisan issue, and I am proud of  the strong bipartisan work my colleagues have done on the Committee on  Education and Labor to strengthen prevention efforts.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
