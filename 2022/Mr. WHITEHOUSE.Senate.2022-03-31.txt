 Madam President, before I get underway with the  business that brings me to the floor, I would like to take a moment to  say farewell and thank you to a member of my staff who is going on to  other pursuits. Her name is Leah Seigle. She is right behind me, and  she was my scheduler for many, many years.   As every Senator knows, there is a special relationship between a  Senator and a scheduler. They have to be on duty, more or less, 24/7  when we are up and about. They have to deal with our day-to-day life  and how it integrates with our offices. They very often are close to  and involved with our families, because of having to deal with keeping  our family time extant and busy schedules.   So I want to say a word of appreciation to Leah.   I don't know how many speeches she has scheduled me here on the floor  for--all the ``Scheme'' speeches, probably all of the ``Time to Wake  Up'' speeches, and this one today. This one today she actually gets to  be here for and doesn't have to watch on television.   So to Leah Seigle, thank you very much, and to schedulers everywhere,  you are important to us.                     Nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson    Madam President, the reason I am here is to announce my intention to  vote for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court and to congratulate her on the grace and dignity with  which she withstood what Chairman Durbin called her ``trial by ordeal''  in the Judiciary Committee.   Last week, Judge Jackson set the gold standard for patience and  courtesy from a Supreme Court nominee. She demonstrated, hour after  hour after often-agonizing hour, in plain view the qualities that Rhode  Islander and Reagan First Circuit appointee Judge Bruce Selya has  praised in her, an outstanding legal mind, an exemplary judiciary  temperament, and a depth of experience in the courtroom that none of  the sitting Justices possesses.   Judge Jackson reminded us, through her personal story of perseverance  and hope, how historic and important it is to have a Black woman about  to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. That story of perseverance and hope  stretches back beyond Judge Jackson's own life and work into the  experience of Black women through American history, and it illuminates  a brighter American future. So I will be proud to cast my vote for her  confirmation.   During the Judiciary Committee hearing, there were persistent efforts  to rewrite Judge Jackson's own history, to assign to her beliefs she  has never espoused. She dispensed with those attempts so effectively  that I won't dwell on them here. But there were other attempts in that  hearing to rewrite history that I feel obliged to correct here today.   The first is the notion that a Justice must have a ``judicial  philosophy.'' That is news to me. If a nominee has a judicial  philosophy, it is definitely fair game. It is important to explore  that, and it is particularly important to explore that because  predisposition can come masked as judicial philosophy. But I don't see  where a nominee has to have one, and I would actually suggest we are  better off if judges don't, because judicial philosophy can so easily  be code for predisposition.   Republicans persisted in that ``judicial philosophy'' quest, asking  about ``judicial philosophy'' over 50 times. The favored theme appeared  to be the so-called judicial philosophies of originalism and  textualism, doctrines which illustrate my concern about predisposition.   The big, dark money donors who ushered the last three Justices onto  the Supreme Court love the backward look of originalism. A backward  look to an era when industry regulation did not exist because big  industry did not exist. Moreover, Republican Justices completely  ignore originalism when it suits them. As I pointed out in committee,  the entire vast structure of corporate political power in America  erected by Republican Justices over years is a continuing affront to  originalism.    There was no corporate role in politics in the Constitution or the  Philadelphia debates or the Federalist papers. Any of the customary  wellsprings of originalism would say that this is a country to be run  by we the people. But how happy--how happy--corporate political power  makes big Republican donors. So originalism goes out the window, and  corporate power gets baked into our system.   Unlike those judicial philosophies of predisposition and of  convenience, Judge Jackson said her judicial philosophy is her  methodology--``consistently appl[y]'' the ``same level of analytical  rigor'' to a case ``no matter who or what is involved in the legal  action.'' For a judge, following your oath of office, the  constitutional precedents of the Court, and the text of the  Constitution itself should suffice. You don't need a judicial  philosophy.   So where did this Republican fascination with judicial philosophy  come from? Here are talking points distributed by twinned rightwing,  dark money influence groups, the so-called Independent Women's Law  Center and the affiliated so-called Independent Women's Voice. These  groups are tied in with Leonard Leo's massive, secretive $580 million- plus archipelago of front groups, like these, that make up the  rightwing donors' Court-capture operation.   They sent these talking points to Republican Senators even before  Judge Jackson was selected. These dark money groups noted that ``this  nominee is likely to be a woman of color'' and urged the Republicans  not argue, ``that the president's selection process led him to choose  someone who may not be the best person for the job.''   They said:         It is . . . important that you focus not on the selection       process or on the nominee's paper qualifications, but rather       on the need to learn more about the nominee's judicial       philosophy.    The marching orders were clear, and 50 efforts at ``judicial  philosophy'' discussion later, we saw these talking points play out in  that hearing.   This rewrite of history, to presume that every nominee should have a  judicial philosophy, just because rightwing nominees have a fake  judicial philosophy of originalism that turns out to be sourced to  rightwing dark money talking points, it seems to me to be an effort to  erase the dangers of having a judicial philosophy, particularly a  judicial philosophy that masks predisposition and is selectively  applied.   Another rewrite of history came through the witness chosen to  highlight Judge Jackson's amicus brief defending a 2000 Massachusetts  law establishing buffer zones for protests around abortion clinics.   The witness was a sidewalk counselor, someone who encourages women  not to go in and exercise their rights. She seemed like a very nice  woman, and she testified that she acted with compassion and love. But  history and  [[Page S1900]]  my experience don't align with that image of clinic protesters, as I  recall personally.   Crowds outside of clinics in Rhode Island in those years leading up  to the 2000 law were hostile and intimidating, screaming and accusing  of murder, to the point where patients coming in required security  escorts to protect them.   I remember pink sweatshirts that safety escorts wore outside Planned  Parenthood so that patients could identify who was there to help them  and then pass safely.   Activists went back and forth between Massachusetts and Rhode Island  to protest outside of clinics.   On the morning of December 30, 1994, bad went to worse. A man walked  into a pair of abortion clinics in Brookline, MA. At the first clinic,  he shot and killed the receptionist with a modified semiautomatic  rifle, then turned on others present--patients, their accompanying  partners, staff. He left that clinic and traveled to the second clinic  and there continued the slaughter. The man killed two people and  wounded five others in this rampage, which shook New England to the  core.   I was the U.S. attorney when word came out of these shootings at  clinics just 1 hour up the road and that the shooter was still at  large. I thought Rhode Island might very well be next. So I went and  stood outside the Planned Parenthood clinic just off the highway with  my friend and Federal law enforcement colleague U.S. Marshal Jack  Leyden, and we stood there on that cold morning until a police cruiser  could be posted outside.   I will just say that the environment that led to Massachusetts'  buffer zone law passing in 2000 was not an atmosphere of compassion and  love, and it is a disservice to the facts to try to rewrite history and  pretend that it was.   Another rewrite of history that took place in this hearing was a  rewrite of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.   The Judiciary Committee had been provided evidence in those hearings  that young Brett Kavanaugh was an out-of-control drinker with a bad  history of behavior around women--most particularly the testimony of  this woman that she had been physically assaulted as a young woman.   You would never know of her testimony from the history rewrite  offered by Republicans in the recent hearings. You would never know  that she came to the Judiciary Committee; that she testified under oath  and intense public scrutiny; that she weathered the attentions of a  professional prosecutor hired by the Republicans; that she was calm and  credible.   And you would never know that the FBI tanked its supplemental  background investigation into these allegations, including a tip line  whose tips received zero FBI investigation. I have described it before  as a tip dump, not a tip line.   The tips related to the nominee were segregated from the regular  stream of tips in the FBI tip line and sent, without investigation, to  the White House.   Republicans sought to erase all of that by rewriting Kavanaugh  hearing history during this Supreme Court hearing. Well, she has a face  and she has a name: Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.   And the big rewrite--the big rewrite is to ignore all the evidence  that our Supreme Court is now a captured Court, captured in the same  way that Agencies and Commissions are sometimes captured by big special  interests.   There is a whole literature in administrative law, there is a whole  literature in economics about Agency capture or regulatory capture.   Well, even before the Trump Presidency, big, powerful, rightwing  donor interests began spending massive sums of money to install  Justices on the Supreme Court whom they expected to rule reliably in  their favor.   Very often, as the Presiding Officer knows, if you can pick the  judges, you can pick the winner.   The 5-to-4 and now 6-to-3 Republican majority on the Court has been  steadily delivering for those big donors; over 80--eight, zero--80 5- to-4 partisan wins for big corporate and partisan donor interests under  Chief Justice Roberts.   In those 5-to-4 partisan decisions, by the way, where there was an  identifiable Republican donor interest involved, it wasn't just the 80  decisions that stood out; it was the fact that the score was 80-to-0.  Every single one went their way.   Dark money lurked behind the Federalist Society turnstile that picked  the Justices. Dark money lurked behind the secretive Agency down the  hall from the Federalist Society that ran the ads for them. Dark money  lurks behind the flotillas of front group amici curiae that tell the  Justices, in orchestrated chorus, how to rule.   You would never know any of this from our Republican friends in the  committee.   But the American people have seen those decisions, and more and more  they understand that the Court is rigged; that it is now the Court that  dark money built.   Judge Jackson, by contrast, is a walking reminder of what the Court  ought to be. She didn't pass through the dark money-funded turnstile at  the Federalist Society. She arrived after a lifetime of accomplishment,  against unimaginable odds, through a fair and honest selection process,  through her merit and abilities.   The attacks on her in the committee were unseemly, but there is no  need to dwell on that because at the end of the day, they were sound  and fury, signifying nothing.   Judge Jackson will excel on the Supreme Court, and I will proudly  cast my vote to put her there.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
