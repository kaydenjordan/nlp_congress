 Madam Speaker, I rise today during  National Nurses Week to celebrate America's hardworking and  professional caregivers, our nurses.   National Nurses Week is celebrated annually from May 6 through May  12, the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern  nursing.   Men and women who enter the nursing profession care for bodies and  minds and educate and empower patients.   This rewarding profession allows nurses to deeply impact their  patients' lives. Often, nurses help those facing serious health  challenges.   Nursing is a science; it is an art; and it is a profession for the  most giving, caring, and compassionate individuals.   Nurses help patients and their families enter new stages of life.  From the birth of a child to the challenge of an aging parent, nurses  are there, providing expertise and encouragement, delivering care and  compassion, and working to deliver positive outcomes.   Madam Speaker, some nurses travel the globe caring for others. Others  are the well-known caregivers in their small communities.   Wherever they practice, I say thank you to our nurses for caring so  deeply for all of us.                            ____________________
