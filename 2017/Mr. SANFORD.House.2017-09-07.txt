 Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), I have an amendment at the desk.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 7, 2017, on page H7158, the following appeared:  Mr.  Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Lobiondo), I have an amendment at the desk.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Chair, I want to make clear I am offering this  amendment on behalf of the gentleman from New Jersey, Frank LoBiondo,  who I know has worked with my colleague, the gentleman from Virginia,  Don Beyer, on this bipartisan measure. I think it is one that makes  sense. It would, quite simply, restrict money with regard to seismic  testing on the Atlantic waters and the waters of the Florida Straits.   Now, why do I think that that is important? I think it is important  because you don't build a foundation if you don't intend to build a  house. And yet, fundamentally, what we are trying to do is move forward  on something that I think begs this most Republican of questions, which  is: Do we believe in home rule?   At home, every municipality of every town and hamlet along the coast  of South Carolina has come out unanimously against the idea of offshore  drilling and seismic testing, not because they are against fossil fuel,  but simply because they believe that they want to determine themselves  how the coast of South Carolina develops. That is obviously the case  with many colleagues from Florida, who have now headed home to deal  with the hurricane, and a whole host of other places up and down the  Atlantic and, again, the Straits of Florida.   So I think that this amendment fundamentally is about this notion of,  if you believe that the government that is most local governs best--not  always, but generally--then might you not give this amendment a try,  because fundamentally what it says is places like Port Fourchon are  nice, but what the people of South Carolina have determined is that we  don't want our coast to develop that way because of the amount of  onshore that is necessary to support offshore operations.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my colleague.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I very much respect the viewpoint of the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), and I want to be clear: I believe in  fossil fuel.   I think that the real conundrum in this debate is who is best able to  determine whether or not areas off of where they happen to live should  or shouldn't be developed: Should it be decided from Washington, D.C.,  or should it be decided by local folks?   So I would frame this, fundamentally, as an issue of home rule, that  all  [[Page H7160]]  the points that you are making are very, very valid, but shouldn't that  determination be made by folks that are most close and would be most  affected by what might or might not happen in the offshore waters off  of the coast of South Carolina or Florida or Georgia or elsewhere?   So I just go back to, if we found the mother of all lodes, there has  been testing out there, they say 132 days' worth of supply might be off  the coast of South Carolina, and what people have said is we have a  vibrant tourism industry on the coast of South Carolina and we don't  think the risks are worth the rewards based on what might or might not  be out there.   So I very much respect the viewpoint of the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Duncan), but again, what folks are telling me at home on  the coast of South Carolina is, even if stuff is out there, we are  concerned about the tourism risk and we are concerned about the  infrastructure that would be required to support it.    Mr. Chair, I will split my time, in the spirit of  bipartisanship, with my colleague from Virginia, and I would simply say  this: I want to go back to the most basic of all conservative themes,  which is we believe that the individual is paramount in the way that  decisions get made and that not all decisions should be made in  Washington, D.C. And if folks have spoken out as clearly and as loudly  as they have with regard to home rule on what should or shouldn't  happen off their coast, that voice ought to be respected in Washington,  D.C.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to my colleague from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).                                time  2030     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
