 Mr. Speaker, the resolution rightfully expresses the  urgent need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Yemen, which  remains a stain of the conscience of the world.   The resolution condemns violations of international law and  specifically denounces those actions taken by Iran that are illegal.  Saudi Arabia should also be subjected to that judgement.   When the resolution ``denounces the conduct of activities in Yemen  and areas affected by the conflict that are, directly or indirectly,  inconsistent with the laws of armed conflict, including the deliberate  targeting of civilian populations or the use of civilians as human  shields'' and ``calls on all parties to the conflict to allow for  unobstructed access for humanitarian organizations, human rights  investigators, medical relief personnel, and journalists,'' those calls  should apply both to the Iranians and to the Saudis.
