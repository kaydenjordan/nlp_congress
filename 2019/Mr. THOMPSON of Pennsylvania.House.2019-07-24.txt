 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Saint Francis University on a well-deserved grant from the  Appalachian Regional Commission, otherwise known as ARC.   ARC recently announced Saint Francis University as the recipient of a  $150,000 grant to support advanced patient simulation training  equipment for the university's new Health Science Experiential Learning  Commons that will open this October.   The Commons will include much-needed space for classroom, laboratory,  and clinical education, including five state-of-the-art simulation  suites where students can practice real life clinical scenarios on  computer-controlled mannequins with the assistance of their instructors  through two-way audio-video conferencing.   The grant will be used to invest in this cutting-edge technology to  provide students with the technology needed to close the skills gap and  better prepare them for situations they will likely encounter in their  professional careers.   Saint Francis University has committed itself to career and technical  education in the health science field, and this grant will help provide  hundreds of students with the training necessary to prepare for  rewarding careers and, quite frankly, service to their community.   Investments like these are playing a critical role in developing the  21st century American workforce, in developing a workforce full of  talented individuals who can help meet today's ever-growing demand for  healthcare professionals.   Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District, in particular, is in need  of healthcare professionals, and Saint Francis students are rising to  the occasion. The grant will not only support current Saint Francis  students; ARC rightfully noted, ``local employers will have access to a  pipeline of highly-skilled healthcare professionals to meet labor  demands, help create jobs and expand the local economy, and provide  quality healthcare to citizens in Appalachian Pennsylvania.''   Reverend Malachi Van Tassell, President of Saint Francis University,  noted the value that this grant adds for the students who are seeking  an education in health science. He said, ``This equipment will allow  our students to practice hands-on patient care procedures in a  simulated environment and to learn how to work in an interprofessional,  team-based setting. Beyond the benefit to our students, it will also  enable us to provide advanced training opportunities to area emergency  medical services personnel and first responders.''   Mr. Speaker, this grant is not just an investment in Saint Francis,  it is an investment in Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District. It  is an investment in the lifeblood of our local communities.   When we empower learners and provide them with the necessary  resources for a conducive, innovative learning environment, our  students will thrive personally and professionally, and will provide  the best possible care to Pennsylvanians in need.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this week the U.S.  Department of Agriculture announced and published a new rule that would  address ``broad-based categorical eligibility'' through the SNAP  program, formerly known as food stamps.   Under current law, SNAP recipients in dozens of States have been  automatically enrolled into the program, despite not really  demonstrating financial need; simply by receiving other minimal welfare  services, even just receiving a pamphlet in the mail.   Now, let me be clear that these changes--anyone who truly is  economically distressed and eligible will continue to receive SNAP  benefits. But through the loophole that has been in existence, some  recipients were enrolled in the program without meeting its asset and  income tests. The asset and income tests are critical metrics to ensure  program integrity and prevent benefits from going to those who would  not normally qualify or truly need the assistance.   This new regulation attempts to fix this problem by limiting  categorical eligibility for SNAP recipients only to those recipients  who receive substantial welfare benefits, rather than nominal ones.   As the former chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I rise in  strong support of this proposal. Enacting this rule will help address  waste and abuse within SNAP, while encouraging the continued  availability of the program for our friends in need who truly find  themselves food insecure.                            ____________________
