 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to our colleague  Walter Jones, who passed away last month. Walter was my friend. Ever  collegial and kind, he saw this institution for the good it could do  for his constituents and for our country.   I admired Walter for his candor and for his patriotism. Over the  years, I watched him make very difficult decisions, take very difficult  votes. He did so out of principle. He stood up for what he believed.   It's no surprise that Walter had so many friends on both sides of the  aisle. And it's no surprise either why the people of North Carolina's  coastal communities sent him back to Congress election after election.  Those of us who served with him could also see the extraordinary love  he had for his wife Joe Anne and for their daughter Ashley.   We will miss Walter Jones in this House. I will miss my friend. We  all are better off for having served with him, and this House and this  country are better off for his service.
