 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H. Res. 76, the  motion to remove Congresswoman Ilhan Omar from the House Foreign  Affairs Committee.   Let's be frank. This is not about antisemitism. If we're going to  have a conversation about antisemitism, let's start with Donald Trump  inviting vile antisemites and neo-Nazis like Nick Fuentes to dine with  him.   This vote today is a partisan, baseless attack of political vengeance  and nothing more.   I want to make very clear what this country would lose without  Congresswoman Omar's representation on the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Ilhan, who I've had the pleasure of getting to know well over the  years, is an experienced, dedicated, talented legislator and public  servant. She is a survivor of war who knows first-hand the trauma of  conflict and life in a refugee camp. And she would be the first  African-born member to serve as a Ranking Member of the Africa  Subcommittee.   Republicans are taking this action at the same moment that we are  working to rebuild relationships with the people of Africa--at the same  time that China emerges as a powerful force on the continent. By  treating Congresswoman Omar this way, we are silencing the voice of a  woman who knows firsthand what is needed to repair our relationships on  the African continent and allow it to thrive, as opposed to castigating  African nations as ``S-hole'' countries like the former president and  leader of the Republican party shamefully did.   Stripping her from this committee is not only undemocratic. It is a  shame, a disgrace, and a profound loss for the people of the United  States. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, to stand with  Ilhan, and to vote against this bigoted resolution.
