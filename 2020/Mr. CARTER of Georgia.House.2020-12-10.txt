 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Mr. Jimmy Orr of Brunswick, Georgia, who recently passed away  after a long and impactful life.   Jimmy was a gifted athlete who excelled in basketball, baseball, and  football in high school and went on to attend Clemson University on a  basketball scholarship.   He later transferred to the University of Georgia to become one of  the Wally Boys, which was a term used for those who played under  football Head Coach Wally Butts.   During his junior year at the University of Georgia, Jimmy was  initially drafted by the Los Angeles Rams and was later traded to the  Pittsburgh Steelers after graduation.   His exceptional performance made him an easy choice for United Press  International and Associated Press Rookie of the Year in 1958.   After Jimmy's outstanding 13-year career with the NFL, he eventually  led several successful business ventures before retiring to the Georgia  coast, where he held a successful golfing record.   He was not only an amazing athlete; he was a loving father and  husband, a wonderful friend, and a generous philanthropist who impacted  the lives of countless individuals.   I am thankful for Jimmy's many years of representing Brunswick well,  and I know his legacy will continue for many years to come.                            ____________________
