 Madam Speaker, too often, the speeches we  make on the floor of this Chamber emphasize our differences and  divisions, but this morning I want to highlight and praise an act of  bipartisanship, the creation of the Fentanyl Prevention Caucus.   Some of you know my family's story and how lucky we are that our son  was not a victim to fentanyl overdose or drug poisoning, but many  families have not been so lucky. Too many.   From 2021 to 2022, more than 107,000 people died of overdoses or  fentanyl poisoning. Sixty-seven percent involved synthetic opioids like  fentanyl.   Whether we focus on the flow of chemicals from China, the trafficking  of drugs over our border or through airports or ports of entry, we must  come together to stop this poisoning that is killing our loved ones.   This Congress needs to educate and legislate our way out of this  tragedy. I believe this bipartisan caucus can do just that.   I thank my fellow co-chairs, Representatives Neguse, Issa, and  Calvert, for their leadership. Bipartisan work will save lives.                            ____________________
