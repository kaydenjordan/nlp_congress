 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I can't begin to tell you how saddened I was at the  passing last month of my dear friend and colleague, Walter Jones.   What a great man Walter was and what a great loss to this  institution.   Walter was one of my closest friends in Congress. I wish I had been  able to spend more time with him, but I will be forever grateful for  the time that I did spend with him.   I am glad I was able to attend his funeral in North Carolina to say  good-bye and celebrate his life with his family and friends. I am  pleased to join with my colleagues here today to do the same.   Even though Walter was one of my best friends, he would always refer  to me as ``Chairman.'' I used to think that was because I was the  chairman of the House Liberty Caucus. Then one day I realized that he  would call all sorts of people ``Chairman,'' so I asked him about it,  and he told me, ``Everyone is chairman of something.''   Well, Walter, you were the chairman of kindness, humility, dignity,  courage, integrity and honor.   Walter was one of the best men I knew, a kind, humble, dignified man  dedicated to his faith, his family, and the people he represented.   Walter had a courage and integrity you rarely see in this chamber or  anywhere. He never gave up fighting for what he believed in. He wasn't  in Washington for money, power, or fame. He cared about honor and doing  the right thing, and he was brave enough to admit when he was wrong.   You were a good man, Walter, no matter what you may have thought  about your mistakes. You were a good man, chairman, and I will miss  you.   May your memory be eternal.
