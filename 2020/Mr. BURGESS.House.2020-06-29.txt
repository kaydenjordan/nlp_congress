 Madam Speaker, the Affordable Care Act, for the last 10  years, really has been anything but affordable. Prices have gone up  every year in spite of what we were promised. It has only been the last  2 years that premiums have actually begun to reduce, and that is  because of some of the policies enacted by the current administration  expanding the usability of limited duration plans, expanding  association health plans.   So when we talk about this bill to expand the Affordable Care Act,  what we are really doing is increasing the unaffordability of  healthcare in this country.   Now, H.R. 1425 establishes a new reinsurance program, and it is going  to cost $10 billion per year forever. There is no end date.   This reinsurance program does not include some of the longstanding  protections that ensure that Federal funding cannot be used to pay for  abortions.   If we want to pass a bipartisan reinsurance policy, Energy and  Commerce Republicans have a bill, H.R. 1510, which includes reinsurance  coupled with structural reform of the Affordable Care Act and gives  States more choice on how to repair their markets that have been  damaged by the Affordable Care Act, and it is offset by stopping bad  actors from gaming the system. Importantly, it does include the Hyde  protections and, therefore, protects life.   H.R. 1425 also punishes States that choose not to expand Medicaid by  cutting their Federal share of Medicaid funding.   So let's be very clear about this. A State such as mine that did not  expand Medicaid reevaluates year by year, but if they choose not to  expand, if they say they can't afford what this expansion would bring  to the State, now this bill proposes to reduce the funding, the  [[Page H2617]]  Federal match, for the traditional Medicaid populations. And who are  they? Blind, aged, disabled, medically fragile, children, women.                                time  1030    Why would we want to do that? Now, look, remember the reason that we  have some States expanding Medicaid and some not is because of a  Supreme Court case, National Federation of Independent Business v.  Sebelius, which ruled that threatening States' Medicaid funding for not  expanding is unconstitutional. Sections 204 and 205 of this bill would  violate those very same principles and coerce States rather than  incentivize them to expand Medicaid. This will be struck down by the  Supreme Court as well.   Lastly, this bill uses offsets that would actively harm our Nation's  coronavirus response by using offsets from H.R. 3 that would require  the government to set prices and confiscate dollars from pharmacologic  developers. The Congressional Budget Office analysis found that such  policies would lead to substantially fewer new drugs coming to market.  We really can't afford a world without the next remdesivir.
