 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  brave  [[Page H3752]]  men and women who place their lives on the line to protect our  communities. They deserve every ounce of support from their government.    I introduced H.R. 2379 to permanently authorize the Bulletproof Vest  Partnership Grant Program at $30 million every year. Our bill will help  struggling law enforcement agencies maintain the necessary lifesaving  bulletproof vests for each of their officers.   Making this important grant program permanent is one of the most  sensible policies Congress can pursue. According to the Government  Accountability Office, more than 3,000 law enforcement lives have been  saved by armored vests since 1987.   But vests are costly, and they wear out. Thankfully, this Federal  program has ensured our Nation's police officers are equipped with the  latest technology to keep them safe.   For the last two decades, the program has awarded more than 13,000  jurisdictions a total of $467 million in matching Federal funds to help  purchase more than 1.3 million vests.   Mr. Speaker, we know that having well-staffed, well-trained, and  properly equipped public safety departments is critical to ensuring our  communities are safe. The importance of sustained Federal funding on  this front cannot be overstated.   I am proud the House of Representatives is considering this  legislation during National Police Week, as was just mentioned. We  mourned the loss of 158 law enforcement officers in 2018 who died in  the line of duty, three of whom served in New Jersey. At 53, this was  the deadliest year for law enforcement officers being shot.   Ensuring more vests are in the field, which can help reduce the  statistics, is our goal.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to recognize the three  officers from New Jersey who died while serving in the line of duty.   First was my friend from New Jersey, Tamby Yagan of the Paterson  Police Department. With 13 years of service in his hometown, Officer  Yagan died in an automobile crash while on duty on April 22, 2018.   Lieutenant Christopher Robateau from Jersey City passed on January 5,  2018, after being struck by a vehicle.   New Jersey State Police Trooper Robert Emmet Nagle passed on November  26, 2018, because of 9/11-related illness.   Mr. Speaker, I grieve for their families, as do you, and their loved  ones. I know this House does, too.   Our Nation's local, State, and Federal law enforcement officers  constitute both the first and last lines of protection for the American  people. These officers deserve our support, and I am committed to  ensuring that they have the resources needed to protect the public's  safety.   Congress has renewed the program five times, most recently in 2016.  The current authorization expires next year.   I especially thank Congressman Peter King from New York, who is  always there on the firing line for our police officers. On every bill,  on every piece of legislation, he is there.   I also thank Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and, of course, the  bill's namesake, Patrick Leahy.    Mr. Speaker, this bill has strong support from several  law enforcement groups, including the National Sheriffs' Association,  the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police  Organizations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the  Sergeants Benevolent Association, and the Major County Sheriffs'  Association.   I thank Chairman Nadler for allowing our bill to be released.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in strongly supporting  H.R. 2379.                                time  1545
