 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the efforts  of Casey Dittrich, road superintendent of Antelope County, Nebraska, to  repair the many roads damaged by the storms and flooding that battered  our State and much of the Midwest last month.   Even before the floodwaters had crested, Casey was actively  formulating plans to repair the roads, having contracted outside  employees and a large fleet of equipment to commence repairs as soon as  possible.   Through his efforts, Antelope County has made steps toward reopening  its more than 1,000 miles of gravel roads and 180 miles of paved roads  for students to attend schools and livestock producers to continue  their daily business, as well as many others.   In his 3 years working for Antelope County, Casey's efforts have  garnered respect from his coworkers, and his work throughout this flood  has greatly  [[Page H2926]]  helped the county along its long way to recovery.   Please join me in thanking Casey Dittrich for his proactive and  diligent service to Antelope County, Nebraska.                            ____________________
