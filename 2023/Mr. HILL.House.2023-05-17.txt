 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, also I congratulate the gentleman from Massachusetts for  having the third child join his family in this past week. We  congratulate the Auchinclosses on that.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the gentleman from  Massachusetts' bill, the Power of the Mint Act. I thank him for our  partnership in introducing the first bipartisan bill in this House to  prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital  currency, or a CBDC.   We believe together that under the Constitution, that authority rests  solely with Congress and the American people, not unelected  bureaucrats. That is a nonpartisan view.   Something that sets Americans apart from others is that we are  rebelliously independent and skeptical of Government overreach. It is a  cultural tradition in this country that has been passed down from our  Founders.   I compliment the gentleman for having a portrait of Alexander  Hamilton in his office indicating his strong support of the  Constitution's views on money.   Recently, the only time my constituents from central Arkansas call me  about digital assets is when they are worried that Uncle Sam is going  to use a central bank digital currency to surveil where they are  spending money and how much and ultimately block them from using the  banking and payments system.   Instead, we are working collaboratively on a bicameral, bipartisan  basis to believe that innovation belongs in the private sector. That is  why we had this coalition working in both the House Agriculture  Committee and the House Financial Services Committee to craft a  regulatory framework that preserves Americans' privacy, preserves  American competitiveness, and puts America in the right form for a  digital future in money.   Americans have that right to financial privacy, and that is why I am  proud to support the gentleman from Massachusetts' bill.
