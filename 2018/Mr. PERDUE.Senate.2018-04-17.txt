 Mr. President, today is tax day, 2 days later than April  15 actually, but nonetheless, today is tax day. I rise to speak about  the impact of what we have done over the last 15 months to affect the  future of our free enterprise system in America. When President Donald  Trump took office last year, he set out with three clear priorities.  Under the major objective last year, job one was to grow the economy.  To do that, he charged us in Congress to focus on three things:  regulations, energy, and taxes. In addition to those three, we were  supposed to try to get to Dodd-Frank and take away some of the pressure  on small banks and regional banks, which we have done this year in the  Senate. Just a few weeks ago, we passed a bill. The reason that is  important, those four things will free up some estimated $6 trillion in  potential capital investment that has not been at work in our $20  trillion economy.   What we have just done with regulation, energy, and taxes will free  up or have the opportunity to free up the $6 trillion. That is huge in  this economy. In the regulatory environment last year, well over 860  regulations were reversed. It is the largest in history. Concrete steps  have been taken to unleash our country's full energy potential,  including with ANWR, the Keystone Pipeline, and adjustments to the  Clean Power Plan and the waters of the United States, just to mention a  few.    Finally, historic changes to the Tax Code were signed into law by  President Trump. It used to be that today was a bad day in America, and  we all dreaded it. It was the day we had to turn our taxes in. This  year, it is actually a day of good news in that this is the last time  the American people will have to file their taxes by using the old,  outdated tax system that has become so archaic and so noncompetitive  with the rest of the world. These changes to the Tax Code will bring  relief to American workers and businesses. The average, median-income  household in America--a family of four--will see its taxes reduced by  about $2,000 a year, or more than half.   The change to the Tax Code of making our tax rate more competitive is  making American-made goods much more competitive on the world stage.  The greatest hindrance to and the greatest tax on the American worker  in years past was this archaically high corporate tax rate. People  said: Well, we just pushed all of those profits to the corporate  entities. No, this is the greatest thing we could do for the American  worker--to help them become more competitive with the rest of the  world, to give them a level playing field. That is what we did in this  tax bill.   We are already seeing the early positive results. Over 2 million new  jobs have been created since President Trump took office, and consumer  confidence is at a 17-year high. As an ex-retailer and a person who has  worked with consumer products and in manufacturing for most of his  career, I have watched this index. This is phenomenal to be at a 17- year high this early in this turnaround. It bodes well for the future  of what we have just done.   CEO confidence is at a 20-year high. Some $2 trillion in overseas  profits has potentially been unlocked to be made available now for  capital investment back in this country. Yes, we already see public  corporations making public statements in their quarterly earnings  reviews about the capital investment plans they are laying out. We see  investment increases being announced every month from public companies  in America today. There is no question that businesses are beginning to  bring those profits home and investing in our economy.   Nationally, in addition, over 4 million Americans have received  bonuses and wage increases. Over 500 businesses have taken positive  action, be it by giving out bonuses, raising wages, increasing 401(k)  matches, or increasing their overall investments in their companies.   As a matter of fact, another benefit is that most of these public  corporations have major foundations that do philanthropic work-- tremendously constructive philanthropic work. Most of these companies  that have made these announcements about their own financial well-being  and those of their employees have also dramatically increased their  contributions to those philanthropic efforts and those trust funds.   In my home State of Georgia, dozens of companies are taking action  because of these changes to the Tax Code, and they are making these  statements public. Just go to any public corporation today that is in  its latest quarterly return and look at what it is saying about how  this tax change affects its business and the future of its employees.  This is huge.   It is also huge for the entire country because we are much more  competitive today than we have been. For years the Tax Code was working  against American workers and our entire economy. It was crippling small  businesses' ability to expand their companies and hire more workers. It  was damaging our ability to compete with the rest of the world.  Changing the Tax Code last year was the single greatest thing we could  have done to have unleashed economic growth this year, and we are just  getting started.   I have been through some of these large turnarounds, and I  characterize this as a mega turnaround. After 8 years of the lowest  economic growth in U.S. history, we are now on the rebound. That is so  important for the future of our country in the long term. We have a $21  trillion debt today, as the Presiding Officer knows. One of the things  we have to do in order to dig our way out of that is to get our economy  healthy again. As documented by the CBO, or the Congressional Budget  Office, a 1-percent growth in GDP will yield $300 billion of Federal  revenue every year. That is $3 trillion over the next decade. With the  projection that we are going to add $10 trillion to the debt over the  next decade just from decisions that have been made over the last  decade, we can see that just growing the economy alone is not enough to  solve this debt crisis.   There are some in this body who have argued that this has been  nothing but a boondoggle, nothing but a huge deficit-increasing  exercise. Yes, there were identified costs included with this, but what  was not considered by the CBO was the long-term return on investment,  the leverage effect of that return on investment, or the leverage  effect of this returning profit situation that we have coming back from  the changes in the repatriation law. In addition to that, the CBO  disagreed with using the impact of foreign direct investment, which I  really don't understand.   I am proud that we got this tax bill done, and I know that the  positive impact is really just beginning. There are other things we  must do to deal with our national debt in the long term, like fixing  our budget process, cutting back on redundant agencies, saving Social  Security and Medicare, and finally getting after the spiraling nature  of the underlying drivers of our healthcare costs and not just the  insurance of it.   This wouldn't be happening without these changes to the Tax Code,  however, and without a President with a new perspective in the White  House. President Trump worked in the real world for decades, and he  brings that sense of urgency to the White House. Today he is working at  a business pace, not at a bureaucratic pace, and he is committed to  keeping up the positive momentum.   This year, the pressure is on the other side because, right now, as  we are  [[Page S2211]]  trying to deal with immigration, the labor issue might be a  constraining factor in the ultimate growth of this economy, and we need  to deal with that. For different reasons, both sides believe we need to  be investing in infrastructure. I will remind my colleagues in this  body that it was just in 2011 when this government threw $1 trillion  into our economy. I would debate the benefit of that particular  investment because it was not thrown at those stimulative issues that  would grow the economy.   Today, America deals with a new world. The world situation has never  been more dangerous. The best thing we can do for our military and for  our people is to get this economy moving again and create a level  playing field around the world to help our trade situation. That is  what the President is trying to do right now--to create a more level  playing field so as to grow our economy, fix our budget process, and  deal with the spending issues that we have here at home.   I am excited to be a part of the Joint Select Committee on Budget  Process Reform, which is charged with changing the way we fund the  Federal Government every year. I am hopeful that will lead to a new  budget process that will allow us to avoid the continuing resolutions  and the omnibuses by which five or six people get in a room and decide  how to spend $1 trillion. The tax changes alone will not dig us out of  this debt crisis. We knew that this was the first step in getting it  going, and I am delighted with the impact that it is having on our  economy today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 5:30 p.m. today.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:21 p.m., recessed until  5:33 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Rubio).                            ____________________
