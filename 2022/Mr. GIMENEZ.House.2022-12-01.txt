 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss and honor  the incredible life of Mr. Felipe Valls.   Felipe Valls was a giant of the Cuban exile community in Miami and  founded the iconic Versailles Restaurant in Little Havana.   Valls was born in Santiago de Cuba in 1933. He attended the  prestigious Riverside Military Academy in Georgia and returned to his  hometown after graduating in 1950. When he was 27 years old, Valls  escaped the Communist revolution with his wife and two children.   In Miami, he found work in the restaurant business; first as a  busboy, and then at a restaurant equipment company. He then opened  International Equipment Company, which sold restaurant equipment such  as refrigeration, air conditioners, and espresso machines that he  imported from Europe.   It was at this time that Valls invented the ventanita, the now  ubiquitous window stands where locals gather for their morning shot of  Cuban coffee. In 1971, Valls opened Versailles Restaurant on Calle  Ocho. Today, it is the most famous Cuban restaurant in Miami and  possibly the world.    Versailles is a culinary, social, and cultural landmark in Miami. It  has served delicious Cuban pastries, sandwiches, and cafecitos for more  than 50 years. It is one of the first places that any visitor to Miami  will go, and three U.S. Presidents have eaten there.   In Felipe Valls' own words, Versailles ``is where you come to take  the pulse of our community . . . Versailles is the Cuban exile that  refuses to kneel down.'' I believe that Versailles is the heart of the  Cuban exile community in Miami.   Felipe is survived by his loving children and grandchildren, who  continue his family's proud legacy. His long life reflected those of so  many hardworking Cuban exiles who built a new community in Miami. He  will be missed. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
