 Madam President, I rise in support of the historic  nomination of Deb Haaland to serve as the next Secretary of the  Interior. When confirmed, Congresswoman Haaland will be the first  Native American to serve in a Cabinet position.   Deb Haaland's nomination to become Secretary of the Interior means so  much to the future of this country.   For the historically underrepresented and mistreated indigenous  communities of these United States, it means that their experiences and  perspectives will be valued and represented at the highest ranks of our  Federal Government. This important milestone and this reflection of  their stories cannot be overstated.   It means that young Americans and perhaps especially young people in  indigenous communities, who put themselves through school, take out  student loans, raise children, and run a business, will see their  struggles in this nominee and realize that they, too, can work their  way to high-ranking government positions.   Deb Haaland' s confirmation means that our country will, after 4  years of neglect and catering to the fossil fuel industry, work again  to ensure that our natural resources are conserved for the next  generation.   It means that the Federal Government will take swift, meaningful  actions to address climate change.   It means that trust and relationships between local communities,  Tribes, and the Federal Government will be restored and strengthened.   My Republican colleagues have gone to great lengths to smear  Congresswoman Haaland as an extremist. They point to the commonsense  policies and positions that she took while representing her  constituents as ``radical'' and framing her as ``outside the  mainstream.'' They are adamantly opposed to President Biden's  environmental agenda and, regardless of what Deb Haaland says in  response to their concerns, oppose her because they simply oppose the  President's agenda.   If you took them for their word, you would believe that fossil fuels  would disappear overnight. You would believe that workers in that  industry would immediately lose their jobs, that our energy grids would  become unreliable, that the sky would be falling.   What they don't talk about is how the Department of the Interior is  putting a pause on new, not existing, oil and gas leases. A pause.   They don't mention how Deb Haaland, during her confirmation hearing,  repeatedly assured them that the administration will not abandon  workers and families in the fossil fuel industry as we transition to  clean energy.   They ignored and discounted her repeated commitments to working with  Senators and stakeholders in their respective States on issues that  they care about.   They don't talk about the impacts of climate change on American  communities, how climate change is an environmental justice issue, or  the benefits of expanding our country's clean energy production.   Instead, their message is simple--if the nominee is not beholden to  the fossil fuel industry, they won't support them.   Yes, President Biden's environmental agenda is bold. His commitments  to addressing climate change, which he identified as a crisis, are  strong.   We as a country cannot afford to continue with the fossil fuel  extracting, carbon emitting status quo.   We cannot keep burying our heads in the sand and kicking the can down  the road, expecting our children and grandchildren to clean up our  messes.   President Biden committed to tackling some of the greatest challenges  of our lifetime, and he named climate change as one of the four great  crises of our time.   Major changes will need to happen including our old ways of thinking.  We need to be bold, innovative, and think outside the box.   As our country takes on these issues, challenges and opportunities  are inevitable. By having Deb Haaland at the helm of Interior, I know  that our local communities from Hawaii, to Alaska, to Maine, and  everywhere in between, will have a Secretary willing to listen, a  Secretary who will take the time to understand their issues.   Our country can successfully transition from overreliance on fossil  fuels, increase our clean energy production, protect our environment,  and make real progress on climate change by working together.   Mr. President, a family emergency has kept me from being in  attendence for today's vote. If I were present, I would have voted to  confirm Deb Haaland as Secretary of the Interior. It is not only a  historic vote but one of hope. I urge my colleagues to join me in my  support.    (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Madam President, I was necessarily absent for a  vote on March 15, 2021, so I could return to Hawaii to tend to a family  matter.   On March 15, had I been present, I would have voted yea on the  confirmation of Debra Anne Haaland to be Secretary of the Interior,  rollcall vote 119.                            ____________________
