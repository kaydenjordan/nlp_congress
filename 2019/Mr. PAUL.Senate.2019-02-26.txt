 Madam President, as I stand before you, we are facing a  financial calamity that could make the last financial crisis look like  the good old days. I have become aware of a committee of respected  financial industry experts that has developed a Debt Default Clock,  which conceptualizes the risk associated with a potential Federal debt  crisis that leads to the insolvency of the government. The Debt Default  Clock is the same concept as the famous Doomsday Clock, only in this  case illustrating how close we are to fiscal meltdown.   The Debt Default Clock has 12 factors that are used to measure the  risk associated with the burgeoning Federal debt. The Clock currently  stands at 4 minutes to midnight, which means that insolvency of the  Federal Government is close at hand, and we have little time to act.  Although the 12 criteria were developed on the basis of defining the  circumstances leading to government insolvency and default, they were  also created with the idea of identifying metrics that can be measured,  watched, and compared over time to identify the time remaining before  the sequence of insolvency and default. Eight of these factors are  already in negative territory, and the others are moving in that  direction.   In 2010, I ran for the Senate out of concern that our out-of-control  debt might finally take us off the cliff. It is frustration with  rampant, deficit-financed spending that sparked the Tea Party; yet the  situation continues to get worse. So I urge my colleagues to find out  more about the Debt Default Clock and the role of Congress, the  administration, and the States as to how each of the factors might be  mitigated if the political will exists to do so before calamity hits us  square in the face.   Accordingly, I respectfully request that the following information  related to the Debt Default Clock be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Four Minutes to Midnight: The Revised ``Federal Government Debt Default                                  Clock''                     [From the Default Clock Committee]         Beyond the troubling debt-ceiling standoffs we witness       every few years, looms a far more dire threat: a true U.S.       government default, which economists warn could lead to a       collapse of confidence in the American economy, a run on the       dollar, and perhaps even a global economic meltdown.        How close are we to such a catastrophic federal default?        To answer this question, a group of private-sector       economists and fiscal policy experts has formed a citizens'       committee, called the Debt Default Clock Review Committee, to       maintain an objective, fact-based federal government Debt       Default Clock. The Clock is designed to help the public to       see and track the nearness of the danger. On September 10,       2018, the Review Committee announced significant revisions in       the design of the Clock from its original version to make it       more accurate. This announcement is found at: https:// debtdefaultclock.us/wp-content/uploads/press-release-02a.pdf.        For the Committee's purposes, ``default'' is defined simply       as a failure by the U.S. Treasury to make a scheduled       interest payment on just one direct U.S. Government       obligation such as a Treasury note or bond. ``Insolvency'' is       defined as the point beyond which default becomes a virtual       certainty.        Since 2013, Congress has gotten into the habit of       temporarily suspending the government's statutory debt       ceiling, for a year or two at a go, during which time the       Treasury may incur unlimited amounts of debt. This practice       is dangerous. Repealing the debt ceiling does not repeal the       threat of a default. Indeed, to think that it would or could       is akin to thinking we can be assured of perpetually sunny       days if we simply destroy the barometer! Congress seems to be       telling itself: ``If I just increase the credit limit on my       credit card, I will never have to pay it off!''        The debt ceiling is our most important fiscal barometer,       and we hope our new Debt Default Clock will help the public       to read that important gauge more easily, by showing us in a       clear and simple way how close we are to midnight. Its       purpose is to spur fiscal policy makers to change course       before it's too late.                               the twelve tests         The Clock continuously measures twelve of the most relevant       budget factors, or tests, each of which is framed as a simple       yes-no question. At any given moment, the status of ten of       the twelve factors collectively determines the number of       minutes from midnight the Clock stands at any point in time.       The number of minutes, of course, changes as time passes and       new data is received. Each factor assesses, not just where       things currently stand, but also where things are projected       to move over the course of the next ten years. Each of the       twelve tests is objective. None is arbitrary or influenced by       opinion.        Here are the twelve factors:         1. Do federal outlays exceed 17.5 percent of gross       domestic product (GDP)?         2. Is there a U.S. dollar-denominated debt ceiling in law       presently, and will the projected federal debt stay below       that ceiling during the ten-year budget period?         3. Does the debt held by the public exceed 70 percent of       GDP, and does the gross federal debt exceed 100 percent of       GDP?         4. Do gross federal interest payments exceed 15 percent of       federal revenues?         5. Do gross federal interest payments, on a sustained       basis, exceed 70 percent of the money the federal government       brings in through the issuance of new debt?         6. Does the debt held by the public exceed 80 percent of       the gross debt?         7. Does the debt held by foreigners exceed 50 percent of       the debt held by the public?         8. Will short-term maturities and floating rate       obligations of the Treasury decline from the current level of       73.1 percent of all marketable Treasury debt?         9. Are federal revenues below 17.5 percent of GDP?         10. Does the rate of real U.S. economic growth, as       measured in GDP, exceed 3 percent annually?         11. Has Congress enacted a law prohibiting the Treasury       from resorting to ``extraordinary measures'' in the future?         12. Is Congress scaling back programmatic ``mandatory       spending'' and eventually phasing it out?        While economists and financial experts will readily       appreciate the relevance of each of these factors, we realize       that the lay reader may find them confusing. For everyone's       benefit, the following is a detailed, plain-English       explanation of each factor, together with all of its       underlying data and assumptions.                            warning: default ahead         The United States will reach insolvency--the point of no       return--when the federal government fails at least ten of the       twelve tests set according to the questions listed above. As       of right now, the federal government is currently failing in       seven of them. These are Factors 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 11 and 12,       but one (Factor 9) is projected to right itself before the       end of the current ten-year budget period. The design of the       Clock permits the Review Committee to discount up to two       factors at any one time. The Committee is currently       discounting Factor 9 in accordance with the design. The       federal government is passing the remaining four tests now,       but are projected to fail in all of them sometime during the       10-year budget period.        As of today, the Federal Government Default Clock stands at       just four minutes from midnight. If the federal government       remains on its currently projected fiscal trajectory, the       more politically difficult and economically painful its       choices will become as time passes.        The Default Clock is ticking.         Databases Behind Ten of the Factors of Debt Default Clock         (Note: graphs for each of the factors are shown at https://  DebtDefaultClock.us)          factor #1: do federal outlays exceed 17.5 percent of gdp?         The data associated with Factor #1 in the initial Debt       Default Clock showed that federal outlays were already well       above 17.5 percent of GDP, and peaked in the final year of       the budget period (2027) at 23.1 percent of GDP. The updated       version shows that in the final year of the current budget       period (2028) outlays will rise to 23.3 percent of GDP. Thus,       Factor #1 remains set at buying zero minutes from midnight.       The data bases for this factor are as follows: (1)       Congressional Budget Office, ``Budget and Economic Data,''       under the headings ``Historical Budget Data/ Revenues,       Outlays, Deficits, Surpluses, and Debt Held by the Public       Since 1967 to 2017,'' April 2018; and (2) ``10-Year Budget       Projections/CBO's Baseline Budget Projections, by Category,''       April 2018.   factor #2: is there a dollar-denominated debt ceiling in place, and if   so, does the debt subject to limit stay under the ceiling during the                               budget period?         Currently, there is no dollar-denominated debt ceiling in       place because the debt ceiling  [[Page S1486]]       law has been suspended. Thus, Factor #2 also buys zero       minutes from midnight. Accordingly, there are no data bases       and graph associated with Factor #2 at this point. They will       appear when a dollar-denominated debt ceiling is put back       into place.    factor #3: does the debt held by the public exceed 70 percent of gdp,             and does the gross debt exceed 100 percent of gdp?         Under the initial Default Clock setting, the gross debt       peaked in the final year of the budget period (2027) at just       under 110 percent of GDP. The initial version did not include       data on the debt held by the public. The current version       shows that the gross debt will again peak in the final year       of the budget period (2028) at over 113 percent of GDP. The       debt held by the public is also projected to peak in 2028 at       over 96 percent of GDP. Since both the debt held by the       public and the gross debt exceeded 70 and 100 percent of GDP       respectively in 2012, and are projected to grow, Factor #3       will continue to buy zero minutes from midnight. The data       bases for Factor #3 are as follows: (1) Office of Management       and Budget, ``Historical Tables,'' Table 7.1, February 2018;       (2) Congressional Budget Office, ``Budget and Economic       Data,'' under the headings ``10-Year Budget Projections/      Federal Debt Projected in CBOs Baseline,'' Table 5, April       2018; and (3) Congressional Budget Office, ``Budget and       Economic Data,'' under the headings ``10-Year Economic       Projections/April 2018 Baseline Projection--Data Release       (Fiscal Year).''      factor #4: will gross interest costs exceed 15 percent of federal                                 revenues?         In the initial Default Clock assessment, gross federal       interest costs were projected to exceed 15 percent of federal       revenues in 2020. The revised assessment shows the threshold       will be exceeded this year. This is shown in the accompanying       graph. While the actual data is not yet available, the gross       interest costs may already be above 15 percent of revenues,       and are all but certain to remain above this threshold during       the budget period. For the time being, Factor #4 continues to       buy one minute from midnight. It remains likely, however,       that Factor #4 will buy no minutes away from midnight at the       time of the next assessment. If so, this will force the Clock       to three minutes from midnight if all the other factors       remain stable relative to their thresholds. The data bases       for this Factor are as follows: (1) Department of the       Treasury, ``Interest Expense on the Debt Outstanding,'' at       here (accessed April 12, 2018); (2) Congressional Budget       Office, ``Budget and Economic Data,'' under the headings       ``Historical Budget Data/Historical Budget Data/ Revenues,       Outlays, Deficits, Surpluses, and Debt Held by the Public       Since 1967,'' April 2018, here; and (3) Congressional Budget       Office, ``Budget and Economic Data,'' under the headings       ``10-Year Budget Projections/CBO's Baseline Budget       Projections by Category'' and ``Spending Projections by       Budget Account'' (specifically Line 1682, ``Interest on       Treasury Debt Securities (gross)''), April 2018, also here.       The formula for Factor #4 is: gross interest costs        federal revenues = percent of federal revenues going to cover       gross interest costs.    factor #5: do gross federal interest payments, on a sustained basis,  exceed 70 percent of the money the federal government brings in through                         the issuance of new debt?         The original version of the Default Clock estimated that       the level of gross interest costs would exceed 70 percent of       the money brought in by the issuance of new debt (in net       terms) in 2023. The updated version shows the cross-over       point should be reached in the same year. Thus, Factor #5       continues to buy one minute from midnight. The data bases for       this factor are: (1) Office of Management and Budget,       ``Historical Tables,'' Table 7.1, February 2018, at https:// www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/; (2)       Congressional Budget Office, ``Budget and Economic Data,''       under the headings ``10-Year Budget Projections/Federal       Debt Projected in CBOs Baseline,'' Table 5, April 2018;       (3) Department of the Treasury, ``Interest Expense on the       Debt Outstanding,'' (accessed April 12, 2018); and (4)       Congressional Budget Office, ``Budget and Economic Data,''       under the headings ``10-Year Budget Projections/CBO's       Baseline Budget Projections by Category'' and ``Spending       Projections by Budget Account'' (specifically Line 1682,       ``Interest on Treasury Debt Securities (gross)''), April       2018.    Factor #6: Does the debt held by the public exceed 80 percent of the                                gross debt?         The original version of the Default Clock estimated that       the debt held by the public would exceed 80 percent of the       gross debt starting in 2025. This same year is the estimated       cross-over point for Factor #6 under the updated Default       Clock. Once again, this Factor will buy one minute from       midnight. The data bases for this factor are: 1) Office of       Management and Budget, ``Historical Tables,'' Table 7.1,       February 2018, here; and 2) Congressional Budget Office,       ``Budget and Economic Data,'' under the headings ``Historical       Budget Data/Revenues, Outlays, Deficits, Surpluses, and Debt       Held by the Public Since 1967'' and ``10-Year Budget       Projections/CBO's Baseline Budget Projections, by Category,''       April 2018, here.    Factor #7: Does the debt held by foreigners exceed 50 percent of the                          debt held by the public?         The original version of the Default Clock showed that the       share of the debt held by the public owned by foreigners       would exceed 50 percent in 2021. The updated version of the       Clock shows this Factor's cross-over date remains 2021. Thus,       Factor #8 continues to buy one minute from midnight. The data       bases for this Factor are: 1) here, under the heading       ``Ownership of Federal Securities;'' 2) here (accessed on       April 13, 2018); and 3) here, February 2018.   Factor #8: Will short-term maturities and floating rate obligations of    the Treasury decline from the current level of 73.1 percent of all                         marketable Treasury debt?         The Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of The United       States (the ``Monthly Statement'') describes six types of       securities comprising the marketable Treasury debt       outstanding. They are Treasury Bills (``Bills''), Treasury       Notes (``Notes''), Treasury Bonds (``Bonds''), Treasury       Inflation-Protected Securities (``TIPS''), Treasury Floating       Rate Notes (``FRN's'') and Federal Financing Bank (``FFB'')       securities. The Monthly Statements, including attached Excel       spreadsheets, are available at https:// www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/mspd.htm.        Treasury Bills are short-term obligations with a maturity       of less than one year. Treasury Notes are issued with       maturities of between one and ten years. Treasury Bonds are       issued with maturities in excess of ten years. For purposes       of the Debt Default Clock on any given date, all Bills and       previously issued Notes and Bonds maturing within five years       of that date, along with all TIPS and FRN's, which are       adjustable rate securities subject to periodic adjustments in       their interest rates, are categorized as short-term       maturities and floating rate obligations (``STMFROs''). The       Monthly Statement does not provide the maturity dates for FFB       securities, but generally describes them as long term. Thus,       they are not included in STMFROs and set aside here.        As of September 30, 2018, all the STMFROs constituted 73.1       percent of all the marketable Treasury debt outstanding, as       measured in dollars. This structure of the marketable debt       jeopardizes the financial position of the Treasury by leaving       it vulnerable to increases in both the inflation rate and       interest rates. Specifically, Treasury interest costs would       rise very quickly with higher inflation and interest rates       because of the current structure of the debt. It is the view       of the Debt Default Clock Review Committee that the portion       of all Treasury marketable securities made up by the STMFROs,       as measured in dollars, should be reduced to 50 percent of       the total. Factor #8 of the Debt Default Clock will move the       minute hand one minute away from midnight for every five       percentage points reduced from the 71.3 percent of marketable       securities that constitute the STMFROs at the end of fiscal       year 2018. Currently, Factor #8 buys zero minutes from       midnight. The formula for arriving at this percentage at any       particular time is as follows: the value of the STMFROs        the total value of all marketable securities       outstanding = percent of all marketable securities in       STMFROs.          Factor #9: Are federal revenues below 17.5 percent of GDP?         The data bases for this Factor are found at: Congressional       Budget Office, ``The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to       2028,'' April 9, 2018, pp. 67 and 145, here. There is no       formula for the projected data under this factor because CBO       provides the amounts directly.        Federal revenues were at 17.3 percent of GDP in 2017. CBO       projects they will fall to 16.5 percent in 2019, but grow to       the 17.5 percent of GDP in 2025 and exceed 18 percent of GDP       before the end of the budget period. Given that Factor #9 is       the only factor among the 12 that moves in the right       direction over the course of the budget period, this factor       is currently discounted by the Review Committee.   Factor #10: Does real rate of U.S. economic growth, as measured in GDP,                     meet or exceed 3 percent annually?         The data bases for Factor #10 are found at: 1) Bureau of       Economic Analysis (BEA), Department of Commerce, here, Table       5 under ``Tables Only,'' under the heading ``Gross Domestic       Product'' (historical data); 2) Congressional Budget Office,       ``The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028,'' April 9,       2018, p. 140, here (projected data). There is no formula for       either the historical or projected data on Factor #10 because       BEA and CBO provide the data directly.        GDP grew at the rate of 2.3 percent in real terms in 2017.       CBO projects will reach a rate of 3 percent in 2019, but will       fall below 3 percent in each of the remaining years of the       ten-year budget period. Therefore, Factor #10 currently buys       no minutes from midnight.    Factor #11: Has Congress enacted a law prohibiting the Treasury from           resorting to ``extraordinary measures'' in the future?         This is a purely qualitative factor. It adjusts the minute       hand on the Debt Default Clock on the basis of the       legislative actions or the lack thereof taken by Congress in       the applicable legislative period. Specifically, if either       house of Congress has passed such a bill during the current       Congress, it will buy one minute away from midnight. If such       a law is enacted and remains on the books at the time of the       applicable review by the Review Committee, it will buy two       minutes from midnight. Therefore, there are neither  [[Page S1487]]       data bases, nor formulas, nor graphs associated with Factor       #11. Since current law permits the Treasury to undertake       extraordinary measures, Factor #11 buys no minutes from       midnight at this time.        Factor #12: Is Congress scaling back programmatic ``mandatory                 spending'' and eventually phasing it out?         Mandatory programmatic spending, which sets aside net       interest payments, does not require the annual appropriation       of money by Congress. Effectively, these spending programs       are on autopilot. According to CBO, programmatic mandatory       spending was more than $2.5 trillion in 2017. It projects       this spending to grow to more than $4.5 trillion in 2028.        Congress needs to rein in these programs by moving them       back into the appropriated accounts of the budget. By       starting to take such steps, Congress should be able to       reduce this category of spending dramatically. In fact, it       should phase it out altogether. Under the Debt Default Clock,       if Congress returns enough of this spending to the       appropriated category so that by the end of the ten-year       budget period the mandatory category is less than what it was       in 2017, it will buy one minute away from midnight. If the       mandatory category is projected to be phased out altogether       by the end of the budget period, it will buy two minutes from       midnight. Therefore, Factor #12 currently buys no minutes       from midnight.        The data bases for Factor #12 are found at: the       Congressional Budget Office, ``The Budget and Economic       Outlook: 2018 to 2028,'' April 9, 2018, pp. 44 and 148, here.       The formula for calculating whether mandatory spending is       increasing or decreasing during the projected budget period       under Factor #12 is: mandatory outlays (less offsetting       receipts)--$2.5 trillion (mandatory spending in 2017) =       dollar level increase (decrease) in mandatory spending. If       mandatory spending is projected by CBO to be at zero dollars       before the end of the budget period, it will be considered to       have been phased out.                            ____________________
