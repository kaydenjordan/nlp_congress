 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I hope all Senators had a productive and  restful Thanksgiving holiday.   This year, I am sad to say, was a painful Thanksgiving season for the  Schumer family. Last Wednesday, we all said goodbye to my father Abe  Schumer, who passed away after 98 amazing years.   I want to thank all of my colleagues in this Chamber who have reached  out with prayers, condolences, and words of kindness in recent days.  Their words give us strength. Their prayers give us healing. Their  kindness gives us immense comfort. I say the same to so many New  Yorkers who reached out as well.   Here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I want to take a moment to  offer a loving son's tribute to the man we lost last week.   My father was the kind of parent every kid deserves, every spouse  hopes for, and the sort of American that makes our country great, and  as I shared last week:         In so many ways, he personified the greatest generation. He       took whatever was thrown at him, no matter how difficult; he       did his job and never complained. He was an amazing husband,       parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent.    Dad, we love you. We already miss you beyond comprehension. Thank you  for the incredible life you led on this Earth.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another subject, Omicron. Over  the course of 2021, our country has made monumental and hard-fought  progress in our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.   After the passing of the American Rescue Plan, after getting vaccines  into as many arms as possible, and because of the unceasing work of the  Biden administration and healthcare workers across the country, we  begin the winter of 2021 in a much better place than the winter of  2020.   But as we learn more about the Omicron variant that is spreading  abroad, my message to the American people is simple: If you don't want  to get sick, get vaccinated. If you are eligible, get your booster  shot.   While there is so much we have yet to understand about the Omicron  variant, we do know that you are far less likely to be hospitalized or  die from the coronavirus if you are fully vaccinated. And for those who  are already vaccinated, research shows that boosters are likewise  highly effective. Take the words of Dr. Francis Collins, the head of  the National Institutes of Health:         Boosters do, in fact, allow your immune system to have a       wide range of capabilities against spike proteins it hasn't       seen before.  [[Page S8768]]       If you needed one more reason, if you're eligible to get that       booster right away, this would be it.    Those are the words of Dr. Collins.   By now we know, the longer that eligible people resist safe vaccines,  the greater the risk of new variants like Delta and Omicron arising in  our midst. These strains--these strains--of variants have largely  spread among unvaccinated populations, threatening our families, small  businesses, and prolonging the day we put this wretched disease fully  in the rearview mirror.   So if you aren't getting vaccinated for yourself because you don't  think you need it, then do it for your family, your friends, and your  neighbors because the unvaccinated population is where the variants  multiply, spread, and grow, and hurt everybody.   So as we enter the holiday season, as we begin attending holiday  gatherings and traveling long distances to see families, I urge New  Yorkers and Americans everywhere to stay safe, get vaccinated, and get  boosted. It is the best thing we can do to protect our families, our  communities, and our country.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on NDAA, the Defense Act, we begin  an important week for what will be an important final month of 2021.   Later today, the Senate will vote on cloture on the substitute  amendment to the NDAA. NDAA has been passed by this Chamber for over 60  years, and there is no good reason why this year should be any  different.   Before Thanksgiving, the Senate worked in as bipartisan way as it  could to lay the groundwork for advancing the Defense bill. Senate  Armed Services Committee Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Inhofe  reached an agreement, a bipartisan agreement, on a package of 18  amendments--let me repeat that; 18 amendments, folks--for the Senate to  hold rollcall votes on. Nearly half of those amendments were led by a  Republican. That would be more amendments to the NDAA receiving  rollcall votes than in the last 4 years combined.   We also agreed to the substitute amendment, which included at least  50 amendments, 27 of which were led by a Republican. Senator Inhofe,  the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, agreed to this.   In any other time, this would be considered a very fair and generous  compromise. Even though every Member didn't get every amendment they  wanted, the leadership on both sides would have made sure that cloture  was granted.   Unfortunately, Republicans could not accept this agreement before  Thanksgiving, but we hope that Republican dysfunction will not be a  roadblock to passing this bill and taking care of our troops and their  families.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on government funding, as we all  know, by the end of this week, both parties must come to an agreement  for funding the government and avoiding a needless shutdown.   At the end of September, Democrats and Republicans worked together to  keep the government open through December 3, avoiding many of the  fights that tainted so many funding debates under the previous  administration. After the House takes action this week, the Democratic- led Senate will move forward to make sure the government remains funded  after the deadline.   With so many critical issues, the last thing the American people need  right now is a government shutdown, and Democrats are going to work  this week to make sure we don't have one this time around. It is  important to get it done, and we are working to get it done.                            ____________________     Finally, Madam President, on Build Back Better, before  the end of the year, the Senate will also work on President Biden's  Build Back Better legislation, which momentously passed the House at  the very end of the last work period.   This week, Democrats will continue to meet with the Senate  Parliamentarian in order to complete the technical and procedural work  required before the bill comes to the floor. Meetings were held over  the Thanksgiving week, and we will continue this week and next week as  needed.   As I have said repeatedly, once this necessary work is completed with  the Parliamentarian, I will bring the President's Build Back Better  legislation to the floor so we can pass it as soon as possible and send  it to the President's desk. Our goal continues to be to get this done  before Christmas.   Build Back Better represents the largest investment in the American  people in generations. Under our bill, childcare will be more  affordable, pre-K will be more affordable, and raising kids overall  will be more affordable for tens of millions of parents.   The bill will take unprecedented steps in the fight against the  climate crisis, paving the way for even greater action in the future.   And as scores of economists from across the ideological spectrum  attest to, Build Back Better will not worsen inflation--will not worsen  inflation--and in the long run help bring costs under control.   So cutting costs, saving parents money, fighting climate change, and  creating the jobs of tomorrow--these are the things the American people  want; these are the things the American people need; and these are the  things that Build Back Better will deliver on once we pass it through  this Chamber.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the failed  cloture vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  vote on the underlying bill, H.R. 4350, ripen upon disposition of  substitute amendment No. 3867, as modified.    I thank my friend from Rhode Island. I want to make a  brief statement about the vote, and then I will turn it over to him.   My colleagues, there should be no misunderstanding about the  absurdity that just played out on the floor. For a while now,  Republicans have claimed they want to pass the Defense authorization  legislation immediately. They said we couldn't afford to wait any  longer. They called it a core duty, a bare minimum, and they called on  me to bring it to the floor for a full vote.   But a few moments ago, Republicans just blocked legislation to  support our troops, support our families, and keep Americans safe.  Republican dysfunction has, again, derailed bipartisan progress. The  Republican choice to block our bill and, by an extension, legislation  to support our troops and protect the homeland can be summed up in two  words: inexplicable and outrageous.   I hope the American people are watching. Don't tell me we aren't  offering a fair process. We have had ample debate. We had amendments  from both sides. We had a huge number of managers' amendments, equal  numbers Democrat and Republican. We offered to debate--I believe it is  18 amendments--more than has been on most other bills of this type.   In any other time in history, what we offered Republicans would be  considered a very fair and generous compromise, but just because a few  Republicans didn't get every single concession they insisted on, they  are now halting the process.   Despite this vote, Democrats will continue to work to make sure our  troops get paid and our vital defense programs can continue.   I thank my colleague for his courtesy and yield the floor back to  him.
