 Madam Speaker, we have a continued tragedy and crisis at  our border.   Since President Biden took office, over 2.2 million illegal  immigrants have been apprehended at the southern border. In March  alone, there were over 220,000 illegal encounters at our border, a 600  percent or so increase since 2020.   Madam Speaker, the Biden administration's complete disregard for  their obligation to secure our border is having tragic impacts on  America and in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, in fact, today in a briefing on title 42, the Biden  administration did not lay out a plan on how they were going to prevent  an overwhelming surge at our southern border from lifting of title 42,  but instead describe their efforts to increase the number of  accommodations, buses, and secret plane flights that have occurred in  my district, and they will need to move the mass number of illegals  coming into our country.   These are reckless, inhumane policies. They need to be stopped. They  need to be corrected. And this House--both Republicans and Democrats-- need to stand up for our citizens.                            ____________________
