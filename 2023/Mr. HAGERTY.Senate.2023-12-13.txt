 Madam President, on behalf of myself and Senator  Blackburn, I ask unanimous consent that the following remarks be  printed in the Congressional Record in recognition of David Dill, the  chairman and chief executive office of LifePoint Health.   Since 2017, David Dill has led LifePoint Health, a diversified  healthcare delivery network consisting of 62 community-based acute  hospitals, more than 60 rehabilitation and behavioral health hospitals,  and more than 250 additional sites of care.   Under his leadership, LifePoint Health has become a leader in rural  healthcare, serving as an influential voice for healthcare in  communities across the Nation and helping to educate the industry on  shaping policies that ensure that the needs of patients are met timely  and effectively.   David grew up in a small community in Kentucky, giving him a unique  understanding of healthcare providers in non-urban areas. Throughout  his time at LifePoint, the company has invested significant capital  into the communities it serves, including $1.1 billion in charitable  donations and $5.5 billion in total economic impact during the year  2022 alone.   In addition to his success at LifePoint Health, Mr. Dill has served  as the chairman of the board for the Federation of American Hospitals,  the immediate past chair of the board of directors for the Nashville  Health Care Council, and a member of the American Hospital  Association's Health Systems Committee. Most recently, Mr. Dill was  appointed to serve on the Tennessee Rural Health Care Task Force, which  was formed by Tennessee Governor Bill Lee to advance his  administration's efforts to better serve rural communities across the  State.   On November 30, 2023, Mr. Dill received the 2023 B'nai B'rith Charles  S. Lauer National Healthcare Award, which was established in 1983 to  highlight the standard bearers within the healthcare industry  throughout the country.   This award further recognizes his dedication to community service,  excellence in leadership, and outstanding philanthropic commitment to  the healthcare community and beyond.   I congratulate David Dill on his achievements, and I hope the rest of  my colleagues join us in recognizing his tremendous contributions to  rural healthcare across this country.                            ____________________
