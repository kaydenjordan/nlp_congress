 Madam Speaker, 100 days ago today, the Saudi regime  ordered the assassination of a journalist named Jamal Khashoggi.   This atrocity brought the world's attention to Saudi Arabia, a  radical Wahhabi theocracy where the oppression of women and the  persecution of Christians, Hindus, atheists, and other religious  minorities, as well as the LGBT community, is a norm.   Since 2015, the United States has supported Saudi Arabia's genocidal  war in Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of civilians, causing  millions of Yemeni people to suffer, starve, and get sick, creating the  worst humanitarian crisis in the world.   They spend billions of dollars spreading the extreme Wahhabi-Salafist  ideology that fuels terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaida around the  world.   Contrary to what President Trump believes, Saudi Arabia is not our  friend.   Here we are, 100 days later, and this Congress still refuses to take  action to stop U.S. support for Saudi Arabia, to stop arms sales to  Saudi Arabia. Congress must act now to end its support for Saudi  Arabia's genocidal war in Yemen, exercise our constitutional authority  over matters of war, and stop putting the profits of the military- industrial complex before the lives of the American people and people  in the world.                            ____________________
