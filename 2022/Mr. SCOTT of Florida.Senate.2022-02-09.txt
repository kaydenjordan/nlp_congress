 Madam President, almost 4 years ago, on  February 14, 2018, the world witnessed a senseless attack at Marjory  Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL.   I am proud to join my colleague Senator Rubio to introduce this  resolution which honors the 17 victims of the tragic shooting: Alyssa  Alhadeff, Scott Beigel, Martin Duque Anguiano, Nicholas Dworet, Aaron  Feis, Jaime Guttenberg, Chris Hixon, Luke Hoyer, Cara Loughran, Gina  Montalto, Joaquin Oliver, Alaina Petty, Meadow Pollack, Helena Ramsay,  Alex Schachter, Carmen Schentrup, and Peter Wang.   I often think of these innocent lives who were lost way too early.  They were sons, daughters, parents, and partners. Some were educators,  athletes, musicians; many of them, just kids with a life full of  promise ahead of them. My heart breaks knowing that they will never get  to pursue their dreams and that their families will always have a piece  of their heart missing.   Since that horrific day, I have worked closely with many of the  victims' families to ensure no family has to experience that again.   While I was Governor, we passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School Public Safety Act to make sure our State does everything  possible to ensure this does not happen again.   Now as a U.S. Senator, I am fighting for improvements on the Federal  level, including the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, named after Luke  Hoyer and Alex Schachter, which builds on our work to keep schools  safe.   I am also working with my colleagues to pass the bipartisan EAGLES  Act, which improves school safety for our students and teachers and  provides more resources to law enforcement to prevent future tragedies  from happening.   While, unfortunately, we cannot bring back the lives lost on that  tragic day nearly 4 years ago, I will always work to honor them and do  everything in my power to protect our students and educators and ensure  they have a safe environment to learn and succeed.   Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 508, which  is at the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
