 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of the Corporate  Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, and I appreciate my  good friend, Sean Duffy's work on it.   Over the past 3 decades, I have advocated for responsible shareholder  activism and urged for corporate boards of directors to perform their  responsibility of careful stewardship, particularly in their essential  functions in evaluating corporate strategy, hiring able hardworking  executive management, and, critically, capital allocation.   For example, as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO, Warren Buffett, recommends,  corporate compensation committees must be composed of ``saber-toothed  tigers,'' not ``house cats,'' in their work.   Likewise, investors must take their responsibility to hold boards  accountable for their irreplaceable role in maximizing returns for  shareholders, while executing a corporate strategy that balances  shareholder returns with employees and customers.   So the question is: How can investors effectively lower agency costs  and actively meet this accountability mission?   For 20 years, this has been a much-discussed area by thoughtful  experts like Warren Buffett, ISS founder Robert Monks, Marty Lipton,  and Lawrence Cunningham. Grad schools at UCLA, Stanford, Harvard, Yale  all researched this challenge. Organizations of institutional investors  and corporate directors all proffer best practices.   And how do we best align these interests for this mission, but make  conflicts of interest readily apparent?   The role of proxy advisory firms in the U.S. economy has grown over  the last 2 decades and is a major shaper of corporate governance, and  it is of national importance. These firms counsel our pension plans,  our mutual funds, other institutional investors, which are more and  more in the market; 75 percent of the market, compared to when Robert  Monks started thinking about the idea in the late 1980s.   Under the current system, two proxy advisory firms now have 97  percent of the market, Mr. Speaker, and this monopolization and the  lack of transparency regarding their work means that the writings,  analyses, reports, and vote recommendations of just these two firms  have a disproportionate effect on the fundamental corporate  transactions, like mergers and acquisitions, the approval of corporate  directors, and other shareholder proposals.   Also, this has created more of a checklist mentality in the  boardroom. Directors today need information, yes, but, more  importantly, they need wisdom. And the proxy advisory firms are driving  people in boardrooms, in my view, to more of a checklist mentality,  regulatory mentality, and less using their business judgment and wisdom  to guide our public companies.   Proxy advisory firms aren't immune to conflicts of interest.    Mr. Speaker, these conflicts are provided by providing  additional recommendations to the very firms that they are rating.   So, Mr. Speaker, we need balance in this arena, and I think Mr.  Duffy's bill provides a step toward that balance, an improvement in  transparency in the proxy system, thereby enhancing shareholder access  to important investment information. I appreciate his work on it. I  thank him for his work in our committee.
