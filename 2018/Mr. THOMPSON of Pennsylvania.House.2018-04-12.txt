 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Holocaust  Remembrance Day to honor the memory of those who were murdered during  the Holocaust.   The Holocaust was the systematic, government-sponsored persecution  and murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators.   We honor the resilience of survivors, and we rededicate ourselves to  uphold the promise of ``Never Again.''   This week marks the Days of Remembrance for the Holocaust. Congress  established the Days of Remembrance as the Nation's annual  commemoration. Each year, State and local governments, military bases,  workplaces, schools, religious organizations, and civic centers host  observances and remembrance activities for their communities.   These events occur during the Week of Remembrance, which began  Sunday, April 8, and runs through Sunday, April 15.   The events and results of the Holocaust were so devastating and so  extreme that we can barely imagine how such a horrendous event can even  take place.   But we remember because it is an unthinkable scar on humanity. We not  only remember, but, more importantly, we say: Never again.   Today, we mourn the lives of those we lost, and we celebrate those  who saved them, and we honor those who survived.   The Holocaust was a tremendous blight on the history of humanity, but  also a time when we honor those who were brave enough to put an end to  it; those who stood in the face of such evil and refused to turn a  blind eye.   Our American soldiers were fighting to win World War II and liberated  concentration camps and the horror that ensued there. It was an  incredible task carried out by members of the Greatest Generation.   By looking back, we can understand how important it is to defend  those who are defenseless. We recognize the sufferings that took place  and the lives that were shattered, but also the efforts that were made  to put an end to such destruction and suffering.   We have seen such hatred and genocide occur again in places like  Bosnia, Rwanda, Darfur, and Syria. There are still millions of people  being persecuted because of their ethnicity, because of who they are.   We must eradicate hatred and never become indifferent to the  sufferings of others. On the Day of Remembrance, the most important  thing to remember is the humanity that exists in all of us. May we  always remember and always pledge: Never again.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Saturday marks the 70th  anniversary of the Air Force Reserve.   Since President Harry S. Truman called for the formation of the Air  Force Reserve in 1948, it has been a critical part of our Nation's  defense. Its mission is to provide combat-ready forces to fly, fight,  and win.   Operating in various locations around the world, the Air Force  Reserve has evolved from a ``stand by'' force for emergencies into a  major command of the Active Duty Air Force.   The Air Force Reserve currently performs about 20 percent of the work  of the Air Force, including traditional  [[Page H3195]]  flying missions and other more specialized missions, such as weather  reconnaissance, modular aerial firefighting, and personnel recovery.   The Air Force Reserve is part of every Air Force core mission  function and performs the same missions as the Active Duty partners. On  Saturday, we will remember where the Air Force Reserve has been, where  it is now, and where it is going.   Great men and women have sacrificed to give all Americans a better  tomorrow. On Saturday, we honor their legacy. Happy birthday to the Air  Force Reserve.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the  opportunity to be here tonight to join with my colleagues for this  Special Order.   Over the past 3 years, the House Agriculture Committee has been  diligently working on the next farm bill, which sets agriculture and  food policy for our Nation every 5 years.   As chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, I am  pleased that we can discuss this important topic tonight, nutrition,  and I want to thank Chairman Conaway for his great leadership and  commitment putting forward the best farm bill possible.   Tonight, we are here to talk about the nutrition title, specifically  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which we used  to call food stamps. SNAP accounts for 80 percent of spending in the  farm bill, and it is an important safety net for low-income families to  help ensure that no one in America goes hungry when times get tough.  Far too many Americans are living in poverty, and many have been for a  generation.   There is no worse feeling for a parent than to see their child go  without something as basic as food, yet food insecurity exists for so  many. That is why, since 2015, the Nutrition Subcommittee has hosted 21  hearings on SNAP. It has heard from more than 80 witnesses on how we  can improve the program and work to end hunger in America.   In fiscal year 2017, SNAP provided 42.2 million Americans with food  benefits at a cost of $63.7 billion. That is nearly 21 million  households, Mr. Speaker.   In my district, Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, nearly  35,000 households received SNAP benefits for fiscal year 2015. Thirty  percent of those homes have one or more people over the age of 60, and  nearly half, 45.9 percent, of those homes have children who are under  the age of 18.   What this farm bill does is ensure that SNAP benefits continue to be  available for those who truly need the help, especially children,  seniors age 60 and older, and the disabled, who represent nearly two- thirds of the program's participants.   Unfortunately, though, many Americans may not have the skills  necessary to find a family-sustaining job or may have encountered  roadblocks while trying to get ahead. This new farm bill makes a  historic investment in work programs so SNAP recipients have a  [[Page H3197]]  chance to learn new skills and climb the rungs on the ladder of  opportunity.   Now, this investment will equip States with resources to arm  participants with the soft skills--job search skills, certifications,  and education--needed to succeed in today's economy, truly, on-ramps to  opportunity.   Now we have a unique opportunity to expand funding and resources for  these life-changing programs by closing loopholes and improving  opportunities for individuals who have been marginalized by a lack of  employment, education, or, quite frankly, life circumstances. By doing  this, SNAP can provide immediate food assistance in the short term,  while also helping those in need learn skills to help them permanently  escape poverty.   Now, let me be clear. We are not removing anyone from receiving the  SNAP benefits. What we are doing is providing the tools necessary to  help individuals escape the cycle of poverty. I believe that there are  many pathways to success in life, and sometimes we do need that  critical safety net to take care of our families and help us get back  on our feet.    With a rebounding economy and an increased focus on workforce  development, I know we are going to be able to open new economic doors  for many, because all Americans deserve no less.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Conaway), the chairman of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his leadership and for leading what has been one of the most  transparent processes. The amount of hearings that we have had, over 20  hearings just on nutrition, 80 witnesses--a job well done.   You know, there is a saying that we have always heard. What is it?  The doctor knows best. I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall), another member of the Agriculture Committee, a  physician, who really understands health and healthy nutrition.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  being part of this Special Order.   All of the hearings that we had were bipartisan, great bipartisan  input into the hearings, and there is nothing in the nutrition title  that really hasn't come out as a part of those hearings.   In fact, I know my colleagues, my friends across the aisle, our  Democratic members of the committee I have been so honored to work with  and be a part of these hearings, they submitted specific priorities for  the nutrition title under title IV, and I am proud to say that all  those priorities are included within this farm bill.   I now yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), a friend  of mine, who is also part of our leadership with the Agriculture  Committee, a subcommittee chairman, from the First District of  Arkansas.  [[Page H3198]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  being a part of this important Special Order tonight, because nutrition  matters and farmers feed.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to a gentleman from another part  of our Agriculture Committee leadership from the State of Illinois. He  is the chairman of the Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research  Subcommittee.   He actually did a great job yesterday convening a briefing where he  brought in 4-H leaders from all over the country to share their  experiences as a part of that great organization.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney  Davis) from the 13th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his leadership and for joining us here this evening.   One of the things I really love about the Agriculture Committee is,  quite frankly, what we do. Everyone eats, nutrition matters, and our  Agriculture Committee is represented by Members from all over the  country, including Tennessee.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. DesJarlais), another member of the Agriculture Committee from  Tennessee's Fourth Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  being a part of the Agriculture Committee and thank him for his great  work on behalf of the folks in Tennessee.   As the gentleman from Tennessee was saying, what we are talking about  is, part of the nutrition title is really looking at making  improvements to it. We are not really doing anything to people. We want  to do things for people. And, quite frankly, for 65 percent of the  folks who find themselves in a situation where they are on the SNAP  program, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, I don't want to  say nothing is going to change, but it is just going to get better. We  are going to get them greater access to healthy foods.   Those are the 65 percent of the folks who are under the age of 18 or  over the age of 65, or living with a disability. And so for the 35  percent that find themselves on this program--usually for temporary  times--it is because of financial situations. And that is their number  one need. They are unemployed, underemployed. Maybe they have been  living in poverty for generations.   And, yes, we want to provide that safety net for food, but we want to  provide them actually an onramp to opportunity as the gentleman talked  about.   We don't force anybody to do anything. If you are able-bodied and you  fall within that category, that age of 18 to 59--and I guess if you  don't want to take access, take the opportunity for that job training,  then you can self-select out of the SNAP program. But why would you  want to do that?   What we are investing in, education and training, we are actually  guaranteeing a training slot in every State. We are providing the  support to the States to be able to do that, to provide--most  importantly, I think--case management.   Because case management--the gentleman is a physician as well. I am a  rehab therapist and a former manager in rural hospitals, and case  management plays an important role helping lead people through the  process when they have a time of need. And that is what this bill does.   So from Tennessee to New York, I am really pleased to yield to  another member of the Agriculture Committee, representing New York's  19th Congressional District.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso). I  thank the gentleman for being a part of the discussion tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his comments.   Mr. Speaker, the timing is good for our approach here, isn't it? We  have an economy where, for the first time maybe in 10, 15 years, we see  wages rising and we see job creation. Even before this most recent  economic surge, I guess for lack of a better word to call it, there are  an estimated 5 million jobs that are open and available in the United  States. These are jobs that most of them do not require a 4-year degree  or a 6-year degree. These are jobs that require some skills-based  education, maybe a certification, a specialization. It is kind of  perfect with what we are looking at.   There is some confusion that is out there. Some people are saying  this is creating a brand new level of bureaucracy. I know for a fact  that the people I serve with here wouldn't go for anything that is  creating more bureaucracy. The fact is we are actually taking advantage  of, first of all, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, WIOA.  That is our Career Links. That is where people go today, where if they  are unemployed or underemployed, to be able to get a job. That is where  employers look to find qualified and trained employees. So we are going  to be able to utilize that existing infrastructure.   But community colleges, apprenticeships, and private companies that  want to engage in training, there are a lot of opportunities out there  for this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler), who is another absolute friend and leader of agriculture.  She is a former teacher and leads our chair's Values Action Team which  I am proud to be a part of. Representative Vicky Hartzler represents  the Fourth Congressional District of Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for her enthusiasm for this.   Congratulations to Joe. Actually, that is a great story.    Mr. Speaker, for someone who was  incarcerated, that is difficult to overcome; but through the programs,  it gave a great example of how that occurs.   Contrast that also with what Mr. Faso from New York was saying about  those cliffs, what I refer to as poverty cliffs. We try to incentivize  folks to do better for themselves. We are making improvements because  right now the way the program is, like most of our programs, if you  make a dollar more than the limit, an arbitrary limit, the government  pulls the rug out from beneath you.   The fact that we are going after some of those, how much assets you  can have and the value of your car--the folks who are most at risk need  reliable transportation. I am just really proud that we are addressing  all that, and I thank the gentlewoman for being a part of all of this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Rouzer), who is a great member of the Agriculture Committee from North  Carolina's Seventh Congressional District. Congressman Dave Rouzer is a  man I am proud to serve with.    Mr. Speaker, I think we are going to  see many coming out in favor of this proposed farm bill and  specifically the nutrition title.   Two articles came out today. The first one is from USA Today  entitled, ``Food-Stamp Work Requirements Will Lift Americans Out of  Poverty,'' by our own agriculture chairman, Mike Conaway. He was joined  by Lee Bowes who is the CEO of America Works of New York which is a  training placement company. Also, there is an article that was  published in The Wall Street Journal entitled: ``Working on Food  Stamps: A House GOP reform would help the able-bodied get off the  dole.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these two articles.  [[Page H3202]]                                   [Apr. 12, 2018]      Food-Stamp Work Requirements Will Lift Americans Out of Poverty                      (By Mike Conaway and Lee Bowes)         There is a fundamental link between poverty and work.        Individuals who hold full-time employment (https:// www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/ demo/P60-259.pdf) are 10 times less likely to be poor than       people who are out of work during at least part of the year.        But not every American has the skills and training needed       to hold full-time employment.        Teaching these skills takes time and resources, which is       why for so long our nation has taken a piecemeal approach to       supporting work and training to help move people out of       poverty. Instead, we've focused the conversation on poverty       around benefits--on the dollars spent and the meals served.        Benefits are critically important and serve a vital role in       the safety net aimed at catching people if they should fall       into poverty. But equally important is a focus on helping       these same people climb back out of poverty.        That point is underscored by a 2016 poll from the American       Enterprise Institute and the Los Angeles Times. Forty-one       percent of the poor people included in the survey viewed       their circumstances as temporary (http://www.aei.org/ publication/2016-poverty-survey/).        People want to believe the American dream is attainable.        That's why we need to shift the conversation on poverty in       this country from one focused purely on benefits to one about       improving futures.        And as the House Agriculture Committee releases its new       farm bill (https://agriculture.house.gov/news/ documentquery.aspx?IssueID=14904)--legislation that governs       the policy for our nation's nutrition programs--that is       precisely what we aim to do.        Our proposal is straightforward: help those on the       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) who are       work-capable find employment to support their households.        Under this proposal, work-capable SNAP recipients will need       to work for at least 20 hours per week. That can take a       variety of forms they can work, participate in a work       program, or participate in a SNAP employment and training       (E&T) program. This bill makes a significant investment in       training and case management to guarantee access to an E&T       slot to anyone who wants one.        But to ensure this investment yields results, we're also       making these work requirements mandatory. No more loopholes       that create disincentives to work.        We are equipping states with resources to arm participants       with the skills, certifications and education needed to       succeed in today's economy.        And that's a critical point, because our economy is       supporting more jobs and a higher standard of living for ALL       Americans. Jobs that were once unavailable are now at an       individuals' fingertips if aided with the proper training and       skill set.        SNAP recipients want to be beneficiaries of this economic       growth. They want to take advantage of opportunities and meet       the needs of our nation's businesses.        It is also important to note that for nearly two-thirds of       SNAP recipients (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/able- bodied-adults-without-dependents-abawds-rules) who are       currently exempt from work-related programs, nothing will       change. That group includes seniors, those who are mentally       or physically disabled, children and various other       individuals who would not be subject to our proposed       modifications to work.        But for work-capable adults, if they want to receive       benefits, they'll be expected to work. And if they don't       work, they are self-selecting to remove themselves from the       program.        People will try to demonize what we are doing here and say       that this proposal is too much, too fast, too soon.        They will try to claim that this bill is about kicking       people out of the program to save money. But that couldn't be       further from the truth.        Under this work proposal, only an individual who chooses       not to participate in a guaranteed E&T slot will lose       eligibility for SNAP.        Others will claim that these modifications aren't needed       because most SNAP recipients who can work, do work (https:// www.cbpp.org/snap-households-with-working-age-non-disabled- adults-have-high-work-rates-6). And under our bill those       individuals can have the peace of mind that their benefits       will not be compromised.        While critics will say SNAP isn't meant to be a jobs       program, we believe these modifications can support nutrition       for families in need while also creating new opportunities       that emphasize work and independence and provide the       resources needed to move people forward.        Advocating for the status quo has never and will never lift       someone out of poverty.        That's why we need to begin to define success differently--      not by how many people we serve, but rather how many people       we aid in climbing the economic ladder.                                   ____                               [Apr. 11, 2018]                           Working on Food Stamps                          (By The Editorial Board)         A common refrain from businesses is that they can't find       enough workers. The unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, but one       reason for the shortage are government benefits that corrode       a culture of work. So credit to House Republicans for trying       to fix disincentives in food stamps amid what are sure to be       nasty and dishonest attacks.        House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway on Thursday will       introduce a farm bill, though food stamps absorb much of the       cost. More than 40 million Americans are in the Supplemental       Nutrition Assistance Program, the official name for food       stamps, and the figure is up from about 17 million in 2000.       The size of the benefits has also increased, and the program       cost has exploded to about $70 billion a year.        More Americans need assistance during recessions like 2008,       but the question is why so many have stayed on food stamps       even amid the long expansion. The American Enterprise       Institute's Robert Doar in 2014 compared the post-2008       recovery to the recession in the early 1980s. If folks had       left the program at similar rates to the 1980s, food stamps       would have had 36 million beneficiaries by 2013. Instead       there were 47.6 million.        One result is that many Americans haven't returned to the       labor force. Enter the House's first proposal: A 20 hours a       week work requirement for able-bodied adults, ages 18 through       59. This usually elicits panic about child labor or single       moms, but the requirement does not apply to seniors,       children, the disabled, or anyone who cares for a child under       six or is pregnant. That exemption covers roughly two-thirds       of everyone on food stamps.        The folks subject to the work rule have many ways to       satisfy the requirement, including apprenticeships that could       contribute to higher earnings later. States will have to       offer access to training programs, which can also count as       work. The bill stipulates case management and other       techniques to help people transition off assistance.        Food stamps already has a de minimis work rule for some       participants, but states have applied for waivers and       exemptions that have diluted it. Yet the results of real       welfare work requirements in states have been encouraging,       including former Governor Sam Brownback's reform in Kansas. A       Foundation for Government Accountability paper last year       noted that Kansas tracked 6,000 families who moved off       welfare and went to work in 600 different industries. Incomes       on average more than doubled over a year.        The House proposal includes other good ideas, notably       eliminating ``broad-based categorical eligibility.'' This is       a notorious loophole that declares someone eligible for food       stamps because he received a brochure on heating assistance       or a number for a hot line. The bill retains cross-      eligibility that allow the truly needy to qualify for       multiple programs without redundant asset tests.        The politics of all this are tough. The House Freedom       Caucus will pan such changes as ``welfare reform lite.'' The       Senate won't want to take hard votes in an election year. Yet       this isn't a budget slasher and merely reorients money and       incentives. That will make it harder for Senators to pretend       this ``guts'' the program, as some falsely said about       Medicaid last year.        Democrats have attacked the plan with packaged lines that       the GOP will kick millions off the rolls. The work rule       doesn't bounce a single person. One irony is that the left       says work requirements are misguided because most recipients       already work. Then why fight a requirement?        Those who stop receiving benefits because of a work       requirement will fall into two categories: They refused to       work or train for work. Or they found a job and no longer       need assistance, which is supposed to be a success story. The       GOP's work requirements--explained accurately--poll well with       the public because Americans think working is a fair trade       for helping those who have fallen on tough times.        The program is supposed to be ``supplemental,'' but       progressives have transformed it into a permanent       entitlement. The GOP's 1996 welfare reform was an historic       success, and fixing food stamps is a chance to do it again.     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), who is another great leader within the  Agriculture Committee.   The Congressman is a man I have been really pleased to serve with. He  has been a Bible study buddy of mine. He represents Georgia's Eighth  Congressional District and actually chairs the Subcommittee on  Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit.    I thank the gentleman for his  leadership and for being a part of the Special Order.   I am now pleased to yield to a former chairman of the full  Agriculture Committee and currently the Judiciary Committee chairman,  who obviously has a lot of experience in this area and with  agriculture. And so it is my pleasure and privilege to yield to the  gentleman from Virginia's Sixth Congressional District (Mr. Goodlatte).    Chairman Goodlatte, thank you for your  leadership and your mentoring. Greatly appreciated.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains.    Excellent. I will take advantage of  that opportunity. If we have some other Members who come in, I will  yield to them.    The nutrition title for me, personally, is important. When I was just  starting out in life, I had graduated from Penn State, I was working  with people facing life-changing disease and disability, and married.  We were pregnant with our first son, Parker, and so it was during that  first pregnancy. And I was making, I think, maybe a whopping $8,000 a  year working full time.   There wasn't a time when we visited my parents or Penny's parents, my  wife's parents, where we didn't come back with a bag of groceries.  People do that. Families step in and they help. We did what we could,  but we always came home with a bag of groceries.   We also found ourselves WIC eligible. The Women, Infants, and  Children program is not under the farm bill. That is on the Committee  on Education and the Workforce side.   But we know what it was like. It was difficult, actually. It was  embarrassing to be able to use that voucher, but it was important that  Penny and our unborn son at that point, now a 30-some-year-old dad with  two boys of his own, got the nutrition that they needed. So I have been  there, I have experienced that, and I know how important nutrition is.   Nutrition title, for me, I kind of relate it to, Mr. Speaker, what I  would say is the worst part about living and growing up in a rural  area, outside a small town, that everybody knew your business. I would  be out playing with my brother and my sister, and if I did something  wrong, when I got home, mom and dad already knew about it.   But the best part about living in that rural area, in rural America,  is that everybody knows your business. I have a cousin, and about a  month and a half ago their house burned to the ground. It was a  terrible fire. They were lucky to get out. They just barely got out of  the house. Yet, as the fire was just breaking through the roof of their  home and the volunteer fire department was on the scene, they were  surrounded by loved ones, friends, neighbors, and strangers who were  there to offer their assistance, whether it was their love, their  support, money, clothing, whatever, all kinds of things.   That is what the nutrition title is. Nutrition title is about helping  neighbors in need, whether those neighbors  [[Page H3204]]  live in the most densely populated city or whether they live back on  long country lanes. So that is why I'm so proud of the bipartisan work  we have done up to this point, because there is nothing, again, in this  nutrition title in this farm bill that wasn't a part of all those, over  21, hearings that we had.   Some of the things that are in there, in fact, are some of the  priorities. I enjoy working across the aisle in a bipartisan way. I  dedicate myself to that. So I was pleased to see my Democratic  colleagues who communicated their four priorities into this bill to the  committee.   Their first one was to incentivize nutrition education and healthy  eating through a continuation of the Food Insecurity Nutrition  Incentive Program, what we call FINI. I am pleased to report that the  Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018--that is what we are calling the  farm bill--which includes the nutrition title, Title IV, maintains the  FINI Program and enhances it with a technical assistance center  allowing for best practices in operations and delivery to be housed and  used for current and future grantees.   Additionally, the bill provides $275 million for FINI over the life  of the farm bill, actually establishes a baseline funding of $65  million a year, allowing for expansion of opportunities to bring  together stakeholders from the distinct parts of the food system to  foster understanding of how they might improve nutrition and the health  status of participating households and the people who live in those  houses.   Their second priority, which I am pleased to report on, was--and I  appreciated them putting this forward; it was important--to maintain  our commitment to food banks with adequate funding for The Emergency  Food Assistance Program. You just heard the former Agriculture  Committee chairman, Mr. Goodlatte from Virginia, talk about TEFAP.   The farm bill increases TEFAP, funding for our food banks, by $45  million. We have been funding it at $15 million. It goes to $60 million  and directs $20 million of that in a very innovative way, that funding,  to establish a farm-to-food bank program in all States. It allows  States to access agriculture surplus products directly from the  farmers. The freshest of foods is the way I like to look at it. What a  great enhancement, Mr. Speaker.   The third priority I am pleased to report on that is a part of this  farm bill that they communicated was to promote the use of cutting-edge  technology to ensure that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, or SNAP, retailers and recipients have secure, reliable, and  efficient benefit processing. The farm bill introduces the concept of a  national gateway, which is a system modernization that gives the USDA  real-time oversight over the flow of transactions. It helps control  costs.   It allows USDA to develop more tools to ensure integrity, assist in  controlling access to individuals' payment information, and it sets the  stage for the USDA to handle future developments in payment technology.  With that increase in accountability, in those rare instances where  fraud and abuse may occur, it allows for identification of that. And we  incentivize States. States are now able, when they actually identify  fraud, to keep a greater amount of that money that is recovered,  although it has to be reinvested back into the nutrition title.   It is about to go for more program integrity, to make sure we are  doing a better job of serving the needs of our neighbors who find  themselves in those circumstances.   And finally, the last one was to continue to encourage States to  collaborate with business and education leaders to provide innovative  employment and training solution opportunities and programs. That is  what we have been talking about this evening, largely. It is about the  workforce solutions. This was put forward by my friends across the  aisle that I am proud to serve with, the Democratic members of the  Agriculture Committee. This was their goal.    We were able to do that. We have provided significant attention and  considerable investment to improve SNAP workforce and education  development services for recipients. I appreciate what they put forward  as a part of this process, and I appreciate the fact that we have  stepped up and we see this as a part of the text of this farm bill.   The updates to employment and training include best practices taken  from beneficiary, industry, and State feedback. It includes interim  education and training pilot reports. It partners with the workforce- to-innovation opportunity works that are already in place across our  communities and our counties all across this great country. And it  heightens emphasis on public-private partnerships and nutrition  education and also allows recipients to continue to receive a  supportive suite of services to address both food insecurity and upward  mobility.   That is what we are trying to achieve. We want to make families food  secure. We want to provide them access to the rungs on the ladder of  opportunity.                                time  1900    Mr. Speaker, we have also done something for populations very near  and dear to my heart as the dad of an Active Duty soldier, and that is,  when individuals join the military later in life, they tend to enter  with a spouse and a couple of kids, and it is hard to support a family  on a private salary. Most privates are usually 18, 19 years old. They  don't have that family support, and they do fine.   In fact, we just provided all of our military a 2.9 percent pay  increase, the largest in over a decade. But for those who are joining  later in life, it is difficult. Their families live off base and they  get a basic housing allowance to help pay for that, but in the past,  basic housing allowance, 100 percent, with no contribution, no  assistance, counted towards their eligibility for the SNAP program.  They need that SNAP program to be able to make sure that their family  gets support.   We have addressed that by providing moneys that would go toward an  allowance, more or less, that would go towards to help them to truly to  be able to receive those benefits and to be eligible for the SNAP  program.   And so I am just so thankful for, really, the good bipartisan work  that we have done up to this point, with all these hearings--over 100  hearings on the farm bill, as a whole; over 20 hearings for the  nutrition title, title IV of this farm bill. We had over 80 witnesses.  There is nothing in this farm bill that didn't come out there. There  were some rumors of something about a Harvest Box, which was a terrible  idea. That is not a part of the farm bill, never had any intentions of  including that as a part of the farm bill.   I am appreciative to all the hard work that has gone into the bill,  preparing this at this point, and I look forward to next week, next  Wednesday. We will be marking this bill up in the Agriculture  Committee. And I am pleased at the timing too. Normally, when we talk  about reauthorizing the farm bill, we are 6 months, 12 months after it  expired.   Quite frankly, we can't afford to do that. The farm income has been  down for 4 years now, and this total farm bill is so important to  providing for a robust rural America, and that is important to every  American. Because without a robust rural America, people everywhere,  including the cities, will wake up in the dark, in the cold, and  hungry, because that is what the people of rural America, those farm  families, provide for each and every one of us.   So, Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the opportunity to be joined by  so many colleagues tonight on this topic, and I thank you for your  attention.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
