 Mr. Chairman, let's be clear. We must have a global  approach to the climate crisis, but giving a pass to countries like  China and India subverts that process. Look at their record. Since  2001, there has been a 290 percent increase in emissions; India, 235.  We have got a negative 16. We are reducing that.   So because of their miserable record of curtailing greenhouse gases,  we still, in America, across the country, in rural areas, are going to  face droughts, wildfires, and sea level rise. Because of India and  China, experts are saying that Miami, Florida, and Baltimore are still  going to flood.   So let's be honest. The Paris accord is really nothing more about  political theater than actually addressing climate change.   Instead, we should have an agreement that is enforceable with legally  binding targets and specific financial support that provides for  liability or compensation for damages that could be caused and an  understanding that global communities are still fossil fuel driven.   America should not unilaterally transform our energy policies while  gambling that other nations will voluntarily--and I underscore that,  voluntarily--reduce their emissions. History and past agreements  indicate other nations are not following the lead of the United States.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' on H.R. 9.
