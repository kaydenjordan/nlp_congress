 Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga).   I rise today in support of my good friend from Missouri (Mrs.  Wagner's) legislation, H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act.   The American people have grown tired of unaccountable and unelected  Washington bureaucrats bringing forward burdensome regulations without  fully considering the effect on families in our districts.   This simple and straightforward legislation would enact a statutory  requirement for the SEC to outline enhanced economic analysis  requirements for any new regulations before they can be enacted. It  also requires a review of existing regulations to determine if they are  unduly burdensome or duplicative.   Accountability. The impact of burdensome regulations that lack a  thorough vetting by the SEC can have an  [[Page H435]]  untold effect across our entire economy.   Court cases, Government Accountability Office reports, and the SEC's  own Office of Inspector General have raised important questions and  recommended improvements to various components of the SEC's economic  analysis in its rulemaking.   This legislation would go further by prohibiting the SEC from issuing  a rule when it cannot make a reasoned determination that the benefits  of the intended regulation justify the cost of the regulation. Logic  and reason.    In closing, I support this good-government, commonsense legislation  introduced by Chair Wagner. The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act will  take an important step in preventing the SEC from implementing a  regulation before understanding its full impact on our economy and on  the families in our congressional districts and across the country.
