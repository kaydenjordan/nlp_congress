 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on a critical issue  for indigenous people of the United States, specifically Native  Hawaiians.   Yesterday, in this august body, I introduced H.R. 9614 to amend the  Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, legislation critical to the  preservation, protection, and restoration of the sovereign rights of  the Native Hawaiian people.   Madam Speaker, 129 years ago, on January 17, 1893, 13 White men with  the support of U.S. troops of the USS Boston illegally overthrew the  Kingdom of Hawaii. In the years that would follow, the kingdom's  beloved monarch, Queen Liliuokalani, was imprisoned; millions of acres  of sovereign royal lands were stolen; olelo Hawaii, the Hawaiian  language, was prohibited to be taught or spoken in public schools; the  United States illegally annexed Hawaii via a simple majority joint  resolution after failing to gain treaty ratification in the United  States Senate; and by 1920, Native Hawaiians--decimated by Western  diseases, the loss of their land, culture, and identity--were on the  brink of extinction.   Realizing the plight of his people, Hawaii's second Native Hawaiian  and territorial Delegate to the Congress, Prince Jonah Kuhio  Kalanianaole, 102 years ago, authored one of the most important pieces  of Federal legislation for Hawaiians, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act  of 1920.   The act would set aside 203,000 acres to restore land and dignity to  Native Hawaiians of 1/32 blood quantum, giving them leasing  opportunities for homesteading, farming, ranching, and mercantile  purposes.   However, Delegate Kuhio ran into fierce opposition and was forced to  compromise with Western powerful sugar and ranching business interests  by accepting a blood quantum requirement of 50 percent to qualify for a  lease. This requirement would serve as a poison pill in the Hawaiian  Homes Commission Act dividing Native Hawaiians--a divide that remains  to this day.   Inadequately funded and managed by the United States from 1921 to  1959, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act and its day-to-day management  was punted to the new State of Hawaii as a condition and requirement of  statehood in 1959.   Realizing that Native Hawaiians were being quickly displaced from  their land due to interracial marriages, the State of Hawaii and the  United States lowered the blood quantum requirement for qualified  beneficiary successors to 25 percent.   Madam Speaker, 100 years later, due to interracial marriages and  blended families, many descendants of beneficiaries do not meet the 25  percent requirement for successorship.   In addition, the failure of both the State of Hawaii and the United  States to meet its fiduciary, execution, management, and oversight  obligations to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act has resulted in less  than 10,000 Native Hawaiians being awarded a lease while an applicant  wait list of almost 29,000 exists to this day.   As the applicant wait list grows, the median average age of an  applicant grows, creating a sense of urgency as thousands have died on  the wait list, and thousands more will die on the wait list, never  fulfilling the true vision of Prince Kuhio to Aina  [[Page H9916]]  Ho'opulalula, or return Native Hawaiians to their land.   This bill, H.R. 9614, will reduce the blood quantum requirement to  Delegate Kuhio's original intent of 1/32 for the successors of those  who have, while also addressing the inequity of those who don't have by  lowering the 50 percent blood quantum requirement forsuccessorship to  \1/32\ for the thousands of applicants and their successors on the DHHL  applicant wait list.   With the 117th Congress coming to an end in just 13 days, it is my  sincere hope that the 118th Congress will address this important issue  and that an emerging new generation of Native Hawaiian political  leaders in Hawaii will elevate this and the myriad of other issues that  continue to suppress and harm the Native Hawaiian community.   Madam Speaker, I am confident that if we do that, we can effectuate  sustainable and positive change across Hawaii and our Nation where all  of our people thrive, not just a privileged few.                            ____________________
