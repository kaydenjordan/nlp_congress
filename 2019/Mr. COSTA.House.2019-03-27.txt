 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the Sikh community in  celebrating Vaisakhi.   On April 14, Sikhs around the world, including thousands and  thousands in California's San Joaquin Valley, will celebrate the  Vaisakhi festival. This week, we welcome members of the Congressional  Sikh Caucus to the Hill to participate in those celebrations.   The festival marks the new year and the beginning of the spring  season for the global Sikh community.   The date of the Vaisakhi festival has tremendous significance in  Sikhism. The festival commemorates the year 1699, when Sikhism emerged  as a collective faith in what is now modern-day India.   It also celebrates both the birthday of the 10th Sikh guru, Guru  Gobind Singh, and the foundation of the Khalsa Panth, the Sikh  brotherhood.   Sikhs across the globe celebrate this day with enthusiasm and joy. I  know they do in the rich San Joaquin Valley that is home to so many who  are farmers, businesspeople, and community leaders. I have the honor to  represent them and to celebrate with them.   This festival models what all cultures strive for: strong communities  coming together to celebrate progress, renew its dedication to helping  one another, and peace.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in celebrating  this special tradition in the Sikh community.                              Women Trailblazers     Mr. Speaker, every March, we come together to honor  trailblazing women who have come before us, who have made a difference  throughout the history of our country and throughout the world, and  those who continue to pave the way for the next generation, those who  have broken the glass ceiling, and those who are role models.                                time  1030    The unsung heroines of these courageous pioneering women continue to  always make a difference.   The role model for me, and one who I must say made the incredible  difference, was our mother, Lena Cordoza Costa, a daughter of  immigrants, born before the Depression, raised during it, having to  quit school as a freshman in high school to help raise her seven  siblings because her father had been injured in an agricultural  accident.   She went on with our father to be--as Tom Brokaw noted--perhaps  America's greatest generation, striving with the values of hard work,  of teaching us to treat others as we would want to be treated  ourselves, and values of common sense.   As a young boy, learning that, Jim, you know, the truth is the truth,  and that you should always never forget those who are less fortunate.   After our father passed away, my mother in her mid-70s quietly  decided to go back to school and to get her GED. She didn't need to.  She was a successful business person; she was an artist, a voracious  reader, and a competitive bridge player.   And when she got her GED, she told my sister and me. We said, Mom,  why didn't you tell us?   She says, Well, I wasn't sure I would do well.   Our mother did--everything that she did, she did well, and continued  to serve as a role model.   Later on, the high school in which she had to quit as a freshman, at  a 100th anniversary of that high school, asked her to come--with  myself--and they presented her her high school diploma.   She was so proud of that high school diploma. And today, it sits on  my desk. And I show students that you can be whatever you want to be if  you have the proper role model and encouragement.   It is women who are guiding our Nation towards a more equal future-- like our mother--who make a difference.   Today, I am proud to be a Member of the most diverse Congress in the  United States' history, with over 102 women in this body, women serving  the people's House.   We honor their sacrifice, their brilliance, and the strength of their  service for our Nation.                            ____________________
