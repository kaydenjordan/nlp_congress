 Madam Chair, I thank the Speaker for yielding, and I  thank her for her words. I want to join the Speaker in thanking the  chief.   Three decades, 34 years--it is not a job; it is a way of life when  you become a police officer. Your job is a little different, and we see  it each and every day.   Think of the complexity of being a Capitol Police officer. It is not  just the safety of the women and men who serve in here; it is the  thousands of visitors who come every day. But it is also the  responsibility of keeping a government by the people, for the people,  and of the people open.   Every day we see it, and we all have felt it. It is not just  protecting us when it is inside this building. We saw it just a short  time ago on a baseball field. We are reminded of the number of Members'  lives your officers saved that day.   We are reminded of the number of times, just in a building that the  majority leader room has, of the officers giving the ultimate sacrifice  inside these Hallowed Halls to save the others.   So we thank you for your work, but, more importantly, we thank you  for the force. We thank you for all the officers.   We know last week was National Police Week. They were here in the  Capitol and throughout Washington, D.C. We know every day that we hear  the other lives that were lost protecting us throughout the Nation.   We thank you for your service, and on behalf of a very grateful  Congress, thank you for your decades of service, and we wish you all  the best in retirement.
