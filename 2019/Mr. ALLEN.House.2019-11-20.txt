 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Bible Week  and thank Congressman Lamborn for the time tonight to recognize the  importance of honoring God's Word.   As was said, 7 or 8 years ago, FDR declared National Bible Week just  before the start of World War II. Just as it was then, the Bible is  God's gift to us, standing the test of time, and serving as our guide  during times of both joy and hardship. It is the way that God speaks to  us.   I was born in rural America in Georgia and as most youngsters, I was  baptized at an early age because I believed in John 3:16:         That God who gave us his Son, His begotten Son, that who       shall ever believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal       life.    What an amazing gift.   And almost 20 years ago--and of course, there are many highs and lows  during my time since then--but some 20 years ago, in one of those times  of despair, I made a covenant with God. And that covenant was to put  Him first.   And that meant an intense study of His Word. And He actually showed  me how to change my priorities and put Him first because I had this  thirst for His Word as soon as I got up in the morning. In fact, I  would wake up and I would be quoting His Word because of something I  thought of during the night.   I learned that my strength and abilities did not come from myself,  but through Him, and Him alone.                                time  1830    In this great country, we pride ourselves on freedom, and that  freedom is knowing that God is our strength and His grace has no  limits.   I often pray that thy kingdom come on Earth as it is in Heaven, and  the Bible reveals to us that we already have a glimpse of what that is  like.   Genesis 1:26 through 28 shows us that, from creation, we were all  made in God's image and likeness. Now, wouldn't the world be a much  better place if we treated each other, our relationships, as if we were  with God himself in those relationships.   Our country's very foundation comes from Judeo-Christian values, and  these principles are woven throughout our founding documents.   The Bible says we were created for God's purpose and God's image and  in His likeness.   If we study His Word and put it into action to value all people, even  those we disagree with, I am certain that the division and hurt in this  country would heal.   We are a divided nation, and we have a divided government. You know,  Jesus prayed for us in John 17:21 that we would be one, just as He and  the Father are one.   The enemy divides; God unites. And if we trust God, as His word  says--and just above me, above the flag, says, if we put our trust in  God, it would unite all of us here around those important issues that  our Founders and the American people care about.   I believe that if we actually, in this Chamber, debated what the  Scriptures say about the very issues that divide us--and they are very  divisive issues that we deal with on this floor every day--if we took  the Scriptures and debated what the Scriptures say about those issues,  that we would all come to agreement that God is correct and that his  way is the only way.   In fact, his instruction in Joshua 1:8 was: ``Do not let this book of  law depart from your lips. Be careful to do what it says; meditate on  it night and day, and we will be prosperous and successful.''   America stands as a beacon of hope for the rest of the world and can  truly be a shining city upon a hill that God described if we treat each  other with the dignity and respect that God shows us how to do through  His Word.   I pray that God gives me the strength and humility to serve Georgia's  12th District so that more people come to know and love Christ, the  truth, so that the truth will set us free.   God bless America. God bless His great Word.
