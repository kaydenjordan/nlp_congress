 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the recent attacks  on African-American culture in Florida.   Recently, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis blocked a new advanced  placement course on African-American studies.   The course was inclusive of study of African-American culture that  included literature, the arts, politics, science, and even geography.  In addition, it included discussions about the Black struggle in modern  America.   Govern DeSantis said that the class lacks educational value because  it includes other subjects and the theory of slave reparations.   Clearly, Governor DeSantis believes education should reject any  content that allows students to think for themselves, and he wants  Americans to think that nothing bad ever happened in American history.   That does not sound like education to me. It sounds like  indoctrination, and it should not be welcome anywhere in America.   Wokeness on the Republican side has become a new word, a code word.  Let's eradicate that position.                            ____________________
