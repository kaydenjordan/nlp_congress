 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this three-bill minibus,  which delivers important victories for the American people.   The fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development, Military  Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch bill is a  bipartisan rejection of President Trump's extreme budget cuts. It  restores $8.1 billion in funding for programs that create jobs and  strengthen our economy.   Instead of cutting energy efficiency and renewable energy programs  within the Department of Energy, as House Republicans proposed, we have  increased its funding. That means more resources to develop clean  energy technology and accelerate job creation in this growing sector of  the economy.   And this bill gives an emphatic thumbs-down to President Trump's  proposed elimination of the highly successful ARPA-E program, which  promotes and funds research and development of advanced energy  technology.   Turning to the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs division, I am  pleased that the bill provides a second installment of $2 billion for  VA infrastructure improvements. And, as more veterans suffer from our  country's devastating opioid epidemic, we are doing right by our  veterans by providing $400 million for opioid treatment, prevention,  and safety initiatives.   We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those who have sacrificed  for us in our Armed Forces, and we must ensure they receive the  benefits and assistance they deserve. Unfortunately, when it comes to  the VA MISSION Act, the White House and House Republicans refuse to  live up to that sacred trust.   Despite the inclusion of nonbinding report language, the legislation  before us utterly fails to address the transition of the VA Choice  program from mandatory to discretionary spending.   It is deeply disappointing that we have been unable to address this  issue with a bipartisan, bicameral compromise. Instead, Congress has  left behind a shortfall that will lead to cuts to vital domestic  programs, including for our veterans.   It is now imperative for next year that we find a responsible, long- term solution to protect domestic priorities and veterans' healthcare.                                time  1500    Finally, I would be remiss if I did not celebrate one of the  successes in this bill that is closer to home. I am delighted that we  have secured $8.8 million in the new dedicated funding stream for  Members' offices to pay interns.   Congressional interns should be reflective of the country we serve.  This new funding will help a more diverse range of young people follow  their dreams and begin a career in public service.   I appreciate the hard work of my friend, Chairman Frelinghuysen, and  the subcommittee Chairmen Simpson, Carter, and Fortenberry, as well as  our Senate counterparts in crafting this compromise. I am grateful for  the leadership of Ranking Members Marcy Kaptur, Tim Ryan, and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz fighting on behalf of our priorities for the American  people. Of course, I thank the staff on both sides of the aisle who  work so very hard night and day to help us deliver this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this minibus, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), who is the ranking member of the  Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Ryan), who is the ranking member of the Legislative Branch  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gene Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank my friend, Chairman  Frelinghuysen.   It has been far too long since multiple spending bills were enacted  prior to the start of the fiscal year. It is a testament to the  chairman's leadership that we are set to clear three today, and I hope  we send at least one more package to the President before the end of  the month.   Additionally, I would like to thank the staff for their tireless  efforts, particularly Adam Berg, Jaime Shimek, Matt Washington, and the  majority staff, including clerks Jenny Panone, Sue Quantius, and Angie  Giancarlo-Clark.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.
