 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Roger Swor, a  paramedic from my district who has dedicated his life to providing  exceptional emergency medical care.   Roger is now the longest-serving street paramedic in Minnesota and  was recently honored by the National Registry of Emergency Medical  Technicians for achieving 40 years of National EMS Certification. This  is a distinction held by very few EMS professionals.   Roger has answered tens of thousands of 911 calls in his career. He  has done everything from holding dying crash victims in his arms to  delivering babies. As described by his nephew, Adam, who served many  shifts alongside his uncle, ``Roger is universally regarded as the  paramedic you want to see when you are in trouble.''   On behalf of Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District, I  congratulate Roger on his recent achievement and thank him for his  professional service.   Paramedic Roger Swor, you are the best of the best.                            ____________________
