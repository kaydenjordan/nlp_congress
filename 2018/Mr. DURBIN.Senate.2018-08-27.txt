 I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper),  the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), the Senator from Alabama (Mr.  Jones), the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  [[Page S5949]]  Leahy), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin), and the Senator  from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, yesterday, a fire ravaged several homes in  Little Village, Chicago. It was the deadliest fire the city has  experienced in a decade. Today, we mourn the tragic loss of eight lives  taken by this disaster.   In the early hours of the morning, the Chicago Fire Department  received a call that a fire had started on the porch of a home where  children had been having a sleepover. The fire eventually took the  lives of eight precious children, ranging in age from 3 months to 16  years old, and critically injured two others before spreading to  several other homes.   My deepest sympathies are with the loved ones of those who were taken  far too soon, and my prayers for recovery are with the two teenagers in  critical care. Please know I am grieving with the families of Little  Village as they work to remember those lost and rebuild their  community.   I want to thank the Chicago Fire Department and emergency workers for  their quick responses and dedication to saving lives and putting a stop  to the deadly fire, as well as workers from the Red Cross and local  organizations, who immediately came to the scene to provide support to  residents.   I know the people of Little Village will come together to support one  another, and they will be stronger for it.                            ____________________
