 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a recent  milestone in my home State of North Carolina. CNBC just recognized  North Carolina as America's Top State for Business in 2022.   Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and bipartisan infrastructure law,  North Carolina's economy persevered through the pandemic and is  continuing to grow rapidly.   Major companies like Toyota and Boom Supersonic Jets are building  innovative manufacturing operations in North Carolina's Sixth District,  proving that we have what businesses want.   With a well-equipped workforce, investments in infrastructure and  research, and stellar institutions of higher education, it is no  surprise that North Carolina is garnering national recognition for its  business-friendly climate and strong economy.   I thank Governor Cooper for his leadership. I will continue to work  with our elected officials and businesses to ensure that North Carolina  remains the strongest economic State in the country.                            ____________________
