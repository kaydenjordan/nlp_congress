 Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to  join us in supporting H.R. 49 to finally designate the Pulse nightclub  as a national memorial in honor and remembrance of the 49 people who  lost their lives on this tragic night 5 years ago.   ``Orlando Strong'' is more than just a slogan. It is a promise to  support each other and to never forget those we lost and those who were  injured on that tragic night. By establishing Pulse as a national  memorial, we will honor their memories and remind ourselves of that  promise.   My bishop once called the Pulse nightclub a place for late-night  fellowship, a place for fun, laughter, family, and friendship. These  are such fundamental things. We know this now more than ever. After the  pandemic, we see just how precious these things truly are.   Madam Speaker, I thank the House for moving forward with this  legislation. I thank my constituents. I thank the cosponsors,  Congresswoman Murphy and Congressman Soto, for their work to make this  day a reality.  [[Page H2220]]    As we pass this legislation, I know that the memories of those who  died will live on in our hearts. They will not be defined by their  tragic deaths through gun violence but by the lives they lived, the  people they touched, and the love they gave.   Paraphrasing Dr. King: So I decided as an individual to stick with  love because, yes, hate is too great of a burden to bear, and it has  been on me, my community, my city, and my Nation for too long.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining us in supporting  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, in 1962, President Kennedy proclaimed May  15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week of May 15 as  National Police Week. Established in 1962 by a joint resolution of this  body, National Police Week pays special recognition to law enforcement  officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty for the safety  and protection of others.   My home State of Florida, during 2020, lost 19 law enforcement  officers, and we gather today to honor their memory and to thank them  for their service. We thank all law enforcement officers across the  Nation who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, and we remember those who  are out there patrolling our communities to keep us all safe.   I want to thank my colleagues for joining us today to give honor to  whom honor is due. Mr. Speaker, many have given much, but these men and  women--our law enforcement officers--have given all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran),  who is a former law enforcement officer.    We are able to be here today, Mr. Speaker, to conduct  the people's business because of the good men and women who protect us  in the U.S. Capitol, the men and women who wear the uniform and the  badge every day.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson), a former law enforcement officer.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), who comes from a law  enforcement family.    Mr. Speaker, because they are willing to risk their  lives without hesitation, my colleagues and I honor them today.   To continue the tribute, it is now my honor to yield to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), who is also from a law  enforcement family.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), a former Federal law  enforcement officer.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin).    I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Swalwell), also from a law enforcement family.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Thank you so much for that tribute. I now yield to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the chair of the Law  Enforcement Caucus. We are so grateful for the work that he is doing.    Thank you again to the chair of the Law Enforcement  Caucus.   I now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez).    I thank the gentleman from Texas for that tribute to  our law enforcement officers. I now yield to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    We thank the gentleman from Minnesota for that tribute.  I now yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his tribute. I  yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments,  and we join him in grieving the death of the officer just yesterday.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Schrier).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his tribute.   Mr. Speaker, as someone who served 27 years in law enforcement, who  had the honor of serving as the chief of police, one thing I know for  sure is that the police are the community, and the community is the  police. The police and the community are one. We are one.   I do believe that when we come together, we can do anything, that we  can have some of the safest communities that America has to offer, that  we can truly be, in America, what we were created to be.   We honor the men and women who put on the badge and the uniform every  day, Mr. Speaker, and go to work not knowing whether they will ever  make it back to their homes, to their families, to their loved ones.   I am honored to stand once again--I have done it for a lot of years  now--to honor National Police Week and recognize the men and women who  have paid it all. Many have given much, but the men and women in law  enforcement who have laid down their lives to keep us safe have given  their all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
