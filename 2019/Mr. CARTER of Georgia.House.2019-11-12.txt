 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Habersham School for winning the State volleyball championship in  Georgia on October 19, 2019. I could not be more proud of their  excellent representation of the First Congressional District of  Georgia. Now a powerhouse team in the Georgia Association of Private  and Parochial Schools has won back-to-back titles.   In the championship match this year, a number of Habersham players  rose to the challenge on the State's largest stage: Krista Poppell had  33 assists and 10 digs; Jordan Christy chipped in 28 kills; Makenzie  Sparks had 5 kills; and Anna Thompson included 4 kills.   The team had an overall 32-6 record for the year.   Congratulations to every member of the volleyball team at Habersham  School.                            ____________________
