 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Buck) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution, which provides  for the consideration of two bills from the House Financial Services  Committee--H.R. 4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act, and H.R.  4296, legislation to undercut operational risk capital requirements-- under a completely closed process.   These are the 66th and 67th closed rules of this Congress, Mr.  Speaker. I am deeply concerned with the Republican leadership's total  lack of consideration for regular order.   For all intents and purposes, regular order is dead in this Congress.  We consider one closed rule after another after another after another,  and Republicans routinely rush bills to the floor without even holding  hearings on the underlying legislation to help Members better  understand the impacts of these bills and to benefit from expert  witnesses.   What is especially shameful about the process today, Mr. Speaker, is  the fact that there were amendments submitted, but Republicans decided  to self-execute these nongermane amendments with no debate or  discussion on the House floor and to shut down the ability of Members  to offer additional amendments. This is just bad legislating, plain and  simple.   I hope that if November turns out the way I hope it does and we have  a change in leadership in Congress, when Democrats are in charge, we  run this place like professionals, like adults, where we respect all  points of view, where we go back to regular order, when we say we are  going to go back to regular order, we mean it.   Why are we doing all of this, Mr. Speaker? What is possibly so urgent  that we have to throw regular order out the window?   Today, we are considering another two pieces of deregulatory  legislation that will benefit big banks at the expense of financial  stability to our economy and consumer protections that help everyday  families.   H.R. 4607 would create a lopsided approach to implementing  regulations that force agencies to consider the cost of regulations on  bankers without considering the benefit to consumers. H.R. 4296 would  undermine the ability of regulators to establish operational risk  capital requirements to protect our economy from another crisis.   Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable. Our constituents expect Congress  to put them first, not the big banks, especially the big banks that  wrecked our economy and endangered the life savings of millions of  families. We owe it to them to bring to the floor legislation that will  help their lives and make our country better. But, sadly, Mr. Speaker,  this Congress has failed to act on meaningful legislation that will do  anything like that.   Mr. Speaker, today marks nearly 2 weeks since 17 people, including 14  students, were gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in  Parkland, Florida. This was one of the worst shootings our country has  ever seen. It was the eighth school shooting this year, and it is only  February.   Yet Republicans in Congress have not lifted a finger to take up  bipartisan gun reform legislation that would help to prevent shootings  like these and protect our kids. Instead, we are here considering a  bill that will only help the already rich and powerful.   This is shameful. It is absolutely shameful, Mr. Speaker.   According to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that monitors gun  violence, since 2014, there have been over 1,360 mass shootings in  America. In 2018 alone, less than 2 months, there have been over 400  teens aged 12 through 17 and 90 children under the age of 11 killed or  injured by guns.   Yet the majority in this House even refuses to bring to the floor  legislation banning bump stocks, a reform agreed  [[Page H1282]]  upon by both sides of the aisle, I thought. The NRA has even said that  ``devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully  automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.'' I don't  know if they meant it, but they said it.   President Trump: ``I will be strongly pushing comprehensive  background checks with an emphasis on mental health. Raise age to 21  and end sale of bump stocks. Congress is in a mood to finally do  something on this issue--I hope.''   Now, it is true that we have a President who is so erratic that he  changes his mind from one hour to the next, but so far, I haven't seen  a retraction tweet. So I have every reason to believe he is still  standing by his commitment to supporting these modest gun safety  reforms.   Yet here we are, just days after this horrific mass shooting, and not  one single gun reform or gun safety bill is being voted on or even  scheduled for a vote. I am furious that, in the face of such tragedy  and such senseless violence, this Congress continues to do nothing--not  a thing--to protect our kids and our families and our communities.   Students from Amherst Regional Middle School in my district in  Massachusetts sent me a letter last week that every Republican in  Congress should read.   They write: ``Seventeen innocent people lost their lives. . . . That  scares us. It scares us that kids have to go to school wondering if  they are next. That we even have to think that the next time we see  some of our classmates or teachers may be in their open caskets. And  what scares us most of all, is that our government fails to do anything  to change this.''   They continue: ``They are gone because our country doesn't care  enough to have better gun control, and we will not stop fighting until  they get their justice. . . . We're writing this letter because we want  to personally ask each and every one of our politicians: How many more  killings must we bear before the laws are changed. . . . Our country is  no longer safe. Not in school, church, concerts, parties, or even  public meeting areas. Please choose to do something. All of our lives  depend on your actions.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter written by these  students.         Dear Congressman McGovern: Seventeen innocent people lost       their lives on February 14th, 2018. That scares us. It scares       us that kids have to go to school wondering if they are next.       That we even have to think that the next time we see some of       our classmates or teachers may be in their open caskets. And       what scares us most of all, is that our government fails to       do anything to change this. Please don't forget. About the       pain and suffering of all the families and the victims. About       the children fearing that their school is next. About all of       the lives that will never be lived. They are gone because our       country doesn't care enough to have better gun control, and       we will not stop fighting until they get their justice. And       that's why we wrote this letter. We're not writing it to get       some extra credit points or fame. We're writing this letter       because we want to personally ask each and every one of our       politicians; how many more killings must we bear before the       laws are changed and regulations are tightened. Before the       government cares for our safety. Before the lives that were       lost are never forgotten or regarded as yesterday's news. The       time to talk about gun-control is now. It is not next decade       or next year or even next week. It is now. Now is the time to       strengthen the process involved in conducting a complete       background check and lengthen the waiting period required in       order to receive a firearm. Please stand with us and all of       the of the students and children in our nation. Stand with       all of the families of the victims. Stand with the       tremendously brave people who lived through these terrifying       events. Stand with the heroes who saved countless lives, and       ended up losing their own. Our country is no longer safe. Not       in school, church, concerts, parties, or even public meeting       areas. Please choose to do something. All of our lives depend       on your actions and support.            Sincerely,                                    Students at Amherst Regional                                                      Middle School.                                time  1200     I cannot say it better than these students, Mr.  Speaker. These are young people writing to Congress begging us to do  something to end the violence. They are young people who want a better  future.   I would just ask my Republican friends: Are you so beholden to the  National Rifle Association that you could possibly turn your backs on  our country's young people? Can you really ignore these heartbreaking  pleas for action?   You know, a recent poll showed that 80 percent of Americans support  bans on assault-style weapons like the one used in the Florida school  shooting and 90 percent support tougher background checks. These are  commonsense reforms that have overwhelming support from the American  people. This should be a bipartisan issue that we could come together  on.   But I would say, even if you don't want to support what I think is  commonsense legislation and commonsense reform, understand that the  majority of the people in this country do support this and at least  bring these bills to the floor so that we could have a debate, and then  people can vote however they want to vote.   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and these terrible bills  that help big banks, put consumers in our country at risk, and do  absolutely nothing to address the real priorities that we should be  tackling. It is long past time for Congress to finally do something to  stop these horrific mass shootings that are taking the lives of our  kids and our families.   Mr. Speaker, we could just have easily spent this afternoon debating  and approving one, or more, of any of the gun safety and gun reform  measures that have bipartisan support. We could have shown high school  and elementary students, our children, Mr. Speaker, that we heard them,  that we care about them, and that we are starting to take action.   Instead, we are debating these worthless bills to help big banks and  continue to ignore our children's suffering. Shame on this Congress,  Mr. Speaker, shame on all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to my colleagues, I mean, let's be  honest, the two bills that we are debating today are ``nothing  burgers.'' I mean, you know, I just figured this out. In the Rules  Committee, we have spent 43--43 percent of the bills that have come  before the Rules Committee have been financial service-related bills,  mostly to undercut Dodd-Frank and to reward big banks and powerful  special interests.   But, you know, we could debate that, but no matter what you think  about some of this legislation, most of it, I think, has been either,  you know, destructive to our economy or it doesn't add up to very much  of anything. But no matter what you think about it--and we could say  that banking issues are important--they are not as important as  protecting our kids.   I mean, 43 percent of the bills that have come before the Rules  Committee have basically been attempts to reward big corporations and  big financial institutions in this country. We have spent zero time,  zero percent of our time, discussing legislation to ban bump stocks. We  have spent zero percent of our time in the Rules Committee considering  legislation to strengthen and expand universal background checks. We  have spent zero percent of the time debating a bill to ban assault  weapons. We have spent zero percent of our time discussing how we can  restrict high-capacity magazines.   I can go on and on and on. We spent zero percent of our time on the  issue of guns, notwithstanding that we are seeing massacres occur on a  regular basis in this country. There is something wrong here, and, I  mean, we have the time; and if this were a priority, we would be  talking about some of this commonsense gun legislation today rather  than, as I said, these ``nothing burgers'' that are now before us.   Mr. Speaker, less than 2 weeks ago, a gunman walked into a school in  Parkland, Florida, and gunned down 17 students and teachers.  Unfortunately, senseless acts of violence like that one are far too  common. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, every day, 96 Americans  are killed with guns; and every year, there are 13,000 gun homicides in  the United States.   With this most recent tragedy in Parkland, Americans have stood up  and said: Enough is enough. We have all been inspired by these eloquent  and passionate voices of these young students from Florida who have had  the guts to stand up and speak truth to power. But you know, Mr.  Speaker, according to a Quinnipiac poll from last week, over 90 percent  of Americans are in favor of universal background checks for gun  purchases; and according to a CNN poll from yesterday, over 70 percent  are in favor of stricter gun control laws generally.   The American people are clamoring for action on this issue, and we  have yet to do anything about it, not one thing. As I mentioned, all of  our time has been spent mostly on legislation to help the well-off and  the powerful in this country. We have not spent any time at all talking  about this issue of guns, which are killing our kids. But today, my  Republican colleagues have an opportunity to put the safety of our  children over the power of the gun lobby.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question, and  if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up three commonsense gun safety bills: H.R. 4240, the  Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act; H.R. 3464,  the Background Check Completion Act; and H.R. 2598, the Gun Violence  Restraining Order Act.   These bills would close the dangerous gun show and internet sale  background check loopholes, prevent the sale of guns without a  completed background check, and ensure that people who are a danger to  themselves or others can be prevented from purchasing or possessing a  gun.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat what I said at the outset. The rule we  are considering would make in order two Financial Services bills that I  think amount to ``nothing burgers,'' especially when compared to what  we should be doing in terms of protecting our communities and  protecting our kids from gun violence. That should take priority over  this.   We have young people from Florida here, going door to door, talking  to Members of Congress and Members of the Senate, begging us to do  something. And what are we going to consider is the Comprehensive  Regulatory Review Act, and then we are going to consider the  operational risk capital requirements for banking organizations.   I did a couple of townhall meetings over the weekend, and I can tell  my colleagues truthfully that nobody in the audience asked a question  about the operational risk capital requirements for banking  organizations. Nor did they bring up the need for us to rush ahead and  pass the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act, but they did ask what we  are doing to protect their kids and to protect our schools.   We are living in a time when parents have to wonder when they send  their kids to school in the morning whether they will come back alive.  We are living in a time when going to the movie theater is a risk, when  going to a concert is a risk, or when going to church is a risk. This  is unacceptable, and people have had it.   I would say to my colleagues who are beholden to the National Rifle  Association: I get it. If you don't want to stand up to them, that is  fine, but don't stand in the way of this House having a debate on these  issues and having a vote. Let the American people see where everybody  stands, Democrats and Republicans alike.   It is unbelievable to me, in the aftermath of this tragedy, that we  are here talking about the operational risk capital requirements for  banking organizations, when we should be talking about strengthening  our background checks and expanding our background checks; when we  should be talking about banning bump stocks; when we should be talking  about dealing with high-capacity magazines; and when we should be  talking about banning assault weapons.    People don't have to vote for those things if they don't want to, but  I think that is what the American people want. You see it in the  polling data. I am hearing it when I go home and I talk in townhalls.   People are just frustrated that we are doing nothing. We hold moments  of silence, and that is about it. I think some in the NRA are hoping  that this is kind of business as usual. That we will have this terrible  tragedy, then, as time goes on, people will focus less and less on it,  the media will focus less and less on it, and then we will just kind of  move on.   I remember, in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, there was  talk about banning bump stocks. The President said he thought that was  a good idea. Even the NRA did. Time went on, the focus went off of what  happened in  [[Page H1285]]  Las Vegas, and we did nothing. Maybe that is what some of my colleagues  are hoping for, is that time will pass and we will do nothing. But it  is such an abrogation of our duty and our responsibility, and I just  don't get it. I don't get it.   This is another closed rule that makes a mockery of regular order.  But what is even more disturbing to me is that we are prioritizing  banking issues over protecting our kids and our families, and I just  find that unconscionable.   I think the anger in this country is just growing more and more and  more. I have great hope that these young voices, not just those from  Parkland, Florida, but high school students all across this country,  who want a future where they don't have to worry about going to school,  their voices are getting louder and louder and louder, and they are not  going to cave and they are going to demand change. It is their future,  and they want us to give them a future where they feel safer and more  protected.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  that we can bring up some commonsense gun safety legislation. Again, if  you don't want to vote for it, you can vote ``no,'' but we have to have  the debate.   I think that is what is particularly insulting to so many people  across this country who are frustrated with this House when it comes to  gun safety legislation, is that we don't even have the guts to have a  debate. We don't even bring it up. It is not a priority. I think we  have an opportunity now, if we defeat the previous question, to make it  a priority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, a ``no''  vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
