 Mr. Speaker, I thank the dean of the California delegation  and a good friend of Ellen's for yielding.   Ellen was one of my closest friends in the Congress of the United  States. I think Ellen and I voted the same about almost every time the  lights were turned on and the votes were requested.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lofgren and the California delegation  for organizing this tribute.   I rise to join in remembering a dear, dear friend, an outstanding  colleague, and a respected public servant.   In recent days, I have been asked to describe Ellen. Words that come  to mind are extraordinarily accomplished, stateswoman, a diplomat, an  expert in our Nation's defense as a member of the Armed Services  Committee and as a member of the State Department, and a politician in  the best sense of the word. Her skill in rallying disparate interests  behind a common objective was, I think, almost unmatched.   Ms. Lofgren referred to her as presiding. She was a Democrat  presiding in a House in which all respected her, which is why she was  so effective. She would look to the Republican side of the aisle, and  she would tap the gavel. They would know she knew what was right, and  they did not want to cross her.    Her determination not to be swayed from the principles to which she  always remained true was a hallmark of Ellen Tauscher. Many in the  House and in our country will remember Ellen for having been one of the  first women, as has been pointed out, on the New York Stock Exchange at  the age of 25.   I can imagine there were a lot of old bulls on Wall Street who said,  what is that young woman, that young, blonde, beautiful woman doing  sitting on the Stock Exchange, a seat on the Stock Exchange?   And the answer to that question: Damn well--like everything she did.  [[Page H3783]]    Many will remember her for the 13 years she represented California in  the Congress and for her very successful tenure as a top arms control  negotiator with the Russians. But I will remember her as one of my  dearest and closest friends in the House.   I will never forget Ellen's kindness, sincerity, advice, counsel, and  loyalty. I will never forget her honesty and her intellect. Neither  will I forget Ellen's determination to see each of us here, regardless  of our party or background, as a true colleague in service.   That is how she was able to be so successful as a legislator.                                time  2045    As chairwoman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Armed  Services Committee, she was respected not only as a presiding officer  but also for the depth of her knowledge as it related to our national  security and for the fact that she was always genuine.   You knew that Ellen Tauscher was not taking a position for show. She  was taking it because she believed deeply that it was in the best  interest of our country.   Because of her work on the Armed Services Strategic Forces  Subcommittee and extraordinary efforts as a diplomat, Americans are  safer today.   Ellen worked tirelessly during the Obama administration to negotiate  the New START Treaty, which reduced American and Russian nuclear  arsenals to their lowest levels in more than half a century. In that  pursuit, she drew on the same indomitable nature, attention to detail,  and determination to achieve results that made her so successful in  business, in the Congress, and as a campaigner for Senator Feinstein.   She chaired Senator Feinstein's first two campaigns for the United  States Senate, and Dianne Feinstein was one of her closest friends.   I join the Senator from California in expressing my deep sadness at  the loss of my dear friend, and I join with my colleagues from both  sides of the aisle who have said, very rightly, that, with Ellen's  passing, this institution has lost one of its most outstanding former  Members.   My thoughts are with Katherine, who, as Zoe Lofgren said, she adored.  We may have been her good friends, but we were a far-back second to  Katherine, a beautiful young woman in her own right, a wonderful  athlete, and like her mother, bright, ambitious, fair, and loving.   We send our sympathy to her entire family. May Ellen's memory be an  inspiration to all of us in this House to serve in the way she served:  with honor, with humility--humility but also great self-confidence--and  with determination to see every vote as an opportunity to do right by  those who sent us here.   That is what Ellen did every day during her tenure.   I thank Ellen for her service. I thank her for her friendship. I  thank her for making America better. We miss her.
