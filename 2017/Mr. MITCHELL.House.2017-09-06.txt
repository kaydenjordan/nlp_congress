Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                time  1945     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Our Nation faces a dire fiscal situation. We have now reached our  debt ceiling once again. The path we are on is not sustainable. It  jeopardizes our future, our children's future, and our national  security. We must get our fiscal house in order and take this problem  seriously.   Paying lip service to the problem will not solve it. We must be  responsible now before it is far too late. The reality is that we can  make cuts to our government without impacting essential programs. In  fact, the right cuts will grow our economy by stopping overeager  bureaucrats who often seem dedicated to Federal mandates and massive  regulations.   We, in Congress, should be focused on growing and protecting Main  Street, not an already bloated Federal Government. The amendment I  propose today makes the cuts to the bureaucracy, the administrative  costs within the Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies.   The cuts focus on administrative expenses and salaries within these  two departments. This modest 10 percent administrative cut saves  taxpayers $222 million and, admittedly, is but a small step.   I come from the world of private business, so I understand that  fiscal responsibility requires ongoing and consistent small steps. My  amendment, when combined with other similar amendments, will yield big  savings for taxpayers and will do so without cutting projects or  essential programs.   I urge my colleagues to seriously consider my amendment as we work to  secure our fiscal future.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, let me thank the gentleman for bringing  up this amendment. He has worked awfully hard, and I am a huge admirer  of his.   Here is the problem: in the committee, we have actually gone line by  line to identify cuts in salaries and expenses at HUD and DOT, and as a  result, most administrative accounts are at or below the 2017 levels.  By the way, that is one of the ways that we achieved $1.1 billion in  savings, again, below the 2017 budget.   When you do it across the board, it could affect safety programs, it  could actually have unintended consequences. So while I am grateful for  the chairman's hard work, I would urge a ``no'' vote at this time, and  I look forward to continuing to work with the gentleman to make sure  that his concerns are addressed in this bill and in future bills.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I respect the work of the committee,  certainly the chairman.   As I said earlier, I come from the private sector where, frankly, a  10 percent cut in administration is not uncommon. I worked at Chrysler  Corporation back in the original loan guarantee days where Lee Iacocca  said: ``If you can't cut 10 percent of your budget, I will just find a  new manager.''   We have made cuts. We made more substantial cuts than many other  agencies. As noted earlier, we made significant cuts in, for example,  the EPA, back to levels of 2005, 2006. I believe we can make these cuts  and still maintain the safety and security of this Nation, maintain  operations and programs, and while we may disagree, I will certainly  work with the chairman and the committee to continue to work on getting  our fiscal house in order.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise to join the  chairman in opposition.   The amendment would decimate the salaries and expense accounts at the  Department of Transportation, Department of Housing and Urban  Development, and related agencies. There are broad consequences for  this, but I want to focus on one consequence: cybersecurity.   The inspectors general of both departments have indicated that both  agencies have a lot of work to do in addressing cyber threats. The CIOs  at DOT and HUD have been working to address these challenges. They have  had issues in hiring and staffing cybersecurity professionals in what  is a very competitive labor market.   The bill would make these challenges even more difficult by reducing  the salaries and expenses of the CIO offices by 10 percent.   We owe it to our constituents to have a safe and secure  transportation system and to safeguard personally identifiable  information. This amendment would make it harder for these departments  to do this, and I urge its defeat.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).   The amendment was rejected.                  Amendment No. 25 Offered by Mr. McClintock    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 25  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1147, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $150,000,000)''.        Page 1304, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $150,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, this amendment eliminates the $150  million of discretionary spending wasted on one of the least essential  programs in the entire United States Government, the so-called  Essential Air Service. That is the program that subsidizes empty and  near-empty planes to fly from small airports to regional hubs that are  usually just a few hours away or less by car.   This was supposed to be a temporary program to allow local  communities and airports to readjust to airline deregulation back in  1978.   Last year, the Essential Air Service cost a total of nearly $300  million between direct taxpayer subsidies and fees to fly near-empty  planes to underused airports. $150 million of that is in our control,  and this amendment zeros it out and puts it toward deficit reduction.   We are often told that we now have a $200 per person cap on the  subsidies, as if that wasn't bad enough, but that is only for flights  under 210 miles. It continues unlimited subsidies over that distance,  and actual subsidies per passenger can be over $1,000 per seat.   Year after year we are promised reform, and year after year the cost  goes up. By the way, Essential Air Service flights are flown out of  Merced and Visalia airports that serve my district in the Sierra  Nevada. A tiny number of people actually use them, and the alternative  is hardly catastrophic. Visalia and Merced are less than an hour's  drive from Fresno air terminal. But I can assure you that every person  in my district who hears about this waste of their money is outraged by  it.   Rural life has great advantages and great disadvantages, and it is  not the job of taxpayers who choose to live elsewhere to level out the  differences.   Apologists for this wasteful spending tell us it is an important  economic driver for these small airports, and I am sure that is so.  Whenever you give away money, the folks you are giving it to are always  better off, but the folks you are taking it from are always worse off  to exactly the same extent. Indeed, it is economic drivers like this  that have Europe's economy right off a cliff.   Four years ago, one Member rushed to the microphone to suggest this  was essential for emergency medical evacuations. Well, it has nothing  to do with  [[Page H7046]]  that. This program subsidizes regular scheduled commercial service that  practically nobody uses. If it actually had a passenger base, we  wouldn't need, in effect, to hand out wads of $100 bills to the few  passengers who use it, would we?   An airline that so recklessly used its funds would quickly bankrupt  itself. The same principle holds true for governments.   The Washington Post is not known as a bastion of fiscal conservatism,  but I cannot improve upon an editorial a few years ago when it said:  ``Ideally, EAS would be zeroed out, and the $200 million we waste on it  devoted to a truly national purpose: perhaps deficit reduction,  military readiness, or the social safety net. Alas, if Congress and the  White House were capable of making such choices, we probably never  would have had sequestration in the first place.''   There are many tough calls in setting fiscal priorities, but this  isn't one of them. If the House of Representatives--where all  appropriations begin, with a Republican majority pledged to stop  wasting money--can't even agree to cut this useless program off from  the trough, how does it expect to be taken seriously on the much  tougher choices that lie ahead?   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Mitchell). The gentleman from Florida is  recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment. This Essential Air Service program ensures that  small and rural communities have access to the national air  transportation system. The program is vital to small businesses and  farming communities and rural communities and rural entrepreneurs.   So the amendment would cut off air service to many rural communities  and would put economies of many of our small towns potentially at risk.  I thank the gentleman for his passion, but I would urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is correct. It would cut  off air service to communities that are usually just an hour or so  drive from a major regional airport where they can obtain air service.  This is the kindest cut of all. Eliminating a temporary program  established 39 years ago has become a poster child for wasteful Federal  spending.   Now, our national debt has nearly doubled in 8 years. American  taxpayers will pay $269 billion this year just in interest costs on  that debt. If you are an average family paying average taxes, it means  that $2,200 of your taxes this year will accomplish nothing more than  renting the money we have already spent.   Continuing to pay for this obsolete and wasteful program with money  we don't have is simply obscene. It makes a mockery of any claim that  we cut spending to the bone, and I would ask for adoption of the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 26 Offered by Mr. Kildee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 26  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
