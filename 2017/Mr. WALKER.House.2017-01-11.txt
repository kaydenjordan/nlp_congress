 Mr. Speaker, tonight is our third time that we have  hosted People's Night. This is a time for our Members to bypass outside  forces and influences and talk directly to the American people.   Tonight we are presenting something that has been very important, not  just a topic, but something that nearly 6 years ago--or a little over 6  years ago--right here where we stand tonight was passed in an overly  bipartisan manner and has burdened the American people in what is now  known as ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act.   This is a piece of legislation that has burdened small businesses and  individuals alike. Now we have been asked to fix it, to repeal and to  replace. Well, it takes Members to be able to have experience in this  particular field to understand the heart of community. One of the  people who does that most, specifically in the area of poverty  initiatives, who reaches across community lines, reaches across party  lines is the gentleman from Kentucky, my good friend, Representative  Andy Barr from Kentucky. I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr).    I thank Representative Barr. Your compassion on this  topic is certainly evident. We appreciate your comments this evening.   Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of numbers I would like to share that  puts it a little bit in the context of what we are dealing with here.  Seventy-five percent of co-ops have failed. In five States, Americans  are down to just one option. The great thing about our country's  history is that we have choices. We have decisions. Yet, since the  takeover of this administration over health care, those choices have  continued to reduce. Sometimes you may hear Congress this or Congress  that. One of the neat things about Congress is the amount of people  coming from diverse backgrounds.   Our next speaker tonight is Representative Mike Bishop, former senate  majority leader in his home State of Michigan, who was already working  on those reforms when he came to the United States Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend from Michigan (Mr. Bishop).    I thank Representative Bishop of Michigan.   One of the numbers my friend just mentioned was 8 out of 10. Nearly  80 percent, according to Gallup, believe this law should be overhauled  or completely repealed. So I ask people watching tonight and my friends  across the aisle: Are we to do nothing? In fact, even in the press  conference today, President-elect Trump said that, if we did nothing,  it would continue to fail. But we have an obligation to stand up and do  what is right.   We can't do nothing. People are suffering--in fact, suffering to the  place that even recently a couple months ago a Minnesota Governor was  honest enough to talk about how it has damaged small business. Goodness  gracious, even a former Democratic President has acknowledged the  destruction it has caused for individuals and small businesses.   No one knows more about what it does to our States than individual  Representatives. One of the fine gentlemen that is speaking tonight is  Representative French Hill. He is one of the sharper minds that we have  had as part of the 114th class that I have been privileged to meet and  serve with for the last 2 years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    If you listened closely there, Representative Hill talked  about some of the premiums increasing. If you think back 6, 7, even 8  years ago, even part of the original campaign talking about the  Affordable Care Act, this ObamaCare, we think about three promises--we  have all heard them--you can keep your doctor, you can keep your  healthcare plan, and premiums are going down. Specifically one that  stands out more was the premiums going down $2,500.   My Democratic friends want to ignore some of those numbers, but here  are the facts: In 2014, premiums increased across the board 37 percent;  2015, again, last year, 25 percent. In fact, in some States, it is out  of sight. In my home State of North Carolina, it is 40 percent. But in  some places, in Arizona, it is as high as 116 percent.   So the process of working to put this together, the RSC plan and the  repeal and replace, who better than to have people that have experience  in this? There is maybe nobody better in the House who has the  insurance background than our friend, Representative Austin Scott from  Georgia's Eighth District.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin  Scott).    Representative Scott, well articulated. I appreciate your  heart on this.   Looking at this and tackling this project because of the 2,600 pages  of complexities, I guess we don't need to reiterate it, but how the  minority leader said that we needed to pass this law to be able to  figure out what is in it.                                time 1930    Obviously, it is more than just a running joke. With the people in  the background, what does it take to kind of wrap our minds around it  and to wrap our arms around it so as to find our way back? It takes  people with medical experience, and it takes people with budget  experience. This is going to be huge.   One of the Members we have here with us tonight is the vice chair of  the Committee on the Budget, someone who has great concern about the  damage that this has caused to the fine folks of Indiana, whom he  represents. It is my privilege to yield to the Representative from  Indiana, Todd Rokita.    I thank Representative Rokita.   Mr. Speaker, as I was sitting here, I just received a text from a  volunteer fire department official right outside of Charlotte, North  Carolina. He writes that they were watching the proceedings this  evening:         I just want to let you know that even my drug prescription       has gone up $200 out of pocket per person.    He has three daughters in his family.   Think about this. This is real-life stuff. That is why we are  stepping in. Part of our plan in the repeal and replacement--the  American Health Care Reform Act--allows you to have immediate access to  your health savings account. You would not have to worry about  somebody's needing a prescription or somebody's needing medicine--one  of the children--and, every time, it is $200 out of pocket. That is why  it is important to move--and to move with diligence.   Someone who knows a little bit about the healthcare industry is my  friend Dr. Brian Babin of Texas, who has been dealing with this in his  own dentist's practice. He is a former veteran and is someone who cares  about his district but who cares about all Americans. It is my  privilege to yield to my friend from the great State of Texas, the Lone  Star State, Dr. Brian Babin.     I thank Dr. Babin. I appreciate that spirited, heartfelt  talk. In my previous vocation, we would usually call for an invitation  at about this time.   Mr. Speaker, this is not just a problem in red States; this is a  problem in blue States, like it is with my good friend from the First  District of California, Representative Doug LaMalfa, to whom I yield as  he shares a little bit of his heart when it comes to ObamaCare and the  repeal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), our resident veterinarian in the House.    Mr. Speaker, we talk about numbers. Twenty-five percent  of all Americans have been damaged at some point under this Affordable  Care Act. We cannot look the other way.   One gentleman who doesn't look the other way but stands up and speaks  the truth is Representative Pete Olson.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, who better to close out our Special Order  than a gentleman, a doctor who has employed hundreds of people and has  worked with thousands of patients?   You may have heard the false narrative that, yes, we have contributed  in breaking the program, from the Democrat's perspective, and you guys  need to fix it, but you don't have a plan.   Well, that is a false narrative and here to tell you why is Dr. Phil  Roe.   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe).    Mr. Speaker, the bottom line to the American people is  this: it is time to return healthcare choices to the American people.   God bless and good night.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
