 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate my friend, my  constituent, and my role model, Peg Myrick. I celebrate Peg here on the  floor of the House of Representatives because her life and her example  is one I would like to share with you, my colleagues.   Peg began her career as a teacher, reaching kids, impacting lives,  but on Halloween 2016, Peg was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. With a  life-changing terminal diagnosis, Peg committed herself to continuing  her role as an educator, now acting as an ambassador for Fight  Colorectal Cancer and educating others on the importance of screenings  and understanding this disease.   As she has battled for her life, she shares her exuberant positivity  with everyone, and she demonstrates in her daily life what it is to  live for the minute, what it is to show life and love to those around  you--to her family, to her friends--and she demonstrates a lesson I  think we should all learn from, which is that we are all in this  together. Through her positivity and her friendship, she endeavors to  lift up everyone around her.                            ____________________
