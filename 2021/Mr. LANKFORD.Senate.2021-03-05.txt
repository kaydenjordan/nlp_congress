 Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry before  I begin.   Parliamentary inquiry: On page 225, line 23, it appears that the 7(b)  disaster loan program allocates $460 million, but only $70 million is  for the actual disaster loans. The other $390 million appears to be  allocated for administrative costs of the program.   Could the clerk please read page 225 line 20 through page 226 line 2  to confirm the administrative cost for this program is $390 million and  the grant program itself is only $70 million?    I call up my amendment No. 1031 and ask that it be  reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes of debate equally  divided.    Madam President, millions of Americans see a sonogram,  and they see a child. They count 10 fingers. They count 10 toes. They  watch that little girl in the womb suck her thumb. They see a child.   Science notes that the DNA of that child in the womb is different  than the DNA of the mom and different than the DNA of the dad. It is  both confirmed by science that is a baby, and it is self-evident by  just looking at her in the womb, that is a child. Millions of Americans  see that.   Because we have such a divide in this Nation where some people see  every child as valuable and some people see only some children as  valuable, because we have had that divide that is unresolved in our  Nation, we have, for decades, in every appropriations bill, had the  Hyde Amendment, that did not force Americans to have to pay for  abortion procedures for the death of children. We have also had that in  all five COVID bills that we have agreed together on in the last 12  months.   In this partisan bill, mysteriously, the Hyde Amendment disappeared  and suddenly, now, for the first time, Americans who profoundly believe  that children are of great value and should be protected will be  compelled with our tax dollars to pay for the destruction of life.   This simple statement is that we should maintain Hyde protections in  this bill as we have in the previous five COVID bills.    Madam President, in the middle of a pandemic, we  shouldn't be dealing with abortion funding. So, I would say, pursuant  to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, I move to waive.                           Vote on Motion to Waive     Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
