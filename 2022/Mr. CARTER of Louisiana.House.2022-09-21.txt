 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Bowman  for organizing this hour to discuss such a critical issue, and I thank  him for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the opportunity to shine  light on this critical issue of mental health. Our children are our  most precious treasures. For many of us, they are our reason why.   Why we work two jobs. Why we go to school. Why we try to overcome  personal challenges and become the best version of ourselves. Yet, our  system is failing to help our dear children fight their own demons.  From kindergartners to young adults, young people of all ages are  struggling with mental health and that they are not being met with the  services they need to be happy, to be healthy, and tragically, to save  their lives.   It is truly a crisis, and like most crises we face, the situation is  worse for some communities than others, and certainly it is the case  for communities of color.   Here is a terrifying statistic: Black children under the age of 13  are twice as likely to die by suicide compared to their White peers-- twice as likely.   Further, children who survive natural disasters--like many of my  constituents in southeast Louisiana--are left with emotional scars that  can impact them for their entire lives. A new study published by the  Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that the stress of  experiencing a natural disaster during a pregnancy can substantially  increase the risk of childhood depression and anxiety.   It is clear that we are in a crisis, and we must act to meet the  moment. I am so grateful that the Institute of Women and Ethnic Studies  of New Orleans has been granted $400,000 from HHS for an initiative to  help identify health and wellness policies that are successful in  improving Black youth mental health, and including suicide prevention.   This year, Congress just passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,  which will help keep guns out of the hands of individuals who are in  danger of potentially hurting themselves or others. But this historic  bill also includes $500 million for school-based mental health  services, and millions more for certified community behavioral health  clinics and mental health telehealth.   This year, we also launched the 988 hotline, a mental health hotline  and text line, where people can reach trained counselors in their time  of need. We must, we can, we will do more. We must make mental health  service easy, accessible, and affordable to everyone, particularly our  children.   We must tear down the stigma and equalize mental health and physical  health. It is okay to not be okay. Everyone needs support at a  different point in their lives. Everyone needs a little extra help  sometimes. Everyone can feel a little down sometimes. Everyone has  issues that they think are insurmountable. But guess what? With help,  with treatment, help is there, and you can survive it. You have got to  know that.   Don't ever be afraid to ask for help. Don't ever be afraid to admit  that you just don't feel right. Don't ever be afraid to admit that you  don't fit in, that you feel different. Help is there. And we have all  had moments where we needed help. You have got to know that you can  survive, and you will survive this.   We must all be trained about the signs of mental health crises and  look out for one another. Implementing many of these programs and  supporting the mental health professionals who provide these services  may have a significant price tag, and from my perspective, it is  essential.   Any dollar that we spend, any money that we appropriate that saves a  life, that gives individuals hope that we care and that resources are  available, are dollars well spent.   We need to do more. We need to invest in programs and have staff that  change and save lives. We need to do it now. We need to continue to  fight. Our children are worth it.   When someone has high blood pressure, they exercise, they diet, they  take a pill. If someone has diabetes, they exercise, they diet, they  take a pill. They modify their lifestyles, and they are not ashamed to  admit those things. Mental health is no different.   There is nothing wrong with admitting that you may need help because  help is there for you, and we know empirically that the resources are  there, and they make a difference. We have got to get away from feeling  like if we need help that somehow some way that means something is  wrong with me. Well, there is nothing wrong with you. There is nothing  more wrong with you than a person that has a headache who takes an  aspirin.                                time  1730    There is nothing more wrong with you than somebody who has high blood  pressure and takes blood pressure medicine. We can fix it. You are not  alone. It is important that you know.   To anyone who is struggling, who has children or young people in  their lives who are struggling, you are not alone.  [[Page H8051]]  You will never be alone. Things will get better.   Reach out. 988 is available to you 24/7. Experts are waiting to heed  your call. Organizations are funded to help you. We are here to help  you.   You are not alone, and you can and will survive.
