 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1388 will provide for the acquisition of a number  of acres of noncontiguous land in trust for the benefit of Lytton  Rancheria. The lands, located in Sonoma County next to the town of  Windsor, are the subject of a fee-to-trust application filed by the  Tribe with the Department of the Interior in 2009.   Neither the Obama nor Trump administration has provided a reason why  the Tribe's application has not been approved in the last 10 years.   The Tribe has testified that it intends to use a portion of the land  for tribal housing, while the rest would support a diverse range of  economic development, including plans for a future resort and winery.   I notice everyone paid attention to that last word.   An identical measure passed the House in the previous Congress, and  it has been reported twice by the Committee on Natural Resources,  though not in the current Congress.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 297, sponsored by Congressman Gianforte, would  extend Federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa  Indians of Montana.   With Federal recognition, the Little Shell Tribe and its members  would be eligible for all services and benefits provided by the Federal  Government to Indians because of their status as Indians.   A previous version of this bill passed without opposition in the last  Congress, thanks in large part to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Gianforte), who has been a tireless advocate of recognizing the Little  Shell Tribe and whose work has been instrumental to bring this  legislation closer to the finish line.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Gianforte).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
