 Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the lead sponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters of  support for H.R. 748.                                   The ERISA Industry Committee,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.        Dear Member of Congress: This week, the House is expected       to vote on H.R. 748, the ``Middle Class Health Benefits Tax       Repeal Act of 2019.'' The ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC) is       the only national trade association that advocates       exclusively for large employer plan sponsors on health,       retirement, and compensation public policies on the federal,       state, and local levels. ERIC member companies employ workers       in every state and community and provide health coverage that       is valued and relied upon by families across the country.       ERIC urges members of Congress to vote YES and support this       legislation.        H.R. 748, supported by more than 360 cosponsors in the       House, would eliminate the impending 40% ``Cadillac'' excise       tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance. The tax       does not target overly-generous benefits; instead, it attacks       plans based upon their costs. As such, plans that insure more       individuals with chronic conditions, more seniors, more       women, and populations more likely to incur health care costs       will be unfairly taxed at an unsustainable rate--as will       those based parts of the country where health care is more       expensive.        If Congress fails to repeal the Cadillac tax, employers may       have to:        Directly shift costs to employees. This could include       increasing the portion of the plan premium employees pay,       increasing deductibles, copays and coinsurance.        Eliminate employer contributions to consumer-directed       accounts. This includes Health Savings Accounts (HSAs),       Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs), or Flexible       Spending Accounts (FSAs).        Reduce access to care. This includes tightening networks       and excluding high-cost providers, implementing barriers to       high cost treatments and providers (step therapy, prior       authorization), moving expensive medicines deeper into Rx       formularies, and eliminating coverage for some medications.        Eliminate coverage for spouses and dependents, and separate       out or eliminate excepted benefits. These include dental,       vision, hospital indemnity, cancer-only, or other ``add-on''       benefits.        Drastically redesign plans. For instance, ending preferred       provider organization (PPO) or similar plans, and       implementing a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) or a health       maintenance organization (HMO).        Eliminate investments in health. Investments that plan       sponsors make to improve health may save money later, but the       costs of those investments could be considered to add value       to the plan. As such, plans may consider eliminating on-site       clinics, wellness programs, telehealth benefits, health       information technology investments, and other health       improvement efforts that have up-front costs.        As we have previous reported to Congress, the Cadillac tax       is an existential threat to employer-sponsored health       benefits. Repealing the Cadillac tax is ERIC's top priority       on behalf of our member companies. While employers support       efforts to reduce health care costs, a tax on benefits will       do the opposite, making health insurance less affordable for       workers, their families, and retirees.        As such, when H.R. 748 comes to a vote, ERIC urges members       to vote YES. We look forward to working with Congress to       finally repeal this damaging tax, to ensure affordability of       health benefits for patients.            Sincerely,                                               James P. Gelfand.  [[Page H5965]]                                          ____                                         American Benefits Council,                                     Washington, DC, July 14, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: We are very       gratified that the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal       Act (H.R. 748) will be voted upon shortly in the House of       Representatives. This widely bipartisan measure sponsored by       Representatives Joe Courtney and Mike Kelly would fully and       immediately repeal the 40 percent ``Cadillac Tax'' that       threatens the high-value, high-quality health coverage that       181 million Americans receive through employers. We ask that       you strongly urge the members of your respective caucuses to       support this measure. Passage of H.R. 748 with a large       bipartisan majority will send a powerful signal to the Senate       of the need to quickly approve this legislation.        The American Benefits Council's members either directly       sponsor or support sponsors of health and retirement benefits       for virtually all Americans covered by employer-provided       plans. Consequently, we are keenly aware of the drastic       impact the ``Cadillac Tax'' would have on health care       benefits. We have already witnessed some of the negative       consequences, even though the tax does not technically go       into effect until 2022.        Starting that year, a 40 percent excise tax will be imposed       on employer-sponsored coverage that exceeds certain dollar       thresholds. For millions of Americans who rely upon health       insurance coverage through an employer, the looming       implementation of the tax has already resulted in reduced       coverage and increased out-of-pocket costs. The reason for       this is, to ensure the impact of the tax on participants is       not imposed suddenly and severely in 2022, many employers       have already reluctantly been compelled to make plan changes:       reducing important benefits or asking workers to assume a       larger share of deductibles and copayments. This trend will       accelerate without swift action by Congress.                                   ____       AGC Key Vote: Vote ``Yes'' on H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health                      Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019                                                      July 16, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Associated General       Contractors of America (AGC), I write to urge you to support       the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 748).       This bipartisan legislation would repeal the 40 percent       excise tax on employer-sponsored health coverage and employee       benefits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Because       ensuring the ability to provide affordable health care is a       critical issue for the construction industry, AGC reserves       the right to record your vote on this bill as a ``key vote''       for the education of its membership.        The 40 percent excise tax, also known as the ``Cadillac       tax,'' would force contractors to cut or limit employee       benefits for millions of employees. Though dubbed the       Cadillac tax because the provision was targeting ``high       cost'' employer-sponsored health coverage, it is causing an       adverse effect on the affordability and quality of health       coverage available to construction employees and their       families even before it has taken effect.        While we appreciate prior delays of this tax, uncertainty       remains in the employer health market as the U.S. Treasury       Department begins to develop proposed rules for       implementation. As construction employers make health plan       decisions well in advance of a coverage year beginning,       looming proposed rules have a direct impact on their planning       process for the next several coverage years.        AGC supports the affordability and viability of providing       employersponsored coverage now and in the future. As such,       the 40 percent excise tax should be permanently repealed.       Again, AGC reserves the right to record your vote as a ``key       vote'' for the education of its membership.            Sincerely,                                                Jimmy Christianson,      Vice President, Government Relations.                                   ____                                National Business Group on Health,                                                      July 16, 2019.      Hon. Joe Courtney (D-CT)      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Kelly (R-PA)      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Courtney and Kelly: The National       Business Group on Health (Business Group) again writes in       strong support of your bipartisan bill (H.R. 748) that would       eliminate the 40 percent tax on the value of health benefits       above a government-determined amount imposed by the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred       to as the ``Cadillac Tax''. Any tax that raises the cost of       health benefits will harm the more than 181 million Americans       who rely on and value employer-sponsored health coverage.       Even though the Cadillac Tax is delayed to 2022, the Business       Group urges the 116th Congress to pass this important       bipartisan legislation early in 2019 to provide permanent       relief and clarity to employees that this fundamentally       flawed tax will not impact their health benefits.        According to our survey data, absent plan changes, 73% of       companies who responded will have at least one plan that       triggers the tax in 2022 and 94% will in 2026. In a few short       years, if the tax is not repealed, it will affect nearly 100%       of employer plans since the tax is indexed to general       inflation, not medical inflation, which is consistently much       higher.        Furthermore, the National Business Group on Health, which       represents 440, primarily large, employers (including 75 of       the Fortune 100) who voluntarily provide health benefits and       other health programs to over 55 million American employees,       retirees, and their families, believes that not only is this       tax flawed, it is also not the most effective way to tackle       rising health care costs. Rather than focus on demand-side       taxes that will raise costs for working Americans and their       employers, Congress should focus on supply-side drivers of       medical inflation and unnecessary.            Sincerely,                                                 Brian J. Marcotte,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                   National Coalition on Benefits,                                                      July 17, 2019.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       National Coalition on Benefits (NCB), a coalition of       businesses and associations committed to protecting the       ability of employers to provide uniform employee health       benefits across the country, strongly supports the passage of       H.R. 748, the ``Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act       of 2019.'' This legislation would repeal the looming       ``Cadillac Tax,'' a 40 percent excise tax imposed on employee       health benefits above a certain threshold.        Employers strongly support the full repeal of the Cadillac       Tax because this tax inevitably forces the reduction of       employee benefits and, because of the flawed indexing       provisions of the underlying Affordable Care Act, this tax       will affect most plans in a few years, even those with       reduced benefits. Employers devise benefit plans two years in       advance of the actual plan year. As a result, employers are       being forced now to reduce employee benefits in order to       avoid the impending reach of the Cadillac Tax.        Working Americans don't want their health benefits taxed at       a time when they're already confronting higher premiums and       out-of-pocket costs. Indeed, a 2018 election night poll,       conducted by pollster Frank Luntz, highlights that 81 percent       of voters oppose taxes on employer-provided health coverage.        The Cadillac Tax presents a direct threat to the more than       181 million Americans who rely on employer-sponsored coverage       to meet their health care needs. The NCB thanks Reps. Joe       Courtney and Mike Kelly for their dogged and unwavering       commitment to repealing this onerous tax on employee benefits       and urges the House to approve H.R. 748.            Sincerely,      National Coalition on Benefits.                                   ____         Dear Representative: On behalf of NFIB, the nation's       leading small business advocacy organization, I write in       support of H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax       Repeal Act of 2019. This legislation repeals the 40 percent       excise tax on employer-sponsored health insurance, also known       as the ``Cadillac tax.'' This bill will be considered an NFIB       Key Vote for the 116th Congress.        The cost of health insurance continues to be the number one       problem for small business owners, according to NFIB's       Problems and Priorities survey. As health insurance costs       increase, fewer small business owners are able to offer       coverage to employees. In 2010, 39 percent of small       businesses offered health insurance. In 2018, fewer than 30       percent of small businesses offered coverage, a net decrease       of 24 percent. The Cadillac tax will exacerbate this trend.       Health insurance cost increases will accelerate as more small       businesses are subject to the Cadillac tax.        The Cadillac tax will also be an administrative nightmare       for small business owners. Early guidance from the Internal       Revenue Service (IRS) proposed requiring small business       owners to calculate their tax liability, notify the IRS and       health insurers of their tax liability, and remit the tax       liability to the health insurers. Small business owners do       not have time or resources for significant new compliance and       reporting burdens.        NFIB supports passage of H.R. 748 and will consider a vote       in favor of the legislation as an NFIB Key Vote for the 116th       Congress. H.R. 748 will help mitigate health insurance cost       increases and relieve administrative burdens for small       business owners and employees. We look forward to working       with you to protect small business as the 116th Congress       moves forward.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Sanchez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Nevada.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 748, the Middle  Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019.   This legislation has been a bipartisan goal since I came to Congress  in 2012, the permanent repeal of the Cadillac tax. The original design  of the Cadillac tax was meant to be a narrowly targeted tax on the most  extravagant plans.   Instead, the tax will hit working families for a variety of factors  far beyond their control. That includes age, geography, and occupation.   A recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the  Cadillac tax will impact over 20 percent of employers when the tax goes  into effect in 2022. When flexible spending account contributions are  included, that number jumps to over 30 percent and would affect just  under half of all workers by 2030.   While the intended goal of the Cadillac tax was to put downward  pressure on plan costs, the mechanics of the tax will simply put more  costs onto working families in the form of higher deductibles and  greater cost-sharing so employers can avoid the tax.   Madam Speaker, I remind my colleagues that healthcare costs are a top  concern of the American people, and today we can take a meaningful step  to address that concern.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
