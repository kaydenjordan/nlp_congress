 Madam President, I rise today to honor GEN Joseph L.  Votel, of the U.S. Army and the Commander of United States Central  Command. General Votel is one of our Nation's finest military officers,  and he will retire from Active military duty on May 1, 2019, bringing  to a close 39 years of distinguished service to our great Nation.   In 1980, General Votel was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the  infantry upon graduation from the United States Military Academy at  West Point. He commanded units at every echelon, from platoon to  theater, with duty in Germany, Italy, Sarajevo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and  the United States. As a young officer, General Votel deployed with 75th  Ranger Regiment in support of Operation Just Cause. He later commanded  the 1st Ranger Battalion at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia. General  Votel commanded the 75th Ranger Regiment and  [[Page S1984]]  led them on deployments in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and  Operation Iraqi Freedom. Later he served as deputy commanding general  of the 82d Airborne Division in Operation Enduring Freedom.   As a general officer, he served in the Pentagon as the Director of  the Army and Joint IED Defeat Task Force and subsequently as the Deputy  Director of the Joint IED Defeat Organization established under the  Deputy Secretary of Defense. He served as the Deputy Commanding General  and then Commanding General of the Joint Special Operations Command  headquartered at Fort Bragg, NC. He also served as the Commanding  General of U.S. Special Operations Command, MacDill Air Force Base,  Florida. Most recently General Votel has served as the Commanding  General of U.S. Central Command.   At a time of great uncertainty in the world, General Votel has led an  incredible combatant command that has an enormous influence and  presence in some of the most volatile parts of the globe. He has led  the way in strategic relationships with our partners and allies that  have made our country safer. General Votel is an exceptional leader, an  American patriot committed to our Armed Forces, our national security  and our Nation, but most importantly, General Votel is a great man of  character. It is for GEN Joe Votel, a soldier, leader, and selfless  servant, whom we with profound admiration and deep respect pay tribute  to for all he has done for the defense of our Nation for nearly four  decades.   We thank General Votel, his wife Michele, and their two grown  children, Scott and Nicholas, for their dedication and sacrifice, and  we wish them well in the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to recognize Terry  Dupree, a gentleman who has worked diligently serving the people of  Oklahoma throughout his career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  for 38 years.   Terry began his career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  performing work involving the conservation, propagation, management,  protection, and administration of wildlife species. Terry dedicated his  life to implementing and advancing practices necessary for the  conservation and management of wildlife resources and habitats. His  experience and expertise has proven invaluable to the fish and wildlife  community throughout his career.   This hard work eventually led him to become a leader within the  Partner for Fish and Wildlife Program, which provides technical and  financial assistance for the restoration and enhancement of fish and  wildlife habitat on private lands. I am incredibly proud of the work he  has put in over the years for the people of our great State of  Oklahoma.   I want to thank Terry Dupree on his years of service and wish him  well in his retirement.   Well done, Terry.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I  report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in  the Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save  the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these  nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of  Senators.
