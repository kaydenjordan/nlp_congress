 Mr. President, much of the news media today is focused  on Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine--and rightfully so--but not  enough attention is being paid to negotiations that are happening today  and have been happening in Vienna.   The Biden administration seems dead set on reviving, at any cost, the  Iran nuclear deal. Worse, President Biden's chief negotiator Rob  Malley--who, I observe, is not a Senate-confirmed official--outsourced  our negotiations for reviving this flawed Iran deal to the Russians.  This is outrageous.   Let me get this straight. We are working hand in glove with Vladimir  Putin to reach a deal that will help Russia evade sanctions being  imposed for its aggression in Ukraine and work with its ally Iran.   This is not the way to protect the safety and the interest of the  American people.   This is what Russia's chief negotiator to the Iran talks had to say  about what he has accomplished for the Biden administration:         I am absolutely sincere in this regard when I say that Iran       got much more than it could expect, much more.    He recently told reporters, adding:         Realistically speaking, Iran got more than, frankly, I       expected or others expected. This is a matter of fact.    Again, this is Russia's chief negotiator making this statement.   Most alarmingly, this revived deal would pave Iran's path to a  nuclear weapon. News reports also suggest that the revived deal would  quickly unleash $90 billion in frozen funds to Iran--again, the world's  biggest state-sponsor of terrorism. Moreover, Iran can expect to earn  roughly $50 billion annually in renewed oil exports.   It is unconscionable that the Biden administration appears more eager  to unleash the energy production in Venezuela and Iran than right here  in America. The Biden administration is so stubborn and blinded by its  ideological green energy fantasies that it would rather work with  terrorists and dictators--folks with some of the worst human rights  records in history--than admit it was a mistake to abandon America's  energy independence. This administration would rather work with killers  than with American drillers.   As before, the Iranian regime will use this massive windfall of  sanctions relief to fund terrorism and aggression against our ally  Israel, against our Arab partners, and against Americans serving in the  Middle East.   Let me be clear. The Trump administration was right to withdraw us  from the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2018. But I am not here today to  debate the pros and cons of resurrecting the Iran deal. We will likely  have that debate in the days to come, probably sooner than most people  think.   Rather, I am here today to argue for preserving the role that  Congress--amid concerns that the Biden administration will not submit  their new Iran nuclear deal for review and for an up-or-down vote--that  Congress must maintain its role as required by U.S. law.   If news reports are to be believed, the Biden administration may be  nearing the end of negotiations for an agreement to resuscitate the  Iran deal. As Reuters reported recently:         The draft text of the agreement, which is more than 20       pages long, stipulates a sequence of steps to be implemented       . . .    In 2014 and 2015, many lawmakers passionately argued that the  original Iran deal should have been submitted to the Senate as a  treaty, requiring our advice and consent under the U.S. Constitution.  But because the Obama administration refused to follow the  Constitution, Congress was compelled to enact the Iran Nuclear  Agreement Review Act, or INARA. INARA passed the Senate in a 99-to-1  vote--99 to 1. This is nearly unanimous, a bipartisan vote that  reflects how frustrated the Senate is that the executive branch was  trying to circumvent Congress on such an important matter. INARA  clearly requires that any agreement--I repeat, any agreement--related  to the nuclear program of Iran should be submitted to the Senate and to  the House for congressional review, including for an up-or-down vote.   It is beyond debate that the Biden administration is required by law  to submit any new agreement for reviving the Iran deal to Congress for  congressional review, but the Biden administration has not clearly  committed that it will submit whatever agreement it is negotiating in  Vienna for our review and an up-or-down vote by Congress.   If the Biden administration refuses to submit its new Iran agreement  to Congress, it will be ignoring the law and undermining the role of  this body in foreign policy.   Last year, I was concerned this might happen. That is why I  introduced the Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act of 2020. My bill  borrows a provision from the Countering America's Adversaries Through  Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, an act that overwhelmingly passed Congress in  2017.   The CAATSA provision allows for congressional review and an up-or- down vote on any Presidential waiver of Russia's sanctions. My bill  takes word-for-word that same provision and applies it to any  Presidential waiver of Iran sanctions. This is important because any  new agreement to revive the Iran deal will require once again the  executive branch to waive Iran sanctions. In other words, my bill  protects the role of Congress if the executive branch ignores INARA and  refuses to submit the new agreement to the Senate and to the House.   So far, 37 Senators have cosponsored the Iran Sanctions Relief Review  Act with me. This number is significant because 37 Senators would be  more than enough to deny the Senate's advice and consent if the  executive branch actually followed the Constitution and presented a new  Iran agreement to the Senate as a treaty.   I urge my colleagues who have not yet cosponsored the Iran Sanctions  Relief Review Act to join me and to do so. We must protect the first  branch of government from an executive branch that seeks to encroach  upon it or even to ignore it.   I also remind the Biden administration, the Iranian regime, and the  world of a fact that should be patently obvious by now: Any agreement  to revive the Iran nuclear deal that lacks the Senate's advice and  consent under the  [[Page S1028]]  Constitution--that is, that lacks the support of 67 Senators--will not  survive multiple Presidential administrations. It will be ripped up  just like it was the last time. And I have zero doubt that, as before,  the next Presidential administration will end this deal again and will  snap back sanctions--with a vengeance--against the Iranian regime and  those countries that were foolish enough to trade with it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
