 Mr. Chair, since President Biden took office, he has waged  a full-on assault on the oil and gas industry. Instead of unleashing  American energy production, he has unleashed our energy reserves. Now,  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at its lowest level in 40 years.   In an attempt to temporarily lower gas prices leading up to the 2022  election, President Biden has abused the SPR, which is supposed to be  used for emergency purposes, and weakened America's energy security.   Oklahomans and all Americans deserve more than the political games.  H.R. 21 is a step toward allowing America to produce reliable and  affordable energy and ensure we are prepared for true energy supply  emergencies in the future.
