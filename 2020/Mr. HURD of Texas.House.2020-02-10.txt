 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the  tremendous public service of Mrs. Carmen Gutierrez.   Carmen has served for 5 years as my Del Rio district representative,  delivering the gold standard in constituent services to the people of  Terrell, Val Verde, Kinney, and Uvalde Counties.   Carmen was born and raised in Texas and has made it her life's work  to give back to her community. Before working for my office, Carmen  served as district equipment superintendent at the Texas Department of  Transportation, becoming the first female in history to serve in that  role.   Carmen has played an integral role in her community and is beloved by  those who call her friend and neighbor. When you walk through Del Rio,  everyone knows her name.   At the end of February, Carmen will retire from public service. It is  a retirement that is well earned: scores of constituent cases closed,  hundreds of lives touched, and now a loving family eagerly awaits more  time with Carmen.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Carmen  on her distinguished career and upcoming retirement.                            ____________________
