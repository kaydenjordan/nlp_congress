 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Family and  Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, one of the first legislative  acts of the new Republican majority.                                time  1930    Main Street America has suffered 2 years too many of Democrats' one- party rule. Inflation continues to hover at record highs, and small  businesses continue to struggle.   The last thing that these small businesses can afford right now is  87,000 new IRS agents not only targeting their enterprises but  targeting their livelihoods. With 11 million tax returns still awaiting  IRS action, the IRS should be focusing on doing their job rather than  weaponizing their agency.   This isn't new. The Democrats have used the IRS and the Tax Code as a  weapon before and are attempting to do it again. The Family and Small  Business Taxpayer Protection Act rescinds new IRS funding intended to  target middle-class families.   This cannot wait.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill so our small businesses can  thrive absent any fear of IRS agents knocking at their door.
