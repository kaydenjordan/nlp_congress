 Mr. President, for the past 8 years, we had a  President who selected nominees for our Nation's judiciary based upon  what became known as the ``empathy standard,'' an ideological litmus  test designed to find judicial nominees who would favor certain groups  or individuals over others. It is a great standard if you are the party  in a case for whom the judge has empathy. It is not so great if you are  the other person. Not only does this standard deny every litigant a  fair shake, but it also disregards our Nation's bedrock legal tradition  of dispensing equal justice under the law.   President Trump, on the other hand, selected nominees who would help  ensure that the judiciary is true to its role in our democracy. Later  today, the Senate will vote to confirm one of those nominees, Trevor  McFadden, as a district court judge for the District of Columbia. His  nomination was approved by the Judiciary Committee without a single  vote in opposition. Democrats needlessly delayed his vote on the floor  anyway.   We have seen many delay tactics from them already this year. We have  pushed through every time. We are going to push through again today. We  are going to confirm the impressive judicial nominee before us, and we  are going to confirm more judicial nominees in the coming days as well.   Our effort to confirm qualified judicial nominees this year would not  be possible without the tireless work and effective leadership of our  Judiciary Committee chairman, Chuck Grassley. To build on the excellent  work of his committee, I filed cloture last week on four well-qualified  circuit court nominees. These nominees understand that their role as a  judge is to put aside their personal preferences and instead decide  cases based on what the law says. We will confirm all of them this  week, no matter how long that takes.   The first of these four circuit court nominees that we will confirm  this week is Professor Amy Barrett, who was nominated by the President  to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. A mother  of seven, Professor Barrett began her  [[Page S6862]]  legal career by clerking for Judge Laurence Silberman of the DC Circuit  and then for Justice Antonin Scalia. These prestigious clerkships gave  her the opportunity to work closely with two giants of the legal field.  Today, she is a respected professor at the University of Notre Dame,  where, by the way, she was honored as Distinguished Professor of the  Year twice. Professor Barrett will bring a wealth of knowledge to the  bench.   Professor Barrett happens to be a Catholic. Her faith is important to  her. She has spoken freely about it and its impact on her life. But she  also understands the role of a judge, which is not to let personal  beliefs dictate how cases are decided.   Unbelievably, some on the political left, including some of our  Democratic colleagues, are criticizing her because as a law student she  cowrote a law journal article that argued just that. Her coauthor of  the article, John Garvey, is now the president of Catholic University.  He recently wrote the following:         Amy Barrett, a law professor at Notre Dame, was grilled on       Wednesday by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee       about an article she and I wrote together in 1998 when I was       a law professor and she was my student. In that article we       argued that the death penalty was immoral, as the Catholic       Church teaches (in common with Quakers, Episcopalians,       Presbyterians, Methodists, and the 38 member communions in       the National Council of Churches). We went on to say that a       Catholic judge who held that view might, in rare cases, have       to recuse herself under . . . [the] federal statute that asks       a federal judge to step aside when she has conscientious       scruples that prevent her from deciding a case in conformity       with the facts and the law.    President Garvey went on to write:         Perhaps the Alliance for Justice, which has mounted a       campaign to discredit Professor Barrett, didn't get that far       in reading the article. Its website says this: ``Stunningly,       Barrett has asserted that judges should not follow the law or       the Constitution when it conflicts with their personal       religious beliefs. In fact, [this group claimed] Barrett has       said that judges should be free to put their personal views       ahead of their judicial oath to faithfully follow the law.''    President Garvey noted, however:         Barrett (and I) said no such thing--    No such thing--         We said precisely the opposite.    This opposition to Professor Barrett is so upside down that it leaves  people like President Garvey wondering whether there is something else  going on here. President Garvey concluded:         The case against Prof. Barrett is so flimsy that you have       to wonder whether there isn't some other, unspoken, cause for       their objection.    The president of Notre Dame also weighed in about these criticisms of  Professor Barrett. Here is some of what he said in his letter to the  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee:         Your concern, as you expressed it, is that ``dogma lives       loudly in [Professor Barrett], and that is a concern when you       come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought       for years in this country.''        I am one in whose heart ``dogma lives loudly,'' as it has       for centuries in the lives of many Americans, some of whom       have given their lives in service to this nation. . . . It is       chilling to hear from a United States Senator that this might       now disqualify someone from service as a federal judge. I ask       you and your colleagues to respect those in whom ``dogma       lives loudly''--which is a condition we call faith.    A condition we call faith.         For the attempt to live such faith while one upholds the       law should command respect, not evoke concern.        Professor Barrett has made it clear that she would ``follow       unflinchingly'' all legal precedent and, in rare cases in       which her conscience would not allow her to do so, she would       recuse herself.    I will say that again:       . . . in rare cases in which her conscience would not allow       her to do so, she would recuse herself.        I can assure you that she is a person of integrity who acts       in accord with the principles she articulates.    Let me remind colleagues that article VI of the Constitution provides  that ``no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to  any office.'' That is the U.S. Constitution. According to the Founders,  this was done to ensure that ``the people may employ any wise or good  citizen in the execution of the various duties of the government.''   Professor Barrett of Notre Dame is just such a wise and good person,  and when the Senate confirms her to the Seventh Circuit, our judiciary  and our Nation will be better off.   I strongly support her nomination and would urge my colleagues to do  the same.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Sue  Minton, of London, KY, who passed away on September 27, 2017, at the  age of 67. Her passing is a deep loss to the community and to the local  newspaper, The Sentinel-Echo, where she worked for 41 years.   For those who knew her as a colleague and a friend, Sue will be  remembered for her dedication and her friendship. She was also a  beloved member of the Laurel County community, where she lived with her  husband, Dennis, and their daughter Denise.   Sue was always willing to help others, and she especially enjoyed  spending time with her grandchildren. Sue will be deeply missed by  friends, family, and the community. Elaine and I send our condolences  to them in their time of grief   The Sentinel-Echo recently published an article on Sue's life and  career. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Sentinel-Echo, Sept. 29, 2017]      Longtime Sentinel-Echo Lifestyles Editor Sue Minton Passes Away                             (By Nita Johnson)         As the news of long-time Sentinel Echo employee Sue       Minton's passing on Wednesday night spread throughout the       community, many people who knew and had worked with her were       shocked and saddened.        Minton began working at The Sentinel Echo in 1976 when the       newspapers were printed in the basement area of the current       building. She had many stories about the days when the       operation was run by Luke Keith, and then by Al Smith, who       sold the company to corporate ownership. She said she had       withstood the many sales of the company since that time, but       remained loyal to her job and co-workers throughout the 41       years of her employment.        Minton was the longest employee in the history of the       Sentinel Echo, coming in next to former business manager Judy       McCowan who retired after 39 years of employment. Minton and       McCowan became acquainted during their early years at the       newspaper and remained friends over the years, even after       McCowan retired.        McGowan said hearing of her long-time friend's death was       devastating.        ``I'm so heartbroken,'' McGowan said. ``We've been friends       for over 40 years. She seemed more like a sister.''        Minton and McCowan had a bowl of Cheerios every morning       around 9 a.m. in the employee breakroom while McCowan worked       for the newspaper. But McCowan's retirement ended that       morning routine.  [[Page S6869]]         ``She told me she hadn't eaten Cheerios since I left,''       McCowan said. ``But we still had lunch sometimes and I always       looked forward to seeing her. She was a true friend to me.       She was a good person and she was always there when you       needed her.''        ``Sue was not only a dedicated employee, she was also a       trusted friend,'' Managing Editor Denis House said. ``I've       known Sue since I first started working at The Sentinel in       1983. She used to call me her ``work Denis'' since her       husband was also named Dennis, although we spelled our names       differently. She knew this community and was a wealth of       information and knowledge. She loved watching her       grandchildren play sports. I will miss her.''        ``I was very blessed to have worked with Sue for a little       over a year,'' Regional Publisher Dave Eldridge said. ``She       was one of the classiest ladies I believe I have ever met, a       conscientious worker that strived to make The Sentinel the       very best it could be with every edition. Sue had a quick wit       and smile and I really think she knew everyone in Laurel       County, or so it seemed. Her years here made Sue a treasure       that we will never be able to replace, nor would we expect       to. MasterCard would refer to her as `priceless,' and she was       to us. She will be sorely missed and we pray for her family's       peace and comfort.''        Minton was known for her willingness to help others and her       dedication to her job. She was responsible for publishing the       obituaries, school news, business and church pages as well as       several monthly and special publications such as the Chamber       of Commerce newsletter and special sections for the World       Chicken Festival, Laurel County Fair, and Laurel County       Homecoming. She also participated in writing special stories       for the Silver magazine (now Southeast Kentucky NOW magazine)       and the annual veterans' tribute magazine. She won a first       place award in the only Kentucky Press Association contest       she ever entered for her in-depth story on the Bush fire       department.        Minton was well known in the community as well as with her       newspaper job. Raised in Breathitt County, she met her       husband, Dennis Minton, while attending Cumberland College in       Williamsburg. The two married and settled on the Minton farm       in eastern Laurel County in the Bush community, where they       raised their daughter, Denise Griebel.        A devoted mother, she was just as devoted to her two       grandchildren, Weston and Hailey. After working hours, she       was on the sidelines of ball games, cheering them on and       always providing that special love set aside between       grandmothers and grandchildren.        Tammy Mays worked at The Sentinel Echo for five years with       Minton, although she said she was also related to Minton's       husband.        ``Sue was just a good soul,'' Mays said. ``She wasn't just       a co-worker, she was family.''        That close tie continued between the two even after Mays       secured another job. But the two still communicated       frequently.        Minton was known among her coworkers for her smile and       dedication to producing the newspaper with timely and       community related news. She had called Laurel County home       since settling here and ensured that local news and people       were highlighted.
