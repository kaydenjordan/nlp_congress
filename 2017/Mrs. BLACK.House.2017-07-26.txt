 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to voice my concerns about this amendment.   I think everyone in this House has a lot of issues, as has already  been talked about, with the current modeling that is used by the  Congressional Budget Office, and I am certainly one of these people,  but this amendment is not the best way to accomplish our goal of  obtaining better information and analysis from CBO.   The CBO is an important organization that provides vital information  that Congress does need to make the best decisions. However, the  modeling and scoring methods they currently are using need to be  scrutinized, especially their behavioral predictions.   For example, in 2010, the CBO projected that 21 million Americans  would be covered by ObamaCare in 2016, when, in reality, less than 13  million Americans have actually obtained coverage. In fact, during  their scoring of the House Republican healthcare plan, CBO described  their own estimates, which rely on behavioral predictions, as extremely  uncertain.   That is why the House Budget Committee plans to hold a series of  hearings this fall on CBO to gain a better understanding of their  methods and how we can work to improve their ability to give Congress  better information, which we obviously need. As chairman of the Budget  Committee, I take this responsibility very seriously, and we will  approach these hearings in the pursuit of truth and accuracy so we can  make laws that better serve the American people.   We all realize that CBO has room for improvement, but this amendment  being offered tonight is not the best way to achieve that. Instead, we  need to have a deliberative discussion in the Budget Committee and  amongst everyone in the House, and I look forward to doing exactly that  in the coming weeks and months.
