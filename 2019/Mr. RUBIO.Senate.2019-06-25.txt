 Madam President, today I honor Summer Holtzhower,  the Sumter County Teacher of the Year from Wildwood Elementary School  in Wildwood, FL.   Summer, a 4th grade math and science teacher, just completed her  second year and designs her classroom activities to challenge her  students. She has a teaching activity called the Density Lab, where  students experiment with placing certain liquids in measuring cups and  hypothesize where they think the liquids will settle. Students then  test to see if their hypothesis are correct and answer Summer's  [[Page S4503]]  ``higher order thinking'' questions about their lab results.   Summer, who believes that one of her goals as an educator is to make  her students feel valued, does this by encouraging her students to  participate in days such as National Compliment Day. She believes that  events like this will allow her students to feel empowered and know  that they are capable of success in the future.   I offer my best wishes to Summer and look forward to hearing of her  continued success in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I honor Linda Howell, the  Taylor County Teacher of the Year from Taylor County High School in  Perry, FL.   Linda has a strong belief that every student can learn and succeed,  but it takes an entire community to support that success. Her peers  take note of her dedication to being a part of a team at her school.   A 1987 graduate from Florida State University, Linda previously  worked for Proctor and Gamble, helping to develop its employee  assistance program and was a member of its Foley Impact Team. She was  also previously a home educator and substitute teacher.   Linda has great experience as an educator, spending many years  cultivating an esteemed and diverse resume. Linda currently teaches 9th  and 10th grade English, and has spent 8 years with the Taylor County  Public School District. She also intermittently teaches at her local  Boys and Girls Club in its afterschool and summer programs.   I offer my best wishes to Linda and look forward to hearing of her  continued good work in the years to come.                            ____________________
