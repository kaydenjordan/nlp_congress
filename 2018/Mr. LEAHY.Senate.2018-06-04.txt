 Mr. President, I want to take a moment to pay tribute to  the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al  Hussein, who some here also know from his service as Jordan's Permanent  Representative to the United Nations and as Jordan's Ambassador to the  United States.   The High Commissioner has held his post since September 1, 2014, and  his term will end on August 31, 2018. He has carried out his  responsibilities with exceptional courage, compassion, commitment, and  even humor, qualities that are indispensable for any successful U.N.  High Commissioner. In so doing, he has been the target of relentless  attacks by government officials who abuse their authority by  manipulating their countries' electoral processes and security forces  to arrest, imprison, abuse, and even assassinate their critics, whether  independent journalists, members of political opposition parties, or  civil society activists.   In a speech delivered Tuesday at an international conference marking  the 25th anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,  adopted on June 25, 2003, in response to the atrocities committed in  the former Yugoslavia, the High Commissioner warned that human rights  are under siege in many parts of the world, including Europe.   He said, ``This anniversary could be the occasion for a polite  celebration of the achievements of my Office over the past two and a  half decades--and they are many. But today is not a time for soporific  complacency. Human rights are sorely under pressure around the world-- no longer a priority: a pariah. The legitimacy of human rights  principles is attacked. The practice of human rights norms is in  retreat. Here in Europe, ethno-populist parties are in the ascendant in  many countries--fueling hatred and scarring their societies with  deepening divisions.''   No one should be surprised by this. We see the consequences every  day, including in countries that are friends and allies of the United  States. Legitimate dissent is labeled ``terrorism.'' Those who defend  human rights are themselves maligned and targeted. Dictators are feted,  and their crimes are ignored. Xenophobia and racism are treated as  legitimate responses to domestic problems.   As the High Commissioner noted, it is incumbent on each of us to  defend human rights and to counter those who promote hatred and  intolerance. What is the alternative? Despotism. Fascism. Isolationism.  Forces and ideologies we have resisted and fought against for  generations. We owe it to past and future generations, as the High  Commissioner said, ``to stand by our achievements and the advances  which have been made.'' This is not only a moral imperative for  upholding the values our country stands for and preserving our  international reputation, but a pragmatic necessity for protecting our  interests at home and abroad.   I want to thank the High Commissioner for his extraordinary efforts  during the past 4 extremely challenging years. He has been a tireless,  principled defender of universal human rights,  [[Page S2962]]  and in doing so, he has set a high bar for those who follow in his  footsteps.   I ask unanimous consent that the High Commissioner's remarks be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Statement by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al         Hussein on the 25th Anniversary of the Vienna Declaration       Minister Kneissl.      Excellencies, Colleagues, Friends.        Twenty five years ago, it was here, in this city of       confluence and cultural connection that the Vienna       Declaration and Programme of Action was adopted--and with its       crucial description of human rights as ``universal,       indivisible, interdependent and interrelated'', cut through       the artificial division of civil and political rights from       rights that are cultural, economic and social.        The Cold War had ended, and the first words of the preamble       marked a great hope for a new era, with interdependent       countries engaging in a common approach to the causes of       human suffering:        ``Considering that the promotion and protection of human       rights is a matter of priority for the international       community.''        It was here that the world unanimously reaffirmed that       every refugee from persecution is entitled to asylum, and       called for effective protection for all those who are       compelled to become migrants.        It was here that States urged immediate and strong measures       to combat racism, xenophobia and religious hatred, and to       ensure participation by the poorest people in decision-      making.        It was here in Vienna that States recommended the creation       of the mandate which I am honoured to occupy: the UN High       Commissioner for Human Rights.        But today we seem to be headed in another direction.        Backwards. To a landscape of increasingly strident, zero-      sum nationalism, where the jealously guarded short-term       interests of individual leaders outweigh the search for       solutions to our common ills. Backwards, to an era of       contempt for the rights of people who have been forced to       flee their homes, because the threats they face there are       more dangerous even than the perils of their voyage.        Backwards, to a time of proxy regional and global warfare--      a time when military operations could deliberately target       civilians and civilian sites such as hospitals, and chemical       gases were openly used for military purposes.        Backwards, to an era when racists and xenophobes       deliberately enflamed hatred and discrimination among the       public, while carefully cloaking themselves in the guise of       democracy and the rule of law.        Backwards, to an era when women were not permitted to       control their own choices and their own bodies. An era when       criticism was criminalised, and human rights activism brought       jail--or worse.        So this anniversary could be the occasion for a polite       celebration of the achievements of my Office over the past       two and a half decades--and they are many. But today is not a       time for soporific complacency. Human rights are sorely under       pressure around the world--no longer a priority: a pariah.       The legitimacy of human rights principles is attacked. The       practise of human rights norms is in retreat. Here in Europe,       ethno-populist parties are in the ascendant in many       countries--fuelling hatred and scarring their societies with       deepening divisions.        Where these parties have achieved power, they have sought       to undermine the independence of the judiciary and silence       many critical voices in the independent media and civil       society. They have propagated distorted and false views of       migrants and human rights activists. Almost everywhere,       across Europe the hatred they direct at migrants has       infiltrated the mainstream parties and skewed the political       landscape towards greater violence and suffering.        In this country--which more than most should be aware of       the dangers of ethnically divisive rhetoric, given the       historical role of Karl Lueger--false and incendiary       statements have been recently made which are fundamentally at       odds with the Vienna Declaration.        Minister Kneissl, Excellencies,        As Viktor Frankl so often wrote, it is compassion, and       contribution to the lives of others, which form the anchor of       an honourable life. And the way to honour the Vienna       Declaration and Programme of Action is to act on it. Human       rights are not just words to be nodded at sagely at       anniversaries. They are meant, above all, to be put into       practice, and anchored especially in the daily experiences of       the poorest and most marginalised people--such as those who       flee the destruction of their hopes by conflict and       deprivation.        There will be no peace for any country until there is       respect, and justice. There will be no sustainable prosperity       unless all can benefit. Human equality and dignity are the       path towards peace in the world: the path of real patriotism,       building societies grounded in harmony, not divisiveness and       hate.        So it is time to stand up for what the Vienna Declaration       truly represents.        We need to use this anniversary to begin to mobilize a much       broader community to defend human rights with our fierce, and       passionate commitment. We need to make clear the vital, life-      saving importance of human rights for the daily lives and       global future of our fellow human beings.        Many of us do still have space to voice our concerns. We       need to stand by our achievements and the advances which have       been made.        We need to push back against the haters, the destroyers,       the isolationists and ethno-nationalists.        We need to move forward, defiantly, to ensure that those       indivisible, universal, interdependent and interrelated       rights are able to build on each other to shape a world of       well-being and safety.        There is no time to lose. Let this be a turning point, so       that the Vienna Declaration can stand proud--not as a       decaying museum piece, but as the flag-bearer for a resurgent       movement to build peace and progress.        Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to speak about a subject that other  Senators should be aware of.   Many Members of Congress have visited the Philippines, a country with  which we share a long history of strategic, economic, cultural, and  other interests. We also know that, for many years, the Philippine  Government has been fighting an extremist insurgency in Mindanao. The  United States has been supporting the Philippine Government in that  effort.   According to information I have received, on February 21, 2018, the  Philippines State Prosecutor filed a legal petition to declare over 600  persons as ``terrorists,'' alleging that they are members of the  Communist party of the Philippines, CPP, and the New Peoples Army, NPA,  two groups designated by the United States as foreign terrorist  organizations. The list was published after the collapse of the peace  negotiations between CPP-NPA and the Philippine Government last year.   By itself, that might not be objectionable. There are terrorists in  the Philippines. The problem with this ``terrorist list'' is that the  government is apparently using it to persecute people who have nothing  to do with terrorism, but who have engaged in legitimate, peaceful  dissent and protests in opposition to government policies that threaten  their way of life.   The list includes a number of indigenous rights defenders who, as far  as I am aware, are not at all affiliated with the CPP-NPA. These  individuals are known and respected nationally and internationally for  their consistent, lawful efforts to protect human rights for the most  vulnerable and marginalized populations in the Philippines. By  criminalizing their work and including these activists on an official  terrorist list, the administration of President Duterte is endangering  the lives of these and other human rights defenders and community  leaders. It is a misuse of the justice system to deny their rights to  free expression, association, and assembly--rights we take for granted  and that are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   The affected individuals are now subject to warrantless arrests,  surveillance, and freezing of assets. Their lives and the lives of  their families are in danger. Human Rights Watch has described the  petition as ``a virtual government hit list,'' noting the ``long  history in the Philippines of state security forces and pro-government  militias assassinating those labeled as NPA members or supporters.'' In  March 2018 alone, there were reportedly at least three cases of  extrajudicial killings of indigenous leaders, all known for their work  to organize communities for the protection of indigenous lands.   Two of the more high-profile targeted activists, Joan Carling and  Victoria Tauli Corpuz, were fortunate to have been out of the country  when the list was published. Carling is an indigenous activist from the  Cordillera region in the Philippines. She has been working on  indigenous issues at the grassroots and international levels for more  than 20 years. Ms. Carling has been elected twice as the Secretary  General of the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact, AIPP, representing AIPP's  47 member-organizations in 14 countries. She was appointed by the U.N.  Economic and Social Council as an indigenous expert-member of the U.N.  Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues for 2014-16.   Victoria Tauli Corpuz was appointed as the U.N. Special Rapporteur on  the rights of indigenous peoples by the U.N. Human Rights Council in  2014. She is an indigenous leader from the  [[Page S2963]]  Kankana-ey Igorot people of the Cordillera region in the Philippines.  As an indigenous activist, she has worked for over three decades to  protect indigenous rights and as an advocate for women's rights.   As a consequence of the Duterte administration's action, these women  suddenly have no home to return to. They cannot risk going back to the  Philippines. Still, they are fortunate compared to those targeted  leaders who remain in the country. The terrorist list also includes  members of indigenous communities in Mindanao who were displaced from  their lands in President Duterte's antiterrorism sweep and now live  precariously in evacuation camps.   Much of this reportedly has to do with powerful business interests in  collusion with corrupt officials in the government. In the recent past,  the Philippine Government has fast-tracked priority infrastructure  development projects. Some of these projects are reportedly planned to  be built on ancestral indigenous lands, despite opposition from  indigenous communities and the failure to secure indigenous peoples'  free, prior, and informed consent as required by Philippine law and as  contained in the 2007 U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous  Peoples. Indigenous leaders have objected to these projects, insisting  that the government respect their rights and obtain their consent for  projects that affect them.   The United States has long supported efforts of the Philippine  Government and civil society to unlock the country's potential to  achieve inclusive, sustainable economic growth. As ranking member of  the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of State and Foreign  Operations, I have supported programs to help the Philippines combat  poverty, strengthen democratic institutions, enhance maritime security,  and protect the rights of its people.   Criminalizing these indigenous rights defenders would reverse  progress the country has made and threaten the functioning of civil  society which is fundamental to any democracy. Joan Carling, Victoria  Tauli Corpuz, and other indigenous leaders and activists who from all  indications are guilty of nothing more than defending their territories  and cultures do not belong on a ``terrorist'' list. Instead, the  government should be defending their rights and protecting their safety  and the safety of other indigenous leaders and human rights activists.   Our own government, the Departments of State and Defense and the U.S.  Agency for International Development, as well as international  financial institutions we support, should ensure that development  activities are carried out in accordance with the rights of local  communities, including the right of indigenous peoples to free, prior,  and informed consent.   We all oppose terrorism wherever it occurs, but our collective  approach to preventing terrorism has too often made the problem worse,  especially when the result is the curtailment of basic freedoms.  Labeling as ``terrorists'' political opponents or civil society  activists who do not advocate or engage in violence and who, to the  contrary, have been threatened and attacked for defending their rights  is one example of this, and it is an increasingly common tactic of  governments; yet there are few if any ways more likely to cause people  to resort to violence than by misusing government power to suppress  legitimate dissent. Far from stopping terrorism, adopting such abusive  tactics sets back our collective efforts against terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. President, many of us here are familiar with the  International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known as CICIG.  The U.S. Congress and Republican and Democratic administrations have  supported it for years, and with few exceptions, it is strongly  supported by the Guatemalan people. That is because CICIG, working  closely with the Office of the Attorney General, has proven what many  Guatemalans thought impossible, that even the most powerful government  officials who commit major crimes believing they are above the law can  be brought to justice.   CICIG was created in December 2006, when the United Nations and  Guatemala signed a treaty-level agreement setting up CICIG as an  independent body to support the Office of the Attorney General, the  National Civilian Police, and other Guatemalan Government institutions  in the investigation and prosecution of particularly sensitive and  difficult cases. I vividly remember that time, when impunity for even  the worst crimes was a virtual certainty in Guatemala.   During more than 35 years of internal armed conflict an estimated  200,000 Guatemalans, mostly rural Mayan villagers, were murdered--the  vast majority by the army. Many were rounded up and never seen or heard  from again. Thanks largely to the efforts of the Guatemala Forensic  Anthropology Foundation, the tortured remains of many hundreds have  been found in unmarked mass graves, some on former military bases.  Hardly anyone has been punished for those atrocities, and past attempts  to investigate and prosecute some of the individuals responsible were  stymied.   Even in the years since that dark period, almost anyone, especially  those in positions of authority, got away with anything, including  assassinations and robbing the public treasury. Today, few crimes  involving official corruption and violations of human rights are  prosecuted, and even fewer result in conviction and punishment.   But those that have been credibly investigated and brought to trial  are due to the courageous efforts of CICIG and its commissioner, Ivan  Velasquez, a respected Colombian jurist, and the recently retired  attorney general, Thelma Aldana, who carried on the tradition of  independence and integrity established by her predecessor, Claudia Paz  y Paz. These prosecutors have given hope not only to victims who long  ago lost faith in Guatemala's dysfunctional justice system, but also to  many members of the business community who recognize that, without an  independent judiciary and confidence that the rule of law will be  enforced, Guatemala will never attract the foreign investment it needs  to develop.   Predictably and throughout its history, CICIG has come under attack  from those who have enriched themselves at public expense and escaped  justice, including for heinous crimes. Fearing prosecution, they have  sought to challenge CICIG's legitimacy and impugned the character and  conduct of its commissioner. Each time, CICIG has survived, thanks to  the support of the international community.   Today, CICIG is once again being attacked, including by some senior  officials, who have sought to exploit factual misrepresentations,  including those echoed in the Guatemalan and U.S. media, about a  troubling case involving members of a Russian family who entered  Guatemala with fraudulent passports. This has even resulted in a  portion of the funds appropriated by Congress for CICIG to be  temporarily blocked from disbursement.   Without recounting the bizarre facts of that case, suffice it to say  that not a shred of credible evidence has been presented to support the  allegations of abuse of authority leveled at CICIG and in particular at  Commissioner Velasquez. That, however, does not appear to matter to  those who have long sought an excuse to replace Velasquez with someone  who is susceptible to intimidation. The Bitkov case, which has all the  makings of a made for TV tragedy, should be appropriately resolved in  the Guatemalan courts. The family should be treated justly and  humanely. But CICIG is not the problem.   It is important to reiterate what the Guatemalan people know: CICIG  is an absolutely essential institution that has enabled the office of  the attorney general to break through the wall of impunity in ways that  would never have been possible without CICIG's support. It is that  simple. Without CICIG, there is no reason to believe that any case  involving high-ranking officials or members of organized crime networks  with the ability to intimidate and bribe prosecutors and judges and  threaten or assassinate witnesses will be brought to justice.   It is also a fact that CICIG is only as effective as its commissioner  and that, while even those who want to rein in CICIG publicly claim to  support it, they make little secret of their goal to get rid of  Velasquez.  [[Page S2964]]    Commissioner Velasquez is an experienced, courageous jurist with  integrity. That is why he was hired for the job, and by all  indications, he is guilty of nothing more than doing the job he was  hired to do. The more he does so, the more those who fear prosecution  will try to find ways to stop him. It is therefore very important at  this time that the international community, including the United  States, reaffirms its support for Velasquez and the fight against  corruption and impunity in Guatemala.   It is noteworthy that the former attorney general has consistently  voiced her support for Velasquez because, if anyone should know if  there is a grain of truth to the allegations against him, it would be  her. She knows from experience the motivations of those who are aligned  against CICIG because they have also tried to intimidate her.   In order for CICIG and Commissioner Velasquez to effectively carry  out CICIG's mandate through the reminder of its current term that ends  in September 2019, he needs the support of the Guatemalan Government,  the United Nations, the United States, and other governments that  support justice in Guatemala. I commend the Department of State and  U.S. Ambassador Arreaga for recognizing what is at stake and for  seeking ways to ensure that CICIG and Commissioner Velasquez can carry  out their responsibilities transparently and effectively. I also know  that a majority of Democrats and Republicans respect Commissioner  Velasquez and want CICIG to receive the funds it needs. I am confident  that the funds will be released, that CICIG and the role of the  Commissioner will be enhanced, and that the cause of justice for the  Guatemalan people will be served.                            ____________________
