 Madam Speaker, the American people are sick and tired of  our porous borders and of the inability of Washington to get things  done.   Every day that we fail to secure these borders, more drug runners,  human traffickers, and violent criminals enter our communities. It is  time we quit playing politics and give the American people what they  want and what they voted for.   Although President Trump has certainly pushed the topic into the  spotlight, the idea of a wall is nothing new. We have been talking  about a wall for decades. This is not a work in progress. This is a  failure of leadership.   Presidents, Republican and Democratic alike, have failed to secure  our border. It is time for the President to take emergency action. And  make no mistake: Our border security absolutely constitutes a national  emergency.   Every day, our brave soldiers are breaking their backs to support our  national security across the globe, yet we can't secure our own country  here at home. If you were to ask any of them what the priority in this  Nation is, I think you would receive resounding support for a border  wall and border security.   We simply cannot continue to operate as we have. The time has come  for our President to take decisive action, and I urge him do everything  in his power to build this wall.                            ____________________
