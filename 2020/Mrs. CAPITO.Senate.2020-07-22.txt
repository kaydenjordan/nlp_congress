 Mr. President, I rise to recognize Technical  Sergeant Ralph H. Ray, who was a dedicated West Virginia serviceman in  our U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. T SGT Ralph H. Ray is  being honored by the renaming of a bridge on U.S. Route 60 that spans  the Greenbrier River in his native Greenbrier County, WV.   T SGT Ralph H. Ray graduated from Frankford High School at the age of  17 in 1940. He left his home in West Virginia to complete his enlisted  physical for the U.S. Army Corps on January 7, 1943, and subsequently  earned the rank of technical sergeant. He earned his airplane mechanic  diploma at the Ford Factory in Michigan the spring of 1943 and then  completed gunnery school in Laredo, TX.   During his service, T SGT Ralph H. Ray was assigned to a top-notch  flight crew with whom he trained for 3 months. He and his crew traveled  to Trinidad, Brazil, Africa, Morocco, and Wales before reaching the  Tibenham Base in East England. While serving as a flight engineer  during World War II, he and his crew flew 30 successful missions before  returning to the United States and spending the last 10 months of his  enlistment at the Air Transport Corps in Miami, FL. This dedicated and  diverse military service is certainly worthy of admiration.   After his release from the U.S. Army Air Corps, T SGT Ralph H. Ray  worked as an airplane mechanic for Bollinger Airport in Davis Creek,  WV, and while there, he earned his civilian pilot's license. T SGT  Ralph H. Ray began working as a chemical technician for Westvaco in  South Charleston, WV, in 1948. He married his wife Mary Madeline Hudson  on April 16, 1948, and established a beautiful and loving family with  four daughters: Valerie Ann Lyons, Angela Sue Ray, Verna Ray-Breaux,  and Anita Ray-Kirk.   T SGT Ralph H. Ray retired in 1984 and passed away on August 8, 2019.  It is fitting that an enduring monument will be established to  commemorate Technical Sergeant Ray and his contributions to our State  and our country. As resolved by legislature of West Virginia, the  locally known Caldwell Bridge, will henceforth be named the ``U.S. Army  Air Corps T SGT Ralph H. Ray Memorial Bridge.'' I hope it provokes  thought and appreciation for all of our military heroes and may the  bridge be an enduring reminder of the life of dedicated serviceman,  husband, father, and lifelong West Virginian.                            ____________________
