 Madam Speaker, lung cancer is the deadliest  form of cancer in the United States, yet only 6 percent of people  eligible get screened, and that number decreases among underserved  populations.   Prevention and early detection are the best protections against lung  cancer. That is why we have introduced the Increasing Access to Lung  Cancer Screening Act. This bill expands coverage for and improves  access to lung cancer screening. It also provides new coverage for  tobacco cessation, as smoking is a major cause of lung cancer.   Our bill builds on the work of Buffalo's Roswell Park Comprehensive  Cancer Center. I ask my colleagues to join me and Representative Castor  in supporting this legislation that will enhance the goals set through  the President's Cancer Moonshot to save lives and end cancer as we know  it.                            ____________________
