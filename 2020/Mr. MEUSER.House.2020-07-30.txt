 Mr. Speaker, Tuesday's House Judiciary hearing was one of  the most disgraceful events I and millions of Americans have witnessed  in this Congress. No election or apparent hatred of any person should  spark behavior that is beneath this office.   As one of my constituents said, ``all traditional decorum has been  lost.'' The Attorney General of the United States was accused by  Democrat Members of using Federal force to quell the unrest in Portland  for the purpose of providing footage for campaign ads; meanwhile,  refusing to condemn attacks to a Federal courthouse.   For more than 60 days, Portland had experienced violent protests, and  now today's Democrats are rationalizing the situation by blaming the  Federal law enforcement officials for destruction which had been caused  weeks before their arrival.   We have come to expect this level of deliberate mischaracterization  from the media, but from Members? How are we not united in denouncing  violence in our streets? How are we not united in providing resources  to safely open our schools and restart our economy and find a vaccine?  How are we not united in passing an effective phase 4 relief package  focused on solving problems, not prolonging them through November 3rd?                            ____________________
