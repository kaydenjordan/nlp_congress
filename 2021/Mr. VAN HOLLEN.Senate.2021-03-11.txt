 Madam President, I rise today to voice my support for  the President's nominee for Attorney General, Judge Merrick Garland,  who is not only a fellow Marylander, but somebody I have known  personally for many years. And I know that President Biden has picked a  nominee with impeccable credentials and unimpeachable character. His  experience stretches from the halls of the Justice Department to the  chambers of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit, and he embodies the decency, the impartiality, and the  commitment to justice that our Nation deserves as the Attorney General  of the United States. I am confident that Judge Garland will serve  admirably and faithfully as the next Attorney General.   The Nation already knows Merrick Garland because of his Supreme Court  nomination and as the former Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia Circuit, where he earned a reputation as one of  our Nation's finest and fairest jurists. But his tenure on the D.C.  Circuit was just the most recent achievement in a life dedicated to  serving the rule of law. After excelling at law school, Judge Garland  clerked for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and then for the  Supreme Court. He then rose through the ranks of a prominent law firm  before jumping back into public service feet-first as a Federal  prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office during the administration of  President George Herbert Walker Bush and then later served as the  Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Department of  Justice.   As a senior DOJ official, Judge Garland was tasked with overseeing  the case of the Oklahoma City bombing, one of the deadliest domestic  terrorist attacks in American history. It left 168 Americans dead and  hundreds more injured. Merrick Garland brought a steady hand to an  operation that involved massive amounts of evidence, pressure from the  public, and a large team with diverse skills and backgrounds. With  fidelity to the law and meticulous attention to detail and unrelenting  focus, Merrick Garland helped bring the bomber, Timothy McVeigh, to  justice. He has called this case the most important thing he has done  in his life.   Mr. Chairman, ranking member, and committee members, we are going to  need his experience as we once again confront the rise of domestic  terrorism, particularly in the wake of the horrific events of January  6. And the next Attorney General must not only take on the rise of  White supremacists and radical militia groups, but also ensure that  justice is rendered equally and fairly by promoting and ensuring racial  equity, rooting out discrimination in our criminal justice system,  addressing police reform, and ensuring that we don't see a concerted  effort to limit people's citizens' right to vote in the United States  of America. As Justice Garland has himself stated, ensuring the rule of  law and making real the promise of equal justice under the law are  ``the great principles upon which the Department of Justice was founded  and for which it must always stand.'' Judge Garland has spent his  career doing both, and I have no doubt he will honor that tradition as  Attorney General.   During Judge Garland's confirmation hearing his commitment to public  service and ensuring equal justice were on display. He shared that he  felt an obligation to payback our country for protecting and welcoming  his grandparents who fled to the United States to escape anti-Semitism  and persecution. He stated that serving as an Attorney General that  combats injustice and discrimination would be ``the highest, best use  of my own set of skills.''   While his professional experiences have prepared him for this job, it  is his character that makes him right for this moment. Should he be  confirmed, Judge Garland will be charged with restoring credibility and  independence to the Department of Justice, making it clear that the  Department is not the political instrument of the White House. I know  Merrick Garland is up to  [[Page S1499]]  the task. The lengthy list of testimonials speaking to his fairness and  sound judgement span the political spectrum. He is respected by  lawmakers, scholars, and lawyers of every legal persuasion and  political philosophy. And on a personal note, I can attest to the fact  that his brilliance is matched by his kindness. His many achievements  have never gone to his head. He has always stayed humble and treated  everyone with respect.   It is for these reasons and many more that I was honored to vote for  the President's nominee to serve as the next Attorney General of the  United States, Judge Merrick Garland.                            ____________________     Madam President, now is the time to take substantive  action to combat climate change, address environmental justice, and  help clean up the Chesapeake Bay. To help address these critical  issues, President Biden nominated Michael Regan to be Administrator of  the Environmental Protection Agency.   Michael Regan most recently served as secretary of the North Carolina  Department of Environmental Quality. During that time, Mr. Regan led  the implementation of North Carolina's Executive Order 80, a landmark  effort to address climate change's impact and transition the State's  energy economy. Mr. Regan also created North Carolina's first  Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Board to address societal  disparities exacerbated by environmental issues during his tenure as  secretary.   Mr. Regan has a strong record of bipartisanship, having previously  served at the EPA under both Democratic and Republican Presidents. He  is committed to rebuilding EPA's Federal workforce, which saw record  departures during the Trump administration. During the Trump  administration, we saw the EPA workforce shrink to levels not seen  since the Reagan administration, and those who resigned or retired  include some of the Agency's most experienced scientific veterans, as  well as young environmental experts who traditionally would have  replaced them, causing a brain drain at the EPA. Maryland is home to  many of those Federal employees, and I look forward to working with Mr.  Regan to rebuild the civil servant backbone of the EPA.   One of EPA's most critical roles for the State of Maryland is its  role in the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay. We are at a very critical  junction in the implementation of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement and our  mutual goal of clean water in the Chesapeake Bay by 2025. On December  29, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the  Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load--TMDL--a historic and  comprehensive agreement that includes accountability features to  restore clean water in the seven jurisdictions within the Chesapeake  Bay watershed. The agreement is a national and indeed international  model for watershed restoration. It sets limits for pollution that  equate to a 25-percent reduction in nitrogen, 24-percent reduction in  phosphorous, and 20-percent reduction in sediment. As the Bay TMDL  states, ``The TMDL is designed to ensure that all pollution control  measures needed to fully restore the Bay and its tidal rivers are in  place by 2025[.]''   I look forward to working with Mr. Regan to make sure that EPA uses  every tool available to them, including enforcement measures when  necessary, to make sure that all jurisdictions are on track for our  mutual goal of clean water in the Chesapeake Bay by 2025.   Furthermore, I am pleased that Mr. Regan has indicated that he will  reconstituting the position of Senior Advisor to the Administrator of  the EPA for the Chesapeake Bay.   I believe that Michael Regan is a strong choice to lead us into a new  era at the EPA. For these reasons, I supported Michael Regan's  nomination as the Administrator of the EPA.                            ____________________
