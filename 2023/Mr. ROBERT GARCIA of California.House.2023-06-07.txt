 Mr. Speaker, the House library is  open.   I rise to commemorate the start of Pride Month by honoring the one  and only queen of drag, RuPaul. An artist, a philanthropist, and a  barrier breaker, RuPaul Charles has become an American phenomenon and  an icon. Nobody has more charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent than  RuPaul Charles.   Ru's career launched as a drag performer in New York, and then as a  successful pop artist, releasing his first hit album, ``Supermodel of  the World.'' In total, he has released 15 studio albums.   RuPaul also became the first gay Black man to host his own talk show,  ``The RuPaul Show.'' He is most known, of course, for his multi-Emmy- award winning show, ``RuPaul's Drag Race.''   ``RuPaul's Drag Race,'' and its many domestic and international spin- offs, has put drag in the global spotlight. The show has helped lunch  and uplift the careers of thousands of drag queens and artists. But  more importantly, the show has served as a critical space to discuss  issues around inclusion, trans rights, mental health, and self-worth.   This message couldn't be more important as the LGBTQ+ community  continues to fight for equality and acceptance. The world needs more  love and, yes, more RuPaul. I thank RuPaul Charles for his years of  leadership in our community and his activism.   This Pride Season, as we recommit to celebrating diversity,  difference, and self-love, we must always remember what RuPaul so  famously says: ``If you can't love yourself, how the hell are you going  to love somebody else?''                            ____________________
