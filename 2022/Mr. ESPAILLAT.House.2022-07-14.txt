 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of the life and  legacy of Harlem's very own Dr. May Edward Chinn, a pioneer Black  female physician in New York City.   Dr. Chinn was the first Black woman to graduate from Bellevue  Hospital's Medical College in 1926, which is now known as New York  University's Grossman School of Medicine. She is also the first Black  woman to complete an internship at Harlem Hospital in 1928.   Dr. Chinn dedicated her life to serving others. Through her  determination and hard work, she helped advance medical treatments for  cancer screening that continue to save lives today.   Like many of her predecessors, Dr. Chinn persisted and persevered. I  am grateful to the Harlem Cultural Archives for its research to share  this story, and I am honored to share the story of one of Harlem's gems  so that her work does not go unnoticed and her legacy does not remain  anonymous.                            ____________________
