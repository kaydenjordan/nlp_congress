 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  work of a committee in western New York dedicated to constructing the  only monument in the Nation honoring African Americans who served in  the United States military during times of war. This long-overdue  tribute acknowledges the selfless sacrifice of our veterans, many of  whom served our Nation while being denied equal rights at home.   The African American Veterans Monument, to be located in the Buffalo  and Erie County Military Park, will feature 12 illuminated black  pillars, representing U.S. military conflicts, and is designed to give  visitors an experience that is reflective, educational, and  inspirational.   The monument is being designed by a local, young, talented artist,  Jonathan Casey. I have asked the Smithsonian National Museum of African  American History and Culture to collaborate with local project leaders  on this first-in-the-Nation African American Veterans Memorial.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the veterans, the artist, and New York State  [[Page H7171]]  Assemblywoman Crystal Peoples-Stokes, who have dedicated themselves to  making this monument a reality. It is a long-overdue recognition of  those who served proudly and courageously.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, health savings accounts, while  they may help people manage their healthcare costs marginally, the sad  truth is this legislation will do nothing--nothing--to lower healthcare  costs and to improve healthcare quality.   The legislation also does nothing--nothing--to protect people with  preexisting conditions, and 40 percent of Americans between the ages of  50 and 64\1/2\ have preexisting conditions.   The legislation before us will increase the deficit by tens of  billions of dollars and will threaten the long-term viability of  Medicare and Social Security.   Mr. Speaker, because of recent actions by the Trump Justice  Department and House Republicans, millions of Americans between the  ages of 50 and 64\1/2\ who buy their health insurance on the individual  market are about to get clobbered with double-digit multiyear health  insurance premium increases, and this Congress is doing nothing-- nothing--to help. This population needs the protection of Medicare now.   Medicare at 50 would allow people to buy Medicare as their health  insurance. Medicare is Affordable Care Act compliant, with essential  benefits, has high patient satisfaction ratings, has full access to  primary care and physician specialists, and always, always covers  preexisting conditions. Medicare at 50 also is thousands of dollars  cheaper when compared with the gold plan on the individual market.   Mr. Speaker, Medicare is the best public option that already exists,  and the best public option that already exists should be available to  millions of Americans ages 50 to 64\1/2\.
