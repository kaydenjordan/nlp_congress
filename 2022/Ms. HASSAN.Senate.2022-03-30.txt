 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Kateryna  Ridley of Dover as March's Granite Stater of the Month. Kateryna, who  is originally from Ukraine, is spearheading efforts in Dover to support  her home country after Putin's unconscionable invasion of Ukraine.   As Kateryna watched Russia's attack, she agonized over whether her  friends and family in Ukraine were safe or had access to essential  goods. As she continued to receive worrying calls from friends and  family, she decided that she needed to take action to help her  Ukrainian community.   Kateryna's effort started with a trip to the store to buy blue and  yellow paint, along with wood and other supplies that she used to  create small Ukrainian flags. She went on to share her creations over  social media, and within 4 days, she received 100 orders from people  who were eager to show their support for Ukraine. Today, the total  number of orders is well over 300, and Kateryna is donating her profits  to help get Ukrainians everyday necessities.   Kateryna also spearheaded efforts to collect donations such as  medical supplies, first aid, personal hygiene supplies, and baby items  to send to Ukraine. She coordinated with Dover community leaders to  organize a donation drive for Ukraine at a recent rally, and she was  overjoyed with the response from her community as countless neighbors  donated goods and came up to her to express their support and sympathy  for the people of Ukraine.   During a time of immense duress--worrying for the safety of her  family and friends back at home--Kateryna has found a way to make a  real difference. From working in her woodshop for hours, to organizing  donations of essential goods to Ukraine, Kateryna is working hard from  the Granite State to reach her Ukrainian community during their time of  need. I commend her for her efforts and for her spirit, which reflects  the best of our State.   Kateryna is one of many Granite Staters, representing our Live Free  or Die State, who is stepping up to support Ukrainians amid Putin's  horrific war. As the U.S. and our allies continue to impose crippling  sanctions on Russia and send military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine,  individual efforts from people like Kateryna are making a tangible  difference in Ukrainians' lives. They are showing Ukrainians and the  world that New Hampshire--and the United States--stands with them, for  their freedom and democracy.                            ____________________
