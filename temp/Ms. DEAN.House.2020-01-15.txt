 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent and  friend, June Parkinson. June passed away on January 4 at the age of 64.   June was a loving wife, mother, and grandmother, a gifted artist and  special education teacher, and a true community leader. She devoted her  life in  [[Page H251]]  service to others sharing her talents for the betterment of us all.   June was a longtime committee-person of the Greater Glenside  Patriotic Association and chairperson of the Glenside Fourth of July  Parade. The annual parade is the longest continuous Independence Day  parade in America and the pride of our hometown of Glenside. June made  it her mission each year to ensure this treasured tradition continued.   June was an environmental activist best remembered for spearheading  the yearly Earth Day clean-up of Keswick Avenue.   Even though June was born in Boston and was a Red Sox fan, all of us  Phillies fans in Glenside embraced and thanked her for her kind heart,  her giving spirit, and her dedication to community.   I join June's friends, family, and the wider Glenside community in  mourning her loss. I am thankful for June's example of quiet acts of  service, and I am better for having known June.                            ____________________
