 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Congressman Marshall's  bill coming up today.   I rise, Mr. Speaker, in support of H.R. 4675, the Low-Dose Radiation  Research Act of 2018. This legislation authorizes a research program on  the health effects of low-dose radiation within the Department of  Energy's Office of Science.   Currently, key functions of the United States nuclear and medical  industries are guided by assumption-based radiation dose limits and  protections. In order to best serve our Nation's energy, medical, and  defense needs, we need foundational research in radiology and biology  to directly define the impact of low doses of radiation. The United  States should not rely on a ``best approximation'' when it comes to our  nuclear regulatory policies.   Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity to ensure that we as a  nation are doing everything we can to make certain that the  regulations, the guidelines, and the protections that we put in place  are grounded in sound science.   Again, I want to thank Congressman Marshall for introducing this  important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Hultgren for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4377, the Accelerating  American Leadership in Science Act of 2018.   This legislation authorizes very important upgrades to DOE photon and  neutron sources at two national labs. In addition, it funds the  construction of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility, the first  international high-energy physics facility located in the United States  of America.   Over 1,000 scientists from 30 countries are already collaborating on  this project. Let me repeat that: over 1,000 scientists from 30  countries are already collaborating on this very important project.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank my colleague, Congressman Hultgren, for  introducing this important legislation and for his continued support of  the national labs.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4378) to direct the Secretary of Energy to carry out the  construction of a versatile reactor-based fast neutron source, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4378         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. SPENDING LIMITATION.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act, and       this Act and such amendments shall be carried out using       amounts otherwise available for such purpose.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4378, the bill  now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4378, the Nuclear Energy  Research Infrastructure Act of 2018.   Over the past 3 years, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee  has held hearings, met with stakeholders, and worked extensively with  our colleagues in the Senate to draft the Nuclear Energy Innovation  Capabilities Act, the precursor to today's bill.   This comprehensive, bipartisan authorization bill directed the  Department of Energy--DOE--to invest in supercomputing capabilities,  created a framework for DOE to partner with the private sector to host  prototype development for advanced reactors, and laid out a clear  timeline and parameters for the DOE to build that research reactor.   Mr. Speaker, this bill passed the House three times last Congress,  and passed the House again in January as a part of H.R. 589, known as  the DOE Research and Innovation Act.   The research reactor, or Versatile Neutron Source, authorized in that  bill, Mr. Speaker, is crucial for the development of advanced reactor  designs, materials, and nuclear fuels. This type of research requires  access to fast neutrons, which are currently only available for  civilian research in Russia.                                time  1700    While modeling and simulation can accelerate R&D, nuclear energy  research must be validated through a physical source, Mr. Speaker, like  a reactor. The bill which we will consider today, H.R. 4378, the  Nuclear Energy Research Infrastructure Act, authorizes specific funding  from within the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy for the construction of  that versatile neutron source.  [[Page H1095]]    Building this open-access user facility in the DOE national lab  system will facilitate nuclear energy research in the United States.  The access to fast neutrons that this reactor provides can support  private sector development of the next generation materials and fuels  needed for advanced nuclear reactor technology.   The versatile neutron source will also enable the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission to verify data on new fuels, materials, and designs more  efficiently, which will expedite regulatory approval for those advanced  nuclear reactors. Without this user facility, Mr. Speaker, this  research simply will not take place, and we cannot afford to lose the  ability to develop an innovative nuclear technology right here at home.   This bill will also help maintain America's capability to influence  security and proliferation standards around the world by maintaining  cutting-edge nuclear science.   Mr. Speaker, as more developing nations look to nuclear energy to  grow their economies, our role in protecting nuclear technology grows.  By building this user facility, we will fortify the U.S. commitment to  safely advancing nuclear energy. H.R. 4378 is a commonsense bill. It  will maintain American leadership in nuclear power.   I want to thank Ranking Member Johnson and Chairman Smith for  cosponsoring this important legislation and for their leadership in  advocating for nuclear energy research and development. I am very  grateful for the opportunity to work with my fellow Texans to guide  research that will keep America not only safe, but globally  competitive.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the  full Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4378 is vital to ensuring America's leadership in  nuclear innovation. By harnessing the unique expertise of our Nation's  national labs, the private sector can take the lead in developing  groundbreaking advanced nuclear technology.   I especially want to thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee who have cosponsored H.R. 4378, including Chairman  Lamar Smith, Representative Dan Lipinski, Representative Steve Knight,  and Representative Randy Hultgren. I also want to thank the dozens of  researchers and stakeholders who have provided feedback as we developed  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the  [[Page H1096]]  bill (H.R. 4376) to direct the Secretary of Energy to carry out certain  upgrades to research equipment and the construction of a research user  facility, and for other purposes, as amended.

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act, and       this Act and such amendments shall be carried out using       amounts otherwise available for such purpose.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4376, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4376, the Department of Energy  Research Infrastructure Act of 2018. H.R. 4376 will support the  research infrastructure needed to conduct leading basic energy science  and nuclear physics research initiatives here in the U.S. by  authorizing upgrades in construction of major user facilities at the  Department of Energy, DOE, national labs and universities.   The Advanced Light Source, ALS, at Lawrence Berkeley National  Laboratory is a specialized particle accelerator that generates bright  beams of X-ray light for scientific research. The proposed upgrade to  this facility will ensure that DOE can maintain ALS' status as a world- class X-ray facility and allow scientists to study the structure and  behavior of materials at extremely small scales.   The Linac Coherent Light Source, LCLS, is the world's first hard X- ray, free-electron laser. The upgrade to this facility located at SLAC  National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University will provide a  major jump in imaging capability and will enable researchers to perform  groundbreaking experiments in chemistry, in materials, in biology, and  in energy.   The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University is a  one-of-a-kind linear accelerator facility that will allow researchers  to study rare isotopes and their properties. This facility will support  research that expands our understanding of atomic structures and could  facilitate discoveries in medicine and even in physics.   H.R. 4376 reaffirms the Federal Government's key role in basic  science research.   My home State of Texas has long been a world leader in advanced  science and technology, and it is home to millions of entrepreneurs  eager to take advantage of the best research facilities in the world.   These user facility upgrades will give the private sector the tools  they need to develop breakthrough technologies in medicine,  manufacturing, and energy. Investing in this research infrastructure  will also help train the next generation of researchers in chemistry,  physics, and materials science.   Here in Congress, it is our responsibility to take the long-term view  and be patient, making smart investments that can lead to the next big  discovery. This bill funds the research infrastructure necessary to  make those very discoveries possible.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Lamar Smith, Representative Dan  Lipinski, Energy Vice Chairman Steve Knight, and Representative Randy  Hultgren for joining me as original cosponsors of this very important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), who is the very  honorable chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. We  are going to lose Chairman Smith, and we ought to start researching now  to replace him.    It is my distinct honor now to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4376 authorizes critical investments in research  infrastructure at our national labs and universities and will ensure  the next big discoveries in physical sciences, manufacturing, medicine,  and energy can happen right here in these United States.   I want to thank, again, the sponsors of this bill and also thank the  researchers and stakeholders that provided feedback as we developed  this legislation. I certainly want to thank Congressman Knight from  California.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
