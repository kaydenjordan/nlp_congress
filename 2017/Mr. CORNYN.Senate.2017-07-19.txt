Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, we are grinding the wheels here in  Washington, DC, in the Senate very slowly, too slowly, when it comes to  confirming the President's nominees, first to the Cabinet and now to  the sub-Cabinet positions.   When the American people elected President Trump on November 8, they  knew they were electing not just one person but also his full executive  branch team, most certainly when it comes to filling vital national  security positions like those in the Department of Defense. But because  of unprecedented delay and obstruction from our Democratic colleagues,  at the current pace, it would take more than 11 years to fully staff  the executive branch--and to what end? Do our Democratic colleagues  object to the qualifications of these nominees? Well, the answer is, by  and large, no. Most of these nominees have sailed through the relevant  committees, and some were even nominated by President Obama, but that  doesn't do anything to expedite the confirmation process. So I can only  be left to conclude that our Democratic friends are just trying to make  it more difficult for President Trump to do his job and, in the  process, make it harder for us in the Senate to do ours.   On Monday, we voted to end the filibuster of Patrick Shanahan, the  nominee for Deputy Defense Secretary at the Department of Defense.  Thankfully, we voted to confirm him, but he was confirmed by a vote of  92 to 7, so there wasn't any good-faith disagreement about his  qualifications. There wasn't any real doubt about whether he would be  confirmed, but our friends across the aisle insisted on burning as much  time as possible, using every procedural objection they could in order  to delay it. This is the same person who passed out of the Armed  Services Committee by unanimous voice vote, essentially by unanimous  consent.   Well, if there is one thing that is indispensable in the Federal  Government, it is our national security. The Department of Defense has  been facing a critical shortfall in leadership, which is dangerous to  the Nation, especially while we are engaged in such a vast array of  conflicts around the world. We have seen only 6 of President Trump's 22  nominations confirmed, and by drastically delaying this process, our  Democratic colleagues are promoting not only the waste of taxpayer  dollars, but they are putting lives at risk. I recently talked to the  commander of a cyber unit who said that it took months for recently  appropriated money to make its way out to his unit. In the meantime, he  had to make personnel cuts and forgo investing in resources that would  strengthen our cyber defenses, all because we couldn't get  administrative positions filled at the Pentagon. The type of drastic  action this particular commander was forced to take is not unique. It  is reprehensible that anyone would play politics and delay for delay's  sake, especially when considering the nomination of a person who  directly impacts the training and readiness of our troops.   Of the 197 nominations to agencies made by the President so far, the  Senate has confirmed only 48. Additionally, the Senate has confirmed  only 2 of the 22 judicial nominations. This is one reason the majority  leader said that we are going to spend a couple more weeks during the  August recess to be here, working to get our work done. I have already  heard from some of our Democratic colleagues saying: Why would the  majority leader make that decision? I said: All you need to do is look  in the mirror and ask that question of the Democratic leader, who is  leading this unprecedented effort in obstructing and slow-walking these  nominations. I suspect that they are going to come forward and say:  Well, let's play nice now. Let's make a deal.   The Department of Justice, for example, has only 3 out of 19  nominations confirmed. This is the Department of Justice. The  Department of Health and Human Services--by the way, we have been  talking a lot about healthcare. Wouldn't you think we need a full  complement of nominees confirmed there? But only 3 out of 11 have been  confirmed there.   In November, when the people elected President Trump, they wanted  him, certainly by implication, to appoint a Cabinet of qualified  individuals to help guide our country and carry out the tasks and  policies of the administration. I am left with the unfortunate  conclusion that, really, what this is designed to do is to not accept  the verdict of the voters on November 8 but to continue to obstruct  this President and the executive branch by any means available in order  to try to make his job harder. The problem with that is it hurts the  American people. It wastes taxpayer money. It makes our country and the  world more dangerous, especially when his national security nominees  are not considered and not confirmed. So it really does represent, to  my experience, an unprecedented unwillingness to accept the outcome of  the election, and it shows contempt, I believe, for the will of the  American people when it came to the election on November 8.    It is easy to call this what it really is. It is an unwillingness to  accept the outcome of the election, further poisoning the already toxic  atmosphere here in Washington, DC, and it doesn't need to be that way.  In my experience, even after tough elections, people on both sides of  the aisle would generally accept the outcome. I don't know what the  alternative might be but to accept the outcome and then try to work  together in the best interest of the American people, try to find those  areas where we do agree--we don't agree on everything, but there are  areas where we do agree--and to move forward and make progress. That  doesn't seem to be happening today, and it is too bad. It is  unfortunate.   To put this in perspective, there were only eight cloture votes of  President Obama's nominees by his first August recess in 2008. For  everybody's concern, the term ``cloture votes'' basically means  invoking all of the procedures to delay things and make it harder to  confirm nominees. Only eight times was that used when President Obama  was President. By the time we reach the August recess this year, we  will have had over three times as many cloture votes; that is,  unnecessary obstacles placed in the way of timely confirmation of  President Trump's nominees, making us jump through more hoops. It is  delay for delay's sake. I believe this strategy--and it is a strategy-- is simply unconscionable and that the time-consuming parliamentary  procedures and slow-walking and needless gridlock advance no interest  of the American people.   I can only hope people will change in the way they approach this.  Maybe if they hear from their constituents, maybe if the stories are  written about it or people hear about it on the news, they will call  their elected representatives and say: The election is over. Accept the  outcome and try to work together in the best interest of the American  people. I think that is what our constituents expect of us.   So this week we will press forward with two important nominations,  John Bush to be U.S. circuit judge for the Sixth Circuit and David  Bernhardt to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior. These are two  additional, highly qualified individuals who are seriously needed in  their respective roles, but it shouldn't take a whole week to confirm  three nominees. That is what it takes now, given the obstruction and  foot-dragging on the other side.   I would urge our colleagues to end their political gamesmanship for  the benefit of our country and for the American people so we can move  forward doing the people's business.   I yield the floor.
