 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 92) condemning North Korea's  development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                 H. Res. 92         Whereas the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),       also known as North Korea, possesses a ballistic missile and       nuclear weapons development program that poses a grave threat       to the United States, United States allies South Korea and       Japan, and to regional and global security;        Whereas North Korea's ballistic missile program has       demonstrated an increasing ability to reach the United       States, which constitutes a credible and growing threat to       the security of the American people;        Whereas North Korea has demonstrated a willingness and       ability to proliferate its ballistic missile and nuclear       weapons technology to a variety of countries, including the       Islamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic, which       the United States has designated as state sponsors of       terrorism;        Whereas, on January 6, 2016, North Korea detonated a       nuclear device, marking its fourth nuclear test to date;        Whereas, on February 7, 2016, North Korea, utilizing a       modified version of the Taepodong-2 ballistic missile,       launched a ``satellite'' into space;        Whereas according to the U.S. Intelligence Community's 2016       Worldwide Threat Assessment, North Korea is ``committed to       developing a long-range, nuclear-armed missile that is       capable of posing a direct threat to the United States; it       has publicly displayed its KN08 road-mobile ICBM on multiple       occasions'';        Whereas, on April 28, 2016, Deputy Secretary of State       Antony Blinken, in a hearing before the Foreign Affairs       Committee of the House of Representatives, testified ``the       benefits of [the trilateral] relationship are crystal clear       in the face of the region's most acute challenge--the       challenge from North Korea and its provocative acts in the       nuclear missile domain'';        Whereas, on August 24, 2016, North Korea successfully       tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile, firing the       missile over 300 miles from a submerged submarine;        Whereas, on September 9, 2016, North Korea conducted its       fifth nuclear test, which it claimed was a warhead that could       be miniaturized for its ballistic missiles;        Whereas, on September 15, 2016, Admiral Harry Harris,       Commander of U.S. Pacific Command, stated ``Combining nuclear       warheads with ballistic missile technology in the hands of a       volatile leader like Kim Jong-un, is a recipe for       disaster.'';        Whereas, on September 16, 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton       Carter stated ``Everyone can see that North Korea is       determined to try to expand its missile threat to the       peninsula, to the region, and to the United States.'';        Whereas in 2016 North Korea willfully and repeatedly       violated multiple United Nations Security Council       resolutions, through its nuclear tests, missile tests, and       satellite launch;        Whereas, on January 6, 2017, Deputy Secretary of State       Antony Blinken stated that North Korea had conducted 24       missile tests in the past year, as well as two nuclear tests       and ``in our assessment, we have a qualitative improvement in       their capabilities in the past year as a result of this       unprecedented level of activity'';        Whereas, on January 8, 2017, North Korea declared that it       is ready to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic missile       (ICBM);        Whereas, on February 11, 2017, North Korea launched an       intermediate-range ballistic missile off its eastern coast       while President Donald Trump hosted Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe on an official visit to the United States;        Whereas, on February 18, 2017, the People's Republic of       China announced that it would suspend all coal imports from       North Korea, a significant source of revenue to the North       Korean regime;        Whereas, on February 27, 2017, the United Nations Panel of       Experts on North Korea determined that ``The Democratic       People's Republic of Korea is flouting sanctions through       trade in prohibited goods, with evasion techniques that are       increasing in scale, scope and sophistication.'';        Whereas, on March 6, 2017, North Korea launched four       intermediate range missiles, three of which landed       approximately 200 miles off the coast of Japan;        Whereas South Korea and the United States have made an       alliance decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area       Defense (THAAD) system as a self-defensive measure to ensure       the security of South Korea and its people, and to protect       alliance military forces from the growing threat of North       Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program; and        Whereas a nuclear North Korea with a functional and       operational intercontinental ballistic missile program would       pose a direct threat to the United States and United States       interests: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns North Korea's development of multiple       intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs);        (2) welcomes the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude       Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea to counter North       Korea's missile threat, which supports an alliance security       decision;        (3) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China       to immediately cease its diplomatic intimidation and economic       coercion against South Korea in an attempt to block the THAAD       deployment;        (4) reaffirms the United States support for a layered,       integrated, multi-tier missile defense system to protect       Americans and allies in Northeast Asia;        (5) supports continued bilateral security cooperation       between the United States and South Korea and the       consideration of additional measures to strengthen the       alliance, including expanded foreign military sales, joint       exercises, and other actions as appropriate;        (6) reaffirms, in view of the ICBM threat by North Korea,       the commitment of the United States to its alliances and to       trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan, which is       critical for the preservation of peace and stability in       Northeast Asia and throughout the world;        (7) supports and urges the full implementation of the       intelligence sharing agreement between Japan and South Korea       signed on November 23, 2016, concerning the direct exchange       of intelligence on North Korean threats;        (8) calls upon the People's Republic of China to use its       considerable leverage to pressure North Korean leaders to       cease their provocative behavior and abandon and dismantle       their nuclear and missile programs, and comply with all       relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions;        (9) calls on the United States to fully enforce all       existing economic sanctions on North Korea and to seek to       continuously adapt the sanctions regime to address evasive       techniques employed by the North Korean regime; and        (10) calls on the Secretary of State to undertake a       comprehensive and rigorous diplomatic effort to urge allies       and other countries to fully enforce, and build upon,       existing international sanctions on North Korea.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).  [[Page H2606]]                                     General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin here by thanking Mr. Wilson for his  leadership on H. Res. 92. What this resolution does is to describe in  alarming detail the growing sophistication of North Korea's missile and  nuclear weapons program. This, of course, poses a direct threat to the  United States as well as to our allies.   Last year alone, North Korea, as we will recall, conducted more than  20 missile tests, including one from a submarine, and they are doing  this in pursuit of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of  striking the United States. Kim Jong-un has detonated two separate  nuclear devices in the same year, a first for this rogue regime. Today,  the Kim regime's aggression continues, and recent satellite imagery  indicates that Pyongyang is now prepared to detonate its sixth nuclear  device.   With every test, North Korea gains valuable knowledge that has  enabled it to make significant improvements to this developing arsenal.  Bear in mind that North Korea has cooperated on its program with these  countries, and I would like the Members to think on this: they have  cooperated with Iran, they have cooperated with Syria on a nuclear  program, and they have cooperated with Pakistan. This, of course, is  undermining U.S. security, but, frankly, it undermines the security of  the entire global counter-proliferation system.   That is why I strongly support the passage of this resolution. I have  been in North Korea, and let me tell you, this resolution, which  condemns North Korea's development of an ICBM and calls for the United  States and others to immediately address this urgent threat, is very  necessary at this time.   Fortunately, the new administration already has several tools at its  disposal. One of those is a bill that we wrote up in the committee, a  bill authored by myself and Eliot Engel, the North Korea Sanctions and  Policy Enhancement Act. It was signed last year, and it was also taken  up at the U.N. Security Council and passed at the Security Council  office. This resolution, among other things, empowers the President to  ramp up pressure on the North Korean regime by sanctioning foreign  companies that do business with--and therefore enable--the regime.   The deployment of the anti-missile defense system THAAD to the Korean  Peninsula must also continue as quickly as possible, and China should  end its economic intimidation of our ally South Korea in response to  this deployment. THAAD will serve as a vital first line of defense  protecting U.S. personnel in the region and protecting our allies from  Kim Jong-un.   As this resolution notes, China needs to do its part to implement the  sanctions contained in multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions.  President Trump should press this issue with President Xi when the two  meet this week. With these steps, I believe the United States can again  exert effective pressure on the Kim regime.   As H. Res. 92 emphasizes, Congress stands ready to help counter North  Korea's belligerent behavior and maintain peace and maintain stability  in the Asia Pacific.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Armed Services,                                     Washington, DC, March 30, 2017.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H. Res.       92, a resolution ``Condemning North Korea's development of       multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles, and for other       purposes,'' as amended. There are certain provisions in the       legislation which fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Armed Services.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important       legislation, I am willing to waive this committee's further       consideration of H. Res. 92. I do so with the understanding       that by waiving consideration of the resolution the Committee       on Armed Services does not waive any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the legislation       which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in       which you have worked regarding this matter and others       between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                     William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 30, 2017.      Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, House Armed Services Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Foreign Affairs on H. Res. 92, Condemning North       Korea's development of multiple intercontinental ballistic       missiles, and for agreeing to be discharged from further       consideration of that resolution so that it may proceed       expeditiously to consideration by the House.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Armed Services, or prejudice its jurisdictional       prerogatives on this resolution or similar legislation in the       future.        I will seek to place our letters on H. Res. 92 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work with your Committee as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), who is a senior member of  both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee and  the author of this resolution.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I was grateful to visit  North Korea on a congressional delegation in 2003 with House Foreign  Affairs Ranking Member Eliot Engel on a delegation led by Congressman  Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania. While there, we witnessed a regime  obsessed with a Potemkin-like appearance and preservation to the  detriment of its own citizens who have been reduced to destitution and  starvation.                                time  1715    After seeing the devastation of the people at the hands of the  totalitarian regime, I have been even more invested in the need to hold  the regime in Pyongyang accountable for threatening neighbors.   In early February, I introduced this bipartisan resolution in  response to North Korea's threat to test an intercontinental ballistic.  Their threat is concerning because an ICBM has the capability of  reaching the West Coast of the United States.   The rapid pace of North Korea's growing offensive nuclear weapons  development is alarming to the United States and our allies. In just a  few short months, North Korea has appeared to successfully test an  ICBM; launched a satellite; tested four simultaneous ballistic  missiles, three of which landed in Japanese territorial waters; had a  failed missile launch; and tested a ballistic missile engine. The  regime also claims to be planning another nuclear test for later this  month.   Sadly revealing, the regime in North Korea recently released a  propaganda video depicting a missile striking a U.S. aircraft carrier  and calling for the destruction of the American people.   North Korea is rapidly advancing their capabilities, working to  miniaturize nuclear technology to deliver a nuclear weapon anywhere in  the world. Sadly, 8 years of strategic patience only enabled the  dictatorship. We cannot afford to stand by as this regime grows in  power and influence, threatening the United States and our allies.   I am grateful that President Donald Trump is taking the regime and  its threats seriously. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of  State Rex Tillerson recently visited our allies in South Korea and  Japan; and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has  led the efforts for strengthening international sanctions against North  Korea.   The administration has also demonstrated peace through strength by  backing up their commitments to our allies with action. We have begun  deploying the THAAD missile defense system, recently resumed the annual  military training exercises with South Korea, and deployed attack  drones to support our servicemembers stationed in the region. This  defends the extraordinary people of South Korea, who have developed one  of the most prosperous nations on Earth.   As we work to check the growing influence and missile capability of  North Korea, Congress, too, has a vital role, starting with passage of  H. Res. 92 to forcefully condemn North Korea for these actions and call  for the consideration of all available sanctions on the regime and the  individuals or businesses who sustain it. We are clear: the United  States must stand strong against North Korea for American families and  our South Korean allies.   I appreciate the consideration of H. Res. 92, with 120 bipartisan  cosponsors. I know that America is fortunate to have the leadership of  House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce, serving in a bipartisan manner  with Ranking Member Eliot Engel.   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the resolution.    I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of the committee who  chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North  Africa and has authored previous legislation to address the North  Korean threat.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I commend the commitment that Chairman  Royce and Ranking Member Engel have shown in holding North Korea  accountable for its illicit activity, and it is a long list.   Mr. Speaker, I want to also commend my good friend and colleague,  Congressman Joe Wilson, for authoring this important measure, H. Res.  92, condemning North Korea's development of multiple intercontinental  ballistic missiles, or ICBMs.   Recently, North Korea has made the calculation that it either needs  to flex its muscles through the test of ballistic missiles or, at the  very least, provoke an international response so that the regime can  use it as propaganda against the West.   We have seen dozens of missile tests over the past year, and, just as  troubling, at least two nuclear tests. I know that this is resolution  condemning North Korea's provocative action, but I do think this is an  opportunity to call attention to the Iranian nuclear and ballistic  missile program. What I and some of my colleagues have been saying for  years now is that Iran has been following the North Korea playbook.   We signed a weak and dangerous nuclear deal with North Korea, and  what was the result? A nuclear-armed Pyongyang that is testing and  upgrading its ballistic and nuclear program unchecked and possibly even  proliferating these materials, or at least the know-how, to Iran.   We concluded a weak and dangerous nuclear deal with Iran, and you can  be sure, if we don't do more to press Iran, we will be welcoming  another dangerous regime to the nuclear weapons club.   While we rightfully condemn North Korea for its provocations, we must  be mindful that, if we follow the same path and make the same mistakes,  it will be Iran in a few years that will have a nuclear weapon and  ballistic missile program that can threaten global security, and that  is in none of our interests.   I urge my colleagues to fully support Mr. Wilson's measure, Mr.  Speaker, but I also urge them to realize the failures of past policies  and what got us here to this point with North Korea and not to allow  the same mistakes to happen with respect to Iran.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a senior member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters of California).   Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H. Res. 92, condemning North Korea's development of multiple  intercontinental ballistic missiles.   The world has watched in fear as this brutal dictatorship has labored  to miniaturize a nuclear warhead capable of being delivered by an ICBM.  Across the 45th District, Californians are anxious about the growing  threat from North Korea and its efforts to develop the capability to  strike the West Coast.   Orange County is home to a large Korean-American population who have  spoken out forcefully against this rogue regime, fearing for the life  of their Korean kin and the safety of the entire world. As I tell all  concerned constituents when I am back home in California, and I will  repeat here today: I share your concern and will do all I can to ensure  we eliminate this threat.   Mr. Speaker, just today, an interview with the most high-profile  North Korean defector in two decades was released. The man's warning  was dire: Kim Jong-un will use nuclear weapons at the slightest sign of  an imminent threat to his rule.   The time for the old strategy of strategic patience has passed. We  must take serious actions now to prevent a nuclear weapon from ever  threatening the United States or one of our allies. I urge the  President to address this grave threat with the Chinese President at  their upcoming summit.   I thank my friend, the gentleman from South Carolina, for undertaking  this effort, and I am proud to join him in this fight.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, North Korea, as we all know, poses an urgent threat to  the United States and to our allies. Experts say that, in less than 4  years, Kim Jung-un will likely have the ability to make a reliable  intercontinental ballistic missile topped by a nuclear warhead capable  of targeting the continental United States. They also expect that, by  then, North Korea may have accumulated enough nuclear material to build  up to 100 warheads for those ICBMs they have been making.   In an interview, the President says he is going to discuss this  growing threat and Kim Jung-un's behavior with Chinese President Xi  this week. As he says, China has great influence over North Korea, and  China will either decide to help us with North Korea or they won't,  but, if they do, that will be very good for China.   It will be good for China because we have made it very clear that  this is a key interest of the United States. We do not want to see  North Korea able to proliferate this kind of weaponry. They have  already tested this off of a submarine. It would be irresponsible for  us, China, and every member of the international community not to take  steps now to cut off all hard currency into North Korea that allows  that regime to continue down this path.                                time  1730    This threat is real, and that demands real response. I appreciate Joe  Wilson bringing this resolution because, as he notes, one other point  that I think we have to make, the deployment of THAAD needs to be  completed as quickly as possible.   The President must also utilize the economic tools that Congress has  given him with the act authored by myself and Mr. Engel to cut off  funding for the regime of Kim Jong-un. I would also encourage the  administration to pursue all opportunities to strengthen our economic  and security relationships with our partners throughout the Asia  Pacific right now because, as we know, our allies there are equally  concerned about this development.   I thank the author of this resolution, Mr. Joe Wilson, and, of  course, my committee's ranking member, Mr. Engel. I want to thank Mr.  Sherman as well for working on this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 54) reaffirming the United States- Argentina partnership and recognizing Argentina's economic reforms, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                 H. Res. 54         Whereas, on November 22, 2015, the citizens of the       Argentine Republic elected Mauricio Macri as their President;        Whereas President Macri has pledged to promote greater       national unity, rebuild the economy, combat domestic       corruption, strengthen freedom of the press, defend human       rights abroad, attract foreign direct investment, return to       international credit markets, and reassert Argentina's       leadership globally;        Whereas President Macri has emphasized his intention to       seek closer ties with the United States and restore the       bilateral partnership previously enjoyed by both countries;        Whereas the Argentine Republic has been a major non-NATO       ally of the United States since 1998 and is the only country       designated as such in Latin America;        Whereas United States-Argentina relations are historically       characterized by comprehensive commercial ties and strong       bilateral cooperation on human rights, peacekeeping, science       and technology, non-proliferation, and education, as well as       on regional and global issues;        Whereas, in an appearance with President Macri at the Casa       Rosada in Buenos Aires in March 2016, President Barack Obama       said that ``our countries share profound values in common--      respect for human rights, for individual freedoms, for       democracy, for justice, and for peace'';        Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry visited Argentina in       August 2016 to launch a High-Level Dialogue to develop and       sustain cooperation on bilateral, regional, and global       challenges, including democratic development and protection       of human rights in Latin America;        Whereas Secretary Kerry, during his visit, stated that       ``the United States strongly supports President Macri's       effort to deepen Argentina's integration with the global       economy' '' and that ``our governments will be supporting       policies that are aimed at strong, sustainable, and balanced       economic growth'';        Whereas the United States Department of the Treasury no       longer opposes multilateral development banks lending to       Argentina because of the Government of Argentina's ``progress       on key issues and positive economic policy trajectory'';        Whereas President Macri prioritized Argentina resolving its       15-year standoff with private creditors stemming from the       2001-2002 economic crisis, which facilitated Argentina's       return to international financial markets;        Whereas the Macri Administration lifted controls on trade,       currency, and poultry, enhanced the quality and transparency       of government data, and eliminated subsidies on electricity,       water, and gas;        Whereas Argentina is Latin America's third largest economy       and the International Monetary Fund, in April 2016, claimed       the Macri Administration ``embarked on an ambitious, much       needed transition to remove domestic imbalances and       distortions and correct relative prices''; and        Whereas the Government of Argentina has expressed a renewed       commitment to bring the perpetrators of the 1994 bombing of       the Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) building,       that occurred in Buenos Aires on July 18, 1994, killing 85       people and injuring hundreds, to justice: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) upholds its commitment to the partnership between the       United States and Argentina and reaffirms that the Argentine       Republic is a major non-NATO ally of the United States;        (2) encourages the Department of State to coordinate a new       interagency strategy to increase cooperation with the       Government of Argentina on areas of bilateral, regional, and       global concern;        (3) commends the Government of Argentina for making far-      reaching economic reforms that will benefit the people of       Argentina, stimulate economic growth, and deepen Argentina's       integration with the global economy;        (4) praises the Government of Argentina for resolving most       of its business disputes at the World Bank's International       Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)       thereby hastening their re-entry into world financial markets       to the benefit of the Argentine people; and        (5) encourages the Government of Argentina to continue to       investigate and prosecute those responsible for the 1994       bombing of the Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA)       building in Buenos Aires, as well as the January 2015 death       of AMIA special prosecutor Alberto Nisman.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to put any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to put any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Let me just start by thanking Mr. Sires, the author of this measure,  and I rise in support of it. It reaffirms the United States-Argentina  partnership.   After over a decade of economic mismanagement and corruption and  alliances with the likes of Iran--well, we should say the Ayatollah in  Iran--and alliances with the regime in Venezuela, the people of  Argentina used their vote to usher in a new era of what I would call  economic common sense and a new era of regional leadership.   Since assuming the Presidency in December 2015, President Macri has  undertaken difficult economic reforms to undo the damage caused by his  predecessor's policy and taken reforms to return to the global markets.  He tore up the laughable agreement that President Cristina Kirchner  signed with Iran to investigate the 1994 Hezbollah bombing of the  Jewish community center, which killed 85 and injured hundreds of other  people in the Jewish community in Argentina. He has shown regional  leadership in condemning Venezuela's human and democratic rights  violations.   As the new Argentinian Government undertakes difficult reforms, it  needs the moral support of its allies in the region, including the  support of this body. This measure seeks to reaffirm the partnership,  the friendship that we share with Argentina. It commends the  government's hard work in bringing Argentina back from economic ruin.   This measure also encourages the Government of Argentina to make good  on its promise to finally bring the perpetrators of the 1994 bombing  there  [[Page H2610]]  of the Jewish community center to justice, while thoroughly  investigating the January 2015 death of special prosecutor Alberto  Nisman. As my colleagues know, immediately before his mysterious death,  Nisman was set to issue a thorough report on his findings that the  government of Cristina Kirchner had colluded with Iran to conceal  Iran's role in orchestrating that 1994 terrorist attack at the hands of  the Iranian proxy in this case, Hezbollah.   Mr. Speaker, let me just mention another subject here. In South  America, we are watching Venezuela lose any semblance of democracy or  human rights. Last week, Venezuela's democratically elected National  Assembly was dissolved. The Venezuelan people are greatly suffering. As  Argentina has dropped its support of these authoritarians and stands  with the rest of the region in strong condemnation of authoritarianism  in Venezuela, the Venezuelan Government is now more isolated than ever.   Back to H. Res. 54. This reflects this body's support of and  friendship with Argentina, and it reflects our gratitude for Argentine  leadership in support of economic and democratic reform.   Again, I thank Mr. Sires for this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), who chairs the Subcommittee  on the Western Hemisphere of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He is  the primary cosponsor of this measure.   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I briefly want to mention  the country of Colombia. Tremendous flooding and mudslides there have  taken more than 200 lives. Colombia is in my prayers, the prayers of  the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and the prayers of all of  America.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 54, which reaffirms  America's partnership with Argentina, and applaud the economic reforms  undertaken in recent years.   I applaud Ranking Member Sires for his leadership on this issue. Last  year, he and I led a congressional delegation to Argentina to see the  differences in the country under the new leadership of President Macri  and to reextend a hand of friendship of the United States.   Though the previous government followed the path of ruinous economic  and foreign policies, I saw new optimism that the new Macri  administration would right these wrongs. For example, at the  Organization of American States, Argentina has been supportive of the  actions of OAS Secretary General Almagro, urging the Venezuelan  Government to respect democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.   In addition, President Macri is working to find justice for the 1994  AMIA bombing terrorist attack--the largest loss of life from an act of  terror in this hemisphere prior to 9/11--and the murder of the AMIA  special prosecutor, Alberto Nisman. It is my sincerest hope that he  will find the perpetrators and hold them accountable for these heinous  acts of terror.   In conclusion, the United States should be very clear that we are  thankful for President Macri's courage and willingness to take  unpopular but principled positions. I urge the new Trump administration  to do all in its power to take the steps outlined in this legislation  and advance a deeper bilateral relationship.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs and a cosponsor of this measure.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for the time.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to be standing here in strong support of  the measure of my very good friend from New Jersey, Mr. Albio Sires. H.  Res. 54 is so important. It reaffirms the U.S.-Argentina partnership  and recognizes Argentina's economic reforms. As Mr. Royce said, I am  proud to be an original cosponsor of Mr. Sires' important resolution.   Up until the recent election of President Macri, Argentina was going  in the wrong direction. Since Macri came to office, he has made some  tough but much-needed economic reforms. He has shown that Argentina is  willing to be engaged in areas of mutual interest to our two countries  and expand our bilateral relations. President Macri's commitment to  these reforms should be commended.   But he hasn't just shown strong leadership on economic reforms.  President Macri has shown strong character and leadership to the rule  of law and pursuit of justice. He has done so by announcing his  intention to continue to investigate and prosecute those responsible  for the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association, AMIA,  in Buenos Aires, Argentina.   Last month, we marked the 25th anniversary of the terrorist attack on  the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which was followed by the 1994  AMIA attack.  [[Page H2611]]  It is no secret that the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah was  responsible for these attacks; yet, to this day, Mr. Speaker, Iran and  Hezbollah have evaded justice.                                time  1745    The United States should support President Macri as he continues his  investigation and seeks to hold those responsible accountable to make  sure that he can bring them to justice for their deadly terror attacks.   We should also applaud and support his decision to investigate the  suspicious circumstances involving the death of the special prosecutor  of these cases, Alberto Nisman. Alberto had uncovered links between  Hezbollah and these terror attacks, and I would speak with Alberto  frequently about these troublesome ties.   Nisman was a good man and a strong supporter of human rights. We must  help President Macri and the people of Argentina continue Nisman's work  and legacy by bringing those responsible for his death and for those  dastardly terrorist attacks to justice.   We can start by signaling to the people of Argentina that we support  their government and that we value our bilateral relationship. Passing  Mr. Sires' resolution will do just that. We will send that message.   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Sires' measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues; I want to thank Mr.  Sires, ranking member of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere; and I  thank the chairman of that committee, Mr. Duncan, for their leadership  in bringing this measure to the floor.   This important resolution reaffirms our relationship with the people  and the government of Argentina. It calls on the State Department to  develop an interagency strategy to maximize our cooperation with  Argentina as our countries work together to promote democracy, to  promote human rights, and to promote economic freedom across the  Americas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 54, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 479) to require a report on the designation of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 479         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``North Korea State Sponsor of       Terrorism Designation Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF GOVERNMENT OF NORTH KOREA AS                     A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States Government designated the Government       of North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism on January 20,       1988.        (2) On October 11, 2008, North Korea's designation as a       state sponsor of terrorism was rescinded, following       commitments by the Government of North Korea to dismantle its       nuclear weapons program. However, North Korea has failed to       live up to these commitments.        (3) On October 22, 2015, the United States Special       Representative for North Korea Policy with the Department of       State, testified before the House Foreign Affairs       Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade that       North Korea's ``conduct poses a growing threat to the United       States, our friends in the region, and the global       nonproliferation regime'' and the Deputy Coordinator for       Homeland Security, Screening, and Designations with the U.S.       Department of State noted that ``weapons transfers that       violate nonproliferation or missile control regimes could be       a relevant factor for consideration, depending on the       circumstances, consistent with the statutory criteria for       designation as a state sponsor of terrorism''.        (4) The Government of North Korea has harbored members of       the Japanese Red Army since a 1970 hijacking and continues to       harbor the surviving hijackers to this day.        (5) On July 16, 2010, in the case of Calderon-Cardona v.       Democratic People's Republic of Korea (case number 08-01367),       the United States District Court for the District of Puerto       Rico found that the Government of North Korea provided       material support to the Japanese Red Army, designated as a       foreign terrorist organization between 1997 and 2001, in       furtherance of a 1972 terrorist attack at Lod Airport, Israel       that killed 26 people, including 17 Americans.        (6) In the case of Chaim Kaplan v. Hezbollah (case number       09-646), a United States district court found in 2014 that       North Korea materially supported terrorist attacks by       Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist organization,       against Israel in 2006.        (7) In June 2010, Major Kim Myong-ho and Major Dong Myong-      gwan of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau pled       guilty in a South Korean court to attempting to assassinate       Hwang Jang-yop, a North Korean dissident in exile, on the       orders of Lieutenant General Kim Yong-chol, the head of North       Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau. The court sentenced       each defendant to 10 years in prison.        (8) In March 2015, the Government of South Korea concluded       that North Korea was responsible for a December 2014 cyber       attack against multiple nuclear power plants in South Korea.       The South Korean Government stated that the attacks were       intended to cause a malfunction at the plants' reactors, and       described the attacks as acts of ``cyber-terror targeting our       country''.        (9) On December 19, 2015, the Federal Bureau of       Investigation (FBI) concluded that North Korea was       responsible for a cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment       and a subsequent threat of violence against theaters that       showed the film ``The Interview''. The FBI concluded that the       ``Guardians of Peace'', which sent the threat to Sony       Pictures Entertainment, was a unit of North Korea's       Reconnaissance General Bureau, its foreign intelligence       service.        (10) Malaysian authorities have alleged that officials from       North Korea's secret police and Foreign Ministry were       involved in the poisoning and killing of the estranged half-      brother of the country's leader, Kim Jong-nam, using the       chemical weapon VX nerve agent, a substance banned for use as       a weapon by the United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention,       on February 13, 2017, in Kuala Lumpur.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that the Government of North Korea likely meets the criteria       for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism and, if so       should be so designated.        (c) Determination.--Not later than 90 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall       submit to the appropriate congressional committees a       determination as to whether the Government of North Korea       meets the criteria for designation as a state sponsor of       terrorism.        (d) Form.--The determination required by subsection (c)       shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a       classified annex, if appropriate.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and        (B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives.        (2) North Korea.--The term ``North Korea'' means the       Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.        (3) State sponsor of terrorism.--The term ``state sponsor       of terrorism'' means a country the government of which the       Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of section       6(j) of the Export Administration  [[Page H2612]]       Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. 4605(j)) (as in effect pursuant to the       International Emergency Economic Powers Act), section 620A of       the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371), section       40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780), or any       other provision of law, is a government that has repeatedly       provided support for acts of international terrorism.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last month, I was pleased to hear Secretary of State Rex  Tillerson say that the State Department is considering a range of  measures to respond to Kim Jong-un's dangerous provocations in  Northeast Asia. One immediate step should be listing North Korea as a  state sponsor of terrorism, a status it should have never lost.   In 2008, North Korea's designation as a state sponsor of terror was  rescinded following the regime's promise to dismantle its nuclear  weapons program. Well, North Korea got its delisting, but it kept its  nuclear program, as proven by its fourth test and as proven by its  fifth test last year.   Since 2008, not only has North Korea's nuclear weapons program  advanced, so too has its support for terrorism. Let me explain that.  The Kim regime has continued to supply surface-to-air missiles and  explosives to terrorist groups like Hezbollah. In addition to that, the  actions taken by North Korea include the firing of repeated rounds on  South Korean civilians on the island of Yeonpyeong and carrying out  targeted assassinations of North Korean defectors, including the recent  assassination of Kim Jong-un's half brother, who had been living in  exile.   Recall that this murder, which took place in broad daylight at Kuala  Lumpur International Airport, involved the use of VX nerve agent, which  is a chemical weapon banned under international law. Now, a liter of  this substance contains enough lethal doses to kill 1 million people.  It has no other purpose than being an instrument of death. This they  used to assassinate the President's own half brother.   Mr. Speaker, the Foreign Affairs Committee has focused extensively on  the urgent threat by North Korea to the U.S. and our allies in Asia. It  is critical that we use every tool at our disposal to ramp up the  pressure on the Kim regime.   I know just how aggressive North Korea can be. I saw a ship of the  South Korean Navy that had been lifted from the bottom of the sea. It  had been split in two by a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine.  Over 40 South Korean sailors were killed in that attack.   This is the kind of behavior we have seen from Kim Jong-un. This is  why I rise in support of Judge Ted Poe's bill, H.R. 479, which pushes  the State Department to relist North Korea as a state sponsor of  terrorism.   The state sponsor of terrorism label is a very powerful one. In  addition to imposing sanctions and other restrictions, the designation  itself earns a state pariah status internationally. And that is  deserved. After all, these are countries whose governments backed the  killings of innocent people, innocent civilians, as a matter of policy.   Frankly, the Department should never have removed North Korea's  designation in the first place.   I am glad that this legislation demands a reevaluation. I think I  know what that result will be.   I thank the bill's author, Judge Ted Poe, who has a deep sense, as a  former judge, of justice and has pursued this issue for a long time. I  also thank the ranking member for working with our offices on this  important and timely measure. The flawed delisting of North Korea has  also been a particular focus to the chairman emeritus of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, and so I want to recognize her  contributions as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                      Washington, DC, April 3, 2017.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing with respect to H.R. 479,       the ``North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act       of 2017.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on       provisions on which the Committee on Ways and Means has a       jurisdictional interest, I will not request a sequential       referral on this measure.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation, and requests your support for       such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 479.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, April 3, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee on H.R. 479, the North Korea State       Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017, and for       agreeing to forgo a sequential referral request so that the       bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your declining to pursue a sequential referral       in this case does not diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       the Committee on Ways and Means, or prejudice its       jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar       legislation in the future. I would support your effort to       seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from       your committee to any House-Senate conference on this       legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on Ways       and Means as this measure moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize  the contribution here of Mr. Sherman, who is the ranking member on the  committee, and to acknowledge also the force of his argument.   Kim Jong-un is an individual who not only kidnaps his neighbors, but  also, in the past, this rogue regime has become expert at transferring  the methods to kill civilians to other rogue regimes around the world.  And based upon his past behavior, it is only too plausible that if they  get this weapon, they will do it again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe),  the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism,  Nonproliferation, and Trade, and the dogged author of this bill who has  pushed this issue for a long time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), and I thank the  gentlewoman from Florida again for her contribution on this  legislation.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I stand in full support of Judge Poe's  bill, H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation  Act of 2017.   Over the years, as the chairman has said, I have repeatedly and  explicitly called for Pyongyang to be redesignated as a state sponsor  of terrorism, SST, country.   I stood in ardent opposition to the Bush administration's decision to  remove North Korea from the SST list, and in the years past, I  introduced similar legislation to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe),  which would see Pyongyang back on the list where it belongs.   The removal from the list was a failure of the nuclear negotiations  with North Korea, a concession given for nothing but empty promises in  return.   In much the same way that the Obama administration removed Cuba from  the SST list 2 years ago, the Bush administration got empty promises in  return for these terrible concessions, while the Obama administration  couldn't even get empty promises.    These designations are much more important than just tools for  negotiation, Mr. Speaker. They are there because these countries  actively support terror or they support or facilitate countries that do  support terror. They pose a very serious risk to U.S. national security  and global stability. This is not something to take lightly, and  removing North Korea from the SST list was a very serious error in  judgment.   It is far past time, Mr. Speaker, to correct this mistake, and it has  to start by having an honest and transparent determination made on  Pyongyang, its support for terror, and its ties to other state sponsor  of terrorism states like Iran.   I support Judge Poe's bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I again want to thank Judge Poe for his determination to have North  Korea labeled as a terrorist state. As Judge Poe notes, that is just  the way it is.   With the passage of this bill today, we are going to take another  step, I think, toward pushing back on that regime's destructive  ambitions.   I think also it is worth noting that we have a recently published  U.N. panel of experts on North Korea. They put out this report that  says that North Korea continues to illicitly ship dual-use items to  both Syria and Iran. Now, those are two terrorist regimes.   So I hope that the new administration will move quickly to relist  North Korea and continue to seek ways to increase pressure on the  regime through the sanctions bill that we passed out of here today and  other measures.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 479, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
