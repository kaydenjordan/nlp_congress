 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am assuming our colleague on the other side of the  aisle can pass a background check, so she will have no inability to  have a gun.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background  Checks Act, because even as we manage a deadly pandemic, gun violence  continues to plague our Nation.   Every year, more than 130,000 people in this Nation are victims of  gun violence. Some 38,000 dead, another 100,000 caught in the  crossfire. In my home region in Philadelphia, 2,244 people were victims  of gun violence in the year 2020.   Mr. Speaker, death by guns doesn't mean only murders. Sadly, it also  means death by suicide using a firearm, which was the case in 62  percent of Pennsylvania's gun deaths last year. This is a public health  crisis.   The Bipartisan Background Checks Act requires a background check for  all gun sales, no loopholes, no backdoors, a commonsense solution  supported by a majority of Americans, including 89 percent of  Republicans and 87 percent of gun owners.   Mr. Speaker, let's find the courage to address the crisis. Let's save  lives. Let's pass the bill.
