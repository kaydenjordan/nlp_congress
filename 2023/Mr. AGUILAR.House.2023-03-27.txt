 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize three  phenomenal women in my district for Women's History Month. These women  were nominated by their peers and local elected officials for their  incredible dedication to supporting the Inland Empire.   The first woman I recognize is Dr. Gwen Dowdy-Rodgers. Dr. Dowdy- Rodgers is the first Black woman to serve on the San Bernardino County  Board of Education. She was born and raised in San Bernardino, and  first became involved in the school system as a parent advocate.   She is a fierce advocate for mental health in schools, especially  after the COVID-19 pandemic. She believes that mental health issues  need to be a priority in schools so students can stay happy and healthy  in their learning environment.   Besides serving with distinction on the Board of Education, she  serves as the president of the Arrowhead United Way board of directors,  co-chair of the San Bernardino County Gangs and Drugs Task Force, and a  member of the San Bernardino City Police Department African American  Advisory Committee.   My community is lucky to have Dr. Dowdy-Rodgers, a committed public  servant dedicated to helping our students and hearing the concerns of  parents.   The second woman I recognize is Ms. Vanessa Perez. Vanessa is  executive director of the Time for Change Foundation. She is an active  volunteer in our community through her work and her involvement in her  church, The Way World Outreach.   Through her work at Time for Change, Vanessa is living out a passion  of empowering women to use their voice to create change. In 2014, she  completed the Women's Foundation of California's Solis Policy  Institute, which provided her with the skills necessary to navigate the  California legislative process and influence decisionmakers to create  policies that improved the quality of life of San Bernardino residents  and all Californians.   Madam Speaker, the third woman I recognize is Ms. Paula Granado  Flores. She is a long-term volunteer and co-chair of ACS Colton Relay  for Life and a frequent volunteer in several local churches, Seeds For  Hope, and the American Legion. Ms. Flores has dedicated her free time  for decades to help the residents of San Bernardino County.   These women are changing my community for the better every day, and I  am proud to be their Representative here in Congress. They have made a  lasting impact in our region and deserve to be recognized for the  extraordinary work that they have done to further our community.   As we round out Women's History Month, I thank them for their service  to our region, to the Inland Empire, and to the State of California.                            ____________________
