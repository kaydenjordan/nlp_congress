 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in  paying tribute to my dear friend and predecessor, Louise Slaughter.   As evidenced by the many laudatory statements being made today,  Louise's contributions to this institution were immeasurable. Louise  left a remarkable legacy:   The only woman to chair the Rules Committee;   A stalwart for women and children;   A leader who was instrumental in passing landmark healthcare  legislation.   But what I remember most about Louise and what was at the heart of  all her accomplishments is how much she cared for her friends and for  her community.   Louise was my dear friend not only on the best of days, like when she  encouraged me to run for my first elective office or celebrated with me  when I was chosen to be the majority leader of the New York State  Assembly, but also on the most difficult of days.   When my daughter Lauren passed away, Louise was there that afternoon  spending hours at my house with our family. That is just who she was.   She had one of the biggest hearts of anyone I know. I am better for  having known her, and I know that our entire country is better for her  many years of dedicated service.   May you rest in peace, Louise Slaughter.                            ____________________
