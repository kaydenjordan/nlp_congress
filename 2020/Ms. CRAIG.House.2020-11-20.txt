 Mr. Speaker, nearly 8 months ago, our lives changed  dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With cases surging across  the country and in Minnesota, the devastation to our small businesses  is significantly increasing.   Main Street businesses are the backbone of our local economies. They  bring value to our communities and to our lives. We must act with  urgency to support those most impacted by this pandemic.   We have legislation to do this. My bill, the Prioritized Paycheck  Protection Program, would allow small businesses with 100 or fewer  employees who have sustained significant losses due to COVID-19 to  receive a second PPP loan.   In addition, we need to provide targeted assistance to specific  industries. I have cosponsored the RESTAURANTS Act and Save our Stages  Act, which would create grant programs so our restaurants and  independent entertainment venues can survive these unprecedented and  unpredictable times.  [[Page H5992]]    I urge my colleagues to come together behind a bipartisan relief bill  to protect our small businesses and local economies.                            ____________________
