 Madam President, today I would like to honor the  life and legacy of Franklyn G. Verley III, a radio host and community  leader who passed away in Las Vegas, NV, in late September at the age  of 59. Franklyn Verley will be remembered as the host of the ``Like it  is Radio'' show on Las Vegas' Power 88.1 for the past 16 years, where  he made the most of his role to highlight social, race, and economic  issues that impact the Las Vegas community every day.   Franklyn was born and raised in New York, NY, where his parents  immersed him in Black culture and the value of his roots and cultural  history. While living in New York, he was a lead sales representative  for the School and College Department for the New York Times. Once he  relocated to Las Vegas in the mid-2000s, Franklyn began his radio  career, joining the team at KCEP Power 88.1, where he hosted the ``Like  it is Radio Show.'' As a host and executive producer, he brought on a  wide range of guests, such as Senator Harry Reid, Armstrong Williams,  and Angela Bassett. His show covered topics that ranged from political,  judicial, and social issues that affected the Black community he  advocated for on a daily basis. He also became a recipient of many  awards, being inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters Association Hall of  Fame in 2019 and receiving the Fountain of Hope Community Activism  Award and the NAACP Legacy Builder Award.   Franklyn will be dearly missed by family members, friends, and the  hundreds of people whose lives he touched every day through his  advocacy and knowledge. I extend our sincerest condolences to  Franklyn's wife and the entire extended community where he made a  positive impact. His legacy lives on in each of us.                            ____________________
