 Mr. Speaker, every day law enforcement officers around this  country protect our families from harm and keep peace and promote the  cause of justice. As a former first responder myself, I am proud to  support these heroes, especially those who have paid the ultimate price  to keep our families safe.   National Police Week is a good reminder that we need to show support  and appreciation to those who serve and protect us. We set aside this  week each year to honor the call to service and profound commitment to  duty embodied in our law enforcement officers--both in southern  Illinois and across this Nation.   I join with the grateful communities around the Nation to thank our  officers and honor those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the  line of duty. We pray for them and we pray for their families as they  watch over us.                            ____________________
