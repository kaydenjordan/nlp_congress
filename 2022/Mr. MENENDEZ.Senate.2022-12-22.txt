 Mr. President, this amendment is about justice and  restitution. Twenty-one years ago, on a cloudless morning in 2001,  nearly 3,000 Americans, including 750 from my home State of New Jersey,  were senselessly murdered in the terrorist attacks on September 11.   Mr. President, 9/11 families are the reason why ``Never Forget''  continues to be a clarion call in this Congress. They are the reason we  seek a vote on the Fairness for 9/11 Families Act.   I do this alongside Senators Cotton and Sullivan, who worked with me  to bring justice and relief to also the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks  bombing victims and so many other Americans who have suffered at the  hands of state sponsors of terrorism.   Our amendment is straightforward. It expands coverage of the U.S.  Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund to deliver justice and relief  to previously excluded 9/11 families who, because of this exclusion,  lost out on the ability to get some of the compensation, as well as the  families of the victims of the Beirut Marine barracks bombing and the  Khobar Towers attack.   Many of these families have waited for years--and, in some cases,  decades--for relief, and that is what we seek today. I believe that we  can take a voice vote.   I turn to Senator Whitehouse, yield to him for a moment. I know he  wants to speak to it.    Mr. President, the committee finished a report  entitled, ``Enhancing Transparency on International Agreements and Non- Binding Instruments.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that  report be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    ENHANCING TRANSPARENCY ON INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NON-BINDING                                INSTRUMENTS         Report on section 5947, Enhancing Transparency on       International Agreements and Non-Binding Instruments, of the       James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2023, H.R. 7776.                                 I. Purpose         The Committee strongly supports robust diplomacy and       international engagement, including efforts to advance U.S.       interests through the negotiation and implementation of       international agreements and nonbinding instruments with       allies, partners, and other actors. These efforts must be       conducted with accountability to Congress and, to the       greatest extent appropriate, transparency for the public, as       both are essential to our democracy.        The Case-Zablocki Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-403; also known as       the ``Case Act'') was an important but highly-limited and       long-outdated framework for reporting on binding       international agreements. Section 5947 of H.R. 7776,       Enhancing Transparency on International Agreements and Non-      Binding Instruments, strengthens and modernizes the Case Act       and makes it applicable, for the first time, to non-binding       instruments. Even with this broadened scope, however, the       Case Act is only the starting point--a basic notification and       publication requirement. It does not replace consultation       with Congress on the development of our foreign policy or       substantive engagement with the public on commitments entered       into on behalf of the American people.                            II. Committee Action         Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch first proposed       an amendment to update the Case Act as part of the       Committee's consideration of S. 1169, the Strategic       Competition Act of 2021 (SCA). The bipartisan provision was       included as section 310 of the SCA. On May 10, 2021, the       Committee considered the SCA and ordered it reported, with an       amendment in the nature of a substitute, by a vote of 21-1.        A modified version of the Case Act reform passed the Senate       on June 8, 2021 as section 3310 of S. 1260, the United States       Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 (USICA).        The House of Representatives passed a further modified       version as section 5947 of H.R. 7776, the James M. Inhofe       National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (NDAA       or FY 23 NDAA), on December 8, 2022. The Senate subsequently       passed section 5947 as part of the NDAA on December 15, 2022.                      III. Section-by-Section Summary         A summary of the provisions of section 5947 of H.R. 7776,       follows:        Paragraph 5947(a)(1) amends 1 U.S.C. 112b as follows:        Subsection 112b(a): This subsection requires the Secretary       of State not less frequently than once each month to provide       to congressional leadership and the appropriate congressional       committees a list of all international agreements and       qualifying non-binding instruments signed, concluded, or       otherwise finalized during the prior month, as well as those       that entered into force or became operative. For such       international agreements and qualifying non-binding       instruments, the Secretary must provide the text and a       detailed description of the legal authority relied on, as       well as a description of any new or amended statutory or       regulatory authority anticipated to be required to implement       an agreement or qualified nonbinding instrument. The required       information must be provided in an unclassified form but may       include a classified annex.        Subsection l12b(b): This subsection requires the Secretary       of State to make public on the State Department website the       text of newly-operative international agreements and       qualifying non-binding instruments, with certain exceptions,       as well as the information required to be reported to       Congress under subsection 112b(a).        Subsection 112b(c): This subsection requires the Secretary       of State to provide the text of implementing agreements or       arrangements for international agreements or qualifying       nonbinding instruments, or any other documents of similar       purpose or function, whether binding or not binding, if not       otherwise required to be submitted under subsection       112b(a)(l). The text must be provided within 30 days of       receipt by the Secretary of a written communication from the       Chair or Ranking Member of either appropriate congressional       committee requesting the text.        Subsection 112b(d): This subsection requires any U.S.       Government department or agency that enters into any       international agreement or qualifying non-binding instrument       to provide the text to the Secretary of State within 15 days       of signature or conclusion, or otherwise being finalized, in       addition to a detailed description of the legal authority       that provides authorization for each qualifying non-binding       instrument to become operative after such instrument is       signed. (With regard to international agreements, the       Committee understands that the relevant agency would have       already been obligated to submit the legal authority to the       Department of State through the Circular-175 process.) This       subsection further requires such department or agency to       provide on an ongoing basis any implementing materials to the       Secretary for transmittal to congressional leadership and the       appropriate congressional committees to satisfy the       requirements of subsection 112b(c).        Subsection 112b(e): This subsection requires each U.S.       Government department or agency, including the Department of       State, which enters into any international agreement or       qualifying non-binding instrument to designate a Chief       International Agreements Officer, with particular       requirements. Further, it establishes an International       Agreements Compliance Officer at the Department of State.        Subsection 112b(f): This subsection requires the substance       of oral international agreements to be reduced to writing for       purposes of meeting requirements of subsections 112b(a) and       112b(b).        Subsection 112b(g): This subsection provides that       notwithstanding any other provision of law, an international       agreement may not be signed or otherwise concluded on behalf       of the United States, without prior consultation with the       Secretary of State. Such consultation may encompass a class       of agreements.        Subsection 112b(h): This subsection requires the       Comptroller General to conduct an audit and submit the       results to congressional leadership and appropriate       congressional committees, at least every three years for nine       years, assessing the Secretary of State's compliance with       reporting requirements under this section, in addition to       particular issues related to whether any failure  [[Page S10083]]       to comply resulted from failure or refusal by other       departments and agencies to provide necessary information or       material to the Department of State. The Comptroller General       and Secretary of State are required to make the information       publicly available.        Subsection 112b(i): This subsection requires the President       and Secretary of State to promulgate rules and regulations       that may be necessary for implementing this section.        Subsection 112b(j): This subsection expresses the sense of       Congress that the executive branch should not prescribe or       otherwise commit to specific legislative text in a treaty,       executive agreement, or non-binding instrument unless       Congress has authorized such action.        Subsection 112b(k): This subsection defines key terms       including ``appropriate congressional committees'';       ``appropriate department or agency''; ``qualifying non-      binding instrument''; and ``text'' with respect to an       international agreement or qualifying non-binding instrument.        Subsection 112b(l): This subsection includes two rules of       construction: first, that nothing in the section may be       construed to authorize the withholding from disclosure to the       public of any record if such disclosure is required by law       (e.g. pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.       552). The second rule of construction provides that nothing       in the section may be construed to require the provision to       congressional leadership or the appropriate congressional       committees of any implementing agreement, arrangement, or       document of similar purpose or function, entered into by the       Department of Defense, Armed Forces, or any element of the       intelligence community, or any implementing material       originating with the aforementioned agencies, if such       agreement, arrangement, document, or material was not       required to be provided to congressional leadership or the       appropriate congressional committees prior to date of the FY       2023 NDAA.        Paragraph 5947(a)(4) requires the Secretary of State to       establish within 270 days after enactment a mechanism for       State Department personnel who become aware or have reason to       believe that the requirements of the amended Case Act have       not been fulfilled to report such instances to the Secretary.        Paragraph 5947(a)(5) calls on the President, through the       Secretary of State, to promulgate within 180 days after       enactment rules and regulations necessary to carry out the       Case Act, as amended by this section.        Paragraph 5947(a)(6) requires the Secretary of State to       consult with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House       Foreign Affairs Committee on matters related to implementing       this section before and after the effective date in       subsection 5947(c). It further requires the Secretary to       brief, every 90 days for one year after enactment of the FY       2023 NDAA, the Committees on Foreign Relations and       Appropriations of the Senate and Committees on Foreign       Affairs and Appropriations of the House of Representatives,       on the status of efforts to implement the section and       amendments made by it.        Paragraph 5947(a)(7) authorizes to be appropriated to the       Department of State $1,000,000 for each fiscal year 2023       through 2027 for purposes of implementing the requirements of       the Case Act, as amended by section 5947.        Paragraph 5947(b) retains and updates the requirement under       Section 112a of title 1, United States Code, for the       Department of State to provide, upon request copies of       international agreements in its possession, but not       published. This subsection also expands that requirement to       apply to qualifying non-binding instruments.        Paragraph 5947(c) provides that amendments made by this       section will take effect 270 days after the date of enactment       of the FY 2023 NDAA.                               IV. Discussion         Section 5947 of H.R. 7776 is a critical bipartisan reform       of the Case Act. It reflects notable developments in practice       over the past fifty years in how the U.S. Government engages       in diplomacy through accords with other countries and       international actors. Key aspects of section 5947 include:        expanding the Case Act publication and congressional       reporting requirements to cover the text of qualifying       nonbinding instruments (QNIs);        requiring more timely reporting to Congress and publication       of the text of international agreements, and mandating that       the executive branch provide to Congress and the public       detailed information related to each particular agreement and       QNI, including the legal basis that, in the view of the       executive branch, provides authority to bring the instrument       into force;        strengthening intra-executive branch organization and       coordination on international agreements and QNIs, including       through explicitly requiring that each agency of the federal       government that enters into agreements or QNIs (1) provide       text of agreements and nonbindings to the State Department,       along with associated information, within 15 days of       signature, and (2) appoint a Chief International Agreements       Officer with responsibility for compliance with the Case Act;        providing a more complete and holistic understanding of       agreements and QNIs for the entirety of the time in which       they are in force or operational by ensuring ongoing access       for Congress to implementing materials (subject to the rule       of construction in 112b(l)(2)), and;        facilitating successful implementation of the amended Case       Act by (1) requiring that the Department of State consult       with the congressional foreign affairs committees on an       ongoing basis on matters related to such implementation, (2)       authorizing $1 million per year for fiscal years 2023 through       2027 for implementation, and (3) and mandating GAO audits of       executive branch compliance.        An informal comparison of key features of the amended Case       Act versus the law prior to enactment of section 5947 can be       found in the chart on p.9. The discussion below focuses on       one particular aspect: the expansion of the Case Act to       nonbinding instruments.                       case act coverage of nonbindings       Background        When it was enacted in 1972, the Case Act was a       groundbreaking recognition of developments to that date in       executive branch practice, namely a shift in conducting       foreign policy and reaching accords with other countries,       from Article II treaties, entered into with the Senate's       advice and consent, to executive agreements. Since then,       however, executive branch practice has shifted again, in the       direction of nonbinding instruments.        Updating the Case Act now is critical to address this       shift. Previously, there had been no uniform statutory       approach to nonbinding instruments and no standing       requirement that they be shared with Congress or, if       appropriate, e.g., not involving classified information,       shared with the public. Consequently, as such instruments       have proliferated, there has been increasingly less       visibility into the international commitments made on behalf       of the United States.        Congressional oversight on nonbindings has depended in part       on case-specific statutory requirements with respect to       particular nonbinding instruments or, in the absence of any       such law, requests from members of Congress for text and       information on specific nonbindings. The most prominent       example of a case-specific statute is the Iran Nuclear       Agreement Review Act of 2015, P.L. 114-17 which ensured that       Congress had access to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action       (JCPOA).        This ad hoc approach is not sustainable or acceptable,       especially given the increasing reliance on nonbindings.       Passing case specific legislation is a difficult, uncertain,       and time-consuming endeavor that devours scarce legislative       resources, yet covers only the tiniest fraction of the       executive branch's expansive nonbinding practice. On the       other hand, when there is not a specific statutory mandate       for the executive branch to engage Congress on a nonbinding,       the Committee's experience demonstrates that it cannot expect       to receive basic information in a timely manner or on a       consistent basis. Further, there have been instances when the       executive branch has simply denied or refused to take any       action on basic requests to provide the final text of       nonbindings signed with foreign governments. Expansion of the       Case Act to cover nonbindings is intended to address this       obvious gap in U.S. law.       DEFINITION OF QUALIFYING NON-BINDING INSTRUMENT IN SECTION 5947         The requirements of section 5947 apply to ``qualifying       nonbinding instruments'' (QNI). That term is defined as those       nonbindings that ``could reasonably be expected to have a       significant impact on the foreign policy of the United       States,'' as well as those that are the subject of a written       communication from the Chair or Ranking Member of either of       the congressional foreign affairs committees to the Secretary       of State.        The Committee anticipates that the State Department will       promulgate a regulation or share informal guidance for       purposes of executive branch implementation and application       of the ``significant impact'' standard. During the       negotiation of section 5947, the Committee shared its view       that the executive branch must ultimately assess the totality       of the facts and circumstances in determining whether a       particular nonbinding meets the significant impact standard.       That view has not changed.        Factors the Committee expects to be considered as part of       the analysis include, but are not limited to, whether a       nonbinding is politically significant or if there is       congressional or public interest in the instrument, as well       as if implementation of the nonbinding (1) affects the rights       or responsibilities of American citizens or individuals in       the United States; (2) impacts State laws; (3) has budgetary       or appropriations impact; (4) requires changes to U.S. law to       satisfy commitments made therein, or; (5) presents a non-      trivial degree of commitment or risk for the entire Nation.       The Committee views the presence of any of those factors as       relevant and militating in favor of treatment of an       instrument as a QNI and urges the State Department to include       them in the implementing regulations or interagency guidance       for the amended Case Act.        The Committee notes that whether a non-binding instrument       could reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on       the United States cannot be dictated by comparison to those       highly publicized non-binding instruments that were shared       with Congress prior to enactment of this legislation, e.g.,       the JCPOA and the U.S.-Taliban Agreement. Those instruments       were profoundly and extraordinarily significant and therefore       do not set the bar for what constitutes mere significance.       Nor should significance be determined by the form or       structure of an instrument or the number of participants       involved--the Committee expects that both bilateral and       multilateral nonbindings will meet the standard, as will       nonbindings that share a form and structure similar to a       binding agreement and those that do not. Finally, the       Committee notes that while a non-  [[Page S10084]]       binding on a purely technical matter may not on its own rise       to the level of ``significant impact,'' particular       circumstances could lead to even technical nonbindings having       a significant impact on foreign policy--e.g. if a nonbinding,       although technical in nature, were of particular importance       to a bilateral relationship.        The Committee appreciates that there will inevitably be       close calls on whether a particular nonbinding meets the       ``significant impact'' standard. In these situations, the       Committee strongly encourages the executive branch to apply       the standard liberally and err on the side of inclusion and       engagement, treating the nonbinding as a QNI for purposes of       the Case Act.        As noted above, the definition of QNI also includes any       nonbinding that is the subject of a written communication       from the chair or ranking member of either of the       congressional foreign affairs committees to the Secretary of       State. By design, a communication under this provision is not       limited to a single nonbinding and does not require the chair       or ranking member to specifically name or identify a       nonbinding in the communication to the Secretary.        Finally, the definition of QNI includes an important       carveout. At the urging of the executive branch, nonbindings       that are signed, become operational, or are implemented with       authorities relied upon by the Department of Defense, the       U.S. Armed Forces, or any element of the intelligence       community are excluded from the definition of QNI, and       therefore from coverage under the amended Case Act. As with       almost all legislation, section 5947 is the product of       compromise: The Committee understood that this carveout was       necessary in order for section 5947 to be enacted, and       encourages the congressional armed services and intelligence       committees to conduct oversight related to the nonbindings of       those agencies.                               V. Conclusion         The Committee looks forward to working with the Department       of State and other executive branch agencies to ensure a       smooth transition and ongoing successful implementation of       the amended Case Act. At the request of the executive branch,       the amendments in section 5947 do not take effect until 270       days after the date of enactment of H.R. 7776. This feature       gives the executive branch ample time to prepare for and       ensure full implementation of the Case Act reforms beginning       on the effective date.        The Committee expects that this reform will provide a       richer tapestry of information that allows for greater       understanding of the use of international accords as a       foreign policy tool. Greater congressional input and public       insight will lead to a stronger and more sustainable foreign       policy.        While an important starting point for executive branch       engagement with Congress and the public, the Case Act is just       that--a starting point--particularly with Congress. The State       Department is required to keep the Committee fully and       currently informed about its activities both so that the       Committee may discharge its constitutional oversight       responsibilities and as required by statute; other executive       branch agencies and departments are required to provide       information to the Committee upon request. Fulfilling those       obligations requires the executive branch to proactively       engage with the Committee at a stage well before the text of       an agreement or nonbinding is signed and the amended Case Act       obligations attach.

Zendegi. Azadi.        Jin, Jiyan, Azadi.    ``Women, life, freedom.''   These words of protest have echoed through Iran's streets and across  the world for 4 months--because 4 months ago, the Iranian Morality  Police arrested Mahsa Amini at a highway entrance in Tehran. Their  charge? Not wearing her hijab ``properly.'' They stopped her. They  forced her into their van. They beat this 22-year-old woman until she  was brain dead. And when word of her death got out, the chanting and  protests began.   I rise today to express my profound disappointment that the Senate  has failed to pass S.Con. Res. 47, which commends the bravery of these  Iranian protestors who have stood their ground against the Iranian  regime for over 100 days--and counting. We have seen women defiantly  burn their hijabs and cut off their hair in public. We have seen  Iranian soccer players on the global stage at the World Cup risk  everything to stand in solidarity with their brothers and sisters back  home. We have seen famous Iranian actors and actresses, singers and  other popular figures, refuse to back down, even as the regime has  arrested them--like Amir Nasr-Azadani, Taraneh Alidoosti, Toomaj  Salehi, Mona Borzouee, Mahmoud Shariari, and so many others that I  could name. We have seen ordinary Iranians of all walks of life risk  imprisonment and death to gather in squares and march through the  streets to confront the misogyny of this regime--too many to name  here--but we must remember their names.   How has the Iranian regime responded? With tear gas, with torture,  with live gunfire and death. They have killed hundreds of protestors  and arrested tens of thousands more. As someone who has been closely  following the Iranian regime for over three decades since my time as a  Representative in the House, their actions don't come as a surprise. We  all know how brutal the Iranian regime has been both at home and  abroad. We see it with Iranian drones that are killing Ukrainians. We  see it in the missiles aimed at our Gulf partners and Americans in the  region, in the threats to wipe Israel off the map. We see it in the  assassination attempts on former U.S. officials.   For decades, the Iranian regime has repressed and tortured anyone who  opposes them. They have massacred innocent political prisoners. And  now--on full display across social media--we are seeing how ruthless  and desperate they are to keep their grip on power. The only difference  between their violent actions in the past and those unfolding this year  is that, despite the internet shutdowns, today, the world is watching  the events unfold in real time.   According to the organization Iranian Human Rights, the regime has  killed over 600 people, including dozens of minors, and detained at  least 18,500 people since protests began in September. Eighteen  thousand--that is about the same as the population of Weehawken, NJ. In  less than 1 week, the Iranian regime hanged two protestors without due  process after sham trials alleged they ``waged war against God.''  Majidreza Rhanavard and Mohsen Shekari, they both were 23. The regime  has sentenced at least 11 others to death, the majority of them in  their 20s. Reports suggest at least 30 others are facing sham charges  that could carry the death penalty as well.   The world sees clearly the depravity of this regime. That is due to  the incredible bravery of the Iranians who are speaking out. And we  need to stand shoulder to shoulder with them because, contrary to what  some may say, it is not American meddling in internal Iranian politics  to support the Iranian protestors. It is not American meddling when we  raise up Iranian voices. These are voices coming from those inside Iran  who are risking everything to pursue their basic human rights, when  they know they are putting it all on  [[Page S10087]]  the line. They know the nature of the regime they confront. And they go  out into the streets anyway. They do it today, even as the regime shuts  down internet access inside the country, so the world cannot see. But  the United States and the international community cannot be silent in  the face of their courage. We cannot look away.   Speaking up when we see the spilling of protesters' blood is the very  least we must do. And that is why I rise today to express deep  disappointment that my colleagues did not join me in passing S. Con.  Res. 47. The resolution calls on the international community and the  private sector to look for every opportunity to support the protesters.  It calls for cooperation to hold the regime accountable as it  represses, detains, and murders its citizens. This resolution is not  controversial. Indeed, it is the minimum message that the U.S. Congress  should be sending.   But we all need to do more. That is why I introduced this resolution  to amplify the voices of Iranian protestors around the world using  social media and other technologies, as well as American surrogate  networks. It is why I think the United States needs to be raising this  issue in every international forum--as we have successfully done in the  UN Human Rights Council and the UN Commission on the Status of Women.   But we should not stop there. We should be using the tools we have to  help circumvent the regime's efforts to jam communications of its own  people. And we should invoke the Global Magnitsky Human Rights  Accountability Act and other provisions against those who are  perpetrating these heinous acts.   No one should underestimate the deep and real grievances of Iranian  protestors. Their chants against the Iranian regime reflect decades of  pent-up frustration. That sense of desperate longing for the kinds of  things many of us take for granted comes through in the viral protest  song ``Baraye'' by Shervin Hajipour, a musician that the Iranian regime  also has detained. The Iranian protestors' demands for justice and  fundamental rights are inspirational, especially in the face of the  Iranian regime's response.   All they want is to live life in peace and prosperity. So let's keep  standing shoulder to shoulder with the protesters as they stand up to  the regime's human rights violations and violence. Let's help them keep  fighting against the senseless repression of women and girls. Let's  keep the world's eyes on Tehran's ruthlessness.   And remember the lyrics of Baraye: Women. Life. Freedom.   Because if we do, we not only honor the memory of Mahsa Amini and  every Iranian yearning for freedom and justice, we honor our own  democratic values and principles which we all hold so dear.   We have not done that today. This is no time for hesitation or  equivocation. I urge my colleagues to join me in ensuring quick passage  of similar legislation in the new congressional session.                            ____________________
