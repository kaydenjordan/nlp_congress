 Madam Speaker, I rise today to reflect on  moral character, which is essential to the promise of America in order  for us to flourish.   I am reminded that we stand on the shoulders of so many who have gone  before us and impacted our lives in many ways--members of our greatest  generation--who bravely fought tyranny and oppression during World War  II. They were driven by honor, duty, and country. They were selfless,  not drawing attention to themselves or seeking to be a celebrity or a  hero. They are the models for character that we must always celebrate  and remember. They would never admit it, but they are heroes, heroes  for bravely and humbly doing their part to protect our freedom.   Madam Speaker, why is character so important? Why does it matter? It  is because our character--who we are and the decisions that we make  when we are tested--is foundational to the rule of law.   In this body, we talk a lot about the Constitution, our God-given  rights, bills and laws, checks and balances, the rules and the  procedures that govern debate, the branches that make up this  government, and so on. All of these pieces of our government are  significant, but they are lifeless and have no meaning without the  spirit of good faith.   If we, representatives of the people, don't lead with moral  character, America doesn't stand a chance against corruption and the  breakdown of trust with the people we serve. It is on us, each one of  us, doing our part for what is righteous, what is just, and for what  will keep America free.   President Reagan once said:         Freedom isn't passed down to us in the bloodstream; it has       to be fought for.    In other words, freedom involves choices, and that is precisely why  character matters.   Every single day, every single moment, our character is tested. In  politics, it is tested by the temptations of power, palace intrigue,  ambition, and personalities.   I won't blame either side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, but these are  the smoldering fires that burn around us that threaten our institutions  and our laws.   Did you know that only 3 percent of Americans trust the government  will do the right thing--3 percent. Forty-six percent of Americans say  that they have very little confidence in Congress. That is a crisis of  confidence, and it is a call for reformation of character, so that  people will trust and can trust that their representatives will always  act in good faith on their behalf.   Again, it starts with us being better examples, not for the glory or  the recognition, but because it is the right thing to do. We must be  countercultural to the divisiveness that has taken hold of modern  politics today. That means stopping the blame game, honoring another's  argument, even when we disagree, and acknowledging, and even  celebrating, our differences without attacking the other side's  character. That is the way that we will come together to find out how  we can make tough decisions without kicking the can down the road.   I fear what may come if things do not change. As Abraham Lincoln  famously said, ``A House divided against itself cannot stand.'' The  strength of our Nation, our Constitution, our laws, and our  institutions have no greater guardians than us. It is this government  of  [[Page H4017]]  the people, by the people, and for the people.   We must take this responsibility seriously or, again, we won't have a  fighting chance to rebuild the trust of ``we, the people'' and keep the  promise of America alive. I have said it before in the well of this  House: this is the promise that will keep us free and empower the next  generation to shine. For their sake, our character, the spirit that  leads us to do what is right and just, must be our guide so our House  will forever stand.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the bold trailblazers like Susan B. Anthony, a pro-life woman and  Republican, and others like Emma Smith DeVoe and May Arkwright Hutton,  who both led the suffrage movement in Washington State.   It was exactly 100 years ago today that this body passed a  constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. Its leaders  like Susan B. Anthony and others have inspired generations of women to  live their dreams, to be courageous, and to be risk-takers. They fought  in search of a more perfect union to make sure the promise of America  was available to women of all walks of life so that we, the people, are  able to make our voices heard.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for them. I am honored to stand here  today, 100 years later. Their legacy reminds us all why we are  empowered to do our part and write the next chapter of America's  history.                            ____________________
