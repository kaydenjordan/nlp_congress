 Mr. Chairman, it is great to be able to speak on this. I  am grateful to Mr. Westerman. We share a great deal of interests, and  Mr. Thompson.   As far as the endangered species, I remember hearing about how this  little spotted owl only could mate in virgin forests, and then it turns  out some pair were reported to have mated in a Kmart sign. But  endangered species will do best in managed forests where we clear  underbrush and where we make fire lanes--where we manage the forests.  The forests do better, and you stop the wildfires.   If you want to just leave it to nature, nature will destroy massive  numbers of acres of land. So we have a responsibility. Even in the  Garden of Eden when things were perfect, God said to tend the garden.   So I appreciate the time, and I also appreciate the chairman's  willingness to address the issue of the stewardship program so counties  don't get messed over.
