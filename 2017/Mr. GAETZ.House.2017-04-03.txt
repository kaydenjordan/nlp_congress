 Mr. Speaker, our great ally Australia has long been the  leading voice in the world to end commercial whaling. I rise to let  them know that they are not alone and to announce the filing of  bipartisan legislation to support an end to commercial whaling.   Another of our valued allies, Japan, unfortunately continues this  depraved practice. In fact, the Japanese whaling fleet has just  returned home, having killed 333 Antarctic minke whales.   Despite the global ban on commercial whaling, Japan continues the  slaughter on the seas under a thinly veiled claim of research. Research  into whales is important, but all available science shows that this  research can be conducted with nonlethal testing and biopsies.   The Japan whale hunt isn't about research. It is about whale meat. In  2012, a Japanese minister even commented that the minke whale offers  great flavor and aroma as sashimi. I think that is disgusting.   The Japanese whalers shoot the world's majestic mammals with  exploding harpoons and electric lances. Death can often take hours.   Commercial and fake research hunting of whales must end. I thank  Australia for its leadership. I ask Japan to be honest with the world  and end this barbaric practice.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise to speak on an issue important to so many Floridians, and that  is the Florida Everglades. The Everglades are Florida. They are as  iconic as the Blue Angels, the space shuttle, and even the orange. No  one in Florida is unaffected by the fate of the Everglades. This is why  I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in encouraging  President Trump to remain focused on Everglades restoration.   Congress has invested in these projects before, and the Everglades  ecosystem is improving as a result. But there is debate about how to  proceed. In short, the question is: Should the government buy more  Everglades land?   I say no. Forty-two percent of the land in south Florida is already  owned by the government. We should get the government out of the real  estate business, not deeper into it.   Instead of a land buy, we must finish the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan. Since 2000, this plan has enjoyed bipartisan support.  Taxpayer dollars go toward important environmental work. The plan  respects private property rights, doesn't harm agricultural communities  who play a critical role in Florida's economies, and advances the cause  of restoration.   Florida's Everglades are a national treasure. We can't afford to lose  them. Finishing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan will  ensure that our river of grass will be around for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I take particular pride in thanking both Congressmen  Rooneys from my State for their outstanding leadership.
