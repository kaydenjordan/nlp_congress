 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  contributions of Lieutenant Commander Michael J. Hall to his community,  country, and the fight against COVID-19.   Service to one's country is rarely convenient, particularly not for a  father of four with a thriving orthopedic surgery practice. Yet, in  September 2019, Dr. Hall overcame adversity to join the Navy Reserve at  the age of 48.   Earlier that year, one of Mike's boys showed interest in joining the  Navy. A concerned father, Dr. Hall wanted to speak directly to the  recruiter. By the end of the call, he inquired about joining himself.   Just 6 months after his commissioning, Dr. Hall was given 36 hours'  notice to voluntarily deploy to hard-hit New York City, wearing the  only uniform he had without having even completed his basic officer  training.   While many of us were scrambling to buy toilet paper, Dr. Hall fought  an unknown virus in a makeshift ICU unit with dozens of intubated  patients.   Now a seasoned veteran of this pandemic with a deployment under his  belt, Dr. Hall is finally attending his basic officer training. No  amount of instruction can teach the qualities that Mike Hall already  personifies: honor, courage, and commitment, not when it was  convenient, but when it mattered most.   Inspired by his father, Mike's son has now also joined the military,  building on a new family vision formed in a makeshift ICU ward during a  very dark spring in New York City.   Dr. Hall, I thank you for your service, and Mrs. Hall, I thank you  even more for your service. You have made Ogden proud.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern  with this lands package.   I was elected just this past November, with many of my freshmen  colleagues, and I am sincere in my commitment to work with my  Democratic colleagues on the Committee on Natural Resources. However,  the majority is pushing legislation with significant environmental and  economic costs for the American people without a markup or hearing.   The work that was done in the 116th Congress or before is great. We  are in the 117th Congress now, and I sincerely would like to have had  that opportunity. I was excited to be able to put forth some amendments  to this.   This package disregards input from local and State officials, puts  our lands at greater risk for wildfires, and threatens livelihoods for  those who work in extractive industries at a time when our country is  financially hurting from the pandemic.  [[Page H701]]    Mr. Speaker, this style of policymaking is unsustainable, and it has  major ramifications for Utahns. The policies that result from H.R. 803  will impact jobs and recreation and restrict local input over our  lands.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I oppose H.R. 803. But I stand here  hopeful that we can come together and find common ground.
