 Mr. President, just before the July recess, the Senate  confirmed the nomination of Dr. Christopher J. Scolese to serve as  Director of the National Reconnaissance Office, NRO. I doubt there is  any individual more qualified for the job. I supported the nomination,  but it was bittersweet because Chris has left his post as Director of  NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. Chris was the  longest serving Director in Goddard's illustrious history.   Chris is well-suited to run the NRO. To put the matter simply, he  knows how to put stuff into space and make it work. I will provide just  one example: the Terra mission. Chris was the project manager. Terra  was supposed to be a 5-year Earth science mission that has now lasted  20 years. Terra explores the connections between Earth's atmosphere,  land, snow and ice, ocean, and energy balance to further our  understanding of our home planet.   I know the NRO is headquartered in Virginia, but with Chris at the  helm, we Marylanders will consider it part of our State, just as we  consider the Wallops Flight Facility to be part of Maryland. I was down  at Wallops on April 17 for the successful commercial resupply services,  CRS launch to the International Space Station and I visited Goddard on  March 4 to discuss the impact of the 35-day government shutdown and the  budget picture going forward with Chris and the Goddard workforce.   Chris certainly has the academic credentials for the job. He holds a  bachelor of science degree in electrica1 and computer engineering from  the State University of New York at Buffalo, and he earned a master's  degree in electrical and computer engineering and a Ph.D. in systems  engineering from George Washington University. After Chris earned his  bachelor's degree, ADM Hyman Rickover personally selected him to serve  at Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA, where he worked on the  development of instrument and multi-processor systems for the U.S. Navy  and the Department of Energy. I think anyone who could pass muster with  Admiral Rickover can handle just about anything, including running the  NRO.   Chris's stint in the Nuclear Navy from 1978 to 1986 was just the  beginning of a long, distinguished career in public service. In 1987,  he joined Goddard's Earth Science team and became Earth Science Program  Manager and Deputy Director of Flight Projects. Later, he moved to NASA  Headquarters as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Science for 3  years before returning to Goddard where he rose to become Deputy  Director. Chris then returned to NASA Headquarters, first as Chief  Engineer and then as Associate Administrator, which is the top civil  servant at the Agency. He served as Acting Administrator from January  to July of 2009. He went back to Goddard, where he became Director in  2012.   I think. that moving over to the helm of NRO is a natural fit for  Chris since Goddard manages many of NASA's space telescope programs,  including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey  Telescope, WFIRST, that have a technology heritage from NRO's  satellites.   I have enjoyed getting to know and working with Chris over the past  several years. He developed great relationships with the Maryland  delegation and with local officials. He is a subject matter expert and  an excellent manager. He has an upbeat, amiable, and collegial  personality that brings out the best in the people who work with him.  Goddard employees from custodians and bus drivers to Nobel laureates  felt free to engage with Chris. He listens and relates to everyone as a  colleague. Former Dodgers' manager Leo Durocher famously said that nice  guys finish last. He didn't know Chris. Chris is a genuinely nice guy  who has come out on top, and deservedly so.   Chris instituted a culture of diversity and inclusion at Goddard, and  I am sure he will do the same at NRO. He is committed to inspiring the  next generation. He has a great interest in STEM and talking with  students. Goddard hosted over 500 interns every year while Chris was  Director. He routinely referred students and young adults whom he met  to Goddard's education director so they could learn more about working  at Goddard. He has been committed to early career professionals and  always included their voice in senior staff retreats. Above all, Chris  is a dedicated public servant with the accolades and awards to prove  it, including the 2018 American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics  Von Karman Award, the Presidential Rank Award of Meritorious Executive,  and the NASA Distinguished Leadership Medal, among many others.   Whenever we talk about public servants, it is important to mention  their spouses and other family members whose own sacrifices enable and  support that service. I would be remiss if I failed to mention Chris's  wife, Dianne, and their children: daughter Jenni and her husband Mark;  son Dan and his wife Maura and their daughter Maddie who is Chris and  Dianne's granddaughter; daughter Lauren and her fiance Ian; and  daughter Anna.   Chris may be from New York, and he may live and now work in Virginia,  but we Marylanders will always consider him as one of our own, and we  are grateful for his distinguished service to our Nation. I have no  doubt that he will be a superb NRO Director.                            ____________________
