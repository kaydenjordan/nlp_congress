 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from  Pennsylvania for yielding.  [[Page H1360]]    Madam Speaker, the Biden administration is breaking all the wrong  records. Just this week, oil prices surged to a 14-year high, and gas  prices topped $4 a gallon nationwide, hitting an all-time high.   Americans are spending more to heat their homes, put gas in their  cars, and to run their businesses.   Yet, the Biden administration through all of this has refused to get  behind American oil and natural gas producers. Instead, we are back to  the days of begging OPEC and adversarial nations for oil.   America's energy needs can be achieved right here at home; a cleaner,  more affordable option than importing it from Russia or other nations  who don't have our best interests in mind.   President Biden is so fixated on dismantling American energy  independence and imposing a radical Green New Deal that he has lost  sight of what is best for the American people.   This administration's continued assault on American energy must end.   There is only one path that leads to lower energy costs and a  stronger future for America. That path is American energy independence  and dominance.
