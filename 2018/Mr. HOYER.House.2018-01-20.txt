 Mr. Speaker, the Trump travesty continues, as it has for  the last 12 months. We have heard our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle talk about the Children's Health Insurance Program. They are  very concerned about its passage. Bring it to the floor. It will pass.  And I guarantee you it will pass in the Senate.   Your Speaker, our Speaker, said: ``We will advance major legislation  one issue at a time.''   Mr. Speaker, that is not what the bill you put on this floor did. It  is not what the bill that is on the Senate floor did.   You are right. There is no controversy. Government should not be  shutting down. It is the Trump confrontation and chaos that continues.  That is why this government is shut down, and the American people are  rightfully upset with every one of us; not just Republicans, not just  Democrats. They are upset that their government is not working.   Mr. Speaker, bring these issues one at a time to this floor, and some  will pass and some will not.   My time has expired, but the people's time is expiring. Let us do our  work one issue at a time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

On this roll call, 377 Members have recorded  their presence.   A quorum is present.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me say at the outset, we ought to both  put sanctimony aside. Both sides are accusing one another of closing  down the government.   Mr. Speaker, you voted to close down the government, and then you  voted against opening it up.   Both sides have accused the other of doing what they have done.   Now, the fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, we are here because we  have not succeeded in passing the appropriations bills and sending them  to the  [[Page H594]]  President. That is why we need a continuing resolution.   My Republican friends are in charge of the House. My Republican  friends are in charge of the Senate, and they are in charge of the  White House. We have not passed a single appropriations bill.   My view is, we have not done so because we have been unwilling to  compromise. That is what this is about. It is about Republicans,  frankly, being unwilling, in our opinion, to work together to get to  agreement.   We don't want this shutdown. Our Republican friends say they don't  want the shutdown, and we have said from the beginning that we are  ready to work across the aisle to prevent it. In fact, the Republicans  have had four opportunities. One hundred percent of the Democrats voted  for a 90-day CR to give us time to get to agreement on appropriations  bills and a level of funding.   Mr. Speaker, you know that. We have been talking about that for some  time. We have not come to agreement. Therefore, we find ourselves here,  notwithstanding the fact that we agree on a lot. We have asked to  adhere to parity. Mr. Speaker, as you know, it is the process that you  agreed with Senator Murray that we have followed for the last 4 years.  All we are asking is, let's follow it again. That is why we are here,  because we have not been able to get such an agreement.   We have also asked that we be able to protect--at the request of the  President of the United States--DREAMers, put something on the floor,  as he said, and send it to him, and he would sign it. We want to  reauthorize the CHIP program, the community health centers, and other  health programs. We agree on that.   The American public has got to be so distressed that they see this  going on on this floor of the House.   We want to provide disaster relief to those in Texas, those in  Florida, those in Puerto Rico, those in the Virgin Islands, and, yes,  those who have been subjected to fires in the West.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues who are in  the majority and control the legislative process: end this shutdown.  Use the authority you are asking for under this rule to bring to the  floor the items on which we agree.                                time  1730    Mr. Speaker, you have said you would do that, take the tough issues  head-on one at a time. I admired that statement. I will tell my friend,  the Speaker of the House, that I will admire even more the performance.   Speaker Ryan said, in 2012: ``We will not duck the tough issues. We  will not kick the can down the road. We will lead. We will not blame  others . . . .''   Mr. Speaker, I ask you to do just that. Stop ignoring your  responsibility as the majority party to keep the government open and  serve the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 4872, the End  the Shutdown Act of 2018, a continuing resolution through Tuesday that  would immediately reopen the government while negotiations continue on  a budget agreement that adheres to parity, reauthorizing the Children's  Health Insurance Program and other critical healthcare programs,  addressing the issue of DREAMers as was requested by the President of  the United States, and providing assistance to Americans impacted by  natural disasters.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland will state his  parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, I am stretching the parliamentary inquiry,  the nature of this, but did the Speaker hear Mr. Meadows objecting to  my unanimous consent request?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The request was not even entertained.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, if we had entertained my unanimous consent request, we  could have accomplished all that the gentleman from Oregon, the  chairman of the committee, just discussed.   I will remind you that the reason Democrats voted against it was  because you took the money for children's health out of children's  health. You decreased the prevention trust fund by some $6 billion  which had, in part, inoculation for children against disease. We  thought robbing from Peter to pay Paul was not a good policy to pursue.     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
