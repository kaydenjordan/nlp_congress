 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent  southeast Louisiana in Congress, a region that is rightfully famous for  its community, its culture, and its incredible food.   Around 9,000 restaurants in Louisiana applied for the Restaurant  Revitalization Act in the American Rescue Plan. Less than 3,000  received funding. It is clear, the need to replenish this legislation  is great and must happen.   Today, we will continue to fight for the help of small businesses and  families during the pandemic as we pass the Restaurant Revitalization  Fund Replenishment Act, providing an additional $60 million for the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund.   Louisiana thrives on tourism and hospitality, and the restaurant  sector is critical in the State's economy. I am so grateful that this  bill now includes provisions that I proposed in the bipartisan MUSIC  Act, which would include members of the entertainment industry, like  live event companies who have yet to have access to industry-specific  economic relief funding.   I am proud to vote ``yes'' today and stand with small businesses that  strengthen and enrich our local economies.
