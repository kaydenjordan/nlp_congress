 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate First Sergeant  Ian McClure, U.S. Army, for being named the 2018 Allied Command  Operations Military Member of the Year.   A 2003 graduate of East High School in Cheyenne, Wyoming, First  Sergeant McClure went on to serve in the Army Special Forces in  Afghanistan, Iraq, and Mali, and he is now stationed at NATO Special  Operations headquarters in Belgium.   First Sergeant McClure was selected for this award because of his  superior performance and professional excellence. I am proud that  General Scaparrotti recognized First Sergeant McClure's significant  contributions to the success of alliance operations.   Sergeant McClure exemplifies the best that Wyoming and our country  has to offer, and I thank him for his service and his sacrifices for  our freedom.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to congratulate First Sergeant Ian  McClure on this prestigious honor and for being a brilliant example for  the entire State of Wyoming.                            ____________________
