 Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (David Price), and I ask unanimous consent that he be  allowed to control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure, and I thank  the Speaker for his words.   I want to start by thanking Chairman Ed Royce, who authored this  resolution. I am proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor and glad to  say that more than 30 Democrats representing a  [[Page H148]]  broad cross-section of our party have signed on as cosponsors of this  bipartisan legislation.   Ed Royce and I have worked together for the past 4 years, and we  believe that foreign policy should be bipartisan and that partisanship  should stop at the water's edge. Frankly, this is what we are doing  today. We are condemning what happened because we think it is unfair  and unjust.   I want to also mention that I join with my friend from North Carolina  (Mr. Price) in authoring an amendment to this resolution that wasn't  accepted which emphasizes a two-state solution. I want to thank Mr.  Price for his hard work on that approach, and I support it. We talk in  this resolution about a two-state solution as well.   Mr. Speaker, throughout its entire history, the State of Israel has  never gotten a fair shake from the United Nations. Year after year  after year, member states manipulate the U.N. to bully our ally,  Israel, to pile on with one-sided resolutions, placing all of the blame  for the ongoing conflict on Israel.   We saw a resolution like this come before the Security Council a few  weeks ago, and today the House of Representative will go on record  saying that that U.N. resolution is wrong, plain and simple. And  frankly, we should not have voted for that.   The Security Council resolution is highly critical of Israel yet asks  nothing directly of the Palestinians. That is biased, that is unfair,  and that is not balanced. Again, we should have opposed it. We should  have vetoed it.   The language about Jerusalem is not new but it remains deeply  offensive to Jews, whose holiest site lies on the Temple Mount in East  Jerusalem. The Kotel, the Holy Western Wall, is simply nonoccupied  territory. And it is offensive to hear that.   So in the measure the House is considering today, we repudiate this  flawed Security Council resolution. And at the same time, we will say  once again that we support a two-state solution, that the only way to  reach that goal is through direct negotiations between the Israelis and  the Palestinians, and that this shameful Security Council resolution  put that goal further out of reach.   Mr. Speaker, the international community faces the longest  suppressing issues: mass killings in South Sudan, a crisis in Yemen, a  humanitarian disaster in Syria, Russia's illegal occupation of the  Ukraine, and North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Yet, rather than  deal with those critical problems, the member states of the U.N. have  chosen instead to use the international body to embarrass Israel. It is  outrageous. This House Resolution that I am cosponsoring with Mr. Royce  rightfully says that it is outrageous.    I think it was a mistake for the current administration to abstain on  this vote in the U.N. I have been very clear about that, but I want to  be fair. Before anyone turns this into another attack on President  Obama, we should be aware of the history of this issue.   This is the first time in 8 years the Obama administration has  allowed a resolution, opposed by Israel, to go forward. The George Bush  administration allowed it to happen 6 times; the Clinton  administration, 3 times; the first Bush administration, 6 times; and  the Reagan administration, 10 times, including voting for one strongly  condemning Israel for its ``premeditated and unprecedented attack of  aggression'' when it wisely destroyed Iraq's nuclear weapons reactor in  1981.   But regardless of that history, it doesn't justify these latest  abstentions. My mother used to say that two wrongs don't make a right.  And she was right. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now.   I think allowing governments to bully Israel and the U.N. is a  mistake, no matter who is in power. Instead, let's focus on what we  should be doing when it comes to advancing the two-state solution.   This resolution calls for us to get back to the policy that many of  us support: one, standing with Israel and the United Nations; two,  stopping one-sided resolutions; and three, supporting direct  negotiations as the only way to move toward a two-state solution.   This resolution says all that. Every one in this Congress should be  voting for it because it is balanced. I am pleased to support this  resolution, and I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), my good friend and senior member of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs.  [[Page H150]]                                     time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Rosen), one of our new Members, who has made support for  Israel part of her entire life and is giving her first speech on the  House floor in support of this resolution and support of Israel.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of New York (Mr. Suozzi), another new Member of Congress  who is also making his maiden speech about the security of Israel and  the U.S.-Israel partnership.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. David Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider). We are pleased that he is back.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my great pleasure to yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of  the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), my friend on the Foreign Affairs  Committee and the ranking member of the Middle East Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   When an unfair, one-sided resolution moves forward in the U.N., as  Israel's ally, we have an obligation to say it is wrong. That is what  this resolution does. This resolution also calls for a two-state  solution. So my colleagues who are somehow portraying this resolution  as not being for a two-state resolution, they are absolutely wrong.   I urge my colleagues, especially my Democratic colleagues, to  continue to support the U.S.-Israel alliance, and you continue to  support it by voting for this resolution. This is a fair resolution.   Let's remember, when Israel left Gaza and uprooted settlements, what  did it get in return? Not peace, but terrorism. Stand with the people  of Israel. Vote ``yes'' on this resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.
