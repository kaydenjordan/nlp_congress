 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Nadler.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with Mr. Gianforte and with Mr. Cuellar. We have  outstanding men and women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I am  not going to do anything to disparage the many good men and women that  we have, but I will never, never support these abominable policies  coming out of the Trump administration that tear families apart, that  these men and women are having to implement because the White House has  decided they are going to go into the immigrant communities and tear  them apart.   This is a piece of legislation that is not necessary, and I say that  to my friends on the Republican side. We support the good men and women  in law enforcement as Democrats, but I will not support any of these  policies or even look like I am supporting any of the immigration  policies of this President. They are terrible, and they are hurting  this country.   I urge a vote of ``present'' on this particular piece of legislation.
