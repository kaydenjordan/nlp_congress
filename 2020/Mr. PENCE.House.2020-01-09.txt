 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand in firm support of  President Trump's leadership in his decisive actions against evil  terrorists.   America and the world are safer without Qasem Soleimani. Not only is  America safer, it is more prosperous than ever before and now energy  independent.   The Iranian regime would be wise to not further test this President's  mettle and the overwhelming capabilities of the greatest fighting force  the world has ever known: our U.S. military.                   Honoring the Life of General Paul Kelley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of General  P.X. Kelley. General Kelley was the embodiment of the Marine Corps. His  distinguished record inspired me, the marines with whom I served, and  will continue to inspire marines for generations to come.   In Vietnam, General Kelley earned the Silver Star, the Legion of  Merit with Valor, and two Bronze Stars with Valor.   As commandant, he led the Corps during the dark days following the  1983 Iran-backed bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut.  General Kelley's leadership inspired every marine to hold true to the  values of the Corps. I am terribly saddened by the passing of General  Kelley, but I will be forever grateful of serving under his command.   Semper fi.     Congratulating Gatorade Indiana Football Player of the Year Charlie                                   Spegal     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate an exemplary student- athlete, Charlie Spegal.   Charlie was recently named the Gatorade Indiana Football Player of  the Year. He has had an outstanding football career, holding the all- time State career record in rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and  career touchdowns.   Finishing with 10,867 career rushing yards and 175 touchdowns, he did  this while maintaining above a 3.5 GPA. Charlie has been a role model  for student athletes everywhere.   I congratulate Charlie on his wonderful career throughout high school  and wish him the best of luck in college.      Remembering the Life of American Hero Charles ``Red'' Whittington     Mr. Speaker I rise today to remember the life of American  Hero Charles ``Red'' Whittington.   Red served in France during World War II as a member of the 377th  Infantry Regiment and the 95th Infantry Division.   His regiment was given the nickname ``Iron Men of Metz'' for their  fierce liberation in defense of the town of Metz from German  counterattacks.   Whittington was the recipient of a Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts,  the Combat Infantryman Badge, the European Theater of Operations  Campaign Medal with two battle stars, a Good Conduct medal and the  Victory Medal.   I give my deepest condolences to the Whittington family and hope they  find comfort in knowing that Charles ``Red'' Whittington was a true  American hero.     Congratulating South Dearborn High School on Reimplementing FFA Ag                                  Program     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate South Dearborn High  School for reimplementing their FFA Ag program. FFA educates students  on agricultural success, as well as providing hands-on career training  experience.   After a 30-year absence, students and future farmers at South  Dearborn will again be able to gain the knowledge and experience they  need to succeed in the agriculture industry.   Congratulations to South Dearborn FFA, and I look forward to seeing  your chapter grow.                            ____________________
