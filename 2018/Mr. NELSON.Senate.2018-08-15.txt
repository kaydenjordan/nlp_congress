 Mr. President, there was a new report published in  POLITICO today that read that oil industry lobbyists have been  consulting with the Trump administration about drilling off of Florida  in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico, off of Florida, is  off limits to drilling, pursuant to a law that Senator Mel Martinez and  I passed in 2006 that prohibits any drilling up until the year 2022.   The U.S. Department of Defense--specifically, the Air Force, which  runs the Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range--has asked us to extend  that moratorium on any oil-related activities until at least the year  2027. The Air Force is requesting this simply because the Eglin Gulf  Test and Training Range is the largest test and training range in the  world for the U.S. military.   When the eastern training for the U.S. Navy was shut down in the  Atlantic because the training range at the island of Vieques had been  shut down, most of the Navy training for the Atlantic came to the gulf  test and training range, not even to speak of the huge U.S. Air Force  bases--Eglin Air Force Base, where all of our American and foreign  pilots are trained on the F-35, as well as Tyndall Air Force Base,  where similar training is done for our American pilots on the F-22.   In addition, the training range is of such a significant distance and  square mileage that it allows some of the most sophisticated weapons to  travel hundreds of miles in the testing of those weapons, most of them  by air. They can either impact in the sea at a potential target or can  impact on land, at the giant Eglin Air Force Base. As a result, this is  an extremely valuable national asset. The training and testing not only  takes place in the air, over the Gulf of Mexico, but it also takes  place on the surface and, in some cases, underwater.   The U.S. military has asked us not to mess with the gulf test and  training range. Yet, as we speak--and from this report in POLITICO  today--efforts are being made by the oil industry to get the Trump  administration to allow up to 75 miles off the coastline of Florida to  be drilled. I want to show you what that would do to the heart of the  gulf test and training range.   All of this area in yellow is off limits until the year 2022 to any  oil-related activities. You see the State of Florida. You see  Pensacola, Eglin Air Force Base, here at Fort Walton, and the Tyndall  Air Force Base, here at Panama City, and the rest of the peninsula of  Florida. These are the Florida Keys and the Naval Air Station Key West,  which is where a lot of those Navy squadrons of F/A-18s come down and  will train for a week or two. When they lift off from the runway on  Boca Chica, within a couple of minutes, they are over restricted  airspace. So they don't have to spend a lot of fuel or time in getting  to their training area.   You see the enormity of this area that is shaded in yellow. From  here, this area is 125 miles off the coast, but in a line from Tampa  Bay, it is 235 miles. From a line off of Naples, it is more like 285 or  290 miles. It is a huge area that is preserved for national security-- for the training and testing of some of our most sophisticated weapons.   As has been reported in POLITICO today, if the Trump administration  were to allow the oil industry to drill up to 75 miles off the coast,  then you will have a line that will be approximately like that, and you  will see what you have done. You will have cut the heart out of the  gulf test and training range for our U.S. military.   I could tell you that as long as this Senator is here to protect this  training range, that is not going to occur. Yet we passed this in 2006,  and there have been attempts, time after time, of trying to invade this  military space, especially everything east of this longitude line,  which is considered the military mission line. For the sake of our  national security, I don't think we want to do this.   Just to give you an idea of how large and how valuable an asset this  restricted space is, if you were to take the Nevada test site, which is  a famous test site, especially with all of its supersecret stuff, and  were to superimpose it on the gulf test and training range, it would be  a minor part of the land or surface area of the Earth compared to the  size of the gulf test and training range.   Here, again, we have an example where, early in the year, the Trump  administration comes out and says they are going to drill and offer  leases off the entire Outer Continental Shelf of the United States.  Then, in a political stunt, the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Zinke,  comes to Florida and says: Oh, we are not going to do that off of  Florida when, in fact, time after time, we have information--including  this report in POLITICO today--that says they are, and they are up to  75 miles.   We are not going to do that to the U.S Military, to the Department of  Defense. We are not going to take away the heart of their most  significant test and training range, and if anybody wants to have a  fight about it, this Senator is ready to fight.   Instead of proposing this, what we ought to be doing is what the Air  Force asks, and that is to extend out this moratorium and law on any  drilling from the year 2022 to at least 2027. That is what this  Senator--and I think I can speak for the Florida delegation in a  bipartisan way--wants to accomplish.                                   Tariffs    Mr. President, today, in Jacksonville, I saw firsthand how the Trump  administration's tariffs are starting to cut jobs and threaten the very  manufacturing facilities we are trying to encourage.  [[Page S5603]]    I had reported to the Senate several months ago that I had also  visited the Budweiser brewery in Jacksonville, where they produce 3.3  billion aluminum cans a year, and how a tariff, or tax, of 10 percent  added to that imported aluminum would pretty soon add up to real money.   Today I went to a manufacturing plant that had actually brought  business from China. This is a manufacturing company that puts  together, manufactures garbage cans, the kinds that have the lids that  pop up on the top when you step on the foot pedal. They are in various  sizes. The ones I saw being manufactured today are about that much in  diameter or a larger size, about that much in diameter.   This manufacturer, which is the same company that also manufactures  in China, but it is done with human labor in China, imports the  preprepared steel, and then, because of American creativity and Yankee  ingenuity, it acquired robots and created a process where they are  assisted by humans. In one case, I saw a factory worker who could do  the very same task faster than the robot can.   They put together these garbage cans for, lo and behold, Walmart.  Walmart will not pay any more for the ones manufactured in America than  the ones manufactured in China. Of course, the ones manufactured in  China are the ones they are getting because they are cheaper. In large  part, that is because the cost of labor is cheaper. This company  created a new manufacturing process where this can be done as cheaply  as it is done in China and therefore has created 60 jobs, in this  particular plant I visited today, just since it opened up last year.  When you add all of the ancillary jobs and the suppliers, you are  talking about 250 jobs being affected.   Here is the problem. The problem is the 25-percent tariff on the  imported steel sheets that come from China. If the manufacturer has to  add on 25 percent to the cost of his garbage can, obviously, that is  not going to be competitive, since they are selling that garbage can  and can still just make it at the same price they import that garbage  can from China. This is wrong.   Unless that tariff, that tax, is turned off by President Trump, those  jobs are going to be lost. That old warehouse facility, which has been  modernized with all of this state-of-the-art robotic equipment, $15  million worth of equipment, all of that is going to go away. That is  not what we want. That is not what is good for America. We want to keep  the manufacturing jobs here. We want to bring manufacturing jobs here.   This particular company thinks that since this has been a successful  financial operation and their big customer is Walmart, they can expand  into many other products and do the manufacturing in America instead of  in China--but a 25-percent tariff on imported steel is going to kill  it. That is why it is important that we try to get President Trump to  recognize that this is doing harm to America instead of doing good.    I saw that directly and very vividly. I saw employees who were hard  at work. I saw a rundown area that has suddenly sprung back to life. I  saw an old, dilapidated, abandoned warehouse that had suddenly become a  new, modernized, high-tech facility. I don't want that to go away. I  want that and all of the businesses that are getting so hurt all over  America and especially in my State of Florida--what about the boat  manufacturers?   We have a big boatbuilding industry. The boat manufacturers import a  lot of aluminum. Now there is a 10-percent tax on them. That is the  tariff, but because of President Trump imposing that tariff, now there  is a retaliatory tariff put on by the European Union, Canada, and  Mexico for those products--in this case, boats. The company is Correct  Craft. They are the ones that build the very nice ski boats under the  label ``Nautique.'' Canada responded with a 10-percent retaliatory  tariff. The European Union responded with a 25-percent retaliatory  tariff on boats exported from the United States to those countries as  well as Mexico.   They can't be competitive if they are selling boats in the European  Union, and there is a 25-percent hike in the price. That is not going  to be competitive with the other boat manufacturers in other parts of  the world.   My visit today in Jacksonville to the company that makes these  garbage cans for Walmart is another reminder of just how bad these  tariffs are that the President has imposed and how counterproductive it  is to the creation of American jobs.   I yield the floor.
