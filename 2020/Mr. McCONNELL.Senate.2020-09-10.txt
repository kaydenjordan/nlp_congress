 Nineteen years ago tomorrow, thousands of our fellow  Americans were murdered by terrorists. National landmarks were burning.  Brave first responders in New York City, Arlington, and Pennsylvania  rushed into mortal danger, putting their lives on the line to save  strangers.   As the dust settled and 3,000 American families grieved their loved  ones far before their time, we quickly saw there was no going back. The  old world we had woken up to that Tuesday morning was gone.   We had not gone overseas in search of these monsters. These monsters  came to us. These enemies would not leave our Nation alone if we  declined to confront them, so as we reflect on this anniversary  tomorrow, we will remember the thousands of innocent Americans who died  that day and the brave servicemen and women who went on to pay the  ultimate sacrifice to do justice and to prevent more attacks.   My fellow Kentuckians and I cannot be prouder of the heroes stationed  on  [[Page S5526]]  our soil who have deployed throughout the War on Terror. The special  operators of the 160th, the Night Stalkers, based at Fort Campbell, KY,  handled the very first airborne insertion of Army troops in mid- October--a dangerous fight over the Hindu Kush mountains. The soldiers  they carried were from the famed 5th Special Forces Group, also based  at Fort Campbell, who formed the tip of the spear to unleash the might  of America on the terrorists and their Taliban hosts. The famous 101st  Airborne, also at Fort Campbell, became the first conventional unit on  the ground just days later.   Fast-forward a decade, and the Night Stalkers were helicoptering over  Afghanistan yet again. They inserted and extracted SEAL Team Six the  night we took Osama bin Laden off the battlefield.   Thousands more servicemembers deployed from Kentucky's Fort Knox and  Fort Campbell during the War on Terror, and more than 18,000 soldiers  and airmen from the Kentucky National Guard had been mobilized to  defend our Nation.   Fighting by our side for nearly 20 years now have been our friends  and NATO allies. America's friends invoked article 5 right away and  have fought alongside us to defeat this global threat.   That dark day occasioned brave contributions from so many--from the  firefighters who sprinted through the smoke to the citizens who donated  blood and flew our flag, to the young men and women who are stationed  thousands of miles from home right now to help our Nation project power  and protect our homeland.   We did what Americans do. We stayed strong. We stuck together. We  rolled up our sleeves, and we rebuilt. Some rebuilt their lives. Others  rebuilt buildings. Some put on the uniform and rebuilt peace and  security with their own hands.   May we never fail to honor them, and may we never tire of the  toughness, vigilance, and persistence it has taken--and will continue  to take--to make our pledge, ``Never Again,'' a reality.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter,  Congress has spent months talking--talking--about whether to give the  American people more relief as they continue grappling with this  pandemic.   Today we are going to vote.   Today we are going to vote. Every Senator will be counted. Should we  move forward with the floor process to deliver hundreds of billions of  dollars more for kids, jobs, and healthcare? Should we at least vote to  move forward and have this debate out in the open? Or do our Democratic  colleagues prefer to hide behind closed doors and refuse to help  families before the election?   Well, we will find out in a couple of hours.   Republicans have tried repeatedly to build on the CARES Act and get  more help out the door to American families. Democrats have blocked us  at every turn. They have invented different excuses each time.   A few months ago, Speaker Pelosi wrote a massive multitrillion-dollar  liberal wish list that even her own House Democratic Members said would  never become law.   ``The HEROES Act went too far.'' A ``political wish list.'' These are  quotes from House Democrats.   But in July, when the Senate Republicans put forward a serious offer,  Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader said they would not even  talk--not even talk--unless we started with that unserious bill. No  help for families unless they got to pass the absurd bill their own  Democratic Members have ridiculed.   So, in August, Republicans tried something else. We proposed breaking  off some of the most urgent, most bipartisan policies and agreeing  wherever we could: unemployment insurance, the Paycheck Protection  Program. But Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader blocked that too.  They said they didn't want to do anything ``piecemeal.'' ``Piecemeal,''  they said.   Then, just a few weeks later, Speaker Pelosi completely contradicted  herself and rushed back to Washington to pass a total piecemeal bill  that only helped the Postal Service and did nothing for working  families--contradiction after contradiction, excuse after excuse, while  working families have suffered and waited and wondered whether  Washington Democrats really care more about hurting President Trump  than helping them through this crisis.   My Democratic colleagues should stand up and tell the American people  which elements of our multihundred-billion-dollar proposal they  actually oppose.   Let me say that again. They should stand up and tell the American  people which parts of the proposal we will vote on later today that  they are actually against.   Today, we are going to vote to extend the Federal unemployment  insurance. Will Democrats vote against that?   Thanks to Senator Collins and Chairman Rubio, we are going to vote on  a whole second round of the PPP for hard-hit businesses. Are the  Democrats against that?   Thanks to colleagues such as Senators Ernst, Daines, Gardner, and  Sullivan, we will be voting on help for small businesses like farms and  fisheries. Thanks to Senator Cornyn, we will be voting on commonsense  legal protections that universities and nonprofits have been asking  for. Who are the Democrats excited to vote against--the farmers or the  university presidents?   Thanks to Chairman Alexander and Senator Blunt, we are going to vote  on an incredibly robust package for education and healthcare to get  kids back in school safely and then defeat this virus through science.  We will be voting on $105 billion for education, more than House  Democrats put on their bill; billions on testing and tracing; and even  more support for vaccines.   Thanks to a number of our colleagues, including Senators Ernst and  Loeffler, there is new support for childcare, plus other arrangements  like homeschooling, thanks to Senator Cruz.   Are Democrats going to vote against childcare and education during a  pandemic because they are afraid the Republicans might get some credit?  Really? They are going to vote against finding and distributing  vaccines because they are afraid the breakthrough that our Nation is  praying for might possibly help President Trump?   These are the policies that every one of us will be voting on in a  couple of hours--these and many more.   Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader can keep up their frantic  political spin. They can keep trying to make this an abstract argument  over leverage or an infinite set of things that aren't in the bill or  whether the White House Chief of Staff has been polite to them or  whatever new excuse they will settle on today. But none of that is what  we are going to vote on. We are going to vote on policy.   Today, every Senator will either say they want to send families the  relief we can agree to or they can send families nothing--nothing.   Reporters asked the Democratic leader yesterday if his stonewalling  was making the perfect the enemy of the good. He replied--listen to  this--``Republicans are the enemy of the good.'' ``Republicans are the  enemy.'' That is what he said.    We have all heard the saying that a gaffe is when a politician  accidentally says what he really thinks. That is a Washington gaffe,  when a politician actually says what he really thinks. Well, the  Democratic leader just told us how poisonous his thinking has become.   The Americans we represent, however they vote, know that Republicans  aren't our enemies and Democrats aren't our enemies. The coronavirus is  the enemy. The coronavirus is the enemy.   My home State just passed a sad milestone yesterday. More than 1,000  Kentuckians have lost their lives to COVID-19. These families I  represent are not burying their loved ones because Republicans or  Democrats are the enemy. They are burying their loved ones because of  this virus. That is what we are fighting. That is what families are  dealing with. We are not each other's enemies. We are all in this  together, just like we were back in March and April.   So, today, every Senator is going to vote. Every Senator is going to  vote. Senators who share the Democratic leader's toxic attitude, who  think the  [[Page S5527]]  real enemies are their political opponents, I assume, will follow his  lead and vote no. They can tell American families they care more about  politics than helping them.   But Senators who want to move forward will vote yes. They will vote  to advance this process so we can shape it into a bipartisan product  and make a law for the American people. That is what working families  need. They need us to act. They need us to legislate. Today, they will  see exactly who has their backs.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
