 Mr. President, today I wish to express my gratitude to  Heideh Shahmoradi, who since 2011 has served as clerk for the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies, or THUD, for her many years of  distinguished public service.   Heideh's 24 years of public service have included time on both the  Senate Appropriations Committee and the Environment and Public Works  Committee, as well as the Department of Transportation and the Federal  Highway Administration, where she first started as a part-time employee  at the age of 16.   In her 7 years with THUD, Heideh has played an instrumental role on a  host of issues. Her programmatic knowledge and technical expertise have  been critical in policy-making decisions that ensured air traffic  controllers were able to get back to safely managing our Nation's air  traffic control system following the across-the-board spending cuts in  2013. Heideh has also worked to make groundbreaking transformations in  how we address youth homelessness, which afflicts far too many young  people each year. Thanks to Heideh's dedicated efforts, we have  successfully created targeted programs that are designed to meet the  unique needs of teenagers through the Youth Homelessness Demonstration  Program, in ways that our traditional approach to homelessness was  unsuccessful in addressing.   Heideh is truly a consummate professional, a brilliant expert, and  most importantly, one of the kindest and friendliest people in the  Senate. She is known by her colleagues as being an honest broker who is  able to work in a truly bipartisan fashion in order to help us advance  important legislation.   As Heideh leaves the Senate after years of hard work and dedicated  public service, she leaves behind an impressive list of accomplishments  and colleagues whose lives she touched because she was such an  exceptional role model and mentor. I wish her continued success and  much happiness in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Terrorist  Firearms Prevention Act, which would prohibit suspected or known  terrorists from legally purchasing a firearm.   I thank my colleagues--Senators Heitkamp, Flake, Heinrich, Toomey,  Baldwin, King, Nelson, Manchin, and Kaine--for their cosponsorship of  this bipartisan bill. I particularly recognize the leadership of  Senator Heinrich, who has joined me on the floor this evening as we  introduce the bill and explain it to our colleagues.   Often referred to as ``no fly, no buy,'' this bill represents one of  the sensible steps that we can take to reform our Nation's gun laws to  better protect our people. Our bill is based on a simple principle: If  you are considered to be too dangerous to board an airplane, then you  are too dangerous to buy a firearm.   Our legislation would grant the Attorney General the authority to  block the purchase of a gun by a person who is on either the no-fly or  the selectee list. Remarkably, current law does not prohibit a person  known or suspected of engaging in terrorism from walking into a gun  shop and buying a firearm. The no-fly list and the selectee list are  the narrowest subsets of all of the government's terrorist watch lists.  These lists include the names of individuals who pose the greatest  threat of committing an act of terrorism against aviation, against our  homeland, or against U.S. interests abroad. This bill would also  provide an immediate alert to the FBI and to local law enforcement if  an individual who has been on the government's terrorist watch list at  any time during the past 5 years purchases a firearm.   Our hearts are all broken by the horrific shootings of the students  in Florida. There was another horrendous shooting in Florida in 2016  that demonstrates why this look-back provision in this legislation is  so important. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was on the selectee list for  approximately 10 months, but he was no longer on the list when he  purchased the 2 guns that he used to murder 49 people and injure scores  more. If our bill had been enacted, the FBI would have been notified  immediately when Omar Mateen purchased his first firearm in the weeks  leading up to the shooting. Then the FBI would have been notified a  second time that Mateen had sought to purchase additional firearms.  Surely, that would have caused the FBI to reopen its investigation of  Omar Mateen. If our proposal had been law at that time, perhaps that  massacre might have been prevented.   I note that our bill would provide robust due process procedures to  protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. Any  American who would be denied a purchase under this bill would have the  opportunity to petition a Federal district court and receive a decision  within 14 days. If the government, which would have the burden of  proof, would fail to prove its case, it would have to pay attorneys's  fees for that individual, and, of course, the purchase of the firearm  would go forward.   In 2016, when the Senate voted on our bill, it won majority and  bipartisan support. Our bill was endorsed by a distinguished group of  military and intelligence leaders. I note that during the 2016  Presidential debates, both candidates agreed with our principle of no  fly, no buy. Surely, this is a sensible, reasonable policy around which  we can build consensus.   Another step that we can take right now is to pass legislation I  introduced with Senator Leahy to explicitly outlaw straw purchasing.  Straw purchasing is intended for one purpose only, and that is to put a  gun into the hands of a criminal who cannot legally obtain one. Our  bill, the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act, would provide law  enforcement with an effective tool to fight the violence that too often  goes hand in hand with drug trafficking and gang-related crimes.   Today, gun traffickers exploit weaknesses in our Federal laws by  targeting individuals who can lawfully purchase firearms. Sadly,  according to briefings that I have had from Federal officials, in the  State of Maine gang members from other States have targeted addicts to  go buy firearms for them, and then they swap firearms for drugs. Right  now a straw purchaser can be prosecuted only for lying on a Federal  form, which is treated far too often as just a paperwork violation.  Instead of a slap on the wrist, our bill would create new, specific  criminal offenses for straw purchasing and trafficking, punishable by  hefty prison terms, particularly for those who have reason to believe  that the firearms will be used to commit violent crimes.   Our bill would also outlaw firearms and ammunition smuggling out of  the United States to another country. That is vitally important for  combating drug trafficking near and across our southern border, which  is contributing to the heroin crisis here at home.   Let me again be clear that the bill I have introduced with Senator  Leahy protects the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.   These are just two commonsense reforms that we can pass while fully  protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. We can  make it as difficult for a terrorist to obtain a gun as it is for him  to board an airplane. We can outlaw straw purchasing by increasing the  penalties to make a real difference. I urge my colleagues to support  both the bipartisan Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act and the straw  purchasing bill, as well as other commonsense reforms.   Thank you, Mr. President.
