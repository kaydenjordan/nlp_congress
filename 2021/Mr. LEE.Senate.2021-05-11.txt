 Mr. President, today I offer my recognition of Mr.  Ken Potts for his heroic service to our country and congratulate him on  his 100th birthday.   Ken was born on April 15, 1921, in Honey Bend, IL. His childhood was  spent on the family farm during the difficult years of the Great  Depression. Despite the difficulty of the times, the Potts family  worked earnestly and happily to make ends meet. In fact, Ken has fond  memories of time in his boyhood spent hunting small game with his  slingshot.   At the onset of WWII, when Ken was just 18 years of age, he enlisted  in the U.S. Navy. Two short years later, he was stationed in the South  Pacific working as a crane operator on the largest ship in the Navy's  fleet, the USS Arizona. The work ethic he learned as a child, on the  family farm, earned him great success during his military service.   On December 7, 1941, the Pennsylvania-class battleship was docked at  Pearl Harbor along with the rest of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Ken was  working that morning shuttling supplies to the Arizona when Japanese  torpedo bombers descended from the sky. One of the 797-kilogram armor- piercing bombs dropped by the bombers exploded through the decks of  near a supply staging area at the front the ship. Thinking quickly, Ken  risked his life in a small boat to pick up dozens of sailors stranded  in the burning water, dropping them off at nearby Ford Island. His  heroism saved many. Of the survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Ken  is one of two still alive today.   Ken was undeterred by the harrowing experiences of the attack on  Pearl Harbor. He remained in the Navy and served his country honorably  until 1945. After the war, Ken returned to the States and moved to  Provo, UT, here he has lived with his wife for 54 years.   Ken Potts embodies the very best attributes of the ``greatest  generation''. He is a living testament to American bravery, honor, and  dignity in defense of the American way. I wish him a very happy 100th  birthday. It is my humble privilege to honor him today.                            ____________________
