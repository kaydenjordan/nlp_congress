 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the last 2 weeks, the majority has attacked the First  Amendment, and now they are attacking the Second Amendment.   H.R. 8 will not save lives. As Justice Scalia noted in his decision  in Heller, the Second Amendment does not give Americans a right; it  protects a preexisting right, and that right shall not be infringed.   H.R. 8 would not have prevented recent shootings. In Parkland, the  shooter acquired the firearm legally from an FFL after undergoing a  NICS check. The same thing in Sutherland Springs, Texas; the same in  Las Vegas, Nevada; and the same in Orlando. I could go on because the  list would produce the same result. They got their guns after a  background check, including in El Paso.   Criminals who seek to do harm get guns regardless of the new  restrictions imposed by H.R. 8. And with very limited exceptions, H.R.  8 makes it illegal for Americans to get a gun if a nonlicensed  importer, manufacturer, or dealer is not involved. How will the  government know if an illegal transfer occurs? Without a registry, this  bill is unenforceable.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard supporters of this bill say that other  countries have similar restrictions so we should, too. I counter with  the fact that other countries do not have the Second Amendment. The  Second Amendment was included to ensure that the United States would be  different than other countries.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.
