 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike the section that  allows payments to go towards the Paris climate agreement. Most  importantly, it would allow President Trump to follow through on his  plan to withdraw from the agreement.   Just a few months ago, it was reported that the U.S. economy exceeded  analysts' predictions and grew at over 3 percent in the first quarter  of this year.   In October of last year, unemployment had a mere 50-year low, and  wages are going up. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported  there are 7.4 million jobs available.   Mr. Chair, now those on the other side of the aisle want to put at  risk that growth and enforce policies that will do nothing to stop  climate change.                                time  1500    What would staying in the agreement lead to?   The Heritage Foundation has modeled the policies that would be  required to meet the Obama administration's Paris commitments and found  that by 2035 there would be an overall loss of nearly 400,000 jobs,  half of which would be in manufacturing, an average total income lost  of more than $20,000 for a family of four, an aggregate GDP loss of  over $2.5 trillion, and an increase in household electricity  expenditures between 13 percent and 20 percent.   My amendment would allow the United States to stay out of this  unrealistic and overbearing agreement. I urge the Members to vote  ``yes'' on this amendment.    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the ranking member on the Select Committee on  the Climate Crisis.    Mr. Chair, I would like to point out that the United  States has led the world in reducing carbon emissions, and I would also  like to point out that even former Secretary of State John Kerry, in  2015, stated, if we somehow eliminated all domestic greenhouse gas  emissions--guess what--it still wouldn't be enough to offset the carbon  pollution coming from the rest of the world.   I would also like to point out that, in a hearing before the Select  Committee on the Climate Crisis, I asked the Democrat witnesses,  including an author and editor of the International Panel on Climate  Change, if the United States completely eliminated all of its carbon  emissions, would it stop climate change, and their answer was it would  not.   We have led the world in reducing carbon emissions without harming  our economy, and it makes no sense scientifically or from an  engineering perspective to engage in destroying our own economy when  the rest of the world and, particularly, China and other emerging  economies are not doing their part to reduce their carbon emissions.    I want to emphasize the fact that eliminating our carbon emissions  will not stop climate change. Sound science, technology, and sound  engineering will do more to mitigate and adapt than anything else you  can do.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
