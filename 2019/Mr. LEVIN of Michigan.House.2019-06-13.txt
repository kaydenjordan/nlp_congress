 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this en bloc  package that includes my amendment to prohibit the use of funds in this  act for assistance to the Forces Armees d'Haiti, or the Haitian Armed  Forces, the FAd'H.   I worked in Haiti as an investigator for Human Rights Watch in 1992,  not long after Haitian soldiers led a coup against Haiti's first  democratically-elected President and not long before the military was  implicated in the massacre of his supporters in the town of Raboteau.   Now, the Haitian government has revived the armed forces and  empowered some of the same people who played a part in those horrors of  the 1990s to lead them.   We cannot let a single dollar of U.S. taxpayer funds go to the FAd'H.  The Haitian people must know that we have not forgotten the horrors of  their past and we are committed to working with them for a better  future.   I thank Congresswoman Lee, Congresswoman Waters, Congressman Engel,  and Congressman Sires for cosponsoring this amendment, and I also thank  Chairwoman Lowey for working with me on this and for her hard work on  this bill.
