 Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce the Fair and  Equal Housing Act of 2019, legislation to ensure equal housing  opportunities for all Americans. This bipartisan bill would protect  Americans from housing discrimination based on gender identity and  sexual orientation. No American should be turned away from a home they  love because of who they love.  [[Page S2520]]    I began my career as a civil rights attorney. My initial focus was on  fair housing, and I learned early on that a home is more than just  structure or a shelter. A home plays an integral role in one's  identity, and it is central to the life of every American.   Housing discrimination nevertheless continues to plague many  Americans. And it is a reality for LGBT Americans because of incomplete  protections in the Fair Housing Act (FHA), the landmark Federal housing  law.   The FHA prohibits housing discrimination based on race, color,  religion, national origin, sex, familial status, or disability. It does  not, however, protect against discrimination based upon sexual  orientation or gender. More than 20 states and over 200 localities  safeguard sexual orientation and gender identify in their housing  discrimination laws. That's telling. It's time for the federal  government to do the same.   A study released this month analyzed national mortgage data from 1990  to 2015. It found that same-sex applicants were 73 percent more likely  to be denied approval for a mortgage than opposite-sex couples.   The study also found that same-sex couples often pay more for their  loans in interest and fees. This despite the fact that the study found  no evidence that same-sex couples carried a higher default risk. In  fact, the study's findings suggest that same-sex borrowers may perform  better. The analysis indicated that, on average, same-sex couples paid  0.2 percent more in interest and fees, which adds up to as much as $86  million per year.   These findings confirm the need to include gender identity and sexual  orientation as protected classes under federal housing laws. Loan  decisions should be based on fundamental economic considerations, not  race, religion, sexual orientation or gender.   The job of perfecting our Union is an ongoing quest requiring  continued stewardship. Our history is replete with examples of manifest  action from the Bill of Rights, to the 14th Amendment, to the Civil  Rights Act of 1964. The Fair and Equal Housing Act of 2019 is one more  step in our longer journey to perfect our Union and to extinguish  discrimination in places which call for our leadership. I urge my  colleagues to join us in support of this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Van          Hollen, and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 1249.
