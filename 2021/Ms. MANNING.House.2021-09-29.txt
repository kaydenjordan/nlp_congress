 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support  for the historic bipartisan Investment and Jobs Act. This bill will  provide critical funding to rebuild our Nation's physical  infrastructure and accelerate our  [[Page H5550]]  shift to green energy, all while creating good-paying jobs in  communities like mine.   In North Carolina, more than 3,000 miles of highway and 1,400 bridges  need repair. The average driver spends $500 a year on vehicle  maintenance costs, thanks to this rundown infrastructure.   More than 400,000 North Carolina residents lack adequate access to  internet. This bill expands broadband access, helping to ensure that  everyone has the tools they need to stay connected and participate  fully in school and in remote work.   All these investments create good-paying jobs, spurring economic  development, and catapulting our Nation into the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.                            ____________________
