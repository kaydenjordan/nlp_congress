 Mr. President, I want to be able to talk about a couple  of subjects today, but I want to be able to set the context on these  with the recognition of Women's History Month. A lot of fairly  remarkable ladies in Oklahoma have set American history and world  history into a different pace based on what they have done in the past.   I can't help, when I am talking about Women's History Month, to be  able to talk about my own mom, who is a pacesetter in her own  leadership. She was a student, librarian, and mom. She went through  elementary school librarian and high school librarian and then became  the director of libraries for a very large school district.   She led the way for our family and community. She even led the  American Association of School Librarians around the country. She was a  pacesetter there.   There are other pacesetters that I would highlight who are Oklahoma  pacesetters. The first is Claire Luper. Born in Okfuskee County, OK, in  1923, Claire Luper was the first African-American student to enroll in  the History Department at the University of Oklahoma. She was a civil  rights leader. She led Americans at lunch counters in 1958 as she was  seated there and helped to train youth to be seated at lunch counters  to break through the racism that was existing in Oklahoma City and in  Oklahoma.   Claire Luper herself was arrested 26 times for just eating lunch--for  just  [[Page S2080]]  leading for the rights of what every single human being should be  allowed to do in our great country.   After 26 arrests and the breakthrough leadership that she  experienced, she now has been recognized with over 500 different awards  and honors in her lifetime. She taught in the Oklahoma City area for 41  years, was a senior adviser for the NAACP Youth Council in Oklahoma  City, and is now a member of the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.   Another great leader from Oklahoma is Shannon Lucid. She was raised  in Bethany, OK. In 1979 she became an astronaut in a time period when  ladies did not become astronauts. She set the pace. She was the chief  scientist at NASA from 2002 to 2003. She served as the capsule  communicator for numerous space missions. She was the first woman to  receive the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.   Jeane Kirkpatrick is another Oklahoman. Born in 1926, she was the  first woman appointed to serve as a Permanent Representative to the  United States for the United Nations. She served from 1981 to 1985. She  served on President Ronald Reagan's Cabinet, was a political science  professor at Georgetown University, and was a fellow at the American  Enterprise Institute. She made Oklahoma proud.   Let me tell you about a current one now. LaRita Aragon. LaRita Aragon  was born in Shawnee, OK, but she was raised in the big town of Dale,  just outside of Shawnee. She became the first woman to hold the rank of  brigadier general in the Oklahoma Air National Guard and the first  female commander of the Air National Guard.   Before her military career, she was an elementary school teacher and  a principal. After retirement from the military, she returned to  education. She served as the director of advanced programs in the  University of Oklahoma College of Continuing Education. Then, in  January 2011, she started serving as secretary of veterans affairs for  the State of Oklahoma. She is a remarkable military leader from our  State and a tremendous role model for people in our State--boys and  girls.   Maria Tallchief was born in 1925 in Fairfax, OK. She was a member of  the Osage Nation. At age 17, she did a crazy thing. She moved to New  York City to pursue her dream of becoming a dancer. As her career began  to take off, people tried to persuade Maria Tallchief to change her  last name so that she wouldn't face the prejudice of being Native  American. She refused to do that. She continued to work and to prove  herself. In 1947 she became the first American to dance with the Paris  Opera Ballet. She led the way, and she set the pace.   Oklahomans are proud of these ladies and many, many others who have  done great work and made remarkable advances. We are proud of them.                          Long-Term Budget Planning    Mr. President, from recognizing Women's History Month, let me make a  comment on something currently happening in the Senate. Right now in  the Senate, the Senate Budget Committee is continuing to work on a  budget.   The President turns in a budget. As many people know, since 1974, the  President's budget has been just a document of ideas. The Senate and  the House agree together on a budget, set a number, and then do  appropriations bills. That is how we actually do the spending for the  Federal taxpayers' dollars. Since 1974, it has typically begun with a  budget document from the Senate and from the House.   They are working on that budget document right now in the Budget  Committee, but here is the difficult thing. In all likelihood, that  budget document that will come out of committee will never come to this  floor and will never be voted on because of the difficulty we face  right now in our deficit and the challenges the budget will have in  order for it to move through the process. In all likelihood, this body  will deem a budget number, where there will be no real plan. It will  just set a budget number and then move on and start heading toward  appropriations.   Layer upon layer of debt and deficit will be added to where we are as  a nation. Our simple challenge is, how do we get around this?   Last year, 16 Members met--eight Senators, eight House Members; eight  Republicans, eight Democrats--to try to strategize how we could change  the budget process. Though I commend Chairman Enzi of the Budget  Committee and his remarkable work, thought, and incredible staff, once  again that document will not make a difference on this floor, and once  again it will not set us on a long-term path to getting back to  solvency. We have to change the process of what we do.   These 16 Members met all last year to establish a set of ideas of how  we could change the process, but it failed in December. I am  challenging this body to step up to it again and to reengage on some  simple sets of ideas of how we can get our budget back in balance and  how we can do better planning. Though we do budgets and though we will  do the deeming of a budget number, there is no real plan for how things  can get better. We have to get better at planning, so let me give you  some simple ideas that were birthed out of the conversation last year.   We hold debt ceiling votes, which are supposedly to limit our debt,  but they never do. They did decades ago, but they have not for decades.  We will have 12 appropriations bills in some form and in some way so as  to actually do the spending in the next several months, but there will  be no bill to deal with how we can reduce spending.   A simple idea that came out of that conversation last year was this:  How do we add a 13th bill?   As simple as I can say it, we have 12 spending bills. In every single  Congress, the 13th bill would be set aside for how we will reduce our  deficit. We have a structure with which to do that. It is the  reconciliation process. It will certainly take work to reform this. We  have a process in place right now that we could use but that we don't.  What if we mandate it each year? We would have our 12 spending bills in  whatever form they would take, but in every single session of Congress,  we would have to have some conversation about what we would do to  reduce spending or to fix our deficit. It is not an unreasonable  proposal. It is an opportunity for us to sit and plan, to actually  think about things, and to work things out.   Senator Maggie Hassan and I also have another idea for working  through the process. How do we end government shutdowns? How do we stop  the perpetual cliffs of budgeting issues? There is a simple way to do  that.   The simple way to do that, as odd as it may sound, is for Members of  Congress and our staffs, as well as for members of the staff within the  Office of Management and Budget from the White House, to not travel if  you get to the end of a budget year and the budget is not done. You  can't leave until the work is done, is as simple as I can say it. That  may sound overly simplistic, but I guarantee you, if this body has to  work through 2 weeks, no one would have the opportunity to travel.  Everyone would have to be here days and weekends. There would be no  official travel. There would be no opportunity to head back and see  your family. There would be no codels or staffdels or any kind of other  opportunity to leave. Each day, we would also have to have a quorum  call and be here until the work gets done. Then we would solve this.   Last December, we had this protracted shutdown that began when  Members of Congress left for Christmas. They just left with there being  an unresolved budget issue here. If Senator Hassan's and my idea were  to pass, we would have finished that work last December, and Americans  would never have experienced that protracted government shutdown.   We have differences of opinion. It is who we are as Americans, and  that is what we represent in the U.S. Senate, but we should not punish  Federal workers and the American people because we have not worked out  our differences here. We should stay until the work is done, and we  should keep negotiating until we are finished. That is a simple,  straightforward way to resolve this.   With our adding a 13th bill to enable our having to plan for how we  will actually deal with debt and deficit, there will be some moment  created every year to compel us to actually be here until our work is  done as well as having a more systematic structure of how we are going  to do budgeting. All of these are simple ideas, but they are ideas that  will help us get on top of a $22 trillion debt and an approaching $1  [[Page S2081]]  trillion yearly deficit. It is as if we have lost the importance of  this, and we cannot.   My challenge to this body is to make the budget mean something again.  Let's actually do long-term planning, and let's figure out how to make  a process work for the taxpayers. We can figure this out, and we can  work together to do it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
