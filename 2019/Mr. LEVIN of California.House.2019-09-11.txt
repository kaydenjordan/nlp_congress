 Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I  rise today to recognize an unimaginable tragedy that occurred in my  district last month.   On August 2, three women from the same family died when a coastal  bluff at Grandview Beach in Encinitas collapsed on top of them: Julie  Davis, Annie Clave, and Elizabeth Charles. They were enjoying a day at  the beach with family and friends celebrating Elizabeth's triumph over  breast cancer. Suddenly, all three were lost.   There is a lot that I would like to say about the government's  responsibility to help prevent similar tragedies in the future, but,  instead, I want to use this moment to recognize the extraordinary life  that all three of these women brought into this world.   I had the opportunity to sit down with Dr. Pat Davis, who lost his  wife, one of his daughters, and his sister-in-law on that day. Today,  Dr. Davis is committed to ensuring that no one else experiences the  same kind of loss that he has. He has called for action from local,  State, and Federal officials to prevent future bluff collapses, and we  stand together in these efforts. He is truly an inspiration.   Please take a moment to think of Julie, Annie, and Elizabeth. May  they rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of  H.R. 1941, the Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act, to ban new  offshore drilling along the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts.   My district is home to over 50 miles of beautiful California  coastline. It is home to some of the world's premier marine research  institutions, not to mention some of the best surfing in the country.   In San Diego and Orange Counties, the ocean economy accounts for $7.7  billion and sustains more than 140,000 jobs in coastal tourism and  recreation. All it will take to jeopardize those jobs is a massive  spill like the one we saw off the coast of Santa Barbara in 2015, which  poured 142,000 gallons of crude oil into the water and onto beaches  across southern California. That is why the people I represent have  made their voices heard loud and clear: No more drilling off our coast.    We can't allow the fossil fuel industry and their friends in the  Trump administration to exploit our oceans for their own profit, roll  back safety regulations that help prevent spills, and threaten hundreds  of thousands of jobs.  [[Page H7610]]    I expect we will hear a lot more from my friends across the aisle,  many of whom represent landlocked districts, who claim there is nothing  to worry about. Well, they should know that the folks who actually live  in coastal communities won't stop fighting to protect our oceans and  our jobs.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Chair, there is absolutely no sense in  making a special exception to open the waters along the Pacific Coast  for drilling.   Supporters of this amendment clearly represent districts many miles  from the nearest coastline. Maybe they never saw the environmental  devastation on southern California beaches after the Santa Barbara  Plains oil spill in 2015; maybe they haven't visited with small  businesses in coastal communities like mine that depend on tourism and  recreation to survive; maybe they don't know that offshore drilling  threatens nearly 746,000 jobs and nearly $53 billion in GDP along the  West Coast.   However, I have seen that devastation. I visited those small  businesses. And I am well-aware of how many jobs could and would be  lost if we suffer from another spill along the Pacific Coast. I also  know that more than 90 West Coast municipalities and all three Pacific  Coast State governors formally oppose offshore drilling.   The people I represent in San Diego and Orange County certainly do as  well. They know that the risks far outweigh any benefit that fossil  fuel companies will reap from drilling off our coast, and I am here to  raise their voices.   Mr. Chair, many of my Republican colleagues in the Committee on  Natural Resources try to justify their push to destroy our coastal  communities with offshore drilling by claiming that the alternative to  expanded drilling is imported foreign oil.   If my friends on the other side of the aisle were serious about  addressing oil imports, they would not sit idly by as the Trump  administration works to completely undermine our country's fuel  efficiency standards.   If they were serious, they would support the State of California as  it works to strengthen fuel economy, so that this country is not  dependent on oil, period. And so that Americans can save money at the  pump.   California is working to reduce oil imports with its vehicle  emissions standards and low carbon fuel standard, but the Trump  administration is fighting tooth and nail to stop it by revoking the  State's Clean Air Act waiver and challenging its groundbreaking  agreement with automakers to set strong standards.   Those who support the Trump administration's efforts are hitting my  constituents--not once, but twice. First, they are making cars less  efficient, which drives climate change and hurts air quality in  southern California. And now, supporters of this amendment are seeking  to increase the chances of an environmental catastrophe that could do  irreparable damage to my constituents' communities and our local  economy.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  recognize the impact that this amendment will have on Pacific Coast  economies by strongly opposing it.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1345
