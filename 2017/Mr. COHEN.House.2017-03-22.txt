 Mr. Speaker.    Yes, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Polis and Mr. Pascrell have made the  point, and it is the same point I want to make. There is a shadow  hanging over the United States of America, over our government, and  over this House; and only we can lift it.   The Trump campaign said that if Hillary Clinton was the President  with a Federal investigation overlooking her, which it looked like  there was with Mr. Comey's comments before the election, that it would  be unheard of, unprecedented, and the Government couldn't go on.   Well, there is a Federal investigation of the present President of  the United States--something that has never happened before--and that  has put a dark cloud that can only be lifted by showing in the light of  day what the President's involvements were with his income taxes, whom  he owes money to. And if he doesn't owe money to people that have a  conflict, that is good for the government because it relieves the  President of any suspicion.   Like Caesar's wife, he should be beyond suspicion and beyond  reproach, and, right now, there is a serious cloud. So I would ask the  Chair to rule in favor of this motion so we can do our job to make the  light shine on this government and on this House and give more respect  for us.   I thank the Speaker who is an honorable man and I am proud to say is  my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
