 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution  that reasserts congressional authority over going to war.   We know this: War is devastating for our troops, for their families,  for families and children everywhere, for not just this generation but  future generations to come, for our humanity. That is why our Framers  gave this body the opportunity, the responsibility to have that  discussion and declare war should it be needed.   In 2002, we rushed to war based on made-up claims of weapons of mass  destruction, and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars took hundreds of  thousands of lives, created millions of refugees, and cost us trillions  of dollars.   Today, the President, without providing any raw intelligence to prove  an imminent threat, has brought us to the brink of war with Iran. This  resolution makes it clear that Congress has not authorized this war.   We also must repeal the 2002 AUMF and vote to withhold funds for this  unauthorized war. It is time to reassert our authority.
