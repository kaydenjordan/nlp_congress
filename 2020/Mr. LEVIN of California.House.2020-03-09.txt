 Mr. Speaker, as we confront the coronavirus  epidemic, one thing is clear: Everyone should follow the CDC's  recommendations to stay healthy and safe. That means staying home if  you are feeling sick.   If we want people to follow that important guidance, though, we must  [[Page H1551]]  make it economically viable to do so. That is why I rise today in  support of critical legislation introduced by Congresswoman DeLauro to  ensure that working families receive paid sick leave in the event of a  public health emergency like the coronavirus epidemic.   The concept is simple: We want people to stay home if they are  feeling sick so they don't spread the coronavirus or other illnesses to  others. But not everyone can afford to do that. Many families live  paycheck to paycheck, struggling to pay their bills each month. Taking  unpaid sick leave simply isn't an option for them.   With the severity of the crisis we are facing, we cannot force  working people to choose between going to work and spreading their  illness to others or staying home and getting behind on their bills.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support Congresswoman DeLauro's  bill.                            ____________________
