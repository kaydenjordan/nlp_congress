 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, our Special Order tonight is  to honor a dear friend, one who would have been a colleague of ours  here, and a great tragedy.   Congressman-elect Luke Joshua Letlow, from Start, Louisiana, passed  away from complications due to COVID-19 on December 29, 2020. He had  just been elected to Congress December 5, and he was only, as we know,  weeks away from taking the oath of office and serving here with us.   He was 41 years old. He was in the prime of his life and, so far as  any of us could tell, otherwise the picture of health and energy and  excitement and positivity. He was excited to serve with us here. His  death came as a terrible shock to all the people of Louisiana and to  millions of people around this country.    Luke was known in Louisiana for having a servant's heart. He had a  peaceful nature about him. When he talked to a constituent, or a  friend, or anyone, he made them feel they were the most important  person in the world. He was one of those guys who was a great  statesman, and he would have left a big mark here.   I have also been encouraged since his passing to know that my friend  was guided by his faith in Christ. A good friend of ours told me  shortly after his passing that Luke was drawn even closer to the Lord  in his final days. In fact, he called this trusted prayer warrior to  share briefly about an experience he had just a few nights before he  passed away.   He was in the hospital, and Luke said he felt the certain presence of  God and his peace. Luke Letlow knew the truth of Christ and the peace  of his salvation, and we all have taken great comfort in that.   Luke leaves behind his devoted wife, Julia, and their two young  children, Jeremiah and Jacqueline. He leaves his parents, Johnny and  Dianne Letlow; his grandmother, Mary Taylor; his brothers, Paul and  Matt, and their families; and a huge network of people who were like  family to Luke and loved him as their own.   He was raised in Start, Louisiana, just east of Monroe. For the  people who don't know the geography, it is northeast Louisiana.  Throughout his entire adult life, it was very clear how deeply he cared  about the people of our State and those who live in the Fifth  Congressional District, which is a sprawling 24 parishes, the largest  by land area in our State.   He worked for Bobby Jindal during Jindal's stint here in the U.S.  House, and also later when Bobby was elected Louisiana's Governor.   Luke also worked as chief of staff for his predecessor and our good  friend, Dr. Ralph Abraham, who just retired and left the seat open.   Throughout Luke's time in each of those positions, he made it a  priority to work every day to benefit those that he served. He wanted  to make life better for the people of his home State and, in those  efforts, he worked closely with our farmers and the oil and gas  industry and countless small businesses to ensure they were given every  opportunity to succeed.   Judging from his accomplishments and a remarkable record of public  service, there is no doubt at all that he would have made an  outstanding Member of Congress.   Many people are aware now that there will be a special election in  March, March 20, to fill that seat that he has left open, and we are  delighted to tell you that his beloved bride, his widow, Dr. Julia  Barnhill Letlow, will be running for that seat, and we expect that she  will be taking her place here shortly thereafter.   She is a native of Monroe, a dedicated mother, of course, and an  education professional who has dedicated her life to promote and  advocate for higher education, traditional family values, and our  quality of life in Louisiana. We are excited to soon welcome her here  to fill the giant void that our dear friend and brother, Luke, has left  us.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins),  another member of our delegation.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from  Louisiana, Mr. Higgins, for his remarks. We sat together at the funeral  of Luke, and it was a great service. There were so many kind words said  about him. And he is remembered to just be the great spirit and the  great Louisiana homegrown talent that he was.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice),  who is also the freshman class president, the class that Luke of course  would have been a part of.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her leadership of the freshman class and for those kind remarks.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), another leader  from that class.    Madam Speaker, we have a few others from  the class that Luke Letlow would have been proud to serve in, some of  the rising leaders here. I will call on them in no particular order  here, but I yield to another gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon), if he  is ready.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Iowa (Mrs. Hinson), another classmate of Luke's.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Florida, Mrs. Kat Cammack, another bright light in this class and  my friend.    Madam Speaker, I am delighted to introduce  another member of the Louisiana delegation for remarks in our Special  Order tonight. We are going in, it seems to be, reverse order by  seniority, but I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), my  friend. He knew Luke very well, and I know he will bring some good  thoughts to us tonight.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Garret  Graves of Louisiana, for those poignant words. The funeral service was  like that, with recollections from close friends. We could have sat  there all afternoon and reveled in it.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the whip, my dear friend, and one of the guys  who helped guide Luke on his path to get here.    Madam Speaker, I thank the whip for those  great remarks and his great leadership, and I know Luke appreciated  that as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs.  Boebert).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Colorado for her words. That was very appropriate. I was going to cite  the same scripture.   I will just say this as we close tonight: The night we got word of  Luke's passing was December 29, and that word, the phone call we got  shook my whole family, as it did everybody in the State.   As we were putting our children to bed at night, I reminded my  youngest son, my 10-year-old son, that while grieving is part of our  human experience, the Lord mourns with us. We know that from Isaiah  53:4. And as Lauren just said, He always remains close to the  brokenhearted. Psalm 34.   So many are mourning this loss and so many remain brokenhearted. But  I will close with these words from the Apostle Paul, as he wrote to the  church in Rome, Romans 8:38-39: ``For I am convinced that neither death  nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present or the future,  nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all  creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in  Christ Jesus our Lord.''   Luke believed that and he lived it, and he would want us to remember  it, too.   Madam Speaker, this concludes our Special Order tonight, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
