 Mr. Speaker, today is a great day because, after decades  of struggle, this House will recognize the Armenian genocide, just in  time to be viewed by the last survivors of the first genocide of the  20th century.   Two weeks ago, I came to this floor and I said now is the time,  finally, to recognize the Armenian genocide because it was no longer  the time to kowtow to Turkey. Since then, many of us have approached  the Speaker and urged her to put this bill on the floor.   But this great day belongs to Nancy Pelosi, our Speaker, who made the  decision to bring it to the floor, where we will pass this resolution,  H. Res. 296, which I and so many others introduced to this House in  April of this year. And, of course, I have cosponsored and been an  original cosponsor of every Armenian genocide resolution since 1997.   We always should have recognized the Armenian genocide, but we were  told again and again that we wouldn't do it because we have this great  alliance with Turkey.   Earlier this month, Turkish forces shelled to the left and then to  the right of an American base. It seemed clear to many that they were  ready to kill Americans. America withdrew. And this was not some well- planned, careful, deliberate withdrawal. We left because of the Turkish  shelling and the Turkish threats.   Great alliance? It has been a great alliance for Turkey. We defended  them from communism. We defended them from the Soviet Union. We  provided them $23 billion in aid. And we are the reason why there is  not an independent Kurdistan in northern Iraq.   They shelled to the left; they shelled to the right of an American  military outpost.   From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Empire massacred 1.5 million  Armenians, the first genocide of the 20th century. There is no doubt  that this occurred. Even the administration testified before our  committee last week.   The massacre of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915, et cetera, was one of  the greatest crimes of the 20th century, and this is not in dispute.  There is no dispute that that mass death constituted a genocide because  Raphael Lemkin, who invented the word ``genocide,'' said the Armenian  genocide was an example--the first example, perhaps--of what he was  talking about.   It is time that we recognize the genocide because genocide denial is  the last act of the genocide. First, you obliterate a people; then, you  seek to obliterate their memory; and, finally, you seek to obliterate  the memory of the obliteration.   But genocide denial is also the first step in the next genocide. When  Hitler's cadres wondered whether they could get away with the  Holocaust, he assured them: Who today speaks of the annihilation of the  Armenians?   And it is time to recognize this genocide to remove a stain on  America's honor because, up until now, we have hidden and refused to  acknowledge the truth. We have been silent, all in an effort to appease  Turkey.   Turkey committed a genocide in World War I and denies it to this day.  Germany committed a genocide during World War II and has acknowledged  it from the 1940s.   Germany has moved on to be a prosperous and strong democracy. Turkey  continues to deny the genocide, then passes law prohibiting the  discussion of the genocide; and that leads to censorship,  authoritarianism, undercuts the rule of law, leads to corruption and a  country that has great problems.   Where would Germany be if it denied the Holocaust to this day? Where  would we be if we denied the genocide of so many Native American  Tribes?   Turkey will be a great ally of the United States only when it  recognizes the first genocide of the 20th century, only when it allows  free discussion of its own history by its own people.   So, today is the right day to recognize the first genocide of the  20th century. We should have done it earlier. We should do it every  year on the anniversary in April. But it starts here and now, and,  finally, America can stand up along with so many other countries that  have recognized that genocide.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, after decades of struggle, this House will  recognize the Armenian genocide just in time for it to be seen by the  last few survivors of the first genocide of the 20th century.   We should have recognized that genocide again and again long ago, but  we didn't because we were told that we had a great alliance with  Turkey.   Earlier this month, Turkish forces shelled near and deliberately  bracketed American bases. Americans fled in unseemly haste. Great ally.   It has been a great alliance for Turkey. We defended them from  communism in the 1940s, defended them from the Soviet Union for  decades, and provided them with $23 billion in aid.   It is critical that we counteract Turkey's genocide denial, because  genocide denial is the last act of a genocide--first you obliterate a  people, then you seek to obliterate their memory, and  [[Page H8555]]  finally you seek to obliterate the memory of the obliteration--and  because genocide denial is also the first step in the next genocide.   When Hitler's cadres wondered if they could get away with the  Holocaust, he was able to assure them: Who, after all, speaks today of  the annihilation of the Armenians?   We must recognize this genocide to remove the stain on America's  honor because, up until now, we have refused to acknowledge truth and  we have been silent, all in an effort at appeasement.   The fact is that many other countries have recognized the genocide,  including Belgium, Canada, Greece, Italy, Argentina, and Germany. And  when France had the courage to pass a genocide recognition resolution,  they were threatened with a boycott of all their exports. In fact, what  happened was a fourfold increase in French exports to Turkey.   The only thing worse than unnecessary appeasement is appeasing a  power that will not actually respond.   Today, Germany is a great and prosperous democracy, a great ally of  the United States. Where would Germany be if, to this day, they denied  the Holocaust?   Turkey will be a great ally of the United States and a prosperous and  modern nation only when Turkey recognizes the first genocide of the  20th century.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman for bringing up this rule and  for answering the question why this is so important to do this today.    American honor demands that we end our complicity in  genocide denial.   Four arguments are made against this resolution:   The first is that it is not true. No one can even make that argument  anymore. 1.5 million Armenians and countless Syrians, Greeks, and  others massacred by the Ottoman Government.   Second, they argue that Turkey is such a great ally that we should  turn a blind eye to what happened last century. Earlier this month,  Turkish forces shelled both to the left and to the right of American  military bases. American soldiers fled in unseemly haste. What a great  ally Turkey is.   Then we were told: Well, the Foreign Affairs Committee hasn't had  hearings. We have had countless hearings on this for decades,  including, also, a 4-hour markup where we passed it through the  committee, and the only argument made on the other side there was  Turkey was such a great ally. Well, last week, we had hearings in our  committee that demonstrate that Turkey is not such a great ally of the  United States.   And, finally, we were told--and this is insulting, I think--during  the rules debate by someone arguing against the rule that it is not  worth our time: 1.5 million dead.   The fact is that genocide denial is the last act of a genocide.  First, you obliterate a people; then you obliterate their memory; and,  finally, you seek to obliterate the memory of the obliteration.   And, also, genocide denial is the first step in the next genocide.  When Hitler's cadres wondered whether they could get away with the  Holocaust, he was able to reassure them by saying: Who today speaks of  the annihilation of the Armenians?   Denying genocide in the past will lead to more genocides in the  future.   Today, Germany is a great and prosperous democracy because it has  come to grips with its own past. Where would Germany be today if it  denied the Holocaust?   Turkey will become a prosperous and a modern nation only when it  recognizes the first genocide of the 20th century. The best thing we  could do for Turkey is to acknowledge the genocide and urge them to do  likewise.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and  this is, indeed, a bipartisan speech.   The fact is that many other countries have recognized this genocide,  and they have done so under tremendous Turkish pressure. For example,  France was told that they would not be able to export to Turkey if they  recognized the genocide. They did, and, in the subsequent 6 years,  French exports to Turkey quadrupled.   This genocide has been recognized by Argentina, Germany, Italy,  Belgium, and the list goes on and on. It is time for America to also  recognize the truth.   I look forward to the day, which is not true today, when scholars and  individuals in Turkey can talk about the genocide and can come to grips  with their own past instead of being threatened with incarceration for  even mentioning this debate, because Turkey will not have the rule of  law and democracy until you are free to discuss the first genocide of  the 20th century on Turkish soil.
