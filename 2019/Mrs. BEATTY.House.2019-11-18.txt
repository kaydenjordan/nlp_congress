 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  life and legacy of Bernard Tyson, who passed away on November 10 and is  being celebrated at this hour.   I had the privilege of serving alongside Bernard on the board of the  American Heart Association, and I can tell you he was a visionary and a  champion for high quality healthcare for all Americans and providing  some 12 million American men, women, and children healthcare in the  process. That is what he fought for every day as president and CEO of  Kaiser Permanente, in which he served as the first African American in  that role.   He was a trailblazer in the industry with a push-the-envelope  mindset, quick wit, and he was a people person. He never forgot where  he came from. He mentored many and was a prominent African American  that we looked up to.   My condolences, thoughts, and prayers are with his wife and dear  friend, Denise, his son, and the entire family. I am proud to call  Bernard my friend and will miss him dearly and his exceptional  contributions to our Nation's healthcare industry. Rest in peace. Rest  in power.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first, I thank my colleague and friend,  Congresswoman Plaskett, for leading tonight's Congressional Black  Caucus Special Order hour.   First, and certainly fitting, to tonight's topic on mental health, I  salute the life and legacy of a giant in the healthcare industry who  passed on November 10, Bernard Tyson, president and CEO of Kaiser  Permanente and friend.   Just this year, Mr. Speaker, he was talking to the editor-in-chief of  Fortune magazine about lessons learned and lessons that were worth  remembering, and now he has left them behind, and those lessons were  about mental health.   He was talking about, in this healthcare system, we have a system of  healthcare for the body and for the mind, and he had integrated both  into his system, and he had done it in a seamless way and in a way that  did not have stigma.   So, tonight, I say to my friend: Rest in peace. Rest in positive  power in healthcare.   But also, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus is coming  together tonight, as the Congresswoman has said and as she powerfully  leads us, to elevate the conversation about mental health in the  African American community.   Millions of adults and children are impacted by mental health  conditions each year, including depression, schizophrenia, bipolar  disorder, post-traumatic stress, and anxiety.   For too long in our country, there was a stigma associated with  mental health, especially in our community, the African American  community. According to the United States Department of Health and  Human Services, Offices of Minority Health, just in 2017, suicide was  the second leading cause of death for African Americans between the  ages of 15 and 24. Additionally, the death rate from suicide for Black  men was four times greater than for African American women in 2017.   We are encouraged, encouraged to see more influencers, such as Jay-Z  and the ``Breakfast Club'' host, Charlamagne, speak out about mental  health disparities in the Black community. But as the gentlewoman is  leading us tonight in saying more must be done, the Federal Government  has a moral obligation to invest more resources into mental health  services.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership, and I thank  her for being a voice for us on this topic.
