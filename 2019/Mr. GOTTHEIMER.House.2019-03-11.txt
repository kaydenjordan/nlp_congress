 Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairwoman Waters  and Congressman Lucas for working together on the Federal Reserve  Supervision Testimony Clarification Act, which the House passed earlier  today.   Transparency is critical, and my bipartisan bill requires that  Congress receives regular testimony regarding supervisory matters at  the Federal Reserve Board. Congress has a clear responsibility to  ensure that the Federal Reserve is operating in the best interests of  the American taxpayer, and this bill will do just that.   New Jerseyans deserve to know how the Fed is regulating our financial  institutions, and Congress needs to know how it can cut red tape and  grow our economy. But we can't do that if the Fed doesn't come to  testify on its supervisory work.   My bill will help boost government transparency and accountability  for the benefit of north Jersey and the rest of the country.                            ____________________
