 Madam Speaker, having been through this before, I know  how painful impeachment investigations can be. I also know that I am  not alone in saying that supporting this continuing inquiry is not a  decision that any of us makes lightly.   None of us ever hoped to consider investigating our own President for  compromising our national security and obstructing justice. Regardless  of political ideology, we all understand our constitutional duty.   It is with profound sadness and disappointment that we have to  continue this investigation. The accusations the House is investigating  go straight to the heart of our Constitution.   Our Constitution endows us with not only the authority but also the  duty to hold our colleagues in the Federal Government accountable if  they fail to act in the best interest of our Nation. I don't think  anyone here believes that domestic politics should interfere with  foreign policy.   I hope we will all vote to continue this investigation simply so that  we can be clear on all the facts. More than anything, I am confident  that all of us possess a capacity for fairness and a commitment to  doing what is right for the country we love.
