 Mr. Speaker, I also rise to honor my good friend, Damon.  He was a dear friend, trusted colleague, loving husband, and a warrior  who loved and served his country. We will miss him.   Very briefly, I would like to make the observation that the staffs  that we work with here on the Hill are some of the finest men and women  in the country, and the staff that we work with on the Intelligence  Committee is the finest of them all. Damon was their leader. He was  looked to for his leadership, for his compassion, for his humanity, and  for his example of what it meant to be a warrior.   I also have to mention his family, as we honor them as well. Some of  you know that I wear my father's Air Force wings. My brothers have  served in the Air Force. I served in the Air Force. So did Damon's  family.   Yesterday, I had the honor of meeting his father and mother, both  retired Air Force who have served valiantly and served proudly, also  his brother. I have to mention his wife, an Air Force colonel, who is a  leader, a rock.   Having met her, I can tell you that I would follow her into battle.  She is a great example of the finest young men and women that our  Nation has to offer. This family has proven that they love their  country by serving their country. We honor them in this small way today  in the words that we say.   Damon, God bless you. To Damon's family, God bless you. Thank you for  [[Page H9533]]  generations of service to your country and for being an example to all  of us.
