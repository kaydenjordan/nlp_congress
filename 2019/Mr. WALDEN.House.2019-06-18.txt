 Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today in strong support of this  bipartisan bill that extends several key Medicaid programs, H.R. 3253,  the Empowering Beneficiaries, Ensuring Access, and Strengthening  Accountability Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that strengthens the healthcare safety  net for our communities and provides long-term certainty for patients.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Chairman Frank Pallone of the  Energy and Commerce Committee, for his partnership and willingness to  work in good faith on both sides of the aisle to get this done.   We passed a short-term extension of these programs back in March, Mr.  Speaker, to ensure that patients were still protected as we ironed out  the details. Today, we are delivering the long-term deal that I know we  all wanted all along.   A big priority of mine in this package is the 2-year extension of the  Excellence in Mental Health demonstration program at CMS. Eight States,  including my home State of Oregon, are currently participating in this  pilot program, which is designed to increase access to mental health  and substance use treatment services.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Oregon AFSCME  Council 75.                                       Oregon AFSCME Council 75,                                                      June 18, 2019.      Members of the Oregon Delegation,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives: On behalf of the more than 25,000       Oregon AFSCME Council 75 members, we ask you to approve the       Empowering Beneficiaries, Ensuring Access, and Strengthening       Accountability Act of 2019 (H.R. 3253) when the House of       Representatives considers the bill this week.        We strongly support H.R. 3253 because it extends the       Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHC) program       through December 2021. On June 30, the CCBHCs in our state,       along with those in Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey,       New York, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania, face extreme financial       threat. We appreciate that Representative Walden, in his       capacity as Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce       Committee, worked in bipartisan effort to avert the March 30       fiscal cliff in Oregon and Oklahoma and is an original co-      sponsor for H.R. 3253.        At Cascadia Behavioral Health in Portland Oregon, AFSCME       Council 75 members who are therapists, care coordinators,       crisis counselors, residential counselors, support staff and       other workers, deliver whole health care--integrated mental       health and addiction services, primary care and housing--      through the CCBHC program. These health care workers never       stop working to help those who want to get healthy and       recover. It is not just a job; it is a calling.        That core commitment to helping people heal is why       Alexandra Birch, a Qualified Mental Health Associate, cares       deeply about the CCBHC program. It has helped innovate and       improve the delivery of care. She was hired in 2017 as a Care       Coordinator at Cascadia because of an investment Congress       provided to the CCBHC program. In that role she is the glue       that connects primary care with behavioral health care and       makes sure care is focused on the whole patient.        In her work, Ms. Birch treats clients with anxiety and very       high blood pressure but who do not have an established       doctor; she is able to connect them to a doctor. She cares       for clients on certain anti-depressants that experienced       weight gain as a result, which put them at higher risk of       developing diabetes. Because of the investment Congress       provided in establishing CCBHCs, Ms. Birch can direct those       clients to inhouse primary care to monitor and prevent       diabetes.        For practitioners like Ms. Birch, Cascadia's capacity to       bring primary care into the outpatient behavioral health care       clinics is a game-changer. It enhances their delivery of       services and outcomes for their clients. From the frontline       perspective, the integration of behavioral health and primary       care in a CCBHC removes logistical and other obstacles to       consultation between providers. These consultations translate       into improved identification of the best route of care for a       client with complex physical and mental conditions with the       result of getting a client on the road to wellness much       quicker.        Cascadia's capacity to sustain and expand this level of       high-quality coordinated care to a vulnerable population       depends on the dedication and skills of workers like Ms.       Birch and congressional action to continue investing in the       CCBHC fiscal model that covers 100 percent of costs.        With the fiscal investment in CCBHCs, Congress allows       Cascadia staff to reach into the community to expand access       to behavioral health services for individuals with serious       mental illnesses. Cascadia works with Portland's 24-hour       mental health crisis emergency room, Unity Center Behavioral       Health. Cascadia staff establish crisis patients with       Cascadia primary care providers immediately after Unity       hospital care. This enables patients to continue medications       that ensure mental stability until they have fully connected       with Cascadia's mental health providers.        We urge you to pass H.R. 3253 and extend the CCBHC program.       It would be tragic to lose this funding that has sustained       and expanded vital behavioral and medical services to our       community.            Sincerely,                                                  Stacy Chamberlin,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, this is really important legislation.   Last year, my legislation, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities  Act, our opioids legislation, the most comprehensive bill to address a  single drug crisis in our Nation's history, was signed into law. Our  committee has made major strides in addressing the substance use  disorder crisis that is plaguing our communities.   The Excellence in Mental Health demonstration continues that good  work by increasing Medicaid reimbursement for community-based mental  health and addiction treatment services. This 2-year extension for the  participating States will give us time for a full evaluation to  determine the effectiveness of the program and whether it should be  expanded.   Also included in this bill is an extension for the Money Follows the  Person program through fiscal year 2024. This provides resources to  State Medicaid programs to help individuals with chronic conditions and  disabilities transition back into their communities.   We also secured an extension of what is known as the spousal  impoverishment provisions in Medicaid. To be  [[Page H4710]]  clear, this bill actually helps keep spouses of elderly patients from  impoverishment and out of costly nursing home settings. For spouses of  patients receiving home or community-based care, the bill will protect  them from impractical reductions in their income or resources and  ensures that they can live out their lives with independence and  dignity.   Finally, we clarified the authority of State Medicaid fraud and abuse  control units that investigate and prosecute abuse and neglect of  Medicaid beneficiaries. This is simply good government. It is good  government oversight, and it protects patients who are some of  America's most vulnerable.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friends on the Energy and  Commerce Committee for their work on the bill: Dr. Burgess, Mr.  Guthrie, Mr. Upton, Mr. Walberg, and their counterparts on the  Democratic side, Ms. Eshoo, Mrs. Dingell, Ms. Matsui, Mr. Welch, and,  of course, Chairman Pallone.
