 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3109.   Mr. Speaker, one of society's greatest challenges is honoring and  recording with immortal honor the names, the deeds, and the history of  our heroes.   But I believe it is an easy choice to honor Sr. Chief SEAL Ryan  Owens, who was deployed to a country most Americans would struggle to  find on a map. He spent countless times away from his family,  protecting our Nation so that we didn't have to.   Most people will never understand the sacrifice required to keep evil  outside of our gates. Ryan did it for our country, for his family, and  for the soldier on his left or his right. He traded comfort for  hardship time and time again, and ultimately his life. This to preserve  our right to think, our right to believe, and our right to become  whatever we want in this life.   His shining example and sacrifice will be a beacon for generations to  come who will step up to fight, if needed, for a God-given inheritance  of freedom, no matter the cost.   I urge my colleagues to support this United States Post Office  designation to a great American man and warrior, Sr. Chief SEAL Ryan  Owens.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
