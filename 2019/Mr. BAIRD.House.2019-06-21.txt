 Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor Dorothy ``Mom'' Brown  for her dedication to the Phi Kappa Psi house at DePauw University. Few  individuals have had an impact on Phi Kappa Psi as great as Dorothy,  and we thank her for her selflessness.   Prior to her time with Phi Kappa Psi, Dorothy graduated from Indiana  University, receiving a bachelor's degree in education and a master of  science in administration and supervision, and then began a teaching  career in Gary, Indiana.   After serving as a principal in Warren Township Schools in  Indianapolis in the 1980s, Dorothy returned to her home in Greencastle  in 1986 to teach in the Education Department at DePauw University.   In 1993, Dorothy took a new role as housemother of the Phi Kappa Psi  fraternity. She quickly became an anchor for the fraternity and made it  a memorable experience for generations of young men over the next 26  years.   She was honored in 2009 for her contributions to DePauw by the city  of Greencastle, as the DePauw Cultural Resource Center was renamed in  her honor.   Whether during her time as an elementary school teacher or fraternity  housemother, she exemplified leadership and compassion, and I am proud  to call her a fellow Hoosier.   On behalf of the Fourth District of Indiana, I thank her for her  dedication to her community, and I wish her the very best in  retirement.                            ____________________
