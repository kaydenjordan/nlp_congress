 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1215 will do little to protect Americans' access  to safe and affordable healthcare. Instead, it will deny victims of  medical malpractice and defective medical products the opportunity to  be fully compensated for their injuries and to hold wrongdoers  accountable.   This legislation imposes various restrictions on lawsuits against  healthcare providers concerning the provision of healthcare goods or  services that would apply regardless of the merits of the case, the  misconduct at issue, or the severity of the victim's injury.   There are so many problems with this bill, but to begin with, this  bill would cause real harm by severely limiting the ability of victims  to be made whole. For instance, the bill's $250,000 aggregate limit for  noneconomic damages, an amount established more than  [[Page H5264]]  40 years ago pursuant to a California statute, would have a  particularly adverse impact on women, children, the poor, and other  vulnerable members of our society.   These groups are more likely to receive noneconomic damages in  healthcare cases because they are less able to establish lost wages and  other economic losses. Women, for example, are often paid at a lower  rate than men, even for the same job. Also, they are more likely to  suffer noneconomic loss, such as disfigurement or loss of fertility.  Imposing a severe limit on noneconomic damages, therefore, hurts them  disproportionately.                                time  1415    Finally, this bill is particularly harmful for veterans, members of  the military, and their families. Because the bill prevents State tort  law in any healthcare-related lawsuit that includes any coverage  provided by a Federal health program, all cases arising from  substandard care received in a Veterans Administration facility or a  military hospital would be subject to the bill's restrictions.   As a diverse coalition of veterans organizations noted in their  letter of opposition, H.R. 1215 would limit the ability of veterans and  military families to hold healthcare providers, drug manufacturers, and  medical products providers accountable for pain and suffering and death  that result from substandard care, preventable medical errors, and  defective drugs and devices.   For these and other reasons, I implore and urge my colleagues to  oppose H.R. 1215.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the most active Member in the 115th Congress.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I would say to my colleagues that this is about bad  medicine, not good medicine, and it is about undermining good  healthcare, as we have seen in the TrumpCare saga, causing some 49  million people to lose their insurance. Here we go again.   I would offer to say that the most difficult, hurtful, and harmful  aspect of this particular legislation is that it would make it more  difficult for plaintiffs to seek redress for medical injuries that have  been proven in court.   In addition, it proposes to make dangerous and potentially  unconstitutional changes to our Nation's Federal system, intruding on  State sovereignty, the very thing that Republicans seem to relish and  to support, because this bill attempts to preempt the several areas of  tort law that have been traditionally reserved to the States.   I would tell my good friends in Tennessee and West Virginia: Deal  with your States, just as other individuals deal with their own States.   This bill, as well, has a very difficult impact on medical  malpractice. Because it was written so vaguely, the broad language  sweeps into not only doctors and other medical professionals, but  hospitals and clinics and almost every entity that contributes in any  way to making any healthcare product or service available. That clearly  impacts the healthcare of Americans.   When your child is injured through no fault of their own or your own,  you need relief for that child. Interestingly enough, the American Bar  Association that represents all lawyers, trial lawyers, of which there  is an attempt to impugn their work, contempt for trial lawyers and the  good work that they do. But the ABA says they are opposed to this bill,  and they represent lawyers who fight every day to make sure the  injustices don't happen.   But here is the real cause of my angst for this particular bill:  ``Medical Error Leaves Family With Unanswered Questions.''   ``Olivia was a senior in high school in Santa Monica, California, an  accomplished scholar, actress, and musician who had earned early  acceptance to Smith College.''   The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. ``Olivia was born with a congenital heart  condition.''   She was going into college, but had a condition that caused her to go  into the hospital. When she went in, she had a small procedure. Her  vitals were dropping. Hospital staff waited more than 10 minutes before  attempting resuscitation, but it was too late. She remained in a coma  and died.   Mr. Chairman, I include the article in the Record.           Medical Error Leaves Family With Unanswered Questions         Research has found that 440,000 Americans die every year       from preventable medical errors each year.        Olivia was a senior in high school in Santa Monica,       California, an accomplished scholar, actress, and musician       who had earned early acceptance to Smith College.        Olivia was born with a congenital heart condition that was       monitored throughout her childhood.        The fall that Olivia was supposed to start college, she       underwent a routine procedure to help doctors figure out if       she could be considered for a surgery that would improve her       condition.        The procedure was completed without complications, but       while Olivia was still under anesthesia, a cardiology fellow-      in-training pulled the catheter lines, causing Olivia's heart       rate, pulse, and blood pressure to drop rapidly. Even though       her vitals were dropping, hospital staff waited more than 10       minutes before attempting resuscitation. But it was too late.        Olivia would never regain consciousness and died that       winter, never having lived her dream and attending college.        Her future was stolen from her, and immediately her family       tried to understand what had gone wrong. They began to ask       questions on how this could have happened, but they were       given very few answers from the hospital.        Finally, the hospital gave her family incomplete medical       records to sift through and find answers. They sought the       help of an attorney because, despite their best efforts, they       still did not fully understand what caused their daughter's       death. But due to California's out dated $250,000 cap on       medical negligence damages, it was nearly impossible to find       one.        Olivia's life was cut short by a preventable medical error,       and unfortunately, she is not alone. In the U.S., preventable       medical errors are the third leading cause of death.        Our focus should be on improving patient safety and       preventing medical errors, not limiting the rights of injured       patients and their families. Lawmakers who seek to limit the       accountability of health care providers are seeking to limit       our rights and our avenues to justice.        Don't our loved ones deserve better?    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, what do you want families to face--no  relief? Or do you want these constant errors to go unrecognized and  reconciled? This bill will do that by denying the ability.   It provides immunity for healthcare providers who dispense defective  or dangerous products. It makes it harder for victims to attain  adequate legal representation, and it imposes a risk or loss on victims  rather than wrongdoers. This bill undermines healthcare and it  undermines good healthcare.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the American Bar  Association opposing this bill.                                       American Bar Association,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      Re Concerns Regarding H.R. 1215, the ``Protecting Access to           Care Act of 2017.''       Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: On       behalf of the American Bar Association, which is the largest       voluntary membership organization of legal professionals in       the United States, consisting of more than 400,000 members       from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other       jurisdictions, I am writing to express our opposition to H.R.       1215, the ``Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017.'' I       understand that your committee is scheduled to mark up this       bill as early as tomorrow.        For over 200 years, the authority to determine medical       liability law has rested in the states. This system, which       grants each state the autonomy to regulate the resolution of       medical liability actions within its own borders, is a       hallmark of our American justice system. The states also       regulate the insurance industry. Because of the roles they       have played, the states are the repositories of experience       and expertise in these matters. Therefore, the ABA believes       that Congress should not substitute its judgment, as is       proposed in H.R. 1215, for the systems that have evolved in       each state over time.        Specifically, I would like to share with you the ABA's       concerns and other views regarding key provisions in the       proposed legislation relating to damages, proportionate       liability, and contingent fees.        Damages. The ABA believes that compensatory damages should       not be capped at either the state or federal level, and, as a       result, we have serious concerns regarding Section 3(b) of       H.R. 1215 that would cap noneconomic damages for a       plaintiff's injuries at $250,000 regardless of the number of       parties against whom the action is brought or the number of       separate claims or actions brought with respect to the same       injury. For more than thirty years, the ABA has studied the       research on federal and state legislative efforts to impose       limits on noneconomic damages, including pain and suffering.       Empirical research has shown that caps diminish access to the       courts for low wage earners, like the elderly, children, and       women; if economic damages are minor and noneconomic damages       are capped, victims are less likely to be able to obtain       counsel to represent them in seeking redress.        Those affected by caps on damages are the patients who have       been most severely injured by the negligence of others. These       patients who reside in communities around the country should       not be told that, due to an arbitrary limit set by members of       Congress in Washington, DC, they will be deprived of the       compensation determined by a fair and impartial jury. The       courts already possess  [[Page H5267]]       and exercise their powers of remittitur to set aside       excessive jury verdicts, and that is the appropriate solution       rather than an arbitrary cap. For these reasons, the ABA       opposes those provisions in H.R. 1215, such as Section 3(b),       which would place a dollar limit on recoverable damages and       operate to deny full compensation to a patient in a medical       liability action.        Proportionate Liability. Section 3(d) of H.R. 1215 would       create a ``fair share rule'' under which each party would be       liable only for its share of any damages, and, as a result,       the provision would preempt existing state laws that provide       for joint and several liability in medical liability cases.       The ABA believes that, at the state level, the laws providing       for joint and several liability should be modified to       recognize that defendants whose responsibility is       substantially disproportionate to liability for the entire       loss suffered by the plaintiff should be held liable for only       their equitable share of the plaintiff's noneconomic loss.       Although the ABA supports this principle and encourages other       improvements to the tort laws at the state level, it opposes       federal preemption of the medical liability laws of the       states and territories. Therefore, the ABA opposes Section       3(d) to the extent that it would preempt existing state laws       and to the extent that it would apply a proportionate       liability rule to all damages, not just the plaintiff's non-      economic damages.        Contingent Fees. Section 4(a) of H.R. 1215 would empower a       court to reduce the contingent fees paid from a plaintiff's       damage award to an attorney, redirect damages to the       plaintiff, and further reduce contingent fees in cases       involving minors and incompetent persons. The ABA opposes       sliding scales for contingent fees and other special       restrictions on such fees. In 1985, the ABA created a Special       Committee on Medical Professional Liability (``Special       Committee'') to study the initiatives proposed at that time       in an Action Plain of the American Medical Association       Special Task Force on Professional Liability and Insurance.       Among the initiatives was a recommendation of sliding scales       on contingent fees, having effects comparable to the caps       proposed here. After review, the Special Committee concluded       the following:        ``A sliding scale for contingency fees in medical       malpractice litigation may very well reduce total awards for       patient-victims by depriving them of representation by a       trial lawyer sufficiently skilled at obtaining the highest       appropriate award. Mandatory sliding scale systems could also       inhibit claimants' access to the court system by limiting the       availability of counsel. And imposing sliding scales only in       medical malpractice cases would, in effect, create different       level of skills among available counsel for plaintiffs in       medical malpractice cases from those available to claimants       in other tort cases.''        As a result of this finding, the ABA adopted a policy in       1986 that ``no justification exists for imposing special       restrictions on contingent fees in medical malpractice       actions.'' Therefore, the ABA opposes the limits on       contingent fees contained in Section 4 of H.R. 1215.        The American Bar Association remains committed to       maintaining a fair and efficient justice system where victims       of medical malpractice can obtain redress based on state       laws, without arbitrary or harmful restrictions. We offer       these perspectives for your consideration as you mark up H.R.       1215.            Sincerely,                                                  Thomas M. Susman,                             Director, Governmental Affairs Office.   Mr. CHAIR, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I rise in  strong opposition to H.R. 1215, the so-called ``Protecting Access to  Care Act of 2017.''   I oppose this misguided and ill-considered legislation for several  reasons.   Specifically, the bill before us should be rejected because:   1. H.R. 1215 violates state sovereignty;   2. H.R. 1215 applies well beyond medical malpractice;   3. Unjustifiably caps noneconomic damages, which will have a  disproportionately adverse impact on women, the poor, and other  vulnerable groups.   4. Provides unjustifiable immunity for health care providers who  dispense defective or dangerous pharmaceuticals or medical devices;   5. Imposes an excessively short statute of limitations period;   6. Makes it harder for victims to obtain adequate legal  representation; and   7. Inequitably imposes the risk of loss on victims rather than  wrongdoers.   For over 200 years, the authority to determine medical liability has  rested in the states.   This system, which grants each state the autonomy to regulate the  resolution of medical liability actions within its own borders, is a  hallmark of our American justice system.   H.R. 1215 would preempt state law in all 50 states with a rigid,  uniform set of rules designed to make it more difficult for malpractice  victims to obtain relief in the courts.   Victims injured by the negligent conduct of others, who have lost  limbs, suffered traumatic brain injury, or lost their vision following  medical procedures should not be subject to additional burdens of a  possible limited recovery, currently available under state patients'  bills of rights and other protections under the Affordable Care Act.   The definitions in H.R. 1215 are written in such vague and broad  language as to potentially sweep in not only doctors and other medical  professionals, hospitals and clinics, but also every entity that  contributes in any way to making any health care product or service  available, including insurance companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers,  health product manufacturers, pharmacists, nursing homes, assisted  living facilities, and mental health treatment centers, and drug and  alcohol rehabilitation facility, among others.   H.R. 1215 will do nothing to strengthen protections for patients.   It goes in the opposite direction, by excusing the health care  industry from accountability for carelessness, and shifting the burden  for shouldering the consequences of preventable medical injury to the  injured patients, their families, their employers, their insurance  companies, and taxpayers.   Current provisions of the Affordable Care Act prohibit insurance  companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions, mandate  coverage for young adults and children under the age of 26, and secure  lifetime coverage caps, ensuring patients receive the care they need.   Empirical research has shown that caps on damages, such as those  envisioned by H.R. 1215, diminish access to the courts for the most  vulnerable, such as low wage earners, like the elderly, children, and  women.   The bill arbitrarily caps so-called ``non-economic loss''--which  sweeps in essentially everything that is not loss of salary or  additional medical expenses--at $250,000 for the patient's lifetime,  punishing those patients with the most devastating, life-altering  injuries.   The bill forces the injured patient to take the amounts received for  future expenses resulting from the injury in a ``structured  settlement,'' which may not match up with the patient's actual needs as  they arise, and would further reduce the amount the careless health  care provider actually pays.   Preventable medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in  the United States, with an estimated 440,000 deaths each year following  a medical error or hospital-caused infection during a hospital stay.   Addressing this problem must be a national priority.   And although policies to promote and require safer practices are key  to this effort, that is insufficient.   We cannot assign a government monitor to every hospital operating  room and every doctor's office.   Effective protection should also include enabling patients and their  families to hold health care providers accountable for errors that  cause harm.   H.R. 1215 would unfortunately take several major steps backward from  this goal.   The bill twists important protections found in many state laws into  an additional legal hurdle.   An extended statute of limitations protection allows patients who do  not discover their injury until much later, sometimes many years after  the medical procedure or intervention, to still have a change to seek  legal help.   But in the bill, the period in which an injured patient can seek  legal help is actually shortened to one year.   The bill cuts off a patient injured as a young child if their family  fails to bring legal action on their behalf, long before they are old  enough to legally act on their own behalf.   This legislation would impose various restrictions on medical  malpractice lawsuits, causing these restrictions to apply regardless of  how much merit a case may have, the negligence at issue, or the  severity of the issue.   If economic damages are minor and noneconomic damages are capped,  victims are less likely to be able to obtain counsel to represent them  in seeking redress in these personal injury malpractice cases that  often operate under contingency fee.   Those affected by caps on damages are the patients who have been most  severely injured by the negligence of others.   These patients who reside in communities around the country should  not be told that, due to an arbitrary limit set by members of Congress  in Washington, DC, they will be deprived of the compensation determined  by a fair and impartial jury.   The courts already possess and exercise their powers of remittitur to  set aside excessive jury verdicts, and that is the appropriate solution  rather than an arbitrary cap.   I am concerned that H.R. 1215 would put patient safety at higher  risk, by significantly undermining the accountability of those who  provide patients with medical care.   H.R. 1215 undercuts patients in situations in which carelessness or  misconduct by several health care providers combines to injure the  patient.   It arbitrarily ``divides'' blame among those actors and then if one  of them evades accountability for any reason, the others who caused the  injury are excused from having to make up the difference, and the  injured patient is short-changed.  [[Page H5268]]    H.R. 1215 shifts accountability away from the careless health care  providers who caused the injury and onto ``collateral sources,'' such  as the patient's insurance company or employer, or the government, that  pay for part of the patient's medical expenses or other expenses  resulting from the injury.   In effect, these other sources provide involuntary free insurance to  careless health care providers.   The bill excuses doctors and other health care providers from any  responsibility of looking into the safety and effectiveness of any  medication or medical product, so long as it has been approved by the  FDA.   Accordingly, I strongly oppose H.R. 1215 for these and many more  reasons and urge my colleagues to reject this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman very much. I think  the question to the gentleman from Michigan, and the gentleman's  comments from Iowa, is the question of good medicine, and additional  tests may, frankly, just be good medicine.   Maybe, Mr. Chair, Mr. Conyers would agree that we should gather about  insurance reform and capping premiums so that we can help our doctors.  And I would assure you that they would be very happy on that.   But to the gentleman's point, I'm sorry to say he was incorrect,  because we note that there are almost 20 States that have a variety of  noncaps on certain aspects, and now the Federal intrusion will come in  and now tell them where they do not have caps, that they have to have  caps.   In fact, he is incorrect, and this bill does skew the medical service  or medical treatment in our States.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), a distinguished member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just have to add here that H.R. 1215 deeply intrudes on States'  sovereignty. In particular, H.R. 1215 preempts State law governing  joint and several liability, the availability of damages, the ability  to introduce evidence of collateral source benefits, attorneys' fees,  and periodic payments of future damages.   Members should not be fooled by assertions that the bill preserves  State law. In fact, the rule of construction contained in the bill  expressly states that it preempts State law, except in very limited  circumstances where State law is more favorable to defendants.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Chairman, I refer my colleague, the floor leader on  the other side to section 9 of the bill. We have just looked at it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Numerous consumer, labor, veterans, and legal groups all oppose H.R.  1215, including the AFL-CIO, the American College of Physicians, the  Consumers Union, Public Citizen, Vietnam Veterans of America, 12 other  national veterans organizations, and the Liberty Caucus.   H.R. 1215 is an extremely flawed bill that will deny access to  justice for victims of medical malpractice and especially those who are  the most vulnerable among us. It would deny full compensation for  injuries suffered by veterans and military families, children, the  elderly, and the poor.   I hope my colleagues will join us in opposing this very unnecessary,  mean-spirited bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
