 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marc Gallaway  from Selah Middle School for being named the Association of Washington  School Principals Middle Level Principal of the Year.   A lifelong Washingtonian, Marc Gallaway earned his bachelor's degree  from Central Washington University and his master's degree from  Heritage University in Toppenish. He worked as both a special education  teacher and a baseball coach before he came to work at Selah Junior  High School in 2005.   Mr. Gallaway has served as principal at what is now Selah Middle  School for the past 14 years. Every day, Mr. Gallaway nurtures a  culture of positivity and teamwork among students and staff.   Mr. Speaker, I want to honor Mr. Gallaway for empowering students and  teachers to embrace the Viking Way and thank him for his positive  influence that he has had on students in central Washington.   This award is something that Mr. Gallaway, his students, and fellow  faculty and staff should be very proud of. I urge my colleagues to join  me in congratulating Marc Gallaway on this significant achievement.                 Celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month     Mr. Speaker, September is National Hispanic Heritage  Month, and I am proud to represent central Washington where Hispanic  heritage and culture tells the story of many of my constituents and our  communities.   I have witnessed firsthand how Hispanic Americans contribute to our  communities through entrepreneurship, military service, and cultural  diversity. I am proud to recognize my Hispanic American friends and  neighbors in Washington's Fourth Congressional District.   I am also proud to support national appreciation of Hispanic American  and Latino leadership and heritage as an original cosponsor of the  National Museum of the American Latino Act. I support the establishment  of a Smithsonian museum to recognize Latino contributions to American  history, life, art, and culture.   In the United States, our shared values bring us together, and we  cherish our Nation's diverse history. I urge my colleagues to join me  in celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month.   Recognizing Cathey Anderson for Energy Northwest's CEO Lifesaving Award     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Cathey Anderson  for the compassion she demonstrated aboard a flight from Nevada to  central Washington.   Cathey did not think twice before springing into action when she  noticed a man in his 70s who was traveling alone. He appeared confused  and then lost consciousness.   Cathey recognized the signs of a seizure, and she took the initiative  to help. She and two other nurses administered medical treatment until  the flight landed, and they were greeted by medical crews upon arrival  in Yakima.   Cathey is a registered nurse and the occupational health supervisor  at Energy Northwest. She was awarded the CEO Lifesaving Award for her  actions.  [[Page H8891]]    To Cathey's family and friends, her quick action was not a surprise,  because it wasn't the first time she comforted a stranger in distress.   I thank Cathey for her willingness to help others around her  everywhere she goes. Please join me in recognizing Cathey Anderson for  receiving this prestigious award.                            ____________________
