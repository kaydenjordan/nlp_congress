 Mr. Speaker, while working families are facing economic  challenges, House Republicans continue to prioritize political stunts.   This week, Republicans have taken to the House floor to support  efforts that disseminate extreme MAGA conspiracy theories and encourage  the spread of foreign propaganda and harmful online content that  undermine our democracy.   House Republicans are also using committee hearings to dehumanize the  LGBTQ community--promoting hateful and dangerous rhetoric.   House Democrats will always put people over politics, and we continue  to work to build on the economic gains we have made over the last 2  years.   House Democrats continue to work to lower costs and invest in  America--all while reducing the Federal deficit.   It is past time for House Republicans to stop playing the politics of  demonization and work for the American people and work for their  interests.                            ____________________
