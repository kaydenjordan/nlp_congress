 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of amendment No. 49 on the International  Military Education and Training Program. IMET is, as we all know, a  prestigious and competitive program that trains the next generation of  senior leadership in our allies' militaries around the globe and  enables us to maximize the competitive advantage our alliances and  partnerships provide.   However, as of 2019, approximately only 8 percent of the IMET's  participants were women. That percentage increase was only 2 points  since 2015.   We can and must do better to ensure that we continue to provide this  world-class training to our female military leaders around the world.   This amendment would simply require a gender analysis assessment of  the program to better understand the impediments to increasing the  number of female participants and address any specific needs the women  in the program may have.   By signaling the importance of including more gender diversity in the  program, we are encouraging our partners and allied militaries to  invest more heavily in the recruitment, training, and promotion of  women within their security forces.   We do know that this is not just important; it is smart. We know that  our world is more peaceful and prosperous when women are involved in  national security and defense decisionmaking processes.   I also want to point out that this will continue the work that was  begun under former President Trump when he signed the Women, Peace, and  Security Act during his administration. It received bipartisan support  then. It is also supported by President Biden.   It will also improve military effectiveness of our security partners  and, thereby, advance implementation of the National Defense Strategy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I, too, share a position of working well with my  colleague as the ranking member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee.  I just feel that he is not appreciating, with all due respect, what  this amendment does.    We already say that women, peace, and security should be part of it.  That was something that was signed by President Trump, and it was  bipartisan then. It is something that has also been embraced by  President Biden.   This is only looking at the fact that very few women in the military  of our allies have been participating in this program. This program  exists to provide military education and training to our allies, and we  are talking about only 6 to 8 percent of them being women who are  participating.   This is an analysis. That is all this amendment does is analyze  whether or not we have promoted this properly to encourage our allies  to have servicewomen in their countries participate.   We do know that when you have women in the military, it adds to our  success. It does not degrade it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues, this is a really  important amendment. This deals with suicide and securing guns.   This program will be a pilot. It will be at five installations. It  will be voluntary. It is bipartisan and bicameral.   Senator Dan Sullivan is my co-lead on the Senate side. It is already  in the Senate NDAA. The NRA is satisfied with this amendment.   So what does it do?   This year, my subcommittee has spent over 100 hours on the issue of  suicide in the military. I have personally spoken to parents and  spouses of servicemembers who have died by suicide.                                time  2300    We have seen an extraordinary increase in suicide in our Active-Duty  servicemembers, some 40 percent increase in the past 5 years, and we  have hot spots in areas like Alaska and on the USS George Washington,  where most recently seven sailors have died by suicide. In Alaska we  have seen the suicide rate double in 2021.   Since then, I have traveled to Alaska with Senator Sullivan to visit  soldiers in Anchorage and Fairbanks. We have heard from junior enlisted  soldiers who feel isolated, stressed out, and disconnected, who must  wait 2 to 3 months to see a behavioral health provider. The providers  are overwhelmed by demand from suicidal servicemembers. It is a  challenging problem.   Earlier in March, the subcommittee had a hearing, and one of the  experts said that one of the best things we can do is deal with the  issue that many persons who are contemplating suicide are making that  decision impulsively. A few seconds makes a difference.   The experts are saying to us, if we have a simple process by which,  voluntarily, servicemembers can request a gun safe or a firearm lock  and have it paid for, that will save lives because ideations can come  and go so quickly.   We must create a new norm, not through mandates, but by  encouragement. This amendment would create a voluntary pilot program at  five installations, as I already mentioned. Safe storage has bipartisan  support from both Presidents Trump and Biden, and I would really  request a resounding bipartisan vote for this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I have great admiration for the ranking member of the  committee. A lot of things aren't DOD's responsibility, except for the  fact that servicemembers are their responsibility, and we have an  obligation to address this extraordinary rate of suicide in the  military.   This is one modest step, as a pilot program, to determine whether or  not it is effective. We have experts telling us it is, and we have a  crisis of servicemembers who are taking their lives. There does not  appear to be rhyme or reason to it but for the fact that they have  suicidal ideations or because they can't see behavioral health experts,  which we are trying to address through other elements of the NDAA. I  feel very strongly that this is really a key.   Again, it is bipartisan, it is bicameral, and the NRA is fine with  the amendment.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I think I have said enough, and I will  close. I ask for a ``yes'' vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to make this short and hopefully sweet  because I can't believe for a minute that we don't want to incentivize  States to guarantee, at a minimum, the rights we have already  established in the Survivors' Bill of Rights Act, which was passed in  Congress unanimously in 2016.   This amendment is based on a bipartisan bill offered by myself and  Congressman Kelly Armstrong and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren and  introduced by the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  Chuck Grassley.   When we actually enacted the Survivors' Bill of Rights, it guaranteed  certain rights for sexual assault survivors. Unfortunately, those  rights only applied to Federal cases. This amendment makes further  progress by incentivizing States to follow suit.   What we are debating here is really quite common sense: The right to  have a rape kit if you are raped, the right not to be charged for it,  the right to be notified if the government intends to destroy a rape  kit, the right to be notified of the rape kit's results, the right to  have the rape kit preserved for the statute of limitations or 20 years,  whichever is shorter, and the right to be informed of the status and  location of a rape kit.   Across the country, survivors are shocked to learn that their rape  kits have been thrown out or they can't find them.   Again, we have done this on a Federal level. Congress has recognized  the rights that are good enough for victims of Federal crimes should  also be good enough for those who become victims of State crimes.   Again, this is a simple amendment. It is bipartisan. It is  incentivizing, not demanding or requiring.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This is really astonishing to me, as if servicemembers who are  female, who are in States in which they do not have these benefits,  should somehow be second-class citizens, I don't get.   We have a Parliamentarian who determines whether or not an amendment  is germane to the NDAA. That has already taken place. So having this  debate is irrelevant, because we have already established that it is  germane.   I don't know about you, but I am not just legislating for the people  of California. I am legislating for the entire country. That is my job.   If there is a sexual assault victim in a State where they don't have  the resources to somehow provide the Survivors' Bill of Rights, we have  already done this on a Federal level and we offer some incentive so  they do it, I don't see how this is any different than the other  programs we have that we continue to fund for local jurisdictions all  across this country, whether it is the COPS program or anything else.   So I am flummoxed by this debate on the other side. It is not a  laughing matter. It is very serious. I think sexual assault victims  across this country would like to know that they have the same rights  in States as those who are victims of Federal crimes when it comes to  being able to access a rape kit, have it paid for, and being told what  the results are. It is common sense.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it wasn't short nor sweet, but I am prepared  to close and say this is pretty obvious. This does not take rocket  science. All we are doing with this amendment, that is bipartisan and  bicameral--maybe the gentleman should talk to Senator Grassley. We want  to encourage States to do what we have done on the Federal level.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
