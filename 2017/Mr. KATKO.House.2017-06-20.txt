The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation seeks to expand the Department of  Homeland Security's Traveler Redress Inquiry Program, commonly referred  to as TRIP, to assist travelers who feel that they have been repeatedly  selected for enhanced screening in an unfair manner.   Currently, the TRIP process only provides redress to individuals who  have been placed on the no-fly list. However, for reasons unknown to  the individual, they can be perpetually selected for enhanced screening  without any opportunity to correct the record, if he or she fails, that  this is due to an error.   This issue first came to our attention when an individual who works  for a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization alerted the  committee that he had been subject to enhanced pat-downs by TSA agents  every time he traveled through an airport for over 3 years.   Although he twice submitted inquiries to the Department of Homeland  Security through the TRIP process, he remained unable to obtain  information as to why he was currently getting flagged as a potential  security threat at the airport.   As you can imagine, this can cause a great deal of stress and worry  for someone who feels that they have been targeted by the U.S.  Government for unknown reasons.   After continued prodding of TSA by my subcommittee staff, this  individual, a U.S. citizen, was cleared by Homeland Security and is now  able to travel hassle free.   Unfortunately, this example is not an isolated case. Several weeks  ago, a member of the committee staff also was repeatedly selected for  enhanced  [[Page H4976]]  screening on multiple flights after traveling to the Middle East as  part of an official congressional staff delegation.   When my staff looked into this case, the staffer had been mistakenly  flagged for enhanced screening due to erroneous information that was  entered into the Terrorist Screening Database, or TSDB.   As these anecdotes demonstrate, Homeland Security needs to establish  a formal mechanism to handle these cases. My legislation requires the  Department to do just that.   I would like to thank Chairman McCaul, Congressmen King and Vela, and  Congresswoman Watson Coleman for their support of this bipartisan  legislation. I thank the Speaker for allowing today's consideration of  the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Before I close, I want to note briefly that this is yet another bill  that has come out of Homeland Security that has been done so in a  purely bipartisan manner. I think that serves as an example of how  Congress can abide, going forward, in getting things done, big issues  and small. There are no small issues when it comes to terrorism, but we  seem to be united in our quest to make this country as safe as we can.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues once again to support H.R. 2132, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 2132, ``Traveler Redress  Improvement Act of 2017,'' which requires the implementation of a  redress process and review of the Transportation Security  Administration's intelligence-based screening rules for aviation  security.   The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) provides a  redress process for individuals who have been denied or delayed airline  boarding, entry into or exit from the United States at a port of entry  or border crossing, or have been repeatedly referred for additional  (secondary) screening.   I thank the Committee for accepting the Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R.  2132, which extends the time for GAO to submit its report from 180 days  to one year.   The Jackson Lee Amendment gives GAO additional time to do its work  after TSA concludes its work on the Privacy Impact Assessment for the  Secure Flight program.   In 2015, there were 178 days when TSA screened more than 2 million  passengers in a single day.   George Bush International and William P. Hobby Airports are essential  hubs for domestic and international air travel for Houston and the  region.   Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush International  Airport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P.  Hobby (HOU).   Persons who routinely undergo secondary screening or incur delays in  boarding flights only have the DHS TRIP as their sole means of redress.   DHS TRIP is a single point of contact for individuals who have  inquiries or seek resolution regarding travel difficulties that may be  caused by watch list issues, screening problems at ports of entry, and  situations where travelers believe they have been unfairly or  incorrectly delayed, denied boarding or identified for additional  screening at our nation's transportation hubs.   H.R. 2132 requires TSA, to report within 18o days on the  implementation of the redress process to the Committee on Homeland  Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation of the Senate.   TSA is also required to review and update the Privacy Impact  Assessment Act for the Secure Flight programs in order to make sure  this assessment reflects the operation of the DHS TRIP.   As an added measure to ensure DHS TRIP has the most up to date  information, the TSA Assistant Administrator of the Office of  Intelligence Analysis must conduct a comprehensive review of TSA's  intelligence-based screening rules every 120 days.   Once this review is completed, the Office of Intelligence Analysis of  TSA has 48 hours to notify relevant DHS offices if there is any change,  update, implementation, or suspension of any rule or method.   Reviewing the screening rules allows TSA to keep the methods that are  used for security as up to date as possible and to ensure that air  travelers are treated fairly.   I am a strong proponent of privacy, civil liberties, and due process.   The Federal Privacy Act assures that when agencies use electronic  databases to collect, retain, process, or make decisions regarding-U.S.  citizens that their privacy is protected.   I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to vote in support  of H.R. 2132.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2132, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 625) to provide for joint reports by relevant Federal agencies to  Congress regarding incidents of terrorism, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 625         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reporting Efficiently to       Proper Officials in Response to Terrorism Act of 2017'' or       the ``REPORT Act''.       SEC. 2. DUTY TO REPORT.         (a) Duty Imposed.--Whenever an act of terrorism occurs in       the United States, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of       Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Director of the       Federal Bureau of Investigation, and, as appropriate, the       head of the National Counterterrorism Center, to submit,       within one year of the completion of the investigation       concerning such act by the primary  [[Page H4977]]       Government agency conducting such investigation, an       unclassified report (which may be accompanied by a classified       annex) to Congress concerning such act.        (b) Content of Reports.--A report under this section       shall--        (1) include a statement of the facts of the act of       terrorism referred to in subsection (a), as known at the time       of the report;        (2) identify any gaps in national security that could be       addressed to prevent future acts of terrorism; and        (3) any recommendations for additional measures that could       be taken to improve homeland security, including potential       changes in law enforcement practices or changes in law, with       particular attention to changes that could help prevent       future acts of terrorism.        (c) Exception.--The duty established under subsection (a)       shall not apply in instances in which the Secretary of       Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Director of the       Federal Bureau of Investigation, or the head of the National       Counterterrorism Center determines that the information       required to be reported could jeopardize an ongoing       investigation or prosecution. In such instances, the       Secretary shall notify Congress of such prior to the first       anniversary of the completion of the investigation described       in such subsection.        (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``act of       terrorism'' has the meaning given such term in section 3077       of title 18, United States Code.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has an obligation to ensure that our national  counterterrorism programs and policies are as effective as possible. At  every opportunity, we should assess gaps and weaknesses and work to  find opportunities for improvement.   For example, the committee's investigation into the 2013 tragic  Boston Marathon bombings revealed a series of weaknesses we have worked  to correct; and many of the recent attacks, including the San  Bernardino and Garland shootings, the Orlando Pulse nightclub attack,  and other small-scale plots have each prompted review, reflection, and  action.   The REPORT Act will provide valuable assistance in this work by  requiring the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with  other Federal officials, to submit a report to Congress on incidents of  terrorism within 1 year of completion of the investigation.   Importantly, this report will provide Congress with the facts of the  incident, a review of security gaps, and recommendations to improve  homeland security efforts.   As the committee has learned over the years, it can often be a  challenge to obtain timely and comprehensive sharing of information by  the executive branch in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. While  perhaps understandable, the REPORT Act, offered by Congressman Aguilar,  will help ensure that Congress receives the information it needs. This  is a valuable addition, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Aguilar for introducing this  important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 625, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 625, the Reporting  Efficiently to Proper Officials in Response to Terrorism Act of 2017,  or the ``REPORT Act.''   The REPORT Act bridges an information and preparedness gap that has  for too long clouded the information Congress receives about acts of  terrorism that happen in our homeland.   The REPORT Act requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in  coordination with the Attorney General, the Director of the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, and, if appropriate, the head of the National  Counterterrorism Center, to submit an unclassified report to Congress,  within one year of the completion of an investigation of act of  terrorism in the United States.   This report will include a statement of the facts regarding the act  of terrorism; identify any possible national security gaps that could  prevent future acts of terrorism, and any recommendations for  additional homeland security improvement measures.   The report will help Congress to enact legislation to effectively  address security gaps in our national security efforts.   The REPORT Act fosters accountability, collaboration, and  preparedness.   Acts of terror and violence have been at the forefront of the  American collective memory for more than a decade now.   Americans have become accustomed to hearing about attacks all across  our homeland and around the world.   The Bookings Institute labeled 2016 as the year of the ``Lone Wolf''  terrorist.   Radicalized individuals acting on their own pose a strategic and  institutional threat to our national security.   This phenomenon requires us to think creatively and collectively to  be prepared to address the idiosyncratic aspects of this new wave of  terror.   The REPORT Act relies on our current security structure to prepare us  for the future.   Attacks such as the attack on LGBT people of color in Pulse, the  attacks in the City of San Bernardino, and recent attacks in London  highlight the importance of collaboration and sharing of knowledge to  prevent more attacks from happening.   This common sense bill relies on our current expertise to prepare for  the future.   Mr. Speaker, we share the responsibility with the President to keep  Americans safe and this bill is a step towards improving the way we go  about protecting the American people.   I support the REPORT Act and urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this important legislation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 625, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
