 I would like to thank my colleague and friend from  North Carolina, the gentleman, Congressman Walker, for yielding to me  and for hosting this Special Order tonight, which is fittingly titled,  ``The People's Night.'' After all, there is a reason that the United  States House of Representatives is often called the people's House. It  is because our job is to fight for the priorities of the people that we  are privileged to represent here.   Over the past 6 months, Republicans have been fighting for the  people, fighting to fundamentally change Washington and to return power  to the American people where it really belongs.   We have been doing this against a strong headwind of obstructionists,  sometimes from colleagues across the aisle, sometimes from certain in  the media more interested in a liberal agenda than in accurate  reporting, and sometimes from embedded bureaucrats and special  interests within the government industrial complex who really don't  want to see the Washington swamp drained. But in spite of that, we are  succeeding.                                time  1700    And while many of these conservative winds have gone unreported and,  therefore, flown under the radar, the truth is that we are indeed  steering the ship in the right direction, we are steadily undoing the  damage done by out-of-touch policies by the Obama administration.   Case in point is a fact that has not garnered a lot of headlines, but  should have, something that Congressman Walker pointed out earlier: the  fact that in the first 100 days of this 115th Congress, we have passed  more bills--158 to be exact--than were passed during the first 100 days  of any and all of the four prior administrations: the Obama, Bush,  Clinton, and H.W. Bush administrations. And as proof of our  productivity, we have signed more of those bills into law than in any  of the other administrations' first 100 days as well.   But it is not just the quantity of the bills that we are turning into  laws. It is about the quality and the substance. We are passing  legislation that is making government smaller. We are passing  legislation that is making government less costly. We are passing  legislation that is making the government finally more accountable to  the people. We are dismantling the enormous bureaucratic overgrowth and  underbrush that spun out of control under former President Obama.   As a former prosecutor, I believe you have got to win your case with  verifiable facts and evidence, so let me give you some. In the last 20  years, prior Congresses have successfully used the Congressional Review  Act one time. Just once in the prior 20 years has Congress used the CRA  to undo midnight regulations passed at the 12th hour in the dead of  night as administrations were walking out the door. But in the first 4  months of this Congress, Republicans have united to use the CRA 14  times to overturn 14 of President Obama's most harmful midnight  regulations, and in so doing, we have saved the American people, the  United States taxpayers, billions of dollars in the process.   Now we are in the process of finally saving America from arguably the  most disastrous piece of legislation in our Nation's history:  ObamaCare.   If anyone needs any further evidence of its implosion into a death  spiral,  [[Page H4903]]  just yesterday CMS announced that 2 million Americans dropped off of  the ObamaCare exchanges in just the first 3 months of this year.   The ObamaCare house is on fire, and rather than waiting for it to  burn to the ground with American families still inside, Republicans in  the peoples' House have acted now. Republicans won't let Americans  suffer in the face of such inevitable continuing adversity when it  comes to our healthcare. So as ObamaCare continues to dissolve in front  of our eyes, we have already taken action by sending an ObamaCare  repeal bill over to the Senate.   All of this work makes me incredibly optimistic about the results  that we are continuing to deliver on the people's behalf, just as we  did again last week when we passed a House bill that tackles a key  issue that I have been sounding the alarm about since my first day in  Congress: ending the reckless overreach of Elizabeth Warren's Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau.   I was so grateful for the opportunity to support the House's passage  of my fellow Texan, Jeb Hensarling's, Financial CHOICE Act last week,  which puts an end to the days of the Obama-era CFPB as we know it,  because the Financial CHOICE Act legislation converts the CFPB into the  Consumer Law Enforcement Agency, which is tasked with promoting  competition rather than stifling it, tasked with enhancing consumer  choice rather than eliminating it, all the while ensuring congressional  oversight that has been missing for far too long.   Mr. Speaker, every Federal agency needs to have someone grading its  paper, and the Financial CHOICE Act will allow the CFPB's paper to be  graded for the very first time.   I am incredibly excited about the economic opportunities that our  Nation is going to continue to be afforded as we continue here to wipe  away President Obama's sweeping government mandates and regulations so  we can get our country back on track and back working for all  Americans.   There is a lot more to be done to ensure that America's brightest  days truly are ahead of us, but with so many committed conservatives as  we have here tonight, I am optimistic that we are going to continue to  deliver results for the people here in what finally, once again, can be  appropriately referred to as the peoples' House.
