 Madam President, I am putting a hold on the nomination of  Mr. Jason Klitenic to be General Counsel of the Office of Director of  National Intelligence. I intend to maintain the hold until there is a  satisfactory response to the March 6, 2018, letter Senator Grassley and  I sent the Director of National Intelligence regarding the Intelligence  Community Office of Inspector General, OIG, and the termination of its  Executive Director of Intelligence Community Whistleblowing and Source  Protection. To date, we have received no response to the letter, nor  have we been provided the documents related to the Executive Director's  termination requested in the letter.   My hold is not connected to the qualifications of Mr. Klitenic to  serve in the position to which he has been nominated, and it is my  intention to release the hold once my concerns related to the OIG are  resolved.   I ask unanimous consent to have the March 6, 2018, letter printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      March 6, 2018.      Hon. Daniel Coats,      Director of National Intelligence,      Washington, DC.        Dear Director Coats: We write to express deep concern about       the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General       (OIG) and to urge that you stay actions taken by the OIG       pending confirmation of the new Inspector General. We are       writing to you because the current acting leadership of the       OIG is the subject of our concerns as well as the subject of       allegations in connection with the specific personnel matter       in question.        Late last week, the OIG's Executive Director of       Intelligence Community Whistleblowing and Source Protection       (the ``Executive Director'') was terminated in a process       marked by procedural irregularities and serious conflicts of       interest. Further, the termination of the Executive Director       came after an extended period during which the acting       leadership of the OIG demonstrated a lack of support for the       critical whistleblower protection mission of the office.        The timing of these actions, which occurred during the       confirmation process for Mr. Michael Atkinson to be the new       Inspector General, is especially troubling. We are concerned       that the termination of the Executive Director may constitute       an effort to preempt the nominee's authority to make his own       decisions upon confirmation. Moreover, during the nominee's       hearing, multiple U.S. Senators expressed the expectation       that the nominee would, if confirmed, address their concerns       regarding the current acting leadership of the OIG and its       approach to whistleblowers. We are concerned that any       preemptive steps taken by the acting leadership risk       undercutting the constitutional authority of the U.S. Senate       to provide advice and consent through the confirmation       process.        We therefore write with several urgent requests. First, on       November 29, 2017, Senator Grassley sent you and the Acting       Inspector General letters urging the preservation of all       records relating to the Executive Director's then-proposed       termination, as well as all the contents of the Executive       Director's office.  [[Page S2139]]       Senator Grassley has not received responses to those letters.       We request that you respond and that you ensure that the       Acting Inspector General responds as well. We further request       that the preservation described in the letters be       implemented, and that it be applied as well to all subsequent       records related to the Executive Director's termination and       all matters then pending involving his Office.        Second, Senator Grassley's letters requested documents       related to the personnel action against the Executive       Director and related matters. We request your support in       ensuring that Congress receives the documents described in       the letters as well as subsequent documents related to the       process by which the Executive Director was terminated.        Finally, we urge that all personnel decisions made by the       OIG since the nomination of Mr. Atkinson, including the       termination of the Executive Director, be stayed pending his       confirmation. (Mr. Atkinson's nomination has been favorably       reported by both the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs and the Select Committee on Intelligence       and is awaiting final Senate action on the Calendar.) Upon       his confirmation, the new Inspector General should have the       unfettered authority to consider both personnel and policy       matters de novo without being hindered by preemptive actions       taken by the current acting leadership.        Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.            Sincerely,      Charles Grassley,        U.S. Senator.      Ron Wyden,        U.S. Senator.                            ____________________
