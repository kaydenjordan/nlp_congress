 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Mack Cole of Treasure County, a third generation  Montanan and dedicated public servant. Next month, Mr. Cole will  celebrate 55 years of marriage with his wife, Judy. Mack and Judy Cole  were married in February 10, 1962, in the town of Hysham, one of the  many beautiful small communities in the quiet and peaceful high plains  of eastern Montana.   After marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Cole spent 2 years in South America,  providing much needed services while working for the Food for Peace  Program in Brazil. Mr. Cole's experience in South America would serve  as a trailhead for a lifelong journey of civic minded virtue and  dedication on behalf of his fellow citizens.   In the late 1970s, Mr. and Mrs. Cole moved down the road, west on I- 90 to Billings, MT, and they continued to build upon their honorable  records of public service. During this chapter of his life, Mr. Cole  worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in multiple western States and  was involved in a wide variety of programs, including the development  of irrigation projects. His work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs took  him to Wyoming, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. After retiring from the  Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1993, the Coles moved back to the family  ranch outside of Hysham.   Mr. Cole continued his distinguished record of public service by  representing the people of Treasure County in the Montana Legislature,  retiring from the State senate in 2003. During his time in legislature  and even after retirement from public life, Mr. Cole has always been a  steadfast supporter of responsible energy development, a critical  component for the livelihood of many of his friends and neighbors.   His humble efforts to help provide food to the hungry, keep water  flowing to farms and ranches ensuring energy was always ready at the  flip of a switch make him a great Montanan. It is hard to find a better  example of a fellow Montanan that is always ready to offer a helping  hand.   I want to express my deep gratitude to Mr. Cole for his dedication  and service to Montana and our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF ALEX DIEKMANN PEAK, MONTANA.         (a) In General.--The unnamed 9,765-foot peak located 2.2       miles west-northwest of Finger Mountain on the western       boundary of the Lee Metcalf Wilderness, Montana (UTM       coordinates Zone 12, 457966 E., 4982589 N.), shall be known       and designated as ``Alex Diekmann Peak''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, record, or other paper of the United States to the       peak described in subsection (a) shall be considered to be a       reference to ``Alex Diekmann Peak''.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Cornyn,          Mr. Cruz, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Flake, Mr. Hatch, and          Mr. Tillis):   S. 119. A bill to impose certain limitations on consent decrees and  settlement agreements by agencies that require the agencies to take  regulatory action in accordance with the terms thereof, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, in 2005, the Federal Government enacted  the REAL ID Act, imposing Federal standards established by the  Department of Homeland Security to the process and production of the  issuance of States' driver's licenses and identification cards.   This law was an underfunded, top down, Federal mandate, infringing on  personal privacy, increasing the personal information susceptible to  cyber-attacks, and undermining State sovereignty. Furthermore, a REAL  ID compliant State ID will be required for all ``official federal  purposes,'' including boarding commercial aircraft, impeding the  movement of American citizens.   Montana led opposition to this Federal mandate. In 2007, Montana  enacted a law, after both chambers of the State legislature unanimously  passing legislation, refusing to comply.   That is why I am reintroducing the Repeal ID Act--to allow Montana  and other States to implement their laws, protecting their sovereignty  and citizens' information. Consistent with the Montana State  legislature, this legislation will repeal the REAL ID Act of 2005.   Montanans are fully aware of the power that big data holds and the  consequences when that data is abused. Montana has shown how States are  best equipped to make licenses secure, without sacrificing the privacy  and rights of their citizens. The Repeal ID Act will allow us to strike  a balance that protects our national security, while also safeguarding  Montanans' civil liberties and personal privacy.   I want to thank Senators Paul and Tester for being original  cosponsors of this bill and I ask my other Senate colleagues to join us  in support of this legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 126         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Repeal ID Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REPEAL OF REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIFORM STATE DRIVER'S                     LICENSES AND STATE IDENTIFICATION CARDS.
