 Mr. Speaker, this is a very important and  timely resolution because, in recent years, the lack of sunlight and  transparency in financial transactions and corporate formation has  brought us to the forefront of the very dangerous role that dark money  plays in our financial system.   Money laundering; loopholes in markets like real estate, the arts,  and antiquities can be taken advantage of by criminals who facilitate  their nefarious deeds. And, Mr. Speaker, according to the Financial  Action Task Force, real estate alone accounted for one-third of all the  criminal assets confiscated worldwide between 2011 and 2013, in that 3- year period.   Even more concerning, Mr. Speaker, is this: some of these  transactions are conducted by anonymous shell companies who are  exploiting loopholes in our financial system, creating a lack of  transparency for who really is the beneficial owner of the assets.   This is very important, Mr. Speaker.   This critical resolution offered by my colleague and chairwoman, Ms.  Maxine Waters, recognizes how important this issue is not only to the  stability of our financial system but to the national security of our  great Nation.   It urges that much more be done with these loopholes and lets us  shine a bright light into the darkest corners of our financial system.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, I rise to encourage my colleagues to  support this resolution that will protect our financial system from  abuse and corruption. I am hopeful that it will be unanimous, with all  of our colleagues supporting this important resolution.
