 Mr. Speaker, for the purposes of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Larsen), the ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the veto message on H.J. Res. 27.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to once again rise in  support of H.J. Res. 27, which I introduced to negate an ill-timed and  ill-conceived rule coming out of the Biden administration.   I remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that since I last  spoke on the floor of this Chamber in support of H.J. Res. 27, the  resolution passed both the House and the Senate with bipartisan  support.   While the Clean Water Act has greatly improved the health of our  Nation's waters in the 50 years since it has become law, this  administration's rule defining a ``water of the United States,'' or  WOTUS, is just the latest in a string of examples of executive  overreach beyond the intent of the Clean Water Act.   Decades of agency interpretations and misinterpretations of WOTUS  have created a lot of uncertainty for rural communities, farmers,  businesses, and industries that rely on clean water, and this rule does  absolutely nothing to provide clarity.   In his message to the House regarding the veto of this legislation,  the President claims that H.J. Res. 27 ``would leave Americans without  a clear definition of `waters of the United States.'''                                time  1415    This is simply untrue and disingenuous, especially considering it was  his own administration that decided to get rid of the 2020 Navigable  Waters Protection Rule, which provided long-awaited clarity on the  scope of WOTUS, in favor of this new overreaching and unclear  definition.   This issue matters to everyday Americans all over the country, and I  hear about it all the time.   I am disappointed to see the President favor radical environmental  activists over America's families, small businesses, farmers, builders,  and property owners.   That being said, I am hopeful that the Members of the House and  Senate can come together to override this veto, terminating this  ambiguous and burdensome rule in favor of greater economic prosperity  for Americans nationwide.   Recently, two Federal courts halted enforcement of the  administration's rule, granting relief to farmers, homebuilders, and  landowners in 26 States.   Every Member today has the opportunity to vote to override the  President's veto and ensure all 50 States are relieved of the burdens  this rule has created.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to override  the President's veto of H.J. Res. 27, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), the chairman of the Highways  and Transit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), the cosponsor of the  resolution and the chairman of the Water Resources and Environment  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Duarte), who is somebody who personally  knows how disruptive this rule can be.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), who is the chairman of the  Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   Mr. Speaker, the administration's definition of ``waters of the  United States'' under the Clean Water Act is an onerous, burdensome,  and ambiguous rule that is going to create even more issues for  hardworking farmers, builders, small businesses, and property owners  throughout the Nation.  [[Page H1788]]    While the President claims that the rule is going to help advance  infrastructure projects, economic investment, and agricultural  activities in his veto message, this simply is not the case. Instead,  this costly, overreaching rule favors radical environmentalists at the  expense of infrastructure, agriculture, and economic growth and those  who depend on these activities.   Last month, Members from both parties in the House and Senate came  together to stand up for everyday Americans by rejecting this flawed  rule. Today, we have the opportunity to do so again.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to override the President's veto  and vote in support of H.J. Res. 27, and I yield back the balance of my  time.   The previous question was ordered.
