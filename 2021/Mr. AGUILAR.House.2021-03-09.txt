 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the Inland Empire  of Southern California, the region that my family has called home for  generations.   In my community and around this country people are hurting.   Businesses are struggling to keep their doors open. Families are  wondering where their kids' next meal is going to come from, and our  healthcare system is being pushed to the brink of failure.   Our communities are hurting, and they are wondering if people they  sent to Washington to represent them are going to do anything about it.  We need relief, and it can't come soon enough.   The American Rescue Plan represents real, tangible relief for our  communities.   This bill will bring more than $600 million into my community of San  Bernardino County to help protect first responders, teachers, and other  essential workers.   It will give small businesses the access to funding they need to stay  open and to put money in people's pockets to help them make ends meet.   It will help crush the virus by expanding vaccine distribution and  access.   And it will give our schools the resources they need to safely reopen  and put kids in the classroom.   This is a unique moment in American history, and this legislation  provides bold solutions that this moment calls for.                            ____________________
