 Madam Speaker, in the midst of these hard times, we are  especially grateful for the healthcare and frontline workers who have  bravely answered the call. Thankfully, we see glimmers of hope with the  discovery and distribution of multiple vaccines.   Yet, sadly, here in Congress, Democrats are using the pretense of  COVID relief to ignore bipartisan consensus and push a $2 trillion  liberal wish list of unrelated provisions. Let's not forget the most  recent targeted COVID relief bill was signed into law only 1 month ago,  and together with previously enacted stimulus laws, over $1 trillion  remain unspent.   Back home in Michigan, Governor Whitmer continues to go it alone,  imposing punitive and arbitrary restrictions that have harmed too many  small businesses and hardworking families.   It is time to work together to end this pandemic and help our  constituents get back on their feet. Let's get students back in the  classroom, vaccines distributed, and workers back on the job.                            ____________________
