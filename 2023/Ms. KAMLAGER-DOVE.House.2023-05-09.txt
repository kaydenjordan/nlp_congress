 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the  terrifying regularity of gun violence across this country.   The tragic shooting in Allen, Texas, is part of a near-daily pattern  of gun-related tragedies in America. This year alone, there have been  almost 200 mass shootings in our country, more mass shootings than we  have had days in the year.   I feel for the Allen, Texas, community and empathize with the pain  that too many American families understand. I also feel for the  survivors of gun violence that have to relive their own trauma every  time another shooting occurs and watch as Republicans fail to act. Over  4,800 lives have been lost at the hands of gun violence this year. It  is sickening because it is stone-cold preventable.   Every time a shooting rips apart a community, all we can offer are  thoughts and prayers with hollow solutions that only kick the can down  the road. No more thoughts. No more prayers. Action.   No, this is not God's divine order. This is Republicans too cowardly  to stand up and solve the damn problem. We have got to talk about guns.  We have got to talk about guns. We have got to talk about guns.  Unfettered access to guns, compounded with other challenges, is what  creates these horrific scenes of death and devastation.   Republicans must gather the courage to work with us and make our  streets safer instead of hiding behind antiquated interpretations of  the Second Amendment because the majority of Americans want gun reform  legislation because they want to live.   Democrats have come together to offer a ban on assault weapons that  Republicans have yet to bring to the floor or even consider. AR-15s  shred anything in their wake. They are not used by hunters. They were  designed to be used by snipers.   Last Congress, Democrats and Republicans passed the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act. This legislation supports red flag laws, enhances  background checks for those under 21, cracks down on gun trafficking,  disarms convicted domestic abusers, invests in violence prevention  violence and mental health initiatives, and funds school safety  programs. President Biden signed this valuable legislation into law,  but it is not enough to save the lives of our children. We can and  should be doing more.   The House Republican majority is playing games, wasting precious time  bringing legislation to the floor that has no chance of being signed  into law. If they cared about the life of every child, then they should  deal with the public health epidemic of gun violence because everyone's  child is worth a life.   We need an assault weapons ban, stronger background checks on gun  ownership, gun storage. It must be stated that instead of working on  these policies, some Republicans choose to inflame our gun violence  epidemic with toxic, racist, or bigoted rhetoric.                                time  2130    The Allen, Texas, shooter reportedly espoused white supremacist  ideology before his attack. The shooter had a fascination with mass  shootings and fascism. If you are amplifying hate, if you are  amplifying xenophobia, then you are complicit in these deaths.   Stop, for example, saying that white nationalists and white  supremacists need mental health services while making racist comments  about gun violence in Black and Brown communities or saying that those  neighborhoods are worse than war zones, as the former President has  repeatedly done, because everyone's child is worthy of life.   We must come to the table on gun violence to save our communities.
