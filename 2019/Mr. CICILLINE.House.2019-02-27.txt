 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Father Philip  Salois, who delivered today's opening prayer.   Father Phil is a native of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and now lives in  North Smithfield, Rhode Island, a community that I am proud to  represent today in Congress.   He served our country in uniform during the Vietnam war as a combat  infantryman and earned the Silver Star for his valor.   After his service to our country, Father Phil felt called to service  in another capacity. He was ordained into the priesthood on June 10,  1984.   A few years later, Father Phil joined the Veterans Administration in  Boston, where he served as chief of the chaplain service from 1993 to  2005.   Today, he continues to minister to veterans in Rhode Island and all  across America. We owe all of our servicemembers and their families an  incredible debt of gratitude.   The men and women of the United States Armed Forces represent our  country's most important values of service, honor, courage, and  sacrifice. This is especially true of Father Phil, who represents the  very best of our country and my home State of Rhode Island.   I thank him for his service to our country and for being here today  to offer the beautiful opening prayer. We are truly honored by his  presence.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, we have a gun violence epidemic in this  country. For 8 years, we have marked it with moments of silence and  doing nothing, saying nothing and doing nothing. But today, that  changes with passage of H.R. 8 for universal background checks.   We know universal background checks work, because since the passage  of the Brady bill, 3.5 million illegal gun sales were prevented. But,  of course, there is a huge loophole. Millions and millions of gun sales  happen without a background check at all. In fact, one in five, 22  percent, of guns are sold with no background check. That means  criminals, domestic abusers, and people prohibited due to mental  illness can get a gun. This bill changes that.   We also know that States that have enhanced background checks have  lower rates of gun homicides, gun suicide rates, and gun trafficking.   This is a commonsense bill to protect the American people from the  scourge of gun violence.   Finally, after 8 years of pleading with our Republican colleagues to  do something about gun violence in this country, to take up a bill--we  had a sit-in to try to force a vote--finally,  [[Page H2245]]  today, we are taking our first step to reduce gun violence in this  country by passing H.R. 8.   Finally, we will see Members of Congress standing up to the power of  the gun lobby and doing what is right for the American people.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We are on the precipice of passing the first commonsense gun safety  bill in this Congress in 25 years. I have been here for 8 years. We  begged and pleaded and had a sit-in to try to force Republicans to take  up some measure to reduce gun violence in this country.   There are women, men, and families all across America who are  demanding that Congress do something. We are about to do this, and you  raise a motion to recommit on a phony issue to try to muck this up with  this gimmick. If you were concerned about reducing gun violence in this  country and passing commonsense gun safety legislation, you had 8 years  to bring a bill to the floor.   But if you are really concerned about this, I have good news for you.  I have legislation, because, in fact, if someone buys a gun who is a  prohibited purchaser, whatever their immigration status is, if they  have committed a crime, then they should be arrested  [[Page H2262]]  and prosecuted. Every single Democrat believes that.   So I have a piece of legislation that says, if that happens, notify  the field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the local law  enforcement agency, and the State law enforcement agency, the agencies  responsible for enforcing the criminal law, so they can arrest and  prosecute that person.   I am looking for a Republican colead. I look forward to hearing from  you.   Madam Speaker, defeat this phony amendment and pass universal  background checks.
