 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, Democrats present a false choice: either support the  expansion of an already-failed, government-run healthcare scheme, or  let people go without healthcare. They want you to think that  Republicans and the Trump administration have no ideas about how to  expand coverage--not the case.   One of the first bills I introduced after joining last September was  the Increasing Health Coverage through HRAs Act. My legislation would  codify the Trump administration's rule allowing employers to fund  health reimbursement arrangements for their employees.   Thanks to President Trump, these HRAs can now be used to purchase  individual market coverage. That change is expected to lead to covering  800,000 more people, all without costly and counterproductive  government mandates.   The American people want more choices, lower costs, and increased  access to care, not a continued government takeover. I urge Members to  vote against H.R. 1425 and for Democrats to work with Republicans on  commonsense proposals like mine.
