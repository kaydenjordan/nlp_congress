 Mr. President, as I outlined yesterday, the Senate's  pending business on appropriations is tremendously important to  America's farmers, to our veterans, and to the future of our airports,  roads, bridges, and ports. My home State of Kentucky is certainly no  exception.   The Commonwealth is home to a host of important and overdue  infrastructure projects. As a transportation and logistics hub, my home  State boasts an impressive network of roads, ports, railroads, and  waterways that keep our economy and the American people literally on  the move. Overhauling this infrastructure strengthens the essential  link folks in Kentucky have to the rest of the Nation while making  those transit resources faster, more efficient, and more reliable for  everyone.   I am also proud of Kentucky's diverse agriculture industry, made up  of over 75,000 farms, an overwhelming majority of which are family- owned and family-operated. Kentucky's rural communities understand the  importance of efforts like expanding rural broadband deployment and  protecting livestock from diseases that can financially devastate small  family farms.   Certainly, our work in the coming days will also impact Kentucky's  Army installations and National Guard facilities. Investments in  military construction ensure our brave men and women in uniform have  access to the world-class training facilities they need to defend our  country. Maintaining Kentucky's premier fighting forces is critical to  deterring aggression from our adversaries and protecting American  strength.   So, as the Senate continues to make progress on regular order  appropriations, I am pleased to see Kentucky take center stage in  solving some of the real issues that face our people.                              National Security    Mr. President, America's defense industrial base is in the middle of  a historic transformation. This is something Republicans have been  working toward literally for years. It is good news for America's  national security. In fact, it is essential for our strategic  [[Page S4422]]  competition with communist China; and, today, I would like to talk a  bit more about what exactly is making this urgent progress possible.   Over the past year and a half, the lethal U.S. aid helping Ukraine  defend its sovereignty and degrade Russia's military has consisted, in  large part, of aging weapons stocks that were sitting in our own  arsenal--in many cases, literally collecting dust.   The security assistance money appropriated ``for Ukraine'' isn't just  buying weapons for Ukraine; it is also replenishing and modernizing  America's own arsenal, and the vast majority of it is going to American  defense manufacturers. This includes funding to expand production lines  of munitions needed by the U.S. military as well as vulnerable allies  in both Asia and Europe that want and need American weapons. That is  tens of billions of dollars directly supporting tens of thousands of  jobs in at least 38 States so far. Support for Ukraine is driving  historic investments in the communities that we all represent.   Take the 155-mm artillery round. Replenishing America's stockpile of  this critical munition has meant sending $3.6 million to producers in  Nevada, $48 million to Florida and Illinois, $65 million to Ohio, $141  million to Arizona, $174 million to Tennessee, $181 million to  Virginia, $355 million to Pennsylvania, and $519 million to Texas. That  is nearly $2 billion worth of direct investment in American industry,  American jobs, and American strength.   And, contrary to critics who say Ukraine is a distraction from China,  this investment isn't flowing in spite of our support for Ukraine but  actually because of it.   A West Virginia facility that supports 1,600 jobs has significantly  increased production of motors and warheads for guided multiple-launch  rocket systems, for which there is increased global demand; and a St.  Charles, MO, facility that employs 1,300 workers--so-called Ukraine  money--has funded a vastly expanded production line to build fresh  stocks of extended-range, JDAM precision-guided munitions.   These are actually transformational investments, and they wouldn't  have happened without the supplemental funding that we approved last  year. We are not just talking about buying new stocks but about  expanding production capacity to meet U.S. and allied demand. This is a  critical piece of our race to compete with China.   In fact, that same Missouri munitions production line is also set to  fulfill orders from some of America's closest allies and partners in  Asia. That is right. Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the Philippines  are arming themselves with American munitions to deter China.   And the same is true for other critical munitions. Thanks to Ukraine  funding, we are on a path to double the production of critical weapons  like Stingers and Javelins, along with innovative new weapons like the  ground-launched, small-diameter bomb, which will be produced in  Arkansas and New York. This expanded production capacity will benefit  America as well as partner militaries from European to Asia.   I will have more to say in the coming days about the historic  investments our allies are making here in the United States as a direct  result of American leadership, but, for now, I am tremendously proud of  our own work to invest in American industry, American workers, and  American strength.                                  Inflation    Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, I spoke yesterday about the  Biden administration's war on American energy and how working families  are feeling it at the gas pump, but energy prices are not the only  reason it has been so hard to balance household budgets on Washington  Democrats' watch.   Just this morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that  inflation increased by 0.6 percent this month, putting year-over-year  inflation at 3.7 percent. That is well above the Federal Reserve's 2- percent target, and it puts cumulative inflation since President Biden  took office at over 17 percent.   But as the American people continue to struggle against rising costs,  the President appears to be taking a victory tour, touting Bidenomics  as one of his crowning achievements. Over the Labor Day weekend,  President Biden told voters that Bidenomics ``is working.'' The  American people are not fooled by this. They can feel the pinch in  their wallets, and they know that Washington Democrats' runaway  spending is the reason for it.   As one woman told reporters recently, ``I don't think [President  Biden] has the everyday people's best interests in mind. . . .  Everything has gone up--electricity, groceries, fuel. . . . It's not  fair to the American people.''   Well, she is not alone. According to one recent survey, a large  majority of Americans disapproves of the President's handling of the  U.S. economy. Families are paying 20 percent more at the grocery store.  Credit card debt has surpassed $1 trillion for the first time ever, and  overall real wages are down 2.3 percent since 2021.   The numbers do not lie. Even Biden's Secretary of Commerce has said  that inflation is ``still a challenge'' and ``something that people  still see on a daily basis when they go to the grocery store or pay  their mortgage.''   Bidenomics may be working, but it is working against working  Americans.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
