 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of amendment No. 77.   Listen, the American people have been hit so hard by inflation and  the  [[Page H442]]  rising cost of goods. In its current form, the Strategic Production  Response Act deprives the Federal Government of one of the most  important tools in its toolbox to fight inflation and to lower gas  prices.   Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple. It would protect our ability to  fight inflation by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  and would create an exception clause to ensure that the Secretary of  Energy can draw down the reserve if a delay in drawdown would worsen  inflation.   Releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to  Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a critical strategy that helped lower  gas prices for American families. This bill, without my amendment,  could hurt working Americans struggling so hard with rising prices.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to protect  American families from rising gas prices and runaway inflation.   Lowering gas prices is not a political tactic; it is a question of  survival for many Americans.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
