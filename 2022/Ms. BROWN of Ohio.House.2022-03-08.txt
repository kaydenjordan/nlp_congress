 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago this Friday, amid the  darkest days of the pandemic, President Biden signed the American  Rescue Plan into law. It got shots in arms and money in pockets. It  helped families keep roofs over their heads and food on their tables.  It helped schools reopen safely and kept small businesses afloat.   The American Rescue Plan laid the foundation for last year's  unprecedented growth. More than 7 million jobs were created, the  economy grew at the fastest rate in four decades and a record 5.4  million small businesses were started.   We still have work to do to lower costs for families, but we are  stronger this year than we were last year thanks to the American Rescue  Plan, and we will be stronger next year than we are this year thanks to  the bipartisan infrastructure law.   Equitable growth, more jobs, better infrastructure, that is what I  call building a better America.                            ____________________
