 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is time for the Senate and the U.S.  Department of Education to get serious about the student loan crisis in  America.   This is a crisis in Illinois. It is a crisis in Iowa, in Nevada. You  pick the State. Student loan debt is now a larger debt in the United  States than credit card debt. Add up all of the debt that Americans owe  on credit cards, and it will not reach the amount of student loan debt  that is carried by students and their families.   More than 44 million Americans have student loan debt. The total  amount is $1.5 trillion. As I mentioned, it is larger than America's  cumulative credit card debt--second only to the mortgages that we owe  on our homes across the United States.   An American who graduated from college in 2015, with a 4-year degree,  owed an average of $30,100. That debt is often much higher for many  Americans if they decide to go on to graduate school or if they are  unfortunate attendees at the for-profit colleges and universities.  Across the United States, there are many of these for-profit  institutions. You should remember them. It is 9 percent of young people  who come out of high school who end up at for-profit colleges and  universities, while 33 percent of all of the college students who  default on student loans come out of the same schools--for-profit  colleges. This is 9 percent and 33 percent. Why?   It is that they are so darned expensive--dramatically more expensive  than are community colleges or other universities. No. 2, they don't  care if you finish. They would just as soon you didn't. No. 3, if you  finish, you get a worthless diploma and can't find a job. So there you  are, stuck with your debt.   Yet this is about student loans in general, not just about for-profit  victims.   I hear from students, young and old, who have had to forgo  homeownership and hold off starting families because of their massive  student loan debts. Increasingly, I have been hearing from parents and  grandparents who, in gestures of goodwill and kindness, cosign on the  loans on behalf of those children or grandchildren who are  students. Guess what. Grandma and Mom are now trying to pay off that  student loan debt because the student can't.    Earlier this year, Chairman Jerome Powell of the Federal Reserve said  the student debt crisis absolutely could hold back economic growth in  America--the student loan crisis. We need to take action on it. We  rarely even try, but today I am going to try.   Earlier this year, in March, I tried to offer an amendment on the  Senate floor to help student borrowers. At that time, the Senate had a  bill up to provide regulatory relief--breaks--to banks. I thought it  was only fair that the Senate also consider taking a look at the  student debt crisis. I was blocked from getting a vote on my amendment.  I am not giving up.   I am filing an amendment today to the Financial Services and General  Government bill that is part of this appropriations package pending on  the floor of the Senate. My amendment deals with an important part of  the student loan problem--the treatment of student loans in bankruptcy.   If you borrow money for a vacation house, lose your job, and have no  money, you file bankruptcy, and your mortgage is discharged. If you  borrow money for a car, and you can't pay off the car--you lose your  job--you file for bankruptcy, and your auto loan is discharged. How  about a boat? If you take out a loan to buy a boat and file for  bankruptcy, it is discharged.   I will tell you that there are only a handful of things you can  borrow money for that you cannot discharge in bankruptcy no matter how  bad things get, and one of them is student loans. Currently, most types  of debts can be discharged in bankruptcy but not student loans.   Up until 1976, all student loans were fully discharged in bankruptcy,  but since then, the law has been changed. Now if you have student debt,  you are going to carry it to the grave. You cannot discharge it in  bankruptcy.   In 1998, Congress determined that Federal student loans would be  nondischargeable in bankruptcy unless the borrower could demonstrate  that he or she faced an ``undue hardship''--that is a quote, ``undue  hardship.'' But we didn't define it; we left it up to the courts. That  is a problem.   Most students don't even try to pursue the undue hardship exception  because of the difficulty and expense of meeting the standard of  proving undue hardship in bankruptcy court.   Listen to what the Wall Street Journal said last month. It found that  in 2017, only 473 student loan borrowers in the United States out of 44  million asked for relief from their student debt in bankruptcy--473 out  of 44 million. The Journal found only 16 bankruptcy cases that year  where a judge actually ruled on student loan debt--16 cases out of 44  million borrowers--and in only 3 of those cases did the judge cancel  the debt. What do you think your odds are in taking your student loan  debt to bankruptcy court when 3 out of 473--out of 44 million--actually  had their debt discharged?   A big reason the undue hardship path is difficult for student  borrowers is because the Department of Education contracts out the  collection of the debt to companies like Educational Credit Management  Corporation. This is a student loan guaranty agency that collects on  defaulted Federal student loans. This company is notorious for  aggressively challenging and appealing borrower claims of undue  hardship in bankruptcy court because it doesn't want to see the loans  discharged. So many students don't even try to fight them because they  know they are going to lose.   Here is what my amendment does. My amendment would bar the use of  Federal funds to pay contractors, such as the one I named, to contest  undue hardship claims in bankruptcy court when the claims are brought  by specific categories of borrowers who face severe undue hardship.   Let me tell you the categories I am trying to protect. These are  people who are deeply in debt with student loans and are coming to  court asking for relief from their student loans. You tell me whether  you think these Americans deserve a break when they go to bankruptcy  court on their student loans. The first category is veterans who have  [[Page S5328]]  been deemed unemployable because of a service-connected disability; No.  2, family caregivers of a veteran or an elderly or disabled family  member; No. 3, people who are receiving Social Security disability or  whose only income is Social Security; and No. 4, borrowers who have  finished school but have spent at least 5 years with an income of less  than $24,000 a year. Those are the four categories.   Wouldn't you agree that you would start with groups just like these  and say: Give them a break. This disabled veteran has reached a point  where he can't pay back this loan. Don't have these agencies hounding  this poor fellow for the rest of his life.   By stopping these Federal loan guaranty agencies from contesting and  litigating these undue hardship claims in bankruptcy court, we can at  least give these hard-hit student borrowers a chance to seek an undue  hardship discharge in bankruptcy.   My amendment also includes a provision preventing Federal funds from  being provided to a for-profit college if the college receives more  than 85 percent of its revenue from Federal sources, including the  Department of Veterans Affairs GI bill and Department of Defense  tuition assistance funds.   Currently, for-profit colleges are able to receive 90 percent of  their revenue from Federal sources--the most heavily subsidized,  private, for-profit companies in America. They can add the GI bill in  on top of it, to add insult to injury. It makes no sense. It  incentivizes for-profit colleges to aggressively recruit veterans and  servicemembers in order to get extra money from the Federal Government  and provide very little in return.   Not only would this provision help protect students, it would result  in long-term cost savings to the Federal Government.   I say to my colleagues, I bet you have all given a speech on student  loans. Haven't we all? When young people come in, burdened with debt,  and say ``I don't know what to do with myself. I can't pay off this  debt. I can't even buy a car. I am living in my parents' basement. I  thought I was supposed to be a college graduate with a big life ahead  of me. What are you going to do about it, Senator?'' if you say ``Well,  I wish there were something we could do,'' you will get your chance  today. There is something you can do. It is the amendment I am  offering.   This issue of student loan debt is challenging. Let's not run away  from it. Let's face it honestly. Let's give at least these four groups,  including disabled veterans and the caregivers who watch them, an  opportunity to get their student loans discharged so they can get on  with their lives.   I am going to keep at this and keep raising this issue until we get  the positive change the students and their families deserve.   I yield.    Madam President, I would like to ask the Senator from  Hawaii a question through the Chair.   When the Senator is referring to the number of children who are  currently forcibly separated from their parents by our government, is  the Senator referring to the 2,551 children between the ages of 5 and  17 who were reported  [[Page S5329]]  by this administration as of this past Monday?    Is the Senator referring to the fact that 1,634 families  are possibly eligible for reunification, according to this  administration?    And that leaves 917 families with children forcibly  separated by our government from their parents, who, according to this  administration, may not be eligible for reunification?    We are also told there are some 463 parents who are ``not  in the United States''--children taken away from them, and they have  been sent out of the United States?    Incidentally, the administration reported 37 children in  its custody who have not been matched with a parent?    And we are being asked to reduce the standards of care  for these children by this unanimous consent request?    I thank the Senator from Hawaii.    I object.    Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request.    Madam President, I am making clear to my friend from  North Carolina, as well as to the other Members on the floor, that I  would like to have this colloquy. I would like to make a formal  unanimous consent request, and then we can enter into debate or  colloquy, as the Chair would allow, if I may proceed.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 3263 introduced earlier today; that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.   This is a bill which embodies the Keep Families Together legislation  by Senator Feinstein, A Fair Day in Court for Kids Act by Senator  Hirono, and additional measures which I will then describe later when  we go to colloquy and debate.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would  like there to be some exchange, something even perilously close to a  debate on the issue. I would be happy if the Senator would reframe his  unanimous consent request for that purpose, and I would be happy to  agree to it under those circumstances.    I object to the original unanimous consent request.    Madam President, let me try to give this some  perspective. Let me start with something I hope we all agree on. There  are three things about immigration that Democrats and Republicans can  agree on. Let's see if we can say those three things and all agree.   We need border security in the United States. We cannot have open  borders; we need border security.   No. 2, if someone coming into America is dangerous, we don't want  them here, and if there is someone undocumented in America who is  dangerous, we want them to leave. Those two things I think both parties  can agree on.   The third thing really gets to the heart of it. We need comprehensive  immigration reform. It is not a matter of solving the issue of the day;  it is a matter of looking at all of our immigration laws and making  them work.   The Senator from North Carolina has probably heard what I have heard  from our friends in agriculture. Whether it is ranching or dairy or  picking fruit, they need migrant labor. Americans are many not stepping  up to take that backbreaking work, and they need help. That is one  example.   We need comprehensive immigration reform. Let's take a look at the  whole package.   I spent 6 months with Senators John McCain, Chuck Schumer--four  Democrats, four Republicans. We wrote a comprehensive immigration  reform bill. From start to finish, it was a bipartisan bill. It passed  on the floor of the Senate with 68 votes 5 years ago, and the  Republicans refused to consider it in the House of Representatives.   We still need comprehensive immigration reform. We ought to be  working on that together. We ought to take that bill, reintroduce that  bill, and make that our starting point.   The last point I want to make is about the current issue we face.  Let's put this issue into perspective. First, I am sorry, but I  disagree with my friend from North Carolina and the Senator from Texas,  who say that this is our job to fix or, as the Senator from Texas said,  we created this problem in Congress. That is not true.   The zero-tolerance policy that has led us to this moment of debate  was created by President Trump, Attorney General Sessions, Stephen  Miller, and others. It went into effect in April. We decided then, as  official policy stated by the United States, that we would physically,  forcibly separate children from their parents.   We argued that they are all criminals if they show up at the border.  That is not the case. Some people legitimately come to our borders  seeking asylum status. They are not criminals, per se, and to treat  them as such and take their kids away is unwarranted. But that was our  policy.   So 3,000 children were forcibly removed from their parents starting  in April, and what happened next? These children were sent off into the  system. The parents were sometimes held, sometimes tried, sometimes  deported, and there was a furor that rose across the United States.  People said: What are we doing? Why did we take that nursing child away  from the mother? Why did we take that little toddler away from his  father? What are we doing here? What is our goal?   The opposition from both political parties--Republicans and  Democrats--got so intense that this President did something he almost  never does. He reversed his position. He said: We are not doing the  family separation policy anymore. That is the end of it.   But it wasn't soon enough. There were 3,000 kids at that point  separated from their parents and spread across the United States. There  was one I knew of in Chicago. A woman from the Congo was being held in  California. Her 6-year-old daughter had been sent to Chicago. That is  how I learned about the case. There are cases like that all over the  United States.   Then a Federal judge stepped in. We are here today because that  Federal judge said: Enough--we want these parents reunited with their  kids now.    He set some deadlines. Four weeks ago, he said: All kids under the  age of 5 need to be reunited with the parents they were taken away  from. He set that goal with a deadline of 2 weeks ago. Our government  identified only 103 out of the 3,000 who were under the age of 5, and  they reunited fewer than 60 of them. As for the rest of them, it is  uncertain what is going to happen to those kids under the age of 5 who  were separated from their parents.   Now there is a vast number beyond that; 2,500-plus kids are out  there, and this judge from San Diego stated that as of tomorrow, July  26, all of those kids are to be reunited with their parents too.   Guess what. We are in a position where that is not going to happen.  It physically can't happen. Our government can't do it. Here is the  heartbreaking secret that we now know: Our government separated these  children from their parents without any means of reuniting them,  without keeping information about where the parents were going to be,  where the children are going to be when the day would come that the  mother would get her baby back in her arms. We have no process for  that. That, to me, is inexcusable and disgraceful.   If you order a package on Amazon this afternoon, they give you a  tracking number. Tomorrow, if you want to know where it is, you go to  Amazon, put in the tracking number, and you will know where your  package is.   We sent infants, toddlers, and young kids all across the United  States without a tracking number, and now we are trying desperately to  reunite them. As I mentioned earlier to Senator Hirono, there are 37  kids out there about whom this government has admitted: We don't know  where the parents are. We can't put this back together again. What are  we going to do with these kids?   That is why we are on the floor to talk about this current crisis. It  wasn't a crisis created by Congress. It was created by the Trump  administration with  [[Page S5332]]  a zero tolerance policy. Attorney General Sessions and others were so  proud of it, as they took the kids away from the parents, and they  didn't keep records. They tossed these infants, toddlers, and children  out into the bureaucratic sea and said: Start swimming or sink.   I met some of these kids in Chicago. There were 10 of them. Kids will  be kids. They looked like regular kids sitting around the table. Two  little girls came in, and I thought at first they were twins because  their hair was identical and they were about the same size. When I  looked more closely, I saw that they weren't.   We asked in Spanish: Are you sisters? The little girl said: No,  amigas. No, we are friends. These two little girls had attached  themselves to one another. One was from Honduras and one was from  Chiapas, Mexico. They were holding on for dear life to one another's  hand as they walked around this place because that was their  connection; that was all they had to hang on to. They were taken away  from their parents. I don't know what happened to those two little  girls.   As a grandfather of 6-year-old twins, I looked at those little girls  and thought, I know kids just like them, and I love them to pieces. I  can't imagine being physically, forcibly separated away from those kids  by any government. That is what we have done.   So I say to the Senator from North Carolina, let's find some things  we can agree on. Let me suggest some things. Let's increase the number  of immigration judges. Let's do it on a merit basis so that we can get  professional people who know what they are doing--not political  appointments.   Secondly, let's say that every child who appears in an administrative  hearing is going to have an attorney next to them. It is embarrassing  to me as an American to think of a 6-year-old, 10-year-old, or 12-year- old standing before an administrative judge with an interpreter, trying  to figure out what is about to happen to them. We are better than that  in America. We ought to make sure we are going to do much better than  that in America.   Beyond that, we have to talk about what we do that is humane--that  follows the Flores decision. Just wiping it away--there are no  standards for humane treatment for those kids. We have to have  standards. We have to make sure that they will be placed in areas we  can be proud of, that they will be treated fairly, humanely, in the  right way, which I am sure you want and I want too.   Those are things we can work on. Several weeks ago, we met and sent a  list of questions to the administration to start our bipartisan  conversation. They never got back to us. I think it has been a month  now. I think it is time.   If you want to rekindle this bipartisan conversation, count me in,  but let's do it with the information, and let's try to do it with a  common purpose.   The last point I will make is this. If you want to make sure that  somebody shows up at a hearing, 95 percent of those who are supposed to  show up for these hearings do show up if you do one of three things. If  you provide them with an attorney who gives them advice, they will come  back for the hearing. If you provide them with counseling services--for  example, programs that have been run by the Lutheran family services or  the Catholic family services--they will show up for the hearing. Or if  you provide, in some cases, an ankle monitor, they will come back for a  hearing. So it isn't a question of whether they are going to be lost in  the system. We know this works. Let's make use of it. It is a heck of a  lot more humane than separating families by thousands of miles.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the joint resolution be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was  ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3263         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti and Armenia       Reforestation Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) the established policy of the Federal Government is to       support and seek the protection of forests around the world,       which provide a wide range of benefits by--        (A) harboring a major portion of the biological and       terrestrial resources of Earth;        (B) providing habitats for almost \2/3\ of all species on       Earth, including species essential to medical research and       agricultural productivity;        (C) contributing to the livelihood of more than       1,600,000,000 people through access to food, fresh water,       clothing, traditional medicines, and shelter;        (D) ensuring environmental services, such as biodiversity,       water conservation, soil enrichment, water supply management,       and climate regulation; and  [[Page S5370]]         (E) absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, as deforestation       accounts for approximately 12 percent of the global       anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to       global warming;        (2) while forests cover a little less than \1/3\ of the       land area on Earth, approximately 85 percent of Earth's       original primary forests have been destroyed, degraded, or       fragmented;        (3) in Haiti--        (A) the destruction of forests began centuries ago, when       17th century colonists cut down trees for lumber, fuel, and       furniture;        (B) the 18th century plantation economy resulted in       hillsides near towns being stripped of trees;        (C) after gaining independence, deforestation continued as       Haiti rebuilt its local economy by growing coffee and       exporting timber;        (D) in 1923, more than 60 percent of the land was forested,       but by the 1940s and 1950s deforestation was accelerating as       an increasing population put more pressure on forests;        (E) in recent years, urbanization has expanded       exponentially and growing cities have depended on charcoal       produced by cutting down trees in the countryside;        (F) poor forestry and land use policies by the Government       of Haiti has exacerbated deforestation, and by 2014, forest       cover had decreased to approximately 9 to 11 percent of the       country; and        (G) between 2000 and 2016, 5,430 hectares of forest cover       were lost, equal to 6.3 percent of Haiti's tree cover;        (4) in Armenia--        (A) while archeological data indicated that approximately       35 percent of the country was originally forested--        (i) less than 12 percent of the country was covered in       forest in 1990; and        (ii) less than 6 percent of the country was covered in       forest by 2016; and        (B) in August, 2017, a fire caused significant damage to       the Khosrov Forest, which is among the world's oldest       protected areas, engulfing more than 2,733 hectares in flames       and causing substantial harm to hundreds of unique plant       species;        (5) economic pressures, resulting from more than 60 percent       of the population of Haiti living below the poverty line and       29.8 percent of the population of Armenia living below the       poverty line--        (A) are factors contributing to the deforestation of Haiti       and Armenia; and        (B) are manifested particularly through the cutting of       areas of forest for conversion to agricultural and commercial       uses, where wood and charcoal produced from cutting down       trees accounts for a major supply toward Haiti's and       Armenia's energy sectors;        (6) forests provide cover to soften the effect of heavy       rains and reduce erosion by anchoring the soil with tree       roots;        (7) a significant effect of the deforestation in Haiti and       Armenia is soil erosion, which has--        (A) lowered the productivity on the land due to the       leaching of nutrients in topsoils;        (B) worsened the severity of droughts and the effects of       landslides and floods;        (C) led to further deforestation due to slash and burn       practices when eroded areas are no longer productive;        (D) increased the pressure on the remaining land and trees       in Haiti and Armenia; and        (E) significantly decreased water quality and the quantity       of freshwater and clean drinking water available to       populations;        (8) research strongly suggests that deforestation increases       the risk of infectious diseases, including malaria, dengue       fever, SARS, Ebola, Hantavirus, and Zika--        (A) by depriving insect and animal carriers of habitat; and        (B) by directly increasing their rate of exposure to human       populations who are susceptible to zoonotic pathogens;        (9) both Haiti and Armenia have faced natural disasters in       recent years, the effects of which have been exacerbated by       deforestation, such as--        (A) flooding in Armenia that has swept away or damaged       thousands of homes, schools, health clinics, and other       institutions, partly because of damage to forests through       illegal logging, landslides, and soil erosion;        (B) hurricanes in Haiti that have killed thousands and       displaced hundreds of thousands more, partly because the       clearing of large hillsides enabled rainwater to run off       directly into settlements located at the bottom of slopes,       causing severe flooding; and        (C) the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which destroyed       much of the infrastructure of Port-au-Prince, reduced       hillside stability and increased the likelihood of mudslides,       soil erosion, and flooding factors, which negatively impacted       the water supply and heightened concerns for the spread of       waterborne diseases;        (10) economic benefits for local communities from       sustainable uses of forests are critical for the long-term       sustainable management of forests in Haiti and Armenia;        (11) Congress appropriated funding for fiscal years 2015,       2017, and 2018 to support market-based reforestation programs       in Haiti, which have resulted in successful agroforestry       activities that have increased crop production, profits, and       tree cover;

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti and Armenia       Reforestation Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) the established policy of the Federal Government is to       support and seek the protection of forests around the world,       which provide a wide range of benefits by--        (A) harboring a major portion of the biological and       terrestrial resources of Earth;        (B) providing habitats for almost \2/3\ of all species on       Earth, including species essential to medical research and       agricultural productivity;        (C) contributing to the livelihood of more than       1,600,000,000 people through access to food, fresh water,       clothing, traditional medicines, and shelter;        (D) ensuring environmental services, such as biodiversity,       water conservation, soil enrichment, water supply management,       and climate regulation; and  [[Page S5370]]         (E) absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, as deforestation       accounts for approximately 12 percent of the global       anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to       global warming;        (2) while forests cover a little less than \1/3\ of the       land area on Earth, approximately 85 percent of Earth's       original primary forests have been destroyed, degraded, or       fragmented;        (3) in Haiti--        (A) the destruction of forests began centuries ago, when       17th century colonists cut down trees for lumber, fuel, and       furniture;        (B) the 18th century plantation economy resulted in       hillsides near towns being stripped of trees;        (C) after gaining independence, deforestation continued as       Haiti rebuilt its local economy by growing coffee and       exporting timber;        (D) in 1923, more than 60 percent of the land was forested,       but by the 1940s and 1950s deforestation was accelerating as       an increasing population put more pressure on forests;        (E) in recent years, urbanization has expanded       exponentially and growing cities have depended on charcoal       produced by cutting down trees in the countryside;        (F) poor forestry and land use policies by the Government       of Haiti has exacerbated deforestation, and by 2014, forest       cover had decreased to approximately 9 to 11 percent of the       country; and        (G) between 2000 and 2016, 5,430 hectares of forest cover       were lost, equal to 6.3 percent of Haiti's tree cover;        (4) in Armenia--        (A) while archeological data indicated that approximately       35 percent of the country was originally forested--        (i) less than 12 percent of the country was covered in       forest in 1990; and        (ii) less than 6 percent of the country was covered in       forest by 2016; and        (B) in August, 2017, a fire caused significant damage to       the Khosrov Forest, which is among the world's oldest       protected areas, engulfing more than 2,733 hectares in flames       and causing substantial harm to hundreds of unique plant       species;        (5) economic pressures, resulting from more than 60 percent       of the population of Haiti living below the poverty line and       29.8 percent of the population of Armenia living below the       poverty line--        (A) are factors contributing to the deforestation of Haiti       and Armenia; and        (B) are manifested particularly through the cutting of       areas of forest for conversion to agricultural and commercial       uses, where wood and charcoal produced from cutting down       trees accounts for a major supply toward Haiti's and       Armenia's energy sectors;        (6) forests provide cover to soften the effect of heavy       rains and reduce erosion by anchoring the soil with tree       roots;        (7) a significant effect of the deforestation in Haiti and       Armenia is soil erosion, which has--        (A) lowered the productivity on the land due to the       leaching of nutrients in topsoils;        (B) worsened the severity of droughts and the effects of       landslides and floods;        (C) led to further deforestation due to slash and burn       practices when eroded areas are no longer productive;        (D) increased the pressure on the remaining land and trees       in Haiti and Armenia; and        (E) significantly decreased water quality and the quantity       of freshwater and clean drinking water available to       populations;        (8) research strongly suggests that deforestation increases       the risk of infectious diseases, including malaria, dengue       fever, SARS, Ebola, Hantavirus, and Zika--        (A) by depriving insect and animal carriers of habitat; and        (B) by directly increasing their rate of exposure to human       populations who are susceptible to zoonotic pathogens;        (9) both Haiti and Armenia have faced natural disasters in       recent years, the effects of which have been exacerbated by       deforestation, such as--        (A) flooding in Armenia that has swept away or damaged       thousands of homes, schools, health clinics, and other       institutions, partly because of damage to forests through       illegal logging, landslides, and soil erosion;        (B) hurricanes in Haiti that have killed thousands and       displaced hundreds of thousands more, partly because the       clearing of large hillsides enabled rainwater to run off       directly into settlements located at the bottom of slopes,       causing severe flooding; and        (C) the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which destroyed       much of the infrastructure of Port-au-Prince, reduced       hillside stability and increased the likelihood of mudslides,       soil erosion, and flooding factors, which negatively impacted       the water supply and heightened concerns for the spread of       waterborne diseases;        (10) economic benefits for local communities from       sustainable uses of forests are critical for the long-term       sustainable management of forests in Haiti and Armenia;        (11) Congress appropriated funding for fiscal years 2015,       2017, and 2018 to support market-based reforestation programs       in Haiti, which have resulted in successful agroforestry       activities that have increased crop production, profits, and       tree cover; and        (12) reforestation efforts would provide new sources of       jobs, income, and investments in Haiti and Armenia by--        (A) providing employment opportunities in tree seedling       programs, contract tree planting and management, sustainable       agricultural initiatives, sustainable and managed timber       harvesting, and wood products milling and finishing services;       and        (B) enhancing community enterprises that generate income       through the trading of sustainable forest resources, many of       which exist on small scales.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide       assistance to the Government of Haiti and the Government of       Armenia to develop and implement, or improve, nationally       appropriate policies and actions--        (1) to reduce deforestation and forest degradation, and       improve forest management and natural regeneration;        (2) to increase annual rates of afforestation and       reforestation in a sustainable, measurable, reportable, and       verifiable manner;        (3) to restore social and economic conditions for the       environmental recovery of the forest cover of Haiti and       Armenia to at least 7 percent of total land mass in Haiti and       12 percent of total land mass in Armenia (as determined under       section 302(a)) not later than 10 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act; and        (4) to improve sustainable resource management at the       watershed level.
