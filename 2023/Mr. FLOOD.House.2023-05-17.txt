 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our beef producers,  feeders, and processors as we celebrate Beef Month in Nebraska.   Nebraska is the Beef State. We are the top processing State, number  one for cattle on feed, and the biggest State for beef exports to the  European Union, South Korea, Kuwait, and Colombia.   Nebraska has more than three times the number of cows than people.  From the Lone Creek Cattle Company in Lincoln to Oak Barn Beef in West  Point, we raise the best beef in the world right in the First District  of Nebraska.   It is all because of our abundant natural resources, great cattle  genetics, and a rich heritage that has been passed on for generations.   As we celebrate Beef Month, I give a sincere thank-you to all the  producers, feeders, and processors who raise and make the best beef in  the world on our ranches and in our feed yards for consumers around the  globe.                            ____________________
