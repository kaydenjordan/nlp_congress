 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 329 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 329         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 9) to direct the President to develop a plan       for the United States to meet its nationally determined       contribution under the Paris Agreement, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed 90 minutes, with 60 minutes equally divided       and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of       the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 30 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. No       amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 329. It provides for the  consideration of H.R. 9 under a structured rule that makes 30  amendments in order.   It also provides for 90 minutes of general debate, with the chair and  the ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs  controlling 60 minutes, and the chair and ranking minority member of  the Committee on Energy and Commerce controlling 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the measure we are considering today makes clear that  under this Democratic majority science is once again respected here in  the House of Representatives, that facts matter, and that the word of  the fossil fuel lobby is not going to rule the day, because there is no  debate on our side about something as basic as climate change.   The evidence is overwhelming. It is happening, Mr. Speaker, and human  beings are playing a defining role.   Now, you don't have to take my word for it. You can ask virtually any  scientist working in the field today, because 97 percent of all climate  scientists agree that it is happening--97 percent.   There is a United Nations body charged with looking at the science  here called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.   Do you know what it has found? That the evidence is unequivocal.   The facts are as clear as day.   But you don't even need to read the report to know that something is  happening here. Just look out your window. Once-in-a-generation  hurricanes are becoming commonplace; record-breaking storms are  becoming the norm; and drastic temperature swings are now just the way  it is.   My district is home to more than 1,800 farms, and I visit with  farmers often. Climate change isn't just an issue on their minds; it is  sometimes the top issue on their minds when they are asked about the  challenges that they face.   These farmers have told me about how heat waves disrupt what was once  a reliable growing season and how unexpected frosts have completely  wiped out their crops. Rainfall that once ran like clockwork has given  way to droughts that could wipe out their entire profits.   They don't question what is going on. They are not debating the  science of whether climate change is real. They know. They know.                                time  1230    They can see it, seemingly every day as it impacts their livelihoods.  I wish the Republicans took climate change as seriously. But instead of  treating it as a threat, they treat it as a punch line.   A Republican Senator once brought a snowball onto the Senate floor,  trying to prove that climate change isn't real because it still snows  sometimes. You can't make this stuff up.   Just the other day, President Trump mocked clean energy by suggesting  that windmills cause cancer. Are you kidding me? That is the President  of the United States.   I won't pretend to know what goes on in the President's head, but I  know this: His announcement in June 2017 that he would be pulling the  United States out of the Paris climate agreement was indefensible.   This agreement set an ambitious goal of keeping warming below 2  degrees Celsius and established binding commitments for countries to  meet to reduce emissions. It recognized climate change is a global  problem that requires a global solution.   If the President gets his way and actually withdraws the United  States, we would stand alone as one of the only nations in the world  not to be part of it. Even Syria, a nation embroiled in war, announced  that it would sign on.   Thankfully, we are not out of it yet, but we could be starting as  early as 2020.   H.R. 9 would ensure the President wouldn't get his way by requiring  him to develop a plan to meet our commitments under the Paris  Agreement.   It is called the Climate Action Now Act because we can't wait, Mr.  Speaker. Climate change isn't some far-off threat. It is not a problem  for our great-grandchildren or even our grandchildren to solve. It is  our problem. It is here today, impacting our Nation and our future.   It is not just about the weather. Climate change also negatively  impacts public health and our national security. Experts have even  developed a new term to describe those displaced by its destructive  impacts, ``American climate refugees.''   This is not the time for handwringing or indecisiveness and not the  time to let the fossil fuel industry that funds some campaigns outweigh  the facts. It is certainly not the time for more stunts or snowballs on  the floor.   This is the time to act boldly, to listen to what the scientists are  telling us, and to protect our planet for future generations. That is  what H.R. 9 is all about.  [[Page H3352]]    I ask my colleagues to let the facts rule the day once again in the  people's House of Representatives. Let's support this rule and the  underlying legislation and send an undeniable message that, under this  majority, we value science and recognize the urgent need to act on  climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before I yield to the gentleman from Texas, let me make a couple of  points.   First of all, just so the Record is clear, under President Trump's  policies, which are now taking effect and are now reversing some of the  advances that we made under previous administrations, basically, these  policies have consequences. In 2018, our emissions rose by 3.4 percent.  We are going in the wrong direction.   When the gentlewoman talks about all these other alternative energy  sources that are clean and green that my Republican friends support,  she neglects to point out that this President hasn't seen a fossil fuel  that he hasn't wanted to embrace. In fact, he wants to go back and  invest more in coal, which is hard to believe, given all the scientific  evidence that exists about the dangers of coal for our atmosphere.   There is no question where this President is coming from. He doesn't  believe in climate change, and that is what is so shocking, that the  whole world, the scientific community all over the world, has warned us  time and time again that this is a real problem, and we have a  President who doesn't believe it. It is stunning. It is stunning, but  that is what we are dealing with.   Basically, this is an attempt to try to get us back on the right  track, to take this problem, which is already having significant  negative consequences in our country, and do something about it.   It is time to come together and tell the President, who doesn't  believe in science, that science is real, that it is something we ought  to take seriously, and that we ought to do something about it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the words from our distinguished minority  whip, but I would point out that the cost of climate inaction will far  outweigh the cost associated with acting now.   According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, by 2090, lost  wages will reach $155 billion, mortality from extreme temperatures will  surpass $140 billion, and coastal property damage will approach $120  billion. All told, the U.S. economy could lose more than 10 percent of  its GDP under the worst-case scenario.   So people can deny that this is a problem all they want, but they do  so at great economic risk for our country and for other economies  around the world.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. DelBene).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me just say to my ranking member, whom I have  great respect for, that I think we always need to figure out a way to  do better and to be more accommodating, and I will continue to work  with him to try to do that. But I will point out for the record that  the committee has made in order 30 amendments, a total of 31 pages of  amendments on a 6-page bill.   I think we have a long way to go to achieve the record of closed  rules that the previous Congress had, well over 100 closed rules. That  broke, I think, every closed rule record in history. We certainly don't  want to get there, but we need to continue to figure out ways we can be  more accommodating, and he has my word that I will do that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine  (Ms. Pingree).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, oh my God, just listening to the gentleman from  Washington State give his remarks. He was on the Rules Committee when  the Republicans were in charge last time and voted for a record number  of 103 closed rules. That meant that not a single amendment, Republican  or Democrat, could be made in order. Never once, never once, did I hear  him express reservation about the historic closed process that the  Republicans embraced.   And as far as his amendment goes, as the gentleman knows, the Paris  climate agreement operates under the theory that parties should be able  to satisfy their compliance plans any way they choose. There are  neither preferred nor prohibited ways to reduce emissions.   Since the Paris Agreement is fuel and technology neutral, we think  this bill should be too. But I just find it hard to sit here and to  listen with any level of seriousness to the gentleman's complaints.  When he was on the Rules Committee, they broke every record in the  history of Congress being the most closed Congress in the history of  our country. Can we do better? Yes, we can, and we should do better.   But I will remind the gentleman, again, that there were 30 pages of  amendments made in order on a 6-page bill, a bill, by the way, that the  gentlewoman, Mrs. Lesko, said is not a serious bill anyway. So, I am  not quite sure what the messaging is here: that it is not serious or  that it is serious enough where we need to have more amendments. I  can't quite figure their logic out here.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me just remind my colleagues that the impact on  our economy is astronomical if we do nothing. We are already seeing the  negative impacts on our economy because of climate change. It is hard  to believe that we are having a debate on the floor of the House of  Representatives where people are denying that climate change is a real  threat or that our constituents somehow don't care about this issue,  which they do.   And just one other thing. I want to make sure that the Record is  clear on process. This bill went through two committee hearings-- Foreign Affairs and Energy and Commerce--and two markups before it went  to the Rules Committee where we granted a structured rule and we are  having a debate here on the floor. That is called regular order. I know  some of my Republican friends don't know what regular order is, because  when they were in charge bills routinely came to the Rules Committee  that bypassed committees of jurisdiction and then were closed up and  sent to the floor with no amendments at all.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the distinguished chairwoman of the Energy  and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.  [[Page H3356]]         Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Washington  Post article entitled ``Trump on climate change: `People like myself,  we have very high levels of intelligence but we're not necessarily such  believers.' ''                 [From the Washington Post, Nov. 27, 2018]  Trump on Climate Change: `People Like Myself, We Have Very High Levels         of Intelligence but We're Not Necessarily Such Believers'       (By Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Brady Dennis and Chris Mooney)         President Trump on Nov. 26 reacted to a major report issued       Nov. 23 that said climate change will challenge the economy,       environment, and human health. (The Washington Post)        President Trump on Tuesday dismissed a landmark report       compiled by 13 federal agencies detailing how damage from       global warming is intensifying throughout the country, saying       he is not among the ``believers'' who see climate change as a       pressing problem.        The comments were the president's most extensive yet on why       he disagrees with his own government's analysis, which found       that climate change poses a severe threat to the health of       Americans, as well as to the country's infrastructure,       economy and natural resources. The findings--unequivocal,       urgent and alarming--are at odds with the Trump       administration's rollback of environmental regulations and       absence of any climate action policy.        ``One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we       have very high levels of intelligence but we're not       necessarily such believers,'' Trump said during a       freewheeling 20-minute Oval Office interview with The       Washington Post in which he was asked why he was skeptical of       the dire National Climate Assessment his administration       released Friday.        ``As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the       effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see       it,'' he added.        Trump did not address the fundamental cause of climate       change. The president riffed on pollution in other parts of       the world. He talked about trash in the oceans. He opined on       forest management practices. But he said little about what       scientists say is actually driving the warming of the       planet--emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of       fossil fuels.        ``You look at our air and our water and it's right now at a       record clean. But when you look at China and you look at       parts of Asia and you look at South America, and when you       look at many other places in this world, including Russia,       including many other places, the air is incredibly dirty, and       when you're talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very       small,'' Trump said in an apparent reference to pollution       around the globe. ``And it blows over and it sails over. I       mean we take thousands of tons of garbage off our beaches all       the time that comes over from Asia. It just flows right down       the Pacific. It flows and we say, `Where does this come       from?' And it takes many people, to start off with.''        Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech       University, said in an email Tuesday that the president's       comments risk leaving the nation vulnerable to the ever-      growing impacts of a warming planet. ``Facts aren't something       we need to believe to make them true--we treat them as       optional at our peril,'' Hayhoe said. ``And if we're the       president of the United States, we do so at the peril of not       just ourselves but the hundreds of millions of people we're       responsible for.''        Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at       Texas A&M University, struggled to find a response to the       president's comments. ``How can one possibly respond to       this?'' Dessler said when reached by email, calling the       president's comments ``idiotic'' and saying Trump's main       motivation seemed to be attacking the environmental policies       of the Obama administration and criticizing political       adversaries.        In his comments, Trump also seemed to invoke a theme that       is common in the world of climate-change skepticism--the idea       that not so long ago, scientists feared global cooling,       rather than the warming that is underway today.        ``If you go back and if you look at articles, they talk       about global freezing,'' Trump said. ``They talk about at       some point, the planet is going to freeze to death, then it's       going to die of heat exhaustion.''        This may refer to an oft-cited 1975 Newsweek article titled       ``The Cooling World'' or a 1974 Time magazine story titled       ``Another Ice Age?'' But researchers who have reviewed this       period have found that while such ideas were indeed afoot at       the time, there was ``no scientific consensus in the 1970s''       about a global cooling trend or risk, as there is today about       human-caused climate change.        In other words, scientists' understanding of where the       planet is headed, and the consequences, is far more developed       now than it was in the 1970s.        At present, Earth has warmed roughly one degree Celsius       (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above late-19th-century,       preindustrial levels. Multiple analyses have shown that       without rapid emissions cuts--well beyond what the world is       undertaking--the warming will continue and could blow past       key thresholds that scientists say could lead to irrevocable       climate-related catastrophes, such as more-extreme weather,       the death of coral reefs and losses of major parts of       planetary ice sheets.        On Tuesday, a U.N. report underscored again how the world       is far off course on its promises to cut greenhouse-gas       emissions. The report found that, with global emissions still       increasing as of 2017, it is unlikely they will peak by 2020.       Scientists have said carbon emissions must fall sharply in       coming years if the world is to have a chance of avoiding the       worst consequences of climate change.        Trump also made reference to recent devastating wildfires       in California, which scientists say have been made more       intense and deadly by climate change. But the president       instead focused on how the forests that burned have been       managed. Previously, he has praised Finland for spending ``a       lot of time on raking and cleaning'' its forest floors--a       notion that left the Finnish president flummoxed.  [[Page H3357]]         ``The fire in California, where I was, if you looked at the       floor, the floor of the fire, they have trees that were       fallen,'' Trump said. ``They did no forest management, no       forest maintenance, and you can light--you can take a match       like this and light a tree trunk when that thing is laying       there for more than 14 or 15 months. And it's a massive       problem in California.''        ``You go to other places where they have denser trees, it's       more dense, where the trees are more flammable, they don't       have forest fires like this because they maintain,'' he said.       ``And it was very interesting I was watching the firemen, and       they were raking brush. . . . It's on fire. They're raking       it, working so hard. If that was raked in the beginning,       there would be nothing to catch on fire.''        Trump wasn't the only administration official on Tuesday to       shrug off the federal government's latest climate warnings.       In a television appearance in California, Interior Secretary       Ryan Zinke acknowledged that fire seasons have grown longer       in the state but added, ``Climate change or not, it doesn't       relieve you of responsibility to manage the forest.''        Meanwhile, asked Tuesday about the findings of the nearly       1,700-page climate report the administration released on       Black Friday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders echoed       her boss.        ``We think that this is the most extreme version and it's       not based on facts,'' Sanders said of the National Climate       Assessment. ``It's not data-driven. We'd like to see       something that is more data-driven. It's based on modeling,       which is extremely hard to do when you're talking about the       climate. Again, our focus is on making sure we have the       safest, cleanest air and water.''     Madam Speaker, I do that because I want the Record to  reflect this President's ignorance on an issue that is not only of  national concern but of international concern.   In the past three annual worldwide threat assessments, the U.S.  intelligence communities have cited climate change as a national  security threat and a multiplier of threats that create instability,  food and water shortages, refugee and population migration, and  economic disruption. This is a matter that we can't ignore anymore. We  need to pass this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  leading public health advocates in support of H.R. 9, as well as a  letter signed by many of the leading environmental organizations in  support of this legislation.                                                     April 29, 2019.        Dear Representative: The undersigned public health and       medical organizations urge you to support H.R. 9, the Climate       Action Now Act. The bill would help ensure that the United       States adheres to the science-based targets in the Paris       Agreement and develops a plan to meet them, both essential       steps to protecting public health from the impacts of climate       change.        Climate change is a public health emergency. The science       clearly shows that communities across the nation are       experiencing the health impacts of climate change, including       enhanced conditions for ozone and particulate air pollution,       which cause asthma attacks, cardiovascular disease and       premature death; increased instances of extreme heat, severe       storms and other destabilizing weather patterns that disrupt       people's access to essential healthcare; increased spread of       vector-borne diseases; and longer and more intense allergy       seasons. These threats are no longer hypothetical, and       Americans across the country have experienced them firsthand.        Every American's health is at risk due to climate change,       but some populations are at greater risk, including infants,       children, seniors, pregnant women, low-income communities,       some communities of color, people with disabilities and many       people with chronic diseases. Evidence and experience shows       that these populations will disproportionately bear the       health impacts of climate change without concerted action to       both mitigate and adapt to climate change.        The science is also clear that limiting increase in global       temperatures to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius is       essential. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change       found dramatic differences in health impacts between 1.5 and       2 degrees, including in heat-related morbidity and mortality,       ozone-related mortality, and vector-borne diseases. The Paris       Agreement's goals are to keep the world well under 2 degrees       Celsius and to pursue efforts to further stay below 1.5       degrees.        H.R. 9 is an important step toward what must become a       comprehensive set of policies protect public health from the       worst impacts of climate change. The nation urgently needs to       implement strong, science-based measures to reduce the       emissions that cause climate change. The U.S. must also       invest in health adaptation strategies to help communities       address the varied health impacts they are already facing.        On behalf of the patients and communities we serve, we urge       you to vote YES on H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.            Sincerely,        Allergy & Asthma Network, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy       Environments, American Lung Association, American Public       Health Association, Association of Schools and Programs of       Public Health, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America,       Children's Environmental Health Network, Climate for Health,       Health Care Climate Council, Health Care Without Harm,       National Association of County and City Health Officials,       National Environmental Health Association, National Medical       Association, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Public       Health Institute.                                   ____                                                     April 29, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters across the country, we urge you to support       H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, to ensure the U.S. meets       its commitments under the Paris Agreement and to reinforce       our national resolve to address climate change.        The Paris Agreement is a global response to the greatest       environmental challenge of our time. It includes, for the       first time, specific commitments from all major countries and       a pathway for each country to strengthen its own domestic       climate actions in the years ahead. United States leadership       and participation was crucial in bringing the world together       to act. But now, by threatening to exit the agreement, the       Trump administration risks isolating itself, undermining       global climate action, and weakening America's international       influence on a broad array of critical foreign policy issues.        Americans are experiencing climate change here and now in a       rising tide of extreme weather disasters, from hurricanes in       the southeast, to wildfires in the west, to flooding right       now in the country's heartland. It's no surprise that polls       consistently show that concern over the climate crisis is       rising across generational, geographic, and partisan lines.        Americans' personal experience is underscored by a raft of       new scientific reports. Last fall the Intergovernmental Panel       on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that climate change is       already happening, and ambitious action to curb carbon       pollution is needed starting now to stave off steadily       worsening impacts in the U.S. and across the globe. The last       four years have been the hottest on record since global       measurements began in 1880, according to the National Oceanic       and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics       and Space Administration. And the National Climate       Assessment--prepared by 13 federal agencies and released by       the Trump Administration last year--lays out the stark       reality of current climate impacts in all regions of the       nation and projects how much worse they could get.        Without significant global action, the National Climate       Assessment concludes: ``rising temperatures, sea level rise,       and changes in extreme events are expected to increasingly       disrupt and damage critical infrastructure and property,       labor productivity, and the vitality of our communities.''       ``[C]oastal economies and property are already at risk,''       especially communities disproportionately comprised of low-      income and minority Americans. In short, climate change is       already here in America and it's already harming Americans'       lives.        Despite these dire forecasts, we can still stave off the       worst effects of climate change. Congressional leadership is       more important than ever, and the Climate Action Now Act will       go a long way to ensure that the United States fulfills our       commitments under the Paris Agreement and stays on the path       to serious action on climate change.        This legislation demonstrates leadership and vision needed       to tackle the climate crisis. We urge you to support the       Climate Action Now Act to help make the future climate safe       for our children and grandchildren and honor America's       commitments to help confront this global challenge.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).   (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This is like the theater of the absurd, when I listen to my  Republican colleagues. We have a bill, H.R. 9, that says that the  United States should not remove itself from the Paris climate accord. I  have one colleague saying that it is a messaging bill that means  nothing. I have other Republican colleagues saying that if we pass  this, it is the end of the world because it is going to have all these  implications.   Then we get lectured to by my Republican colleagues for almost an  hour  [[Page H3360]]  now that 30 amendments are not enough on a 6-page bill, that we need  more and more amendments in order. Then, the gentleman from Georgia  comes to the floor and says: I want to offer the Green New Deal, and I  want to offer it under a closed rule where nobody can amend it.   I mean, you can't make this stuff up. The Republicans are saying: We  don't want hearings, and we don't want markups. We want nothing. We  just want to bring it to the floor under a closed rule so that nobody,  Democrats or Republicans, can amend it.   I support the Green New Deal. I have some ideas to make it a little  bit better. I would like to have some amendments made in order. But my  Republican friends say no amendments, closed rule, shut it all down.  Old habits die hard.   When the Republicans were in charge, they presided over the most  closed Congress in the history of our country, and they just can't  break that old habit.   Well, you know what? We want to move on a Green New Deal, but we want  to do it right. We want to do hearings, and you can have some of your  friends and allies who are climate-change deniers come to testify  against it if you want. We will bring experts and scientists because we  believe in science. We will have them come to talk about why it is  important and how we can improve it.   We look forward to that, but not under a closed rule with no hearings  and no markups. This is embarrassing.   Madam Speaker, the United States has a unique role to play in  fighting climate change, not just because we should be leading the way  on innovation or because we have the largest economy anywhere but  because we played a major role in furthering this crisis.   Between 1970 and 2013, the U.S. ranked number one in total carbon  emissions. We released more carbon into the atmosphere than China,  Japan, or any of the other 40 global nations. That is according to the  Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. I don't think we  should be turning our back on a problem that we helped create.   It isn't a radical or partisan idea. Experts consider 1988 to be the  year that the science behind climate change became widely known and  accepted, and that is the year when a Republican Presidential nominee,  George H.W. Bush, pledged that he would fight the greenhouse effect  with the ``White House effect.''   We have come a long way since then, Madam Speaker, and I don't mean  positively. There was a time when Republicans cared about the  environment, when they understood that issues like the climate crisis  were something that we needed to work on in a bipartisan way. Now they  have become the party of climate change deniers.   This is the challenge of our generation. It is more important than  petty partisanship.   President Trump seems obsessed with dismantling anything that Barack  Obama has ever done. That doesn't mean that Congress should sit idly by  when it comes at the expense of the future of our planet.   With climate change, public health is at risk and our national  security is endangered. The President may be unwilling to rise to the  challenge, but this Democratic majority is not. Congress shouldn't let  another one of his temper tantrums ruin our planet.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question, and I  urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and the underlying resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
