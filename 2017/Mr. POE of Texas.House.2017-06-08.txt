 Mr. Speaker, Americans once thought that the  horrors of human trafficking were a foreign problem. However,  traffickers lurk all around us right here in America.   Debbie's mother thought nothing of letting her young daughter meet a  friend in front of their yard one night to play. Her mother didn't  realize her 15-year-old daughter, who was clad in her cartoon pajamas,  was quickly abducted by two men in front of their house.   These deviants threw Debbie in the car, drugged her, and gang raped  her. They threatened to shoot her if she ever tried to escape. For 60  days she was forced to have sex with countless men.   An anonymous tip led police to a hotel room where they found Debbie  tied up and stashed under a bed. But many trafficking victims are never  rescued. We cannot allow this scourge to  [[Page H4715]]  continue to rage in America. Our children are not for sale, period.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
