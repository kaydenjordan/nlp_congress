 Mr. President, before the Senator from Arizona leaves the  floor, he and I are very much in syncopation on the question of what he  has just eloquently addressed about the Russian attempts to interfere  in other countries as well as in our country with regard to the  elections.   I just wanted to pose a question to the Senator. Is the Senator  aware, as he obviously is--but it is my rhetorical question--that the  Russians have already intervened in the elections of other countries  and indeed tried and it boomeranged against them against France and are  probably in the midst of trying to interfere with the German election?    Mr. President, one further question. Has the Senator  been--well, he obviously is aware, and he has obviously been briefed-- but can he help convey the gravity of the situation of Russia's  interference in the upcoming elections in 2018 and 2020, where not only  is it a question of whether they would change the vote count by getting  in and hacking, but they could change the registration records so that  a voter could show up to vote on election day and suddenly the  registrar says: But you are not registered.    Mr. President, this Senator certainly looks forward to  that hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee. I thank the  chairman for his leadership in constantly bringing up and reminding the  American people of the threat that is coming through cyber attacks into  this Nation and others.
