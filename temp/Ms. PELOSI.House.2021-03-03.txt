 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York, the  distinguished chair of the Judiciary Committee, for yielding and for  his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor.   I commend Congresswoman Karen Bass for her great leadership in this  important legislation.   Madam Speaker, nearly 1 year ago, George Floyd gasped his last words,  ``I can't breathe,'' and ignited a nationwide reckoning on the racial  injustice and police brutality in America.   Americans from every corner of the country took to the streets to  peacefully protest violence against Black Americans: waving Black Lives  Matter flags, chanting the names of the murdered, repeating George  Floyd's dying words, ``I can't breathe.'' They turned their agony into  action.   But, tragically, despite these mass protests, the injustice, the  killing, continues. Those protests were global. They were all over the  world.   Here, as Members of Congress, and as Americans, we cannot accept this  epidemic of injustice. We cannot stay silent when our most vulnerable  and historically marginalized communities--people of color, those  living in poverty, Americans with disabilities--are being targeted and  sometimes killed.   That is why today the House will again pass the George Floyd Justice  in Policing Act and send it to the Senate and the President's desk, so  that it can finally become the law of the land.                                time  1915    I salute Congresswoman Karen Bass, who has been relentless,  persistent, and absolutely courageous in her leadership on this  legislation. I thank the Congressional Black Caucus and its  chairperson, Joyce Beatty; and Judiciary chair, Jerry Nadler.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act fundamentally transforms the  culture of policing with strong, unprecedented reform. This legislation  will not erase centuries of systemic racism and excessive policing in  America. It will not bring back George Floyd, Breonna Taylor--say her  name, Breonna Taylor--Ahmaud Arbery, or the countless other men and  women who died or were senselessly injured. But it will take a  tremendous step forward to stop the violence, stem the suffering, and  start to build a healthier and better relationship between law  enforcement and communities that they protect.   All of us here salute and are profoundly grateful for our law  enforcement heroes. I grew up in a public service family. My father, my  whole life at home, was the mayor of Baltimore. My brother was mayor  later, Thomas D'Alesandro, in Baltimore. They had a motto about the  police: Be true to the men in blue.   Of course, this was a long time ago. Be true to the men in blue. I  was raised with that respect.   But then, prayerfully, these people, our men and women--now men and  women--in uniform, whether they are police or fire, but addressing  police here, our first responders left home when they left to go to  work, not knowing, and their families not knowing, if they would return  home because they were risking their lives to save lives and to protect  all of us. So it was with great prayerful gratitude to most of the men  and women in blue that we, sadly, have to say that our appreciation for  them cannot lapse into apathy or acceptance of actions that are  fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of policing.   Of course, there is not anyone on our side of the aisle who has  advocated any policy in this body to defund the police, contrary to  misrepresentations that are coming forth. All of us here, again, salute  and are profoundly grateful for our law enforcement heroes.   As the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives  writes:         The passage of this act is paramount in achieving the       fundamental principle of a police force that ``protects and       serves'' every  [[Page H1062]]       citizen of their community with fairness, accountability, and       transparency in their actions.    The Democratic Congress, together with the Biden-Harris  administration, is committed to not only ensuring that this legislation  becomes law, but to take further action to end violence and advance  justice in America. Let us ensure that the passage of the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act is the first of many steps in this direction.   The family of George Floyd, who came here when the bill was being  reviewed by Chairman Nadler's committee, asked me: Madam Speaker, will  you name this bill for our brother?   His brother asked that question. The gentleman remembers that day. We  couldn't be in the committee room because of COVID.   I said: Only if you think it is worthy of your brother.   I think of George Floyd at least once a day and sometimes more.   Do you know why?   Not just because of the sadness of it all, but I think of him because  they tell us that, in order to be safe from COVID, we must wash our  hands for 20 seconds. So as I'm washing my hands for 20 seconds, after  about 8 or 9 seconds, I am thinking that this is taking forever; I  can't do this for 20 seconds; it takes too long. Then I think of George  Floyd--8 minutes and 46 seconds. It is a long time. It is a long time,  as Congresswoman Dean said, calling out for his mother and extending  love to his family.   Let us ensure that George's brother, Philonise, when he said that  George's name means something; and that as his daughter, Gianna, said,  ``Daddy changed the world,'' with this legislation, let us take an  important step in changing the world for George's family, for all  communities of color, for all Americans, and for the whole world.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote in the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act, and I thank Karen Bass, again, for her  leadership.   Madam Speaker, nearly one year ago, George Floyd gasped his last  words--``I can't breathe''--and ignited a nationwide reckoning on the  racial injustice and police brutality in America.   Americans from every corner of the country took to the streets to  peacefully protest violence against Black Americans: waving Black Lives  Matter flags, chanting the names of the murdered, repeating George  Floyd's dying words.   They turned their agony into action, but tragically, despite these  mass protests, the injustice--the killing--continues.   Last year, 1,127 people were killed by police, far more than in the  year before. In the months following George Floyd's murder, 645 people  were killed--and hundreds more were attacked and assaulted, including  Jacob Blake: shot seven times in the back in front of his three  children.   As George Floyd's brother Philonise recently said, ``As a Black man  in the United States, I want to be able to go outside and protest,  because at this time, I don't know who is going to survive or not.''   As Members of Congress and as Americans, we cannot accept this  epidemic of injustice. We cannot stay silent, when our most vulnerable  and historically marginalized communities--people of color, those  living in poverty, Americans with disabilities--are being targeted and  killed.   That is why, today, the House will again pass the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act--and send it to the Senate and the President's  desk, so that it can finally become law.   I salute Congresswoman Karen Bass, who has been relentless,  persistent and absolutely courageous in her leadership on this  legislation. Thank you to the CBC and Chair Joyce Beatty, and Judiciary  Chair Jerry Nadler.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act fundamentally transforms the  culture of policing with strong, unprecedented reforms, including:  banning chokeholds; stopping no-knock warrants; ending the court- created qualified immunity doctrine; combating racial profiling; and  establishing strong new standards and protections to prevent and combat  police misconduct.   This legislation will not erase centuries of systemic racism and  excessive policing in America.   It will not bring back George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery or  the countless other men and women who died or were senselessly injured.   But it will take a tremendous step forward to stop the violence, stem  the suffering and start to build a healthier, better relationship  between law enforcement and the communities that they protect.   All of us here salute and are profoundly grateful for our law  enforcement heroes. But our appreciation cannot lapse into apathy or  acceptance of actions that are fundamentally incompatible with the  purpose of policing.

Let us ensure that the passage of the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act is the first of many steps in this mission.   And let us ensure that, as George's brother said, ``George's name  means something''; and that, as his daughter Gianna said, ``Daddy  changed the world.''   With this legislation, let us take a small step to ``changing the  world''--for George's family, for all communities of color, and for all  Americans.   With that, I urge a strong, bipartisan vote for the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act.
