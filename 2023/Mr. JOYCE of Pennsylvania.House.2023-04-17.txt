 Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish Henry Haldeman  a happy 100th birthday and to thank him for his service to our country  during World War II.   After joining the Army, Sergeant Haldeman landed at Anzio Beach in  Italy, becoming one of the first Americans to begin liberating the  oppressed people of Europe.   From Anzio to Germany, Henry Haldeman and the men of the 14th Army  Infantry fought bravely and sacrificed much as they helped to turn  around the horrors of World War II.   Receiving both a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, Henry Haldeman  represents what truly made his the Greatest Generation.   After returning home to Port Royal, Henry found joy working on his  family's farm, growing corn and feeding young calves. His life has been  a beacon of what it means to serve his country and his community both  at home and abroad.   On behalf of everyone in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District,  I wish Henry Haldeman a happy 100th birthday and continued blessings to  come.                            ____________________
