 Madam Speaker, today I rise to mark more than 1 year of  Russia's expanded terrorist war against Ukraine after its initial  unprovoked invasion in 2014.   The words of Ukraine's poet laureate Taras Shevchenko ring especially  true today as when he penned them nearly two centuries ago:   `` . . . rise ye up and break your heavy chains and water with the  tyrants' blood, the freedom you have gained.''   Ukraine's moment to victory is now. The defining accomplishment of  the 20th century was the victory of liberty over tyranny. Vanquishing  Nazi and imperialist tyranny and defeating the forces of Soviet-imposed  communism a half century later ended the Cold War.   New institutions for the common defense of liberty, including NATO,  were founded. The U.S. Marshall Plan helped to secure and rebuild a  war-torn but free Europe, and both America and liberty prospered.   Through the bipartisan leadership of great Americans, including  General George Marshall, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, and Presidents  Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, America rose--though somewhat  reluctantly--to be liberty's standard-bearer. And even in those  European nations that had fallen behind the Iron Curtain, such as  Ukraine, the impulse for freedom hastened. For America, helping liberty  defeat tyranny has always been bipartisan.   Recall the images of President John Kennedy in West Germany declaring  ``Ich bin ein Berliner.''   President Ronald Reagan stood behind the Brandenburg Gate nearly two  decades later near the Berlin Wall demanding, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear  down this wall.''   Those images defined the boundary between East and West: free people  versus subjugated people.   It was barely 2 years after President Reagan's speech and after over  four decades of free world vigilance that the world witnessed the  profound victory of the valiant Solidarnosc workers in the steelyards  of Gdansk, Poland.   Soon, captive nations subjugated by the Soviet Union for decades  began to tumble. First, in 1989, Poland. Then in 1991, Ukraine. Then  the entirety of the captive nations held subjugated by the Soviet  Union. It was a major turning point in the arc of world history.   The Allied post-war institutions created to defend liberty still  exist today. Indeed, now with Sweden and Finland  [[Page H923]]  joining NATO, that alliance grows stronger than it has ever been.   Ukraine, too, seeks to join its European allies who are democratic in  the European Union. Ukrainian soldiers meanwhile embattled and vastly  outnumbered are dying, dying, dying for the cause of self-determination  and liberty. Against great odds, Ukraine faces an enemy three times  their population with far more military resources, but they fight.   To gain a sense of what Ukrainians are feeling right now, visit the  World War II Memorial here in Washington, D.C. Seek to understand the  sacrifices of the more than 400,000 Americans whose lives were given to  liberty in its cause on the Atlantic, Pacific, and African fronts  during the 20th century so that we, our generations, could remain free.   Under Soviet domination, no nation in the world suffered more than  Ukraine. More than 4 million innocent people were systematically  starved to death by Joseph Stalin, with millions upon millions upon  millions more, whose names we will never know, murdered by Stalin's  brutal Communist regime. America has been absent those horrors, thank  God.   Despite these bestial atrocities, America at times has turned a blind  eye to Russian atrocities dating back to its World War II unholy  alliance with the Soviet Union to defeat Nazism.    In 2008, when Russian President Vladimir Putin stormed into The  Republic of Georgia, President George W. Bush looked the other way. In  2014, when Vladimir Putin, entirely unprovoked, originally invaded  Ukraine and subjugated Crimea, President Barack Obama paused.   Now Putin, in trying to capture the sovereign nation of Ukraine and  hold it under his tyrannical claw, has gone too far. America has  resumed its role as the vigorous and uncompromising defender of free  and aspiring people. Liberty must check tyranny. Today, Ukraine seeks  liberty for her 40 million people--Liberty must win. Liberty will win.   President Biden, Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell,  Senator Lindsey Graham, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, and other  impassioned advocates of both parties champion Ukraine's cause. America  and our allies have responded to the crisis by sending fervent support  in the form of weapons and humanitarian aid. What happens next? In one  word, victory.   Our Nation does not exist alone on this globe. Isolation is  strangulation. America's democratic ally Ukraine is pleading for help.  President Biden has made his position clear: he will support Ukraine  ``as long as it takes.'' And he will not let Putin force Ukraine to  negotiate away its territory. He takes these positions because he knows  it would be aiding and abetting the enemy for America to look the other  way. To do nothing is essentially choosing to side with Russia over  Ukraine. In the long term that would be foolhardy and dangerous both  for the United States and for a safer, more democratic world.   America is still a young land and, in some ways, largely sheltered  from the lengths to which vicious tyrants will go to wipe out free  people. Putin is prepared to go to those lengths. This is the time to  choose. This is the time to fight. This is the time to stand up and  defend liberty, at home and abroad. Each generation must make fateful  choices. So must we.   When our great Nation was founded, most of the world's population  were slaves, serfs, or subjugated. Even then, one of our Founding  Fathers, Patrick Henry, grasped the concept of liberty. He challenged  our forbearers: ``Give me Liberty or give me death.'' He understood  what was at stake then, just as the people of Ukraine do today. So must  we. The free world must choose liberty. America stands with our Allies  to strengthen democracy, and realize in our time and generation a free,  sovereign, and independent Ukraine. Slava Ukraini! Glory to Ukraine.                            ____________________
