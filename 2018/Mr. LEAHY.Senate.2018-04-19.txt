 Mr. President, the magnitude of atrocities and devastation  in Syria caused by ISIS and the Assad regime, with support from Russia  and Iran, is appalling. When this calamity began in 2011, I doubt  anyone predicted it would come to this: hundreds of  [[Page S2314]]  thousands of people killed; half the population of the country  displaced, many living as refugees in neighboring countries; whole  cities reduced to rubble riddled with landmines and boobytraps.   For years, I, like others here, have called for a comprehensive U.S.  strategy for responding to the Syrian crisis that is grounded in  cooperation with the international community, to be presented to  Congress. I have also supported hundreds of millions of dollars in  humanitarian aid to desperate Syrian civilians. We must at least do  what is within our power to address the needs of those affected while  efforts are made to bring the violence to an end.   I have also defended Congress's sole authority to declare war, which  should always be based on a clear strategy. I opposed the Obama  administration's proposal for the authorization for the use of force in  Syria in 2013 because it was overly broad and would have ceded to the  White House power reserved to Congress under the Constitution. I have  also opposed the manner in which President Trump has twice launched  attacks against Syria without approval from Congress.   While I recognize and appreciate the considerable precautions that  were taken in the early hours of April 15 by the U.S. military to  prevent civilian casualties and avoid targeting Russian assets in  Syria, whenever military operations are conducted the outcome is never  certain. Things can go terribly wrong. In this instance, instead of  demolishing two or three Syrian chemical weapons facilities, we could  have triggered a shooting war with Russia, and Israel and Iran might  have quickly followed suit. What began as a missile attack lasting a  few minutes could have ignited a regional war. That is a risk that  Congress must be given the opportunity to weigh.   The use of chemical weapons is a crime against humanity and a  violation of international law that cannot be tolerated, but it is also  a fact that conventional attacks by the Assad regime have caused far  more deaths of innocent men, women, and children. The Assad regime has  been slaughtering its own people for more than 7 years by dropping  barrel bombs, laying siege to cities to prevent access to food, water,  and medicine, and using poison gas. While we all want to act decisively  in the face of such atrocities, the United States cannot solve this  crisis using Tomahawk missiles. All such attacks can do, it appears, is  degrade, most likely only temporarily, Assad's ability to use chemical  weapons. This was demonstrated in the aftermath of President Trump's  first military response to Assad's use of chemical weapons in April  2017. It was conducted with great fanfare, without congressional  authorization, and it failed to prevent future attacks. President Trump  has now launched a second attack without the approval of Congress, and  he has proclaimed ``mission accomplished.''   Why didn't the President seek Congress's approval? And what is the  mission? How would we have responded if the attacks had triggered an  escalation of violence, potentially spinning out of control? Those  critical questions need answers.   Perhaps the most fundamental question for this administration is what  does President Trump seek to achieve in Syria? Is it limited to  defeating ISIS and punishing Assad for using chemical weapons? Are we  willing to accept Russia and Iran determining Syria's future? If not,  what is the strategy for ending the war, if Russia continues to block  diplomatic efforts in the U.N. Security Council? How does the White  House explain cutting aid for refugees overseas, withdrawing the United  States from the Global Compact on Migration, limiting the resettlement  of Syrian refugees here to only 11 people so far in 2018, compared to  790 last year during the same period, and suspending $200 million in  U.S. aid for civilians in Syria? Those funds are intended to help  improve the livelihoods of Syrians impacted by the war, including to  provide access to basic services.   Does the White House believe that it is in the national interest to  conduct attacks against Syria, at the risk of triggering a wider war  and after failing to produce the intended results in the past, but that  it is not in our national interest to provide aid to Syrian civilians  in areas controlled by our partners?   I am also concerned about what these attacks against Syria may reveal  about President Trump's willingness to direct a military attack  elsewhere without obtaining the consent of Congress, for example,  against North Korea or Iran.   The conflict in Syria obviously has no easy solution, and it is  apparent that it has no military solution. It is the President's job to  explain what our strategy is, including how we can overcome Russia's  intransigence at the United Nations amidst mounting concerns that we  will abandon the Syrian people, before he fires off another volley of  missiles that do not get us any closer to a solution and which may have  the opposite effect.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in this week when new Pulitzer Prizes were  awarded to outstanding reporters and courageous news organizations, I  want to take a moment, on behalf of all Vermonters, to recognize and  thank an earlier Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, Vermont's own David  Moats. Until earlier this year, David has been the editorial page  editor and the editorial page voice of the Rutland Herald.   David Moats is a Green Mountain treasure. John Walters of the  newspaper Seven Days called David ``a beacon of quality'' in Vermont  journalism. He represents and gave voice to ideals, the aspirations,  and the decency that characterize Vermont's vibrant, outward-looking,  and engaged citizens.   On July 1, 2000, our brave, small State again stepped up to tackle a  difficult and momentous issue. That is when Vermont became the first  State to offer to same-sex couples the same legal rights and  responsibilities of traditional marriage. Vermont's law was written,  debated, and approved by the Vermont Legislature.   David Moats documented and illuminated the debate that led to that  breakthrough. He won a Pulitzer Prize for his series of 20 editorials  that were published throughout that difficult and groundbreaking  debate.   The Pulitzer Committee honored David Moats, in their words, ``For his  even-handed and influential series of editorials commenting on the  divisive issues arising from civil unions for same-sex couples.''   In 2004, he wrote a book about this debate, ``Civil Wars: A Battle  For Gay Marriage.'' Ted Widmer, writing in the New York Times Book  Review, said this in his review: ``Near the end of `Mr. Deeds Goes to  Town,' the Vermonter played by Gary Cooper dishes out a series of  homespun metaphors for how government is supposed to treat people, from  helping to push a car up a hill to saving a swimmer who's drowning.  Obviously, life isn't quite that simple. This will take time. But in  the long run, the question will be answered in the vast middle where  most Americans live, and where they privately decide what is right and  wrong.''   David Moats served as editorial page editor of the Rutland Herald  since 1992. Previously, he had worked as the newspaper's wire editor,  State editor, assistant managing editor, and city editor. Earlier in  life, he served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Afghanistan.   He is also the author of 11 plays, has made his home in Middlebury,  VT, and is the father of three children, Jared, Thatcher, and Nina  Moats.   David, we thank you, and we wish you and your family all the best as  you write your next chapter.   I ask unanimous consent that these excerpts from an editorial titled,  ``Legacy,'' in the Rutland Herald last month, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    [From ``Legacy,'' an editorial in The Rutland Herald, March 3, 2018]         A consistently reasoned voice is difficult to find. It's       challenging to hear in these polarizing times, and it's even       harder to find it on the everyday occasion of an editorial       page. The distillation of issues into comprehensible,       authentic points is a skill few writers can pull off,       certainly not with any regularity.        We all know a man who has come to make the blend of opinion       and language an art form.        Vermont has been blessed for decades by David Moats'       compassionate approach to measured debate and thoughtful       provocation. In this very space, David has wrestled to       submission some of the most gut-  [[Page S2315]]       wrenching issues of our times, insisting upon a more       controlled, solution-based dialogue. He has celebrated our       triumphs. He has challenged the parties in power (much to       their chagrin), and he has endeavored to teach us--as readers       and participants in our communities--a bit about ourselves by       shining truths on flawed thinking or highlighting the       arrogance made against a public trust. He has broken our       hearts in tribute, and he has--time and again--called us to       action, whether it was spurring us to vote, raise our own       voices, or simply by being engaged and showing up.        David has won scores of accolades for swinging his mighty       pen, including the coveted Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for his       body of work on civil unions. In that case, David not only       informed, he shaped policy and rewrote history.        For Vermont, he has been advocate, champion, instigator--      and friend. His editorials (and commentaries on Vermont       Public Radio) have generated a loyal following. Liberals and       moderates have come to quote from his editorials, while       conservatives regularly condemn his words as out of step. But       David has more friends then enemies, conservatives among       them. That's how the deepest respect works.        (The editorial continues:)        David Moats has graced these pages with deliberate       conscience, pouring his heart into the collective of Vermont.       His insights and opinions have--and will--continue to       underscore what defines us as Vermonters, and what passions       and principles drive us to stand up for that better life for       our best selves.        We are all indebted to David Moats for being our mentor,       our leader, and our voice. We have needed him, probably more       than we even know.        Vermont is a better place because of the man and his words.                            ____________________
