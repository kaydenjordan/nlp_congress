 Mr. President, I have kind of heard it all today. I am not  going to engage with the ranking member when he calls her unqualified.  We know this is about a history of this committee's Republicans voting  against very qualified African-American women. We have won that debate;  we have won it with the American people.   And I was just handed--because I remembered this. I remembered  hundreds, literally hundreds, of prominent people in the economics  field and outside the economics field that supported Lisa Cook, they  wrote letters. We got more letters, I believe, for Lisa Cook than any  nominee for the Fed.   The ranking member knows, and he has voted for some pretty  unqualified people, and that he would decide this is one he is voting  against is just kind of sad. Let me give you some examples, 35 Marshall  and Truman Scholars are supporting her--35; the National Bankers  Association; Ben Bernanke, a Bush nominee who was chair of the Federal  Reserve; all kinds of organizations, some political, some not  political, many of them bank-based.   I will send these to the ranking member so he can get a look at them.  I know he has already seen them before, but they seem to have slipped  his mind.   I urge my colleagues to support Dr. Cook. She teaches at Michigan  State, the presiding officer's proud institution. She would be a  historic confirmation to the Board of Governors, we know that. She  understands how economic policy affects all kinds of different people  in different parts of the country, from the rural south where she grew  up to the industrial Midwest where she built her career. One of the  things I like about her, the Federal Reserve--I mean, I understand that  economic conservatives in this body--and I think the ranking member  would probably define himself that way; I admire his courage in voting  against--  [[Page S2406]]  voting for the removal of President Trump, so I admired his courage. I  just think he is wrong on these kind of nominees. But I just--I look at  her, and I see how--what I like--one of the things I like about her is  the Fed, for years, has just practiced this top-down economic policy.  The people that sit on the Fed, they almost all look like me,  historically.   In fact, Lisa Cook will be the first Black woman in 109 years ever to  sit on the Fed, seven members of the Fed at any one time, and the terms  are--usually they stay 5 to 10 years--so you can see how many people  cycle in and out. But they almost all believe in this trickle-down  economics that you give tax cuts to rich people and it will trickle  down and the economy will be better.   Well, Lisa Cook is different. She doesn't come from the coast. She  comes from what some people on the coast would call ``flyover  country,'' Michigan or Ohio. She grew up in a small town in Georgia.   She went to college at Spelman, one of the best schools in the  country. She was a Marshall and a Truman Scholar in England. She got  her Ph.D. at Berkeley, and now she is teaching at Michigan State. And  that tells me she has a sense of this country.    And he criticized her because of her emphasis on international  relations. I like it that we have somebody at the Fed that not only  knows the country, knows the great industrial Midwest in Michigan or  Ohio--sort of the same in some ways. I like it that she studied on the  west coast. I like it that she studied abroad. I like it that she spent  time overseas learning about banking in economics and other countries,  instead of the cookie-cutter people we always get on the Federal  Reserve. Someone very important, speaks very seriously, has a good Ivy  League education, but they don't know real people. And Lisa Cook knows  real people.   She has years of research and international experience with monetary  policy, banking, and financial crises. She has served as an economist  under administrations to both parties, and as I said, she has support  from across the political spectrum. All kinds of people endorsed her.  They sent more letters supporting her than any Fed nom that I remember  in front of this Banking Committee, and I have been on the Banking  Committee a decade and a half.   She has demonstrated her commitment to Fed independence, the  importance of making decisions based on fact. She agrees with Chair  Powell that the Fed's most important task right now is to tackle  inflation. She believes:         A strong and resilient financial system supports American       families, businesses, and our economy.    Those are her words.   Take a moment again and let me go back to why this is historical: the  first Black woman in 109 years to serve in the Federal Reserve. Think  about that. Think about that: the first Black woman in 109 years. This  country is 12 percent Black. We have had dozens and dozens and dozens  of Fed noms, yet we are going to need--probably need the Vice President  to come in here and cast the tie-breaking vote because every single  Republican, everybody on this side of the aisle, sitting behind every  one of these desks is voting against the first African-American woman  ever on the Federal Reserve. Spelman College, Truman Scholar, Marshall  Scholar, Ph.D. at Berkeley, tenure at one of America's great  universities, Michigan State University--and they say she is not  qualified? And Judy Shelton was? Really.   She will protect the Fed's independence. She knows that workers drive  our economic growth. She, like this President, understands you focus on  workers, you put workers at the center of our economy. That is the kind  of Fed governor she is going to be. She understands when everyone  participates in our economy, it grows faster and stronger for all  Americans.   We need her on the job today. I would add the other Senator from  Michigan is here who has been a strong, strong supporter of Professor  Cook. I join my two colleagues from Michigan and everybody on this side  of the aisle to support Lisa Cook for the Federal Reserve.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the privileges  of the floor be granted to Brittany Thomas, Sneha Pandya, and Serena  Baserman for the remainder of this Congress.
