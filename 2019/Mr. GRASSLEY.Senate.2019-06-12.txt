 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Mr. President, Congress needs to address the crisis  facing multiemployer pension plans. The Finance Committee is continuing  its work on retirement income security, including those issues with the  multiemployer plans.   While we work to enact the first round of reforms in the retirement  savings accounts, known as RESA, which is now before the Senate, there  is still more work to do. We have the benefit of the joint select  committee's work on multiemployer plans last year. We know what is  going on, we know what is broken, and we know the various options for  repairing the system.   It is time to put pen to paper and fix these plans that will protect  the workers who have paid into them.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
