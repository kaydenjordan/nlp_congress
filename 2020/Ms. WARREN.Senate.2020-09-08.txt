 Madam President, I would like to offer my  congratulations to Donna Kelly-Williams as she retires as president of  the Massachusetts Nurses Association where she has represented our  nurses and the patients they serve since 2009. Beginning her  professional career in 1974, she aided nurses in the newborn nursery at  the Cambridge Hospital, cementing her passion for the caregiving  profession. Following nursing school, she served as a medical-surgical  nurse and then as a pediatric nurse before eventually coming full  circle and returning to the maternity unit. She has spent her entire  nursing career serving her community at Cambridge Hospital in  Cambridge, MA. Throughout her career, she has always been committed to  creating environments where every nurse is respected and valued for  their contributions. This commitment and passion for advocacy led her  to become involved in the Massachusetts Nurses Association, first  joining the bargaining unit at Cambridge Hospital and serving in this  capacity for two decades.   She then served as vice president of the Massachusetts Nurses  Association and on the board of directors before she was elected  president in 2009. As president, Donna led the union as they became a  part of National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses  in history. She understood this participation in a new national nurses'  union enabled members to have an even greater impact on national pushes  for legislation, including healthcare and  [[Page S5441]]  labor reforms, supporting nurses serving in all of America's hospitals.  Donna worked tirelessly to advocate for nurses' workers rights during  strikes; I remember trading calls and texts with Donna late into the  night to settle contracts during the Tufts Medical Center strike.   I am deeply grateful to Donna Kelly-Williams for her lifelong  commitment to America's working families, for all she has done for  nurses across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and for her tireless  fight to improve patient care. We have all benefited from Donna's  passion, resilience, and empathy throughout her entire career and her  lasting impact on our Massachusetts nurses will be felt for years to  come. I once again congratulate her on her retirement and wish her the  best of luck in the next chapter.                            ____________________
