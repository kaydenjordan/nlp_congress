 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R.  1146, the Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act.   After almost 40 years of protection, the Trump administration and the  fossil fuel lobbyists that have taken up residence at the Department of  the Interior opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and  gas development. The timing of this decision could not be more  irresponsible.   The last thing we should be doing is expanding fossil fuel  development in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising twice as fast  as the rest of the United States. But we know that this administration  isn't concerned about protecting our environment or addressing the  climate crisis, so it is not surprising that it is willing to sacrifice  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's diverse habitat in an attempt to  help its Big Oil friends turn an even bigger profit.    The American people disagree. The vast majority of Americans oppose  drilling in this iconic landscape, and I am proud to stand with them.   We should be reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, embracing  renewable energy, and leading the world in combating climate change,  not going backward.   Mr. Chair, I strongly support the Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain  Protection Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
