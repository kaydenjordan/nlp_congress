 Mr. Speaker, when I was a kid, my brother and I would  help  [[Page H2882]]  our dad make ends meet by collecting aluminum cans on the side of the  road. We didn't make much, but what we made, we used to buy food. Very  early, we learned the value of a dollar.   Today, the value of that same dollar has plummeted because of  wasteful, Big Government spending, like the kind President Biden has  embraced with his disastrous economic policies.   One of President Biden's core campaign promises was that he would not  raise taxes on any Americans making less than $400,000 a year. What he  failed to mention was the hidden tax brought on by his inflationary  spending. In May, the Consumer Price Index jumped to 5 percent, the  fastest rate since 2008.   Every American is feeling the strain from this administration's  reckless spending spree. From the gas pump and the supermarket to the  clothing store and the car dealership, Americans are spending more and  getting less.   While the current administration shovels trillions of taxpayer  dollars into the furnace of a runaway train, it is clear that Joe Biden  is intent on saddling our kids and grandkids with insurmountable debt.   It is time for Joe Biden to stop playing politics with taxpayer money  and start doing what is right for our country. Let's get Americans back  to work, get the government out of the way, and allow taxpayers to keep  more of their own money. After all, they have earned it.                                time  2100
