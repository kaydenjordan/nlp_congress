 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Alabama for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2810, the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense  Authorization Act, takes important steps towards strengthening our  national security and supporting our troops.   The conference report authorizes a total of $692 billion in  discretionary budget authority, $26 billion more than the  administration requested.   I am pleased that it raises military pay by 2.4 percent, an increase  from the President's request of 2.1 percent.                                time  1230    It also strengthens our efforts to counter Russia's campaign to  undermine our democracy by fully funding cybersecurity and cyberspace  operations at $8 billion and it drops harmful restrictions on funding  the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty extension between the United  States and Russia. This treaty continues a bipartisan tradition that  began under President Reagan, verifiably reducing both countries'  nuclear arsenals.   Mr. Speaker, there is one glaring problem with this measure, and that  is that the Budget Control Act imposes a $549 billion cap on defense  spending for fiscal year 2018. This bill blows past that by more than  $143 billion. Unless the Senate, the House, and the President come to  an agreement on lifting or modifying the budget caps, there is no way  that these spending levels can become law. So far, that agreement is  not in the offing and it is past time for a bipartisan compromise on  realistic spending levels for defense and nondefense spending alike.   While I am glad to see this pay increase for our troops, this  legislation does not exist in a vacuum. Later this week, the  Republicans plan to bring to the floor a disastrous tax bill that would  force military families and veterans to finance tax cuts for  corporations and the superwealthy. The bill repeals tax credits that  help veterans find employment. It makes education more expensive for  veterans and undermines the GI Bill. It makes it more expensive for  military families to sell their homes. It eliminates tax relief for  veterans suffering from chronic illnesses.   Veterans Day was just a few days ago, Mr. Speaker, and it is no way  for the majority to thank them for their service.   Also before us today is H.R. 2874, which is known as the 21st Century  Flood Reform Act. Now, everybody in this Chamber recognizes the  National Flood Insurance Program is badly in debt, to the tune of $25  billion. The hurricanes this year, together with the flooding across  Louisiana last year, have stretched the program beyond its breaking  point.   Unfortunately, this package will cause more harm than good for the  communities already struggling to rebuild. It will make flood insurance  more expensive for families by increasing premiums.   It also exempts businesses from the requirement to purchase flood  insurance even though the vast majority of policyholders with this  insurance only purchase it because they are required to by law. This  change would take effect beginning in January 2019.   The Independent Community Bankers and a number of other groups oppose  this provision. As businesses pull out of the insurance market and the  number of participating dwindles, responsible businesses that stay in  the market will be forced to bear the burden of greatly increased  premiums. I think these are shortsighted changes that will be felt all  across the insurance market.   Additionally, the legislation doesn't do enough to update the often  out-of-date flood insurance rate maps being used in communities across  the country and in my district. Accurate flood insurance maps prepared  with the most recent mapping technologies would help constituents in  all of our districts better prepare and protect themselves against  flooding. Some current maps are so outdated that the maps don't reflect  changing landscapes and critical flood mitigation improvements. This  bill simply falls short in helping homeowners who want to do the right  thing based off the best available information.   We are in the wake of some of the worst hurricanes our Nation has  ever experienced, and more of them. We are seeing how vital,  affordable, and readily available flood insurance is to so many  communities. It is unconscionable that the majority is moving forward  with this partisan package of bills, unlikely to ever pass the Senate,  because this will only further delay the extension of the program with  1 month left before it expires.   As the majority lurches from crisis to crisis and fritters away  precious legislative time with this partisan approach, we will likely  find ourselves right back here doing this over again in December.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream  Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help thousands of  young people who are Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the distinguished ranking  member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.  [[Page H9194]]                                     time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New York an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, let me yield myself 30 seconds because I  was very impressed, yesterday, with Mr. Graves and the thoughtful work  that he had done. I am sorry his amendments were not made in order, but  I appreciate very much his homework on this bill, and I agree with him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act isn't perfect.  Most notably, it blows past the caps implemented under the Budget  Control Act. But there are areas of common ground in this bill,  including a pay raise for our military and investments to fill the  genuine readiness gaps in our Armed Forces.   I want to point out that they are the result of something that is all  too often nonexistent under the majority, and that is regular order. I  agree with what my colleague said, to see a bill under regular order is  a downright joy. I hope we do more of it.   A hearing and a markup were held for this bill and colleagues from  both sides of the aisle were consulted. That is how the Chamber was  designed to function, but, today, it hardly functions like that at all.   It is a shame that we don't also see the majority put this model to  use for other major legislation like healthcare and tax reform, which  we will be rushing through to get to tomorrow.   This is a process that we didn't see for the other measure before us  today, which is H.R. 2874. No hearing was ever held on the package in  its entirety. It was changed right up until it was considered by the  Rules Committee earlier this week in an effort not to get Democrat  support, but to get enough support from Members of the majority so that  it could pass on a party-line vote.   That is what we see under this leadership: no hearings and rarely any  markups.   Legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would impact  one-sixth of our economy, was passed without so much as a score from  the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office outlining its impacts and  its costs.   This Congress has broken the record for the use of closed rules,  which prevents any amendments from being offered by either side on the  House floor. It is now the most closed Congress ever.   In fact, one of the rules before us right now is closed. We are even  likely to consider the majority's bipartisan tax plan this week-- actually, tomorrow--which would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion,  yet under another closed rule and without scoring.    The United States Congress has been called the greatest deliberative  body in the world. I think it is time the majority change course and  actually allow the great debates about the issues that we face. The  legislation we consider would certainly be better for it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, the rule,  and the bill; and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
