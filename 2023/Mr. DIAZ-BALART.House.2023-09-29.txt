 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 741, I  call up the bill (H.R. 5525) making continuing appropriations for  fiscal year 2024, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak on the Spending Reduction and Border  Security Act of 2024.   As we all know, the most basic duty that Congress has and must  complete every year is that constitutional power of Congress to fund  the Federal Government. This bill, Mr. Speaker, will provide funding to  keep our government open until October 31. Unless we act now, the  government will shut down at midnight on Saturday.   Let's be very clear, Mr. Speaker. The House has already passed four  appropriations bills, which constitute the majority of funding for our  government. Now, unfortunately, the Senate continues to sit on its  hands and has failed to pass any of them, any of them thus far.  Unfortunately, it is something that we have seen time and time again  from our friends across this building.   Mr. Speaker, the country is nearly $32.9 trillion in debt--that is  trillion with a t, Mr. Speaker--and our deficit this year is $1.9  trillion. The Biden administration has gone on a crazy, irresponsible  spending binge with money that we do not have to spend, money that is  borrowed mostly from Communist China. It is time. It is time. It is  time that we slow this out-of-control, unsustainable spending to a  level that is sustainable.   Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I was proud that the House of Representatives  passed the State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, one that I  was pleased and honored to lead that cut wasteful spending while making  crucial investments in our national security, all while the total cost  of that bill passed last night is way below fiscal year 2015 spending  levels. That bill that we passed will slow our spending by really  taking discretionary spending back to fiscal year 2022 overall.   Now, excluded from those reductions in this bill are any reductions  from defense, veterans, homeland security, and disaster relief. It is a  very important start and well overdue to fund our priorities, the  American people's priorities, but doing so in a responsible way that  does not bankrupt the American taxpayer.   Mr. Speaker, in addition, this bill provides flexibility to the  Department of Defense for new starts, but this bill does more than just  deal with our out-of-control spending, which it must. It will also help  the just inhumane tide at our southern border.   Mr. Speaker, our southern border is out of control. The Biden  administration has failed to even do the bare minimum to secure our  border. As I have  [[Page H4890]]  said before, Mr. Speaker, the irresponsible attitude of the Biden  administration when it comes to the southern border is beyond  negligence and incompetence. It also has fatal consequences.   In just the last few days, we have seen a surge at the border with an  average of over 9,000 apprehensions each and every day. This is  unsustainable. It is unthinkable, and I would add it is immoral.   Mr. Speaker, our border is out of control. Actually, no, let me  correct myself right here on the floor of the House, Mr. Speaker. No,  it is controlled now 100 percent by the narco-terrorist cartels on the  Mexican side of the border. That is who the administration has ceded  control of the southern border to. This crisis is only going to  continue to get worse and worse unless we act.                                time  1215    Earlier this year, the House approved the bill that I was honored to  lead, H.R. 2, the Border Security Act of 2023. As you know, Mr.  Speaker, this bill would make changes to our immigration policies that  would help reclaim control of the southern border.   I am proud to say that the Spending Reduction and Border Security Act  of 2024, which I am speaking about today, includes the Border Security  Act of 2023 already passed by this House.   This bill provides a solution. This bill that we are discussing now  provides a solution to keep the government open. This bill keeps the  government open and restrains the growth of government while giving us  an opportunity to continue negotiations on the appropriations bills.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the responsible thing.  Support this bill so that we can send it to the Senate and keep the  Federal Government open. That is what we are dealing with. That is what  the vote is about.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to do the right thing and  vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let's be very clear. We are going to  know shortly who wants to shut down the government and who wants to  keep it open because we are going to have a vote. In front of us today  is this resolution to keep the government open. I know there is going  to be a lot of talk, but we are going to have a vote. If you vote for  this resolution, it keeps the government open, and if you vote against  it, government shuts down Saturday night.   That is not too complicated. The American people are smart. They get  that. Out of all the talk we are going to hear, we will know on that  vote. If you vote for this resolution, you are voting to keep the  government open. If you vote against it, well, you are voting to shut  it down.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Natural  Resources.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington), the chairman of the Committee on the Budget.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleagues in the  House and the American people that last year, 900 immigrants died  trying to cross the border. That is not humane. That is insane, and  that we are not willing to look away and tolerate in the name of what?  No. That is what is intolerable.  [[Page H4892]]    I will not be lectured, Mr. Speaker, when 900 migrants died trying to  get to the United States, and when there are thousands of children who  are now missing that were supposed to be taken care of by the United  States Federal Government.   You don't hear about that. That is not humane. This legislation puts  an end to that insanity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the  chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I will remind everyone what we are  talking about today.   This keeps the government open. It secures the border, and it,  frankly, reduces wasteful spending. That is what we are dealing with  here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Donalds), a friend and neighbor of my district.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani), a Member whose life story symbolizes what the  American Dream is all about, and a member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), an author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).  [[Page H4896]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Molinaro).    Mr. Speaker, oh, so many words. Allow me, Mr.  Speaker, to cut to the chase. We have a choice right now.   Vote ``yes'' to keep the Federal Government open, to control  inflation-causing overspending, and to secure the southern border. That  is a ``yes'' vote, or vote ``no'' to shut down the Federal Government,  to keep the narco cartels in control of the southern border.   This is pretty simple. Government likes to complicate things. As  politicians, we like to try to obfuscate reality.   This is very simple. We have a choice. I ask our colleagues to do the  responsible thing; secure the border, stop out-of-control, inflation- causing spending, and, yes, keep the government open by voting ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
