 Mr. Speaker, as I speak, unprecedented  tsunamis of illegal aliens swamp Customs and Border Patrol resources on  America's porous southern border with Mexico.   What is the socialist Democrat response to this dangerous, life- threatening invasion? Today, they help make our border security crisis  worse by pushing legislation that gives illegal aliens amnesty that, in  turn, entices even more illegal aliens to cross our border.   What is the result of past socialist Democrat amnesty efforts? In the  first half of fiscal year 2019, the number of illegal alien family  units captured by Border Patrol roughly tripled over the previous year.  Worst yet, the number of captured illegal aliens topped 100,000 in each  of March and April. Further, the number of illegal alien caravans has  skyrocketed from two in fiscal year 2017, to 13 in fiscal year 2018, to  104 large illegal alien caravans of 100 or more individuals, totaling  17,242 illegal alien captures in just the first 6 months of fiscal year  2019.   Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost recently testified to the Senate  that, ``Our apprehension numbers are off the charts. . . . We cannot  address this crisis by simply shifting more resources or building more  facilities. It is like holding a bucket under a faucet. It doesn't  matter how many buckets you give me if we can't turn off the flow.''   Thanks to socialist Democrats' betrayals of the American people, the  crisis is not just centered on illegal aliens from Mexico and Central  America. For the first time ever, on May 31, Border Patrol agents  captured a large caravan of illegal aliens from Africa, including  places like Angola, Cameroon, and Congo. Also, on May 31, Border Patrol  agents captured the largest group of illegal aliens ever captured at  one place: 1,036 illegal aliens at the El Paso, Texas, border.   Let me be very clear: Illegal alien amnesty only begets and  encourages more lawless illegal alien conduct.   Socialist Democrats' callous disregard for American citizens plagued  by illegal aliens demonstrates just how radical socialist Democrats  have become. However, if you understand the underlying reason for the  socialist Democrats' dangerous open borders policies, the inaction and  callousness make sense.    About 70 percent of households with an illegal alien in them live off  welfare and on the backs of American taxpayers. Since illegal aliens  are heavily dependent on welfare, once they get the amnesty and the  American citizenship socialist Democrats desperately seek to bestow,  that makes them reliable socialist Democrat voters. After all,  socialist Democrats are the party for taking much-needed money from  hardworking American taxpayers to pay for welfare for those who prefer  to vote for a living rather than work for one.   Quite frankly, socialist Democrats don't give one twit about the  thousands of dead Americans who die each year because of illegal alien  homicides. Socialist Democrats care not one twit about American blood  on their hands. Socialist Democrats covet political power, and they see  open borders, amnesty, and illegal aliens voting as the way to get it.   That is why so many socialist Democrat cities, like San Francisco,  are passing laws that allow illegal aliens to register to vote, and  vote, in American elections, regardless of how badly this denies  American citizens control over their own governments.   This insult to American voters is so astonishing, it deserves  repeating. Socialist Democrat cities, like San Francisco, are passing  laws that allow illegal aliens to register to vote, and vote, in  American elections, regardless of how badly this denies American  citizens control over their own governments.   Mr. Speaker, I yearn for the day that socialist Democrats put the  interests of American citizens above the interests of illegal aliens,  above the socialist Democrats' craving for political power.  Unfortunately, that day is not today.                            ____________________
