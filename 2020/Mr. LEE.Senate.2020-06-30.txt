 Madam President, I come to the floor wanting to discuss a  case called June Medical Services v. Russo. This was a decision  announced by the Supreme Court of the United States yesterday.   This is a decision that hasn't gotten as much attention as many cases  that go before the Supreme Court. It is, nonetheless, a significant  decision, and it is a decision that, I believe, is deeply flawed and  betrays many of the legal and constitutional principles that the  Supreme Court of the United States purports to apply and is supposed to  be bound by as it decides cases and controversies properly brought  before its jurisdiction.   The June Medical Services case involved the constitutionality of a  statute enacted by the Louisiana Legislature, known as Act 620. The  legislation in question required any doctor performing abortions within  Louisiana to hold active admitting privileges at a hospital within 30  miles of the location of the abortion clinic in question. The Act then  defined what it meant to have acting admitting privileges, and it did  so in terms of a reference to the ability to admit a patient and to  provide diagnostic and surgical services to such patient. It is  understandable why the State of Louisiana or any State might want to  consider adopting such legislation.   I want to be very clear at the outset that this case did not involve  any legislation prohibiting abortion. In fact, there is nothing about  Act 620 that made abortions illegal in Louisiana nor is there anything  about Act 620 that would have made it practically impossible or really  difficult for people to obtain an abortion. That is not what it did. It  simply acknowledged the fact that an abortion is a type of surgical  medical procedure and, in taking into account the fact that it is a  medical procedure, is sometimes fraught with medical peril that can  sometimes result in people getting hurt and people having to go to the  hospital and that it might be helpful in those circumstances to have  the person who performed the procedure have admitting privileges at a  hospital within 30 miles of the abortion clinic.   The constitutionality of the law was challenged in a lawsuit brought  by five abortion clinics and four abortion providers in Louisiana. Now,  they challenged the law in Federal district court, and they did so  before the act even took effect, arguing that it was unconstitutional  because it imposed an undue burden on their patients' right to obtain  abortions. The abortion clinics and the medical providers at issue--the  doctors and the clinics that challenged it--were quite significantly  not arguing that these were their own constitutional rights that were  being impaired. They were, instead, arguing that they had standing,  that they had the ability to stand in the shoes of those who were among  their patients, those whom they served.   So I would like to talk about three critical features of this  decision and why I think the decision was wrong in all three respects.   First, let's talk about this standing issue that I alluded to just a  moment ago. The concept of standing is rooted in article III of the  Constitution. Article III is the part of the Constitution that  establishes the judicial branch and sets up the Supreme Court and such  inferior courts as Congress might choose to create. Significantly,  neither article III nor any other provision of the Constitution gives  the courts the authority to make law, to decide policy, or even, for  that matter, to announce what the law is or says or should say at any  moment unless, of course, there is a case or a controversy before the  court.   What that means is that a court cannot issue an advisory opinion. In  our Federal court system, the courts have the power to decide actual  conflicts, disputes, cases, or controversies between one or more  parties who happen to disagree as to the meaning of a particular  provision of Federal statutory or constitutional law. Without that type  of case or controversy, the court lacks jurisdiction. So, even though  this isn't a concept that nonlawyers employ in day-to-day conversation,  it is something that lawyers in America and judges, particularly  Federal judges and lawyers who practice before Federal courts, are  familiar with.   The concept of standing acknowledges that, with very few exceptions  not relevant in this context, a party may not sue on behalf of or in  order to address an injury sustained by a third party. In order to have  standing in Federal court, you have to have an injury in fact--that is  concrete and particularized, that is sustained by the plaintiff, that  is fairly traceable to the conduct of the defendant--and the conduct at  issue must be capable of being remedied by a judicial order within the  court's jurisdiction. Without those elements being present, you can't  have standing. Without standing, you can't have a case or a  controversy, and the court has no jurisdiction   It is well established that, within the Federal court system, this  standing inquiry is what we call part of the court's judiciary  doctrine, meaning it is a threshold inquiry that determines  jurisdiction. As a result, it can be raised at any moment by any party.  It can be, and sometimes will be, addressed by the court acting sua  sponte, meaning, regardless of whether any of the parties raises it. It  cannot be waived. As a result, at any stage of the litigation--whether  at the trial court, at the appellate court, or at the Supreme Court of  the United States--it can be raised by any party or any member of the  judiciary sitting in that case.   It is significant that in this 5-to-4 ruling, in an oddly configured  plurality opinion of four Justices--Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan,  and Sotomayor--being united in a single plurality opinion and joined by  Chief Justice Roberts in a concurring opinion, they cobbled together a  conclusion that it was just fine for the court to act in this  circumstance, notwithstanding the fact that the doctors and the  abortion clinics in this case were not even arguing that their own  constitutional rights were being impaired. This is significant. This is  stunning, in fact. They are asserting the constitutional rights and the  alleged injuries of third parties.   Now, in other circumstances, one might imagine a scenario in which  you might have someone coming before the court, claiming to be the  executor of somebody's estate or, perhaps, the legal guardian of a  juvenile or of a person who had been deemed incapacitated. In those  circumstances, that person has standing, but the standing belongs to  the person suffering the injury. It is just allowed to be asserted by  the third person standing in that person's place. That is not what we  had here. Neither in the complaint nor in any of the moving papers did  any of the plaintiffs argue--that is the clinics and the abortion  providers in question--that its own constitutional rights were being  impaired. They instead asserted impairment of the rights of third  parties not before the court, of would-be patients whom they might  have.   The lack of standing in this case is apparent, and the lack of  standing was glossed over by this cobbled-together combination of the  four-member plurality and Chief Justice Roberts. The plurality glossed  over it and, in part, suggested that the standing issue might not have  mattered because, perhaps, it was not an argument that was properly  raised before the district court. Yet any first-year law student in any  American law school, let alone a Federal judge or a Supreme Court  Justice, knows that standing isn't waivable. It is a threshold  jurisdictional question, and, as such, it cannot  [[Page S4011]]  be waived. It is never waived. It is always a live, relevant,  legitimate question, one that can be raised sua sponte by the Court  itself.   In his dissent, Justice Alito acknowledged this point and explained  it well with the following words:         Neither waiver nor stare decisis can justify this holding,       which clashes with our general rule on third-party standing.       And the idea that a regulated party can invoke the right of a       third party for the purpose of attacking legislation enacted       to protect the third party is stunning. Given the apparent       conflict of interest, that concept would be rejected out of       hand in a case not involving abortion.   The conflict of interest to which Justice Alito is referring refers  to the fact that you have got here, on the one hand, a State regulating  a particular act--here, abortion providers, clinics, and physicians who  perform abortions. That entity, like any other entity that is otherwise  going to be regulated, has an interest in being not regulated.   It makes it easier, perhaps cheaper, perhaps more lucrative for that  entity, for those providers, to be in that business if they are less  regulated. It makes it easier for them to do what they do and perhaps  more profitable if they don't have to have admitting privileges at a  hospital within 30 miles of the location of the abortion clinic.   That is very different than the potential interest of their patients.  Their patients have exactly the opposite interest. Their patients have  the interest in making sure that the abortion provider provides for a  safe, healthy environment in which adequate care can be provided to the  patient, such that as complications arise, the doctor can take the  patient to a hospital and, with those admitting privileges, can go  about setting in order the course of treatment that needs to be  pursued.   And so Justice Alito's point was simply that, in this circumstance,  you have a completely different set of interests, some that are being  advanced by abortion providers, some that the State holds, and some  that the patient holds. They are separate; they are distinct; and here,  really, they are at odds with each other.   So Justice Alito went on to explain:         This case features a blatant conflict of interest between       an abortion provider and its patients. Like any other       regulated entity, an abortion provider has a financial       interest in avoiding burdensome regulations such as Act 620's       admitting privileges requirement. . . . Women seeking       abortions, on the other hand, have an interest in the       preservation of regulations that protect their health. The       conflict inherent in such a situation is glaring.    So with this circumstance, the plaintiffs did not have standing. They  didn't even assert the prerogative of asserting the rights of  themselves. They didn't claim that they themselves had injuries that  were constitutionally cognizable in court.   They instead said that they were asserting them on behalf of an  injury that would be suffered, and had not yet arisen, on the part of  their patients, and that is a problem.   So the Supreme Court, as far as I can tell, based on the time that I  have spent reviewing the decision, the Supreme Court abandoned its  ordinary standards and applied a different standard here so as to make  it easier for this group of plaintiffs to raise a constitutional  challenge.   Madam President, I see the majority leader has entered the Chamber,  and I ask unanimous consent for permission to be able to continue my  remarks after the majority leader has conducted his business, as if  without interruption.    Madam President, that was the first error that I think  deserves to be mentioned in this context--the error apparent in the  fact that the Supreme Court ignored the fact that the plaintiffs before  the Court lacked standing. They just glossed over this issue. Why?  Well, because it involves abortion, and I guess abortion is different.   The explanation provided by the plurality and by the Chief Justice-- understanding that in order to form a majority, sometimes you have to  cobble together a concurring opinion with a plurality opinion, and that  is what happened here.   Their analysis on the standing issue in this case simply doesn't  wash. It doesn't add up. In fact, I believe it defies what every first- year law student is taught in American law schools. It doesn't work.   Secondly, this draws attention to another problem with the Court's  jurisprudence in this area. When abortion is treated differently than  other things, it leads to a fair amount of tail-chasing by the Court  because the Court has stepped in--starting with Roe v. Wade and  continuing with Casey and the other cases since then on this topic--the  Court has stepped in essentially as a superlegislative body, and it has  attempted to set out a rule saying that you can't undermine what the  Court has declared to be a right to access abortion.   So let's set aside, for a moment, that question of what we would be  looking at if we were dealing with a law prohibiting abortion, but this  isn't that. Again, this was a law, Act 620, adopted by the Louisiana  State Legislature that simply required that doctors and clinics  performing abortions be run by doctors having admitting privileges at a  hospital within 30 miles.   It is not an abortion ban. It is just a public health and safety  regulation of the same sort that you might see in effect with respect  to surgical centers or other outpatient treatment clinics throughout  that State.   And so, nonetheless, you have got Roe v. Wade and its progeny in  which the Supreme Court has stepped in, basically, as a  superlegislative body saying you can't impose too heavy of a burden on  a woman's access to or ability to obtain an abortion.   The problem with that is there is nothing in the Constitution that  says that. There is nothing in the Constitution that makes this a  Federal issue. There is nothing in the Constitution that takes what is  essentially a legislative judgment; namely, the legality or  [[Page S4012]]  lack thereof of a particular medical procedure and makes it a question  not only of Federal constitutional law but of Federal constitutional  law that can be written and then addressed and then allowed to evolve  solely within the hermetically sealed chamber of the Supreme Court of  the United States.   This is what produces this kind of tail-chasing. This is what  produces this nonsense, and it is also, by the way, what produces a  whole lot of the political vitriol and venom surrounding the Federal  judiciary.   Why? Well, because they exercised will instead of judgment. What do I  mean by that? Well, in Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton referred  to the difference between what lawmakers do and what judges do. In the  legislative branch, they exercise what Hamilton referred to as  ``will,'' meaning they decide what the law should be. They adopt  policy. They say: We think the law should say x, and they have the  ability to do that. Under our system of government, article I gives the  lawmaking power, the power to engage in exercises of will, to the  legislative branch.   Judgment, by contrast, is what is wielded by the judicial branch.  Judgment asks not what should be but what is and, most notably, what  has been. It looks, as it were, in the rearview mirror, looking at what  the law said as of a particular moment in time.   So it is the job of the jurist not to say what the law should be but,  instead, to say what the law is and only when the question of what the  law is comes properly before the court's jurisdiction in cases or  controversies between multiple litigants properly before the court's  jurisdiction.   And so Hamilton explained in Federalist 78 that there is a difference  between will and judgment and that you don't ever want the judicial  branch exercising will.   Well, why? Because, among other things, it is not their job. Judges  are appointed in our Federal system for life so long as they are on  good behavior. They are not subject to elections, ever. You don't get  elected to get on the court; you don't get elected to stay on the  court. You are on there for life.   Why? Well, because your job is a relatively limited one. It looks  only in the rearview mirror. Your job is not to set policy but to  interpret in very narrow circumstances.   In this circumstance, in Roe v. Wade and its progeny, the Supreme  Court stepped in and exercised will. As a result, they have taken  decisions away from lawmakers--State and Federal lawmakers alike--for  decades.   This has had the predictable result of making a lot of people unhappy  at every point along the political continuum--every single point.   Why? Well, because they exercise will instead of judgment. They  exercise legislative jurisdiction rather than judicial discretion.   Justice Thomas, in his dissenting opinion in June Medical Services v.  Russo, said, referring to Roe v. Wade and its progeny:         [T]hose decisions created the right to abortion out of       whole cloth, without a shred of support from the       Constitution's text. Our abortion precedents are grievously       wrong and should be overruled.    Justice Thomas wrote in a separate passage, explaining that ``Roe is  grievously wrong for many reasons, but the most fundamental is that its  core holding--that the Constitution protects a woman's right to abort  her unborn child--finds no support in the text of the 14th Amendment.''   So we see that the Court was wrong in pretending that the plaintiffs  in that case, not patients, not women who wanted to seek abortions but  couldn't, but doctors and clinics who have an interest potentially  adverse to their own patients who didn't want to be regulated, were  allowed to assert standing as if it were their constitutional injury  that were at stake, and it was not. The Court went on to compound the  problem by continuing to apply the statutory, effectively legislative,  proscriptive framework of Roe and its progeny, which itself finds no  support--not in the Constitution, not in Federal statute, not in 400  years of Anglo-American judicial precedent, not in common law. They  just made it up, and they said it is important. We, therefore, deem it  to be part of the Constitution. These are the first two errors.    There is a third error I want to call out from the Supreme Court's  unfortunate and very wrong ruling in June Medical Services v. Russo.  The third category of error that is built into this decision relates to  the standard by which a court deems something unconstitutional.  Separate and apart from the standing issue, separate and apart from the  fact that Roe was a made-up doctrine, there is also a problem in that  the Court didn't approach this constitutional question the same way  that it is supposed to address all other constitutional questions.   Under a well-worn line of cases, including a case called United  States v. Salerno, the Supreme Court, with only very rare exceptions-- not relevant, not present here--does not declare a statute facially  unconstitutional unless that statute is alleged and proven to have been  unconstitutional in all of its potential applications.   Let's break that down into more common language. You can't just walk  into court and say that a particular law is categorically  unconstitutional; you have to wait until that law is unconstitutionally  applied to you. That is called an as-applied challenge. As-applied  challenges are the norm, the rule, and they are the default. In almost  all cases, that is how you get something deemed unconstitutional, is  through an as-applied challenge; that is, the Court doesn't just strike  it down in its entirety.   But it is striking down the law in its entirety that the Court did  here--that the Court was asked to do here and that the Court, in fact,  did here under circumstances in which the law had not even yet been  implemented and had never been enforced--not once. They didn't even  wait to see if it could be or would be or might be implemented in a  manner consistent with the text and history and structure of the U.S.  Constitution. They just walked in and said: The whole thing is  unconstitutional. Get rid of it.   Why is that a problem? It does matter. It matters because ours is a  system of rules and laws. It is based on the constitutional text. Yes,  precedent factors into it, but precedent can't be the inexorable  command.   In any event, precedent here went the other way with respect to the  standard by which you deem something unconstitutional in all of its  applications.   As Justice Gorsuch explained in his separate dissent, ``In effect,  the standard for facial challenges has been flipped on its head: Rather  than requiring that a law be unconstitutional in all of its  applications to fall, today's decision requires that Louisiana's law be  constitutional in all of its applications [in order] to stand.''   In other words, as Justice Gorsuch explained, they applied a  completely different set of rules here. Why? Well, simply because this  involves abortion, and abortion is different. Somehow abortion-- notwithstanding the fact that it makes no appearance in the  Constitution--somehow abortion is treated differently. Now abortion is  treated differently even in this separate line of cases, even in this  separate line of precedents dealing with facial challenges versus as- applied challenges.   If, in fact, the Supreme Court is going to stick to stare decisis,  the principle invoked over and over and over again in that frankly  awful decision yesterday, for which the Court should be ashamed, stare  decisis is the principle that basically says: We as a court, once we  have decided something one way, are going to continue to follow that  precedent most of the time unless we really really don't want to.   That is, in essence, what stare decisis means. They invoked stare  decisis over and over and over again in that case and said that is just  how it had to be because, well, stare decisis requires that.   Well, they didn't follow stare decisis. They didn't follow their own  precedent when it comes to their standing docket. They didn't follow  their own precedent. They didn't adhere to stare decisis when it comes  to United States vs. Salerno. They utterly ignored the fact that this  is a case in which the statute invalidated by the Supreme Court of the  United States yesterday is capable of being applied in a fully  constitutional manner.   By the way, they made a number of assertions about the factual record  of the case and about the effect of Louisiana's Act 620 that are simply  wrong.  [[Page S4013]]  They invalidated this law by saying: Look, the Louisiana Legislature  claims that this Act 620 was put in place in order to protect women's  health. We don't really think that is the case. We don't think they  have met that standard here.   First of all, in doing that, they ignored precedent applicable in  literally every other scenario in which they defer substantially to the  determinations of a legislative body in deciding whether the law that  they are passing in fact will have the effect that they want,  especially in an area like public health and safety. They ignored the  fact that they had abundant testimony before the Louisiana Legislature  supporting the basis for what they were doing.   In Justice Gorsuch's dissent, he referred to multiple pieces of  information before the legislature. He pointed out that one woman  testified that while she was in an abortion clinic after having a  procedure and she was hemorrhaging, her abortion provider told her: You  are on your own. Get out.   Eventually, the woman went to the hospital, where an emergency room  physician removed fetal body parts that the abortion provider had  recklessly left in her body.   Another patient who complained of severe pain following her abortion  was told simply to go home and lie down.   In another case, a clinic physician allowed a patient to bleed for 3  hours even though a clinic employee testified that the physician would  not let her call 911 because of a possible media involvement. In the  end, that employee at that clinic called 911 anyway, and emergency room  personnel, upon the arrival of that patient, discovered that the  patient had a perforated uterus and, as a result, needed a hysterectomy   A different physician, speaking to the Louisiana State Legislature in  connection with their deliberations on Act 620, explained that she  routinely treats abortion complications in the emergency room when the  physician who performed the abortion lacks admitting privileges. In the  experience of that physician, ``The situation puts a woman's health at  an unnecessary unacceptable risk that results from a delay of care and  a lack of continuity of care.''   It was on this basis that the Louisiana State Legislature concluded  that having admitting privileges would help to contain these risks and  help protect women because a physician--the same physician who  performed that procedure, if he or she has admitting privileges in a  hospital within 30 miles of the abortion clinic in question, would be  the physician in the very best position to treat that patient.   So, yes, could reasonable minds reach different conclusions as to the  exact set of regulations applicable to an abortion clinic or any other  type of healthcare clinic? You bet. There are a lot of ways to get at  the same issue. There are a lot of ways to protect human health and  safety. It is not the job of the Supreme Court of the United States to  decide exactly how those laws are written in Louisiana. And make no  mistake--that is what the Supreme Court did here. They might as well  have removed their robes and pretended simply to be lawmakers. What  they are doing is that blatant, and it is very wrong.   There is, moreover, a connection between this logical disconnect that  I refer to and the fact that the standing analysis that I alluded to  earlier shows something else that the Supreme Court did wrong. This  shows that the very same concerns that the Louisiana Legislature had on  behalf of the patients--the would-be victims of medical malpractice at  many of these abortion clinics--are concerns that were not present  before the Court. They were not represented among the plaintiffs in  that case. That is yet another reason why the Supreme Court of the  United States acted lawlessly, in a shameful manner, in the June  Medical Services case.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we received  this 125-page bill yesterday evening. I have great appreciation and  respect for my colleague, the Senator from Washington, and yet I can't  look at this 125-page bill we saw for the first time yesterday evening  without thinking that hardly enough time has passed since this  legislation was introduced to even read the bill, let alone to mark it  up in committee or bring it up on the Senate floor and have it passed  here.   Even though Congress has acted to provide emergency assistance in  response to the current global pandemic, this legislation includes  significant additional spending for a number of programs that have not  been debated in the Senate. This bill would also create at least one  new program, and I say ``at least,'' because, again, we are still  trying to figure out what is in it. It creates at least one new  program, the Community College and Industry Partnership Grants Program.  I am sure this would do a number of good things, but, again, this thing  is not ready for prime time. This program is, as far as I can tell,  largely duplicative of existing programs. This legislation would  provide $2 billion for it anyway.   A bill of this length and a bill that provides for billions of  dollars in new spending should not--I would hope would never--be passed  this quickly. The Senate should take the time to thoroughly weigh the  changes proposed in this legislation. Therefore, on behalf of Senator  Alexander and myself, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, reasonable  efforts to protect those working on the frontlines in the middle of a  public health crisis should certainly be applied.   There are many individuals across the country steadfastly fulfilling  their occupational duties to care for and otherwise help those who have  the coronavirus. It is important that those individuals take  precautions for their safety and for the safety of other people who  happen to be around them. However, the bill under consideration, the  bill that is the subject of this unanimous consent request, poses  several problems.   First of all, it does not respect the fact that States, localities,  and businesses are far better suited than the Federal Government to  determine what safety standards might be needed. Instead, the  legislation forces State governments to adjust their current plans to  protect workers to meet standards determined by some administrative  bureaucracy in Washington.   This action is burdensome, and a one-size-fits-all approach to  protecting healthcare workers on the frontlines will not work. The  reason it will not work is that our frontlines differ across the  Nation. States must be permitted the flexibility to enact their own  standards based on the needs of each State.   Further, the temporary protection standards for the bill are not  truly temporary. They are described as such, but they are not, as the  bill calls for permanent standards to be made based on the initially  temporary standards to be determined by OSHA.   Finally, the bill broadly subjects all employees at risk of  occupational exposure to the emergency standards to be promulgated by  OSHA. This means that potentially every worker in every industry could  be subjected to these requirements even though each industry has its  own unique challenges that need to be addressed. So this broad-brush  approach could limit the ability of certain individuals to work during  this time even though they might actually be in a good position to do  so safely.   It is critically important for our healthcare workers to be protected  in a time of crisis, but the most effective way to accomplish that is  by continuing to allow States, localities, healthcare facilities, and  businesses to set safety standards and to ensure that those who can  safely work have the ability to do so. Therefore, on behalf of Senator  Alexander and myself, I object.    Mr. President, it is with sadness, concern, and deep  disappointment that I come to the floor to acknowledge something very  unfortunate that happened just last night in my own hometown of Provo,  UT. A group of people were gathered in downtown Provo to protest, to  express concern over matters important to them.   At one moment, a car approached University Avenue, preparing to turn  right on to Center Street. As that car approached, the car was  surrounded by people who were engaged in acts of protests. The car  tried to pull through the intersection very slowly, being cautious, and  not to move into anyone.   The protesters continued to gather around the car. In the middle of  all of this, the driver of that car was shot--was shot--by one of the  protesters who was armed, who, according to the video that I saw,  looked right into the vehicle and shot into the passenger side window  with a gun.   According to eyewitness accounts, after the driver then pulled away  from the intersection, trying to get away, the person with the gun  fired yet again as the driver was driving away. Moments later, the  driver arrived at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, seeking medical  attention. My thoughts and prayers are with that victim and the  victim's family   I am saddened that we have to be having this conversation at all, but  it is something that has come to so many communities around America.  These are protests, in some cases, turning into riots that have visited  communities--urban and rural and suburban alike.   In many instances, people have come to those protests in order to  vocalize concerns that they have with their government--concerns,  perhaps, about law enforcement policy or personnel. In some cases, some  protests have been carried out without violence and without incident.   A few weeks ago, I came to the floor of the U.S. Senate to talk about  one such gathering in Ogden, UT, where people gathered to express their  objections to what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis about a  month ago. They did so in the immediate wake of the killing of a police  officer in Ogden. They dual-tracked their expressions of emotion and of  concern, expressing support and appreciation to the fallen officer who  had given his life enforcing the law and trying to protect his fellow  Utahns, his fellow American, his fellow residents of Ogden, while at  the same time protesting against what happened to George Floyd in  Minneapolis.   They protested in a way that reflected well on this country, on the  city of Ogden, and on the State of Utah. They left with not a scrap of  trash left in the streets. Perhaps far more importantly, they left the  scene without having harmed anyone or anything, without destroying  property.   Yes, the American people have the right peaceably to assemble and to  express their views without fear of retribution from their government.  But, no, that does not encompass the right to harm other people, and,  no, that does not encompass the right to engage in acts of lawlessness,  whether for the purpose of destroying property or life simply because  one is concerned about something.   This violence has to stop. This isn't who we are. It is important  also to remember that whenever we voice concern about something in  government, we remember that you can't expand government without  strengthening government--the same government entity that provides law  enforcement officers, the same government entity that collects taxes,  that runs any government program. So we do have to keep in mind exactly  what it is that we want.   There are many instances that I have observed as a lawyer, as a  former prosecutor, and as a citizen in which police authority has been  abused. I unequivocally condemn all such abuses. That is the very  reason we have a Constitution in place to limit the power of  government, of individual officials running them--government entities.   When you send law enforcement in to address a particular situation,  you are not doing that for the purpose of persuasion; you do it for the  purpose of force. That is the one tool that government has that is  uniquely government's. It has the power of force. It is official,  collective force. That is what government is.   I hope and I expect that our conversations about this will focus on  how force is used by government--where it ought to be entrusted in  government, where it shouldn't. I hope, also, we can look to any of the  true underlying causes of some of these abuses.   I hope and expect that we can address why on Earth was it that the  man who killed George Floyd apparently had 17 complaints filed against  him without formal disciplinary action ever having been taken against  him. Why and how did this happen? What sort of cabal was it that was  protecting him from discipline?   I hope and expect that we can have those conversations, but I hope  and expect that we as a country can come together in condemning  violence--lawless violence in all of its forms. Whether it is against  persons or property or a combination of the two, we are better than  that. Don't dress it up in the flag. It doesn't belong there. Don't  dress it up in the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects our  right peaceably to vocalize our concerns, peaceably to assemble--not  lawlessly and, certainly, not violently.   If this can happen in Provo, it can happen anywhere. You don't want  it to happen in your community, not in any community. I hope and expect  that in the coming days we can come together as a Senate and adopt  sense of the Senate legislation unequivocally condemning violence  undertaken in a lawless fashion. Regardless of the motivation of those  involved in it, it is wrong, and it must never be tolerated--not in  this country, not on our watch.   I yield the floor.
