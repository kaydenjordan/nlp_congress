 Mr. Speaker, January 22 marks the 47th anniversary of the  United States Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade. On that day, in a  historic moment of judicial overreach and without legislative action,  the Supreme Court declared abortion legal in our country. Since then 61  million babies have been robbed of their right to life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.   Today we know much more than we did when Roe v. Wade was handed down.  Decades of scientific advancements have revealed much about the  development and vitality of the unborn child. We know, for example,  beyond any shadow of a doubt that unborn babies feel and react to pain  at just 20 weeks, which means, yes, they do feel the pain of an  abortion.   Fetal heart rate monitors and 3D ultrasounds are commonly used by  expectant mothers today. The use of this technology was very limited in  1973, but now we know that the sounds of heartbeats and images of a  moving baby reveal one thing to us, and that is life. Continued  scientific discovery and the technological advancements have only  strengthened the case that the life of a child yet to be born is  precious.   I do believe that everyone has a right to life and equal protection  under the law. Thomas Jefferson once said: ``Indeed I tremble for my  country when I reflect that God is just, that His justice cannot sleep  forever.''   I pray for God's mercy on this Nation. And I pray that we in this  Chamber and those across our Nation will continue to work together to  end this injustice.
