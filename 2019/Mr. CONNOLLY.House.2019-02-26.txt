 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 145,  the rule providing for consideration of the Bipartisan Background  Checks Act of 2019 (H.R. 8) and the Enhanced Background Checks Act of  2019 (H.R. 1112).   These critical bills would ensure that there is a comprehensive  background check on every firearm purchase, something that 97 percent  of American voters, including 97 percent of gun-owning households,  support.   H.R. 8 requires background checks on all firearm sales, including  those conducted by unlicensed gun sellers, closing what has become  known as the ``gun show loophole.''   H.R. 1112 closes another loophole in current statute that allows gun  dealers to transfer a firearm after three business days if they have  not received a definitive response from the background check system.   Tragically, this gap became known as the ``Charleston loophole'' when  it contributed to the brutal murder of nine people at the Emanuel  African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in 2015.   Congress must act immediately on the ABCs of gun violence prevention.   A is for Assault Weapons Ban.   B is for Background Checks Reform.   C is for Closing the Gun Show Loophole.   These measures make progress on B and C, and I urge my colleagues to  support them.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment printed in section 5 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in part A of       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution if offered by Representative Lesko of Arizona or a       designee. That amendment shall be debatable for 10 minutes       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent.        Sec. 5. The amendment referred to in section 4 is as       follows:        Page 3, line 17, strike ``or''.        Page 4, line 15, strike the period and insert ``; or''.        Page 4, after line 15, insert the following:        ``(G) a transfer to a victim of domestic violence or sexual       assault who is to be protected under an order of protection       issued by a court of law.''.
