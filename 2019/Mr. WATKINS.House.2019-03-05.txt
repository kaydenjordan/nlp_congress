 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to encourage the President to  sign into law S. 47, the bipartisan lands package, which includes my  legislation protecting the Fort Scott National Historic Site in Kansas.   My first piece of legislation, the Fort Scott National Historic Site  Boundary Modification Act preserves the legacy of the fort's role in  the American frontier. This legislation solidifies the community's  contribution to supporting the Union during the Civil War.   Known locally as Lunette Blair, this antique structure is the sole  remaining blockhouse that helped repel the Confederate invasion into  eastern Kansas. It is only through the stewardship of the Fort Scott  community that this blockhouse still stands.   I thank my colleagues in the Kansas delegation for joining me in this  heritage mission for southeast Kansas.                            ____________________
