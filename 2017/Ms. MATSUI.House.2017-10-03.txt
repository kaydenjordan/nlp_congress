 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1539, the Early  Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2017, which I coauthored with  my colleague, Congressman Guthrie.  [[Page H7697]]    The Newborn Hearing Screening and Intervention Program established  almost 2 decades ago has been life-changing for those born deaf or hard  of hearing. A member of my staff in Sacramento, Devin, was born hard of  hearing but didn't receive a screening at birth. For the first few  years of her life, she appeared to be struggling to keep up with her  peers.   It wasn't until Devin reached the middle of kindergarten that her  teacher suggested she get her hearing tested. After receiving her  diagnosis, Devin's family was able to seek out tools and resources to  help her catch up to her classmates in school.   Devin's story illustrates the importance of early detection and  intervention. We know that a child's development in the first few years  of their life can have a major impact on their well-being later on.   By extending this program through our legislation, we are ensuring  that infants continue to have access to hearing screenings at birth so  their parents can make informed choices about their care and management  early on.   We have come so far in increasing the number of babies who are  screened every year. By passing this legislation, we are continuing  that progress.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Guthrie, for his  leadership on this issue, and I ask for everyone's support.
