 Madam Speaker, on June 1, 2020, America lost a football  legend. Pat Dye was a player, coach, administrator, and, most  importantly, a dear friend.   Coach Dye's ties to the 12th District of Georgia run deep, as he was  born and raised in Blythe, Georgia.   He started his football career at Richmond Academy as captain of the  team that won a State championship there. He went on to play at the  University of Georgia, where he was a two-time All-American.   Coach Dye was most known for his work transforming the Auburn  University football team, where he served as Auburn's head coach from  1981 to 1992 and as athletic director from 1981 to 1991.   As the only Auburn alumnus currently serving in Congress, what a  privilege it is for me to stand here on the House floor and enter into  the Congressional Record Coach Dye's amazing record, which includes  four SEC championship wins, including three straight from 1987 to 1989.   He led Auburn to three Sugar Bowls and finished in the top 10 five  times, including four straight seasons, from 1986 to 1989. So it was no  surprise that he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as  a coach in 2005.  [[Page H2979]]    He fought the good fight. He leaves an incredible legacy, not only at  Auburn, but as a great mentor and coach to thousands of young men on  the football field.   Thank you, Coach and War Eagle.                            ____________________
