 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of May  as National Mental Health Awareness Month, an important time to share  resources for individuals and families that cope with any number of  mental health challenges, because about 1 in 5 Americans experience  mental illness, and 1 in 25 struggle with a serious mental health  condition.   Serious mental health illnesses are now costing Americans nearly $200  billion in lost earnings each year, and 16 million Americans have had  at least one major depressive episode in the last year. That is why it  is more important than ever to ensure that people and individuals who  need help are able to get it.   The good news is that now individuals in need of help can call a 24- hour national help line, operated by the Substance Abuse and Mental  Health Services Administration, for a confidential conversation. Mr.  Speaker, it may be the difference between life or death for someone who  is in need                            ____________________
