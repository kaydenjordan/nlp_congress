 Madam President, it has been nearly 7 months since  President Trump took office. He was sworn in on the steps of the  Capitol on January 20.   Our colleagues across the aisle have had, frankly, more than enough  time to come to terms with the election results. Unfortunately, they  seem to be channeling their disappointment through the confirmation  process by engaging in an unprecedented level of obstruction.   We spent all this week when the Senate could do no other business on  the executive calendar than to confirm three nominees--three nominees  of about 500 that need to be appointed by the President. They are there  only because the President would want them there. They come and go as  Presidents come and go. Many of them have gone. The problem is that  their replacements haven't been there.   If there is any doubt as to just how unprecedented this drawn-out  confirmation process has been, let's look at how it stacks up against  the previous administration. We are only a couple of weeks away from  August, and Senate Democrats have only allowed us to confirm 52 of  President Trump's 216 nominees. That is 24 percent. By the August  recess of President Obama's first term, the Senate had confirmed 313 of  his 454 nominations, or 69 percent.   So we start out with an incredibly slow start, where previous  administrations--both the Bush administration and the Obama  administration--by the end of the first week, or often by the end of  the first day, had most of their Cabinet confirmed.   Getting a Cabinet confirmed is a process that took every minute of  time that the Senate rules could possibly be stretched to allow.   Then, we look at nominations. The President, as I said, has nominated  216 people. Less than one out of four of them have been confirmed. In  President Obama's term, even though he had more nominees by this time,  he had a lot more confirmations. The Senate confirmed 69 percent of the  Obama nominees.   There are currently more than 150 nominations waiting for  confirmation, many of them are already out of committee. They are ready  to come to the floor, but Senate Democrats have caused this backlog by  using every procedural tactic to needlessly delay nominees. But, when  they delay the nominees, they also delay our ability to get to the  other work.   So there are two questions here. Are you going to let the President  take over the government, which the Constitution and the Senate have  been an active part of? Are you going to get the other work done? If  you don't let the President take over the government, how do you  effectively get the other work done? It is really a plan that works  really well if what you want to do is slow down any changes of where  the government was on January 20.   A Wall Street Journal editorial earlier this week said:         Democratic obstruction against nominees is nearly total,       most notably including a demand for cloture filings for every       nominee--no matter how minor the position. This  [[Page S3983]]       means a two-day waiting period, and then another 30 hours of       debate. The 30-hour rule means Mr. Trump might not be able to       fill all of those 400 positions in four years.    In fact, at the rate we are going, it will take more than 11 years to  fill all the jobs that the President is supposed to be able to fill. I  guess that would put us in the third term of the Trump Presidency  before he ever got every job filled the first time, which the President  is expected to fill under the laws that have been there, most of them  for a long time.   The Wall Street Journal editorial talks about these difficult terms,  like cloture. What does that mean? That means that you have to get a  vote to move forward with the nomination--normally, not done where  nominations are concerned.   There is a rule that allows you to have vigorous debate on any  nominee who really is a problem, but that rule has clearly been abused.  Now the cloture vote only takes 51 votes. This is no odd Senate  majority or anything like that. A majority of the Senators can vote to  move forward with the nominee. But then, if you will not consent to  waive any of the other rules, you have to wait 2 days before you can  get to that. You can't do anything else during those 2 days. Then you  have to have 30 hours of debate.   That has happened over and over. As a matter of fact, this happened  30 times. That sounded like about 5 days to me, certainly 3\1/2\ days.  That whole process has happened 30 times, only to have many of these  nominees get 90 or more votes, to have no debate on the floor about the  nominee for whom you are supposed to be insisting on 30 hours of debate  and to come to the floor and talk about whatever else you want to talk  about. But if you go back and view the tape on whatever has happened  during these confirmations, you will find very little discussion of the  30 times that 30 hours of debate was supposedly required before we  could get to a final vote. Then, often, in the final vote, in a  bipartisan effort to find nominees who are willing to serve, they get  more than 90 votes. That just has never happened before.   By the first August recess in his administration, President Obama  only had eight cloture votes. So what has happened here 30 times under  President Trump happened 8 times under President Obama. Three percent  of the nominees confirmed under President Obama had a cloture vote  between swearing in and August, but 60 percent of the nominees from  President Trump have had a cloture vote, but about the same amount of  real debate. If we look back at what happened in 2009, the hours of  actual debate on nominees were about the same, but the use of the  maximum abuse of the rules is different.   Let me say this. The rules of the Senate were designed to protect the  minority, and that is a good thing. This is a unique body in a  democratic country, where the minority has been traditionally  protected, and that protection lasts until the minority begins to abuse  it. There will be a point here pretty quickly where I think Senators  are going to have to wonder if this rule is any longer a rule that  should be sustained.   We cannot continue to do what we are doing. We don't have 11 years  and 4 months to confirm the Trump nominees. Nobody would want the  President to have--well, maybe not anybody--an 11-year and 4-month  term. But our friends on the other side are acting like that is how  long he has to get just this rudimentary part of this job done that  largely should have been done in the first 6 months.   Only 10 percent of the President's nominees' confirmations have been  done by a voice vote. That is another alternative--just bring the  nominee, nobody objects to waiving the rules, and you have a voice  vote.   Ten percent of President Trump's confirmations have been done by  voice vote while more than 90 percent of President Obama's  confirmations were done by a voice vote. So we have the same  percentages there, just totally turned around--10 percent for Trump and  90 percent for President Obama. The contrast is striking. It is not  just simply math. It is, again, about the key positions of government  that aren't filled.   As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I hear all the time that  our country faces more threats from more directions than at any time in  our history. But we have only been allowed by this strung-out process,  insisted on by Senate Democrats, to confirm 6 of the President's 22  nominees for the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense has  22 nominees already made, and only 6 of them are over there doing the  jobs, of which the President says: Here are the 22 people I would like  to have, and there will be more names to follow.   The positions that haven't been confirmed are the Deputy Secretary of  Defense, the next job in the Defense Department and the principal  deputy under the Secretary of Defense; and the Assistant Secretary of  Defense.   I don't know about everybody else. I was a little confused by how  long these titles are. But if you look at what each of these people do,  these are critical to the mission of defending the country and they  haven't been filled. These are positions that need to be filled.   The President continues to work to improve the safety of our  communities and enforce our Nation's laws. We have seen obstruction  when it comes to the Justice Department and the 19 people who have been  willing to serve--all of whom I think are out of committee or about to  be out of committee.   If one of them is out of committee, that would be enough. But the  President has nominated 19 people to fill these vacancies, and only 3  nominees have been confirmed. Two of the nominees who have been  reported out of the committee received votes of 20 to 0 and 19 to 1. We  would think that is somebody who could come to the floor with a likely  voice vote.   My bet is that when they do get voted on, 98 Senators will vote for  them. But if we continue to do what we are doing now, only 2 days after  a cloture vote, 2 days after the vote, and then almost a day and a half  of debate after that, it is a disservice to the people that elected us  to do these jobs and even a greater disservice to the people who  elected the President to do his job.   Once again, these are key positions in Justice--the Solicitor General  of the United States, the principal person who argues in court for the  United States of America--and it is the middle of July.   My colleagues from across the aisle have clearly decided that it is  in their best political interests to stand in the way of the  President's nominees, but, maybe, more importantly, to stand in the way  of the Senate's ability to get its job done.   When I talked to Missourians, they want to know what we are doing and  why we can't get the work done that they sent us here to do. They also  want to know why we can't let the President do the job he was sent here  to do.   We need to be working on the failures of the current healthcare  system, how we make college more affordable, and what we can do to  improve our infrastructure. Those are things we need to get to, and we  need to allow the President to put his government in place for that to  happen.   He was sworn in 7 months ago. He has every right to put the  government in place. It is time for our friends across the aisle to  stop grandstanding, to stop standing in the way. It is time to stop  debating the Presidential election, and it is time to start debating  the issues of how to run the government and to let the President put  his people in those jobs so that process can begin.   Mr. President, I see my friend from Wisconsin is here. I will  conclude my remarks.
