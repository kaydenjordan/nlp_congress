 Madam Speaker, just 4 months ago, I rose to remember a  Montgomery County favorite, Denise Burstein, and today, with a heavy  heart, I remember her husband, my friend and community leader, Frank  Burstein.   Frank passed away last Saturday. Montgomery County will not be the  same without his enthusiasm, his service, and his generosity.   Frank embodied service. As a young man, he proudly served in the Army  Medical Unit, and even in his career as an executive, he was a local  political leader and advocate for foster children.   Frank was known for his hospitality, a wonderful chef who regularly  welcomed the community to his famous brunches. People would come from  miles around for his signature lemon blueberry French toast, which he  taught me to make.   Frank and Denise's welcoming way was felt in enthusiasm and smiles.  They were two halves of the same smile.   My prayers are with his sons, Martin and Marshall, his daughter-in- law, Annie, his beloved grandson, Isaiah, and his entire family. May  you and may we find comfort in knowing that Frank and Denise are  together again. May their memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
