 Madam President, today I rise to recognize the  50th anniversary of the Custer County Senior Citizen Center in Custer,  SD. The Custer County Senior Citizen Center has continually been a  place of resource, entertainment, recreation, and community for the  venerable elder citizenry of the Custer Community and southern Black  Hills since 1971; the 50 years of success the Custer Senior Center has  enjoyed is fully supported by the hundreds of volunteers who have  donated thousands of hours every year for five decades to help the  senior center thrive and grow into the valuable community resource it  has become.   The Custer County Senior Center provides unlimited opportunities for  growth, prosperity, increased longevity, and improved quality of life  to our valuable senior citizens by providing educational, cultural,  financial, medical, intellectual, and fitness programs throughout the  year.   The Custer County Senior Center will continue into the next 50 years  providing unparalleled service to the golden age population of Custer  County, the Black Hills, and the State of South Dakota as it has done  since its inception, with the support of the community, the members,  the volunteers, and the dedicated staff at the center.                            ____________________
