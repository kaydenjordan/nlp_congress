 Mr. Speaker, from given no chance in the  preseason polls to making it to the Big 12 championship game, the TCU  Horned Frogs have come a long way and are officially headed to the  College Football Playoff game.   I am tremendously proud of the team for an incredible season, with 12  consecutive wins, ranking third in the Nation, and making history with  being the first team in the State of Texas to make it to the College  Football Playoff.   Needless to say, this has been a historic year for TCU, and it could  not have been possible without our first-year coach and coach of the  year, Sonny Dykes; our quarterback, Max Duggan; all the players and  staff who work tirelessly on the sidelines and on the field to make the  team one of the best in the country; and most importantly, all the  fans, the best in the Nation, who showed up to every game decked out in  TCU purple to cheer and support the Horned Frogs.   As a proud alumnus and trustee of the university, I look forward to  watching the fighting TCU Horned Frogs take the field on December 31 at  the Fiesta Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona.
