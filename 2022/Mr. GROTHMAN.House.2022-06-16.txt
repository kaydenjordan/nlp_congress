 Madam Speaker, I would like to comment on the recent  developments regarding those brave Border Patrol officers who used  their reins to prevent people sneaking into a country illegally,  prevent them from getting stomped under their horses' hooves.   I have been to the border several times. Uniformly, all the Border  Patrol felt those people behaved appropriately, and I think continuous  studies have shown they behaved appropriately. But sadly, President  Biden has decided to pick them out for punishment.   It reminds me when he calls the police of this country racist--both  completely unfounded. He only does it, I think, to divide our country,  create divisions here.   I would demand that President Biden apologize to the brave Border  Patrol, those great guys or gals who, on that day, prevented the  Haitians trying to slip into this country from getting stomped  underfoot.   I would also like him to apologize to the police of this country who  are not racist and are doing a great job to try to hold down our murder  rate.                            ____________________
