 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  offering me just a moment to talk about something that is very  important to me.   Madam Speaker, I rise today at a time when the United States and the  international community must step up efforts to combat money  laundering.   Money laundering is a critical source of funding for terrorist  organizations and drug cartels like the ones that my good friend from  Florida might be talking about tonight. These are drug cartels and  other organized crime rings. It is used to disguise profits from or  financing for illicit activity.   Money is moved in a variety of ways across borders and through the  global financial markets to evade detection by law enforcement--global  financial markets just like ours. While exact numbers can't be  determined, estimates suggest that annual sums of money laundering are  in the trillions of dollars--trillions.   Money laundering facilitates a broad range of serious underlying  crimes, including the financing of North Korea's and Iran's nuclear  proliferation networks and the activities of terrorist operations.  Money laundering also plays a significant role in drug, human, and  wildlife trafficking.   In today's world, money launderers rely on both new and old methods.  The crime is conducted through shell companies, bulk cash smuggling,  gambling, cyber-related methods, and investments in mobile commodities,  including things that you might not think about, like gems and real  estate--yes, real estate.   For example, we have recently seen a rise in money laundering through  luxury real estate purchases. Some people come to me and say there is a  housing crisis. Well, when money launderers are inflating the cost of  housing by laundering money through overpaying for a property, that is  a problem for vulnerable populations in the United States. These real  estate purchases happen in major U.S. cities as well as international  cities like London and Dubai.   Madam Speaker, money laundering threatens political stability,  democracy, and free markets around the globe, and we must take steps to  counter it right now.   I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding to me.                       Honoring the Memory of Rosewood
