 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4738) to direct the American Folklife Center at the Library  of Congress to establish a history project to collect video and audio  recordings of personal histories and testimonials, written materials,  and photographs of those who were affected by COVID-19, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4738         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 American History       Project Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:        (1) COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory illness       caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. This disease has caused       a worldwide pandemic affecting millions of people and has       fundamentally altered the operations of the world's cities,       businesses, and schools.        (2) The outbreak of COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan,       China, and on January 21, 2020, the first confirmed case of       COVID-19 was diagnosed in the United States.        (3) The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a       global pandemic on March 11, 2020, and the President of the       United States issued a national emergency declaration       concerning the pandemic on March 13, 2020.  [[Page H3884]]         (4) To date, 194 million individuals have tested positive       for COVID-19. Of those, 35 million are Americans; that is,       more than one of every 10 Americans. Almost 4.2 million       people have died from COVID-19 globally, and over 610,000       deaths have occurred in the United States.        (5) The first American received the COVID-19 vaccine on       December 14, 2020. Since then, 163 million Americans have       been vaccinated and 188.5 million have received at least one       dose. The vaccine became available to every American adult 18       and older on April 19, 2021.        (6) While there are still remaining cases, and healthcare       professionals and researchers are tirelessly working to       eradicate the disease, it is important we begin work to fully       capture the firsthand personal stories of those impacted by       COVID-19, a major national event in the history of this       country.        (7) Oral histories are of immeasurable value to historians,       researchers, authors, journalists, film makers, scholars,       students, and citizens of all walks of life. Survivors of the       pandemic, survivors of loved ones who lost their lives to       COVID-19, and frontline healthcare workers should be       remembered and can provide valuable firsthand knowledge on       how this pandemic impacted their everyday lives.        (8) It is in the Nation's best interest to collect and       catalog oral histories of Americans who were affected by the       pandemic so that future generations will have original       sources of information regarding the lives and times of those       who lived through or died from the COVID-19 pandemic and       conditions under which they endured. These accounts will       allow an opportunity for Americans to remember those who lost       their lives and may learn firsthand of the heroics,       loneliness, horrors, and triumphs of the healthcare workers       who combated this pandemic.        (9) The Library of Congress, as the Nation's oldest Federal       cultural institution and largest and most inclusive library       in human history, is an appropriate repository to collect,       preserve, and make available to the public an archive of       these oral histories. The Library's American Folklife Center       has expertise in the management of documentation projects and       experience in the development of cultural and educational       projects for the public.        (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create a new       federally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will       coordinate at a national level the collection of video and       audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials,       written materials, and photographs of Americans who       contracted COVID-19, individuals who lost family members and       friends to COVID-19, and healthcare workers who fought to       treat the illness. These stories will inform, assist, and       encourage local efforts to preserve the stories of this       pandemic and the ones who lost their battle to the pandemic.       SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROJECT AT AMERICAN FOLKLIFE CENTER                     TO COLLECT VIDEO AND AUDIO RECORDINGS, WRITTEN                     MATERIALS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF INDIVIDUALS                     AFFECTED BY COVID-19.         (a) In General.--The Director of the American Folklife       Center at the Library of Congress shall establish a history       project to be known as the ``COVID-19 American History       Project'' (hereafter referred to as the ``Project'') to--        (1) collect video and audio recordings of personal       histories and testimonials of individuals who contracted       COVID-19, individuals who lost family members to COVID-19,       and frontline healthcare workers who fought to treat the       illness;        (2) create a collection of the recordings obtained       (including a catalog and index) which will be available for       public use through the National Digital Library of the       Library of Congress and such other methods as the Director       considers appropriate, to the extent feasible and subject to       available resources; and        (3) solicit, reproduce, and collect written materials (such       as letters and diaries) and photographs relevant to the       personal histories of individuals who contracted COVID-19,       individuals who lost family members and friends to COVID-19,       and frontline healthcare workers who fought to treat the       illness, and catalog such materials in a manner the Director       considers appropriate, consistent with and complimentary to       the efforts described in paragraphs (1) and (2).        (b) Use of and Consultation With Other Entities.--The       Director may carry out the activities described in paragraphs       (1) and (3) of subsection (a) through agreements and       partnerships entered into with other government and private       entities, and may otherwise consult with interested persons       (within the limits of available resources) and develop       appropriate guidelines and arrangements for soliciting,       acquiring, and making available recordings, written       materials, and photographs under the Project. The recordings,       written materials, and photographs shall be available on the       Library of Congress website and may be used to educate the       public on the impacts COVID-19 has on everyday Americans.        (c) Timing.--As soon as practicable after the enactment of       this Act, the Director shall begin collecting video and audio       recordings under subsection (a)(1).       SEC. 4. PRIVATE SUPPORT.         (a) Acceptance of Donations.--The Librarian of Congress may       solicit and accept donations of funds and in-kind       contributions to carry out the Project, subject to subsection       (c).        (b) Establishment of Separate Gift Account.--There is       established in the Treasury (among the accounts of the       Library of Congress) a gift account for the Project.        (c) Dedication of Funds.--Notwithstanding any other       provision of law--        (1) any funds donated to the Librarian of Congress to carry       out the Project shall be deposited entirely into the gift       account established under subsection (b);        (2) the funds contained in such account shall be available       only to the extent and in the amounts provided in advance in       appropriations Acts;        (3) the funds contained in such account shall be used       solely to carry out the Project; and        (4) the Librarian of Congress may not deposit into such       account any funds donated to the Librarian which are not       donated for the exclusive purpose of carrying out the       Project.       SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this       Act--        (1) $250,000 for fiscal year 2023; and        (2) such sums as may be necessary for each succeeding       fiscal year, except that no funds are authorized to be       appropriated to carry out this Act for any fiscal year which       begins after the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on       the date of the termination of the declaration of the public       health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and       Human Services pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health       Service Act on January 31, 2020, entitled ``Determination       that a Public Health Emergency Exists Nationwide as the       Result of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus''.       SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4738 establishes a COVID-19 history program within  the Library of Congress' American Folklife Center.   March 11 of this year marked the second anniversary of the World  Health Organization's official designation of COVID-19 as a pandemic.  Since then, more than 6 million people worldwide have succumbed to the  disease, almost a million in the United States alone, and hundreds of  millions more have suffered from its debilitating effects.   Experts agree that current statistics are likely undercounting the  disease's actual toll. Indeed, the true scale of social and economic  devastation caused by the virus may never be known.   Although the virus continues to disrupt daily life in ways both seen  and unseen, through American ingenuity and sheer force of will, several  effective vaccines were developed in record time. These vaccines  continue to be an important tool as the fight to eradicate the  coronavirus goes on.   As the country and world enter this next phase of the pandemic, it is  important that we preserve the stories of those who lived through it.  COVID-19 is not the first pandemic, and it will not be the last.  Humanity has endured Black Death, cholera, influenza, HIV, AIDS, and  the list goes on. As devastating as these diseases can be, there are  lessons to be found in each: lessons of love and loss, of peace and  strife, of failure and triumph.   Tragically, few know this firsthand better than my colleague, the  gentlewoman from Louisiana and sponsor of this bill, who lost her  husband, Luke, to the disease.   We applaud her for bravely answering the call of public service at  such a difficult time, and we hope she and her family continue to heal  and his memory serves as an inspiration to them in all that they do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3885]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for bringing  forward this very poignant and important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues as well to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3294) to obtain and direct the placement in the Capitol or on  the Capitol Grounds of a statue to honor Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court of the United States Sandra Day O'Connor and a statue to  honor Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Ruth  Bader Ginsburg.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3294         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         (a) Sandra Day O'Connor.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Sandra Day O'Connor was born in 1930 in El Paso, Texas,       and spent her childhood on her family's isolated Arizona       cattle ranch. She lived with her grandmother in El Paso       during the school year, away from her home and parents.        (2) O'Connor matriculated to Stanford University at the age       of 16, and combined her undergraduate and law school       curricula, graduating with a bachelor's degree in economics       and a law degree in just 6 years. She was third in her law       school class, behind William Rehnquist, her future colleague       on the Supreme Court of the United States (in this section       referred to as the ``Supreme Court'').        (3) Despite her qualifications, O'Connor could not find       work as an attorney because of bias against women in the law.       She ended up negotiating for an unpaid position in the San       Mateo County District Attorney's office at a shared desk,       while her husband, John, finished at Stanford Law School 1       year later.        (4) O'Connor traveled to Frankfurt, Germany, in 1954 with       her husband John, who had joined the United States Army Judge       Advocate General's Corps, where she was able to find work as       a civilian attorney with the United States Army Quartermaster       Corps. In 1957, O'Connor returned to Arizona and still could       not find work with a traditional law firm due to her gender,       so she ``hung out a shingle'' as a sole practitioner.        (5) In 1965, O'Connor was hired as an Assistant Attorney       General for the State of Arizona.        (6) Active in Republican Party politics and well-received       for her work at the Arizona State Capitol, O'Connor was       appointed to an Arizona State Senate seat in 1969 when the       incumbent, also a woman, was appointed to a Federal position       and vacated the office.        (7) In 1970, O'Connor was elected to the Arizona State       Senate and served 2 consecutive terms. In 1972, she was       selected as Majority Leader of the Arizona State Senate, the       first time a woman held such a position in any State.        (8) In 1974, O'Connor ran for office as a trial court       judge. She won and was later appointed to the Arizona Court       of Appeals in 1979.        (9) On August 19, 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated       O'Connor to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, to       fill the seat vacated by Associate Justice Potter Stewart. On       September 21, 1981, the Senate confirmed O'Connor's       nomination by a unanimous vote, making her the first woman to       serve on the Supreme Court.        (10) O'Connor established herself as a pragmatic,       independent voice on the Supreme Court, casting decisive       votes during a time when the Court was being asked to resolve       politically charged issues.        (11) In the 1982 case of Mississippi University for Women       v. Hogan, O'Connor wrote the majority opinion holding that       the State could not prevent men from enrolling in an all-      women's nursing school, writing that laws discriminating on       the basis of sex would be allowed only if there was an       ``exceedingly persuasive justification'' for them.        (12) O'Connor sought, when possible, to find the middle       ground between her often-divided colleagues, frequently       joining the majority decision but presenting her views in       concurring opinions that eschewed broad constitutional       doctrine in favor of resolving the cases before the Court.        (13) O'Connor put a very public face on the role of the       Supreme Court, domestically and around the world. She became       the Court's most prolific public speaker, traveling to all 50       States and to countless law schools, libraries, and public       events to describe how the Court works and its role in our       constitutional form of government. She traveled worldwide as       an ambassador for the Rule of Law and the independence of       judiciaries everywhere.        (14) After 24 years on the Supreme Court, O'Connor       announced her retirement to care for her ailing husband, who       had Alzheimer's disease. President George W. Bush nominated       John Roberts, Jr., for the vacancy, but before Roberts was       confirmed, Chief Justice Rehnquist passed away, creating a       second vacancy. President Bush personally appealed  [[Page H3888]]       to O'Connor to remain on the Court so he could nominate       Roberts for the Chief Justice vacancy and have more time to       make a second nomination to the Court. In yet another act of       public service, O'Connor agreed to serve until Samuel Alito       was confirmed to fill her seat on January 31, 2006.        (15) O'Connor began her retirement with 2 goals. One was to       convince more States to adopt merit selection of judges for       filling vacancies in State courts. The second was to educate       the public on the importance of an independent judiciary. Her       judicial independence work led to her awareness of a national       civics education deficit.        (16) In 2009, O'Connor created iCivics.org to educate young       Americans about civics and what it means to be a citizen.       That endeavor grew to become the largest civics education       platform in the country, with over 7,000,000 students       annually enrolling in the programs. Its popularity was due to       a captivating online, interactive gaming approach. The       program was free to all and had no advertising. iCivics       played a crucial role in Educating for American Democracy, a       federally funded initiative to improve civics and history       education, which released its reports in March 2021.        (b) Ruth Bader Ginsburg.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born in 1933 in Brooklyn, New       York, and grew up in a low-income, working-class       neighborhood.        (2) Ginsburg graduated from Cornell University in 1954,       finishing first in her class. Following her graduation,       Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1956, entering       into a class of 552 men and only 8 other women.        (3) As a law student, Ginsburg became the first female       member of the Harvard Law Review, a prestigious legal       journal. She also cared for her husband, Martin Ginsburg, who       had been diagnosed with cancer, and their young daughter.       Ginsburg finished her legal education at Columbia Law School,       where she graduated first in her class in 1959.        (4) Ginsburg taught at Rutgers University Law School from       1963 to 1972 and at Columbia Law School from 1972 to 1980,       where she became the school's first female tenured professor.        (5) During the 1970s, Ginsburg served as the director of       the Women's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties       Union. In this position, she led the fight against gender       discrimination and successfully argued 6 landmark cases       before the Supreme Court.        (6) Ginsburg won 5 cases on gender discrimination before       the Supreme Court, including the case Weinberger v.       Wiesenfeld, which involved a portion of the Social Security       Act that favored women over men, because the Act granted       certain benefits to widows, but not widowers.        (7) In 1980, President Jimmy Carter nominated Ginsburg to a       seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District       of Columbia Circuit.        (8) On June 22, 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated       Ginsburg to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, to       fill the seat vacated by Associate Justice Byron White. On       August 3, 1993, the Senate confirmed Ginsburg's nomination to       the Supreme Court by a 96 to 3 vote.        (9) Ginsburg became the second female justice to serve on       the Supreme Court, as well as the first Jewish female justice       to serve on the Supreme Court.        (10) As a justice, Ginsburg presented a strong voice in       favor of gender equality, voting rights, the rights of       workers, and the separation of church and state.        (11) In 1996, Ginsburg wrote the Supreme Court's landmark       decision in United States v. Virginia, which held that the       State-supported Virginia Military Institute could not refuse       to admit women.        (12) Ginsburg famously dissented in Ledbetter v. Goodyear       Tire & Rubber Co., where the plaintiff, a female worker being       paid significantly less than males with her same       qualifications, sued under title VII of the Civil Rights Act       of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), but was denied relief       under a statute of limitation issue. Ginsburg broke with       tradition and wrote a high colloquial version of her dissent       to read from the bench. In her dissent, she also called for       Congress to undo this interpretation of the law.        (13) Ginsburg's impactful dissent in Ledbetter v. Goodyear       Tire & Rubber Co. led to the successful passage of the Lilly       Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-2; 123 Stat.       5), which was the first piece of legislation signed by       President Barack Obama.        (14) Until the 2018 term, Ginsburg had not missed a day of       oral arguments, not even when she was undergoing chemotherapy       for pancreatic cancer, after surgery for colon cancer, or the       day after her husband passed away in 2010.        (15) Ginsburg passed away on September 18, 2020.       SEC. 2. STATUES HONORING JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR AND                     JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG.         (a) Obtaining of Statues.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of       the enactment of this Act, in consultation with the Committee       on House Administration of the House of Representatives and       the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate, and       under such terms and conditions as the Joint Committee of       Congress on the Library considers appropriate, consistent       with applicable law, the Joint Committee shall--        (A) enter into an agreement to obtain a statue honoring       Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States       Sandra Day O'Connor; and        (B) enter into an agreement to obtain a statue honoring       Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States       Ruth Bader Ginsburg.        (2) Consideration.--In selecting one or more artists to       make the statues obtained under paragraph (1), the Joint       Committee of Congress on the Library shall make the       announcement available to, and consider, artists from a       variety of backgrounds, including artists from       underrepresented demographic groups.        (b) Installation.--        (1) In general.--The Architect of the Capitol, under the       direction of the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library,       shall permanently install each statue obtained under       subsection (a) in a prominent location in the Capitol or on       the Capitol Grounds, as described in section 5102 of title       40, United States Code.        (2) Priority for location.--In determining the location for       the permanent installation of each statue obtained under       subsection (a), the Joint Committee of Congress on the       Library shall give priority to identifying an appropriate       location near the Old Supreme Court Chamber of the United       States Capitol.        (c) Funding.--Amounts available in the Capitol Preservation       Fund established under section 803 of the Arizona-Idaho       Conservation Act of 1988 (2 U.S.C. 2083) may be used by the       Joint Committee of Congress on the Library for payments for       the costs of creating and installing the statues obtained       under subsection (a), without regard to subsections (b) and       (d) of such section, provided that not more than $500,000 of       such amounts may be used for each statue obtained under       subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the matter under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill, by creating statues in the Capitol, honors former Supreme  Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, two women  who made groundbreaking contributions to American history and  jurisprudence.   The United States Capitol is a global symbol of democracy. This  iconic building, where we debate and craft law, is also a museum of  American art and history, with a rich collection of portraits,  paintings, and statues.   Among the hundreds of sculptures, just 14 honor women leaders. By  adding statues of these two pioneering Supreme Court Justices, we will  honor their legacy and inspire all who pass through these Halls.   In 1869, Arabella Mansfield became the first woman admitted to  practice law in the United States when she was admitted to the Iowa  bar.   Ten years later, Belva Lockwood became the first woman admitted to  practice before the Supreme Court of the United States. One hundred  years would pass before Sandra Day O'Connor became the first woman to  serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.   Born in the early 1930s, Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg  both achieved extraordinary academic success. One of only five women in  her class at Stanford Law, O'Connor served on the Board of Editors of  the Stanford Law Review and graduated near the top of her class.   Ginsburg first attended Harvard Law School, one of nine women in her  class. She became the first female member of the Harvard Law Review,  while also caring for her husband, who had been diagnosed with cancer,  and their young daughter. When her husband took a job in New York City,  Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School and graduated first in her  class.   Despite their outstanding academic qualifications, O'Connor and  Ginsburg faced barriers to employment after graduation, as law firms  were unwilling to hire women lawyers. Each persevered and rose to  prominence.   O'Connor obtained a position as a deputy county attorney in  California. Then, when her husband was stationed in Germany, she served  as a civilian attorney with the United States Army Quartermaster Corps.  [[Page H3889]]    In 1957, the O'Connors settled in Arizona, where they raised their  three sons. O'Connor started a law practice, became involved in local  politics and community service, and served as an assistant state  attorney general.   In 1969, O'Connor was appointed to the Arizona State Senate, where  she was twice reelected and became the first woman majority leader in  any State. In 1974, she was elected as a trial judge, a position she  held until 1979, when she was appointed to the Arizona Court of  Appeals.   In 1981, President Ronald Reagan fulfilled his campaign promise to  appoint a woman to the Supreme Court by nominating O'Connor. The Senate  unanimously confirmed her appointment. In her nearly 25 years on the  Court, Justice O'Connor established herself as a pragmatic, independent  voice.   In a 1982 case, O'Connor wrote the majority opinion, holding that the  State could not prevent men from enrolling in an all-women's nursing  school. She wrote that laws discriminating on the basis of sex are  allowed only if there is an ``exceedingly persuasive justification''  free of archaic and stereotypic notions of the roles and abilities of  males and females.   Justice O'Connor retired from the Supreme Court in 2006. In  retirement, she remained active as a tireless advocate for judicial  independence and civics education.   Following law school, Ginsburg served as a law clerk to Judge Edmund  L. Palmieri of the United States District Court for the Southern  District of New York. She then became associate director of a  comparative law project sponsored by Columbia University before joining  the faculty of Rutgers Law School in 1963. From 1972 to 1980, she  taught at Columbia Law School, where she became the first female  tenured professor.   In the 1970s, Ginsburg also served as a fellow at the Center for  Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California, and  as the director of the Women's Rights Project of the American Civil  Liberties Union. In this position, she led the fight against gender  discrimination and won five landmark cases before the Supreme Court.   In 1980, President Carter appointed Ginsburg to the United States  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In 1993,  President Clinton nominated Ginsburg as an Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 96-3,  and she became the second female and the first Jewish female to serve  on the Court.   Justice Ginsburg was a strong voice for gender equality and voting  rights. She authored the landmark majority opinion in United States v.  Virginia, which held that the State-supported Virginia Military  Institute could not refuse to admit women. Justice Ginsburg served on  the Supreme Court for 27 years, until her death in September 2020.   It is difficult to overstate the importance of these two Justices as  role models and inspiration for generations of American girls, women,  and women lawyers.   Justice O'Connor was sworn in as the first female Supreme Court  Justice the same month that I started law school, and I had the  privilege of working with both Justices on issues of civic education  and access to justice. Both women were brilliant and funny. They were  stars on the bench and in our national firmament.    Now we are presented with another moment of equal significance, with  the nomination of Judge Jackson under consideration in the Senate. One  more barrier has fallen, and soon young women of color will be able to  see themselves in future Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ketanji  Brown Jackson, as I once saw myself in Justices O'Connor and Ginsburg.   Today I ask my colleagues to honor these incredible women, Justice  O'Connor and Justice Ginsburg, and help inspire our next generation of  leaders by voting to create these statues for the Capitol of the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am so proud to rise in support of this bill to recognize the  brilliant and groundbreaking legal careers of Sandra Day O'Connor and  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but I am also so proud to recognize them because  of their unrelenting focus on our young people.   We have heard a couple of times about Justice O'Connor's interest in  civics education. She founded her civics nonprofit when she found that  more Americans knew the names of the judges on ``American Idol'' than  they did the Justices of the Supreme Court. She was really committed to  helping our next generation understand the importance of our civics.   I had the opportunity to meet Justice Ginsburg with my daughter when  my daughter was about 10. My daughter was very anxious to ask a  question of her. She asked her: ``When will we  [[Page H3891]]  have a female President?'' Justice Ginsburg turned to her and said:  ``Probably not in my lifetime, but certainly in yours.''   My daughter graduated from law school this year. We look forward to  the fulfillment of Justice Ginsburg's prophecy.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and support these  statues. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
