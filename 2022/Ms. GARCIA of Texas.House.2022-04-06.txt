 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the incredible  impact the bipartisan Affordable Insulin Now Act will have on Americans  across the Nation.   It is no secret diabetes poses a major health burden to Americans  across our country. Texas, in particular, suffers greatly from the  effects of type 2 diabetes. Every day, new Texans are diagnosed. On top  of that, the rate of new cases increases every single year.   This topic, Mr. Speaker, hits very close to home. I have seen  firsthand the hurdles diabetes creates for families simply looking to  live a quiet life and be alone and have a good, productive life. In my  family, my mother faced uphill health battles because of diabetes most  of her adult life. She died eventually of diabetes complications.   Diabetes runs in my family. In fact, my doctor tells me that no  matter what I do, I may end up getting diabetes. I am one of 10  children. Five of us have already gotten diabetes and are dependent on  insulin.   Sadly, this epidemic disproportionately impacts older adults,  especially Latinos, minorities, and populations with lower levels of  education. It remains one of the leading causes of death in Texas and  the United States. In my own home county of Harris County, diabetes is  the fifth leading cause of death.   Even when purchased through Medicare, insulin is more than three  times as expensive in the United States than in the U.K. The bipartisan  Affordable Insulin Now Act is truly needed to save lives.   The Affordable Insulin Now Act caps insulin copays at $35 per month  or 25 percent of an insurance plan's negotiated price, whichever is  lower. It is a great first step, and it will save lives. But more must  be done.   You see, Mr. Speaker, Americans without health insurance will not  benefit from this bill. This will help those residents who are  fortunate to already have health insurance, and we welcome this  support. Again, it is a great first step. But much more is very needed.   Texas is the State with the highest rate of uninsured individuals  and, in my district, 33 percent of the residents in my district do not  have health insurance.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, my district has the highest number of uninsured  people than in any other district in the Nation. To make matters worse,  diabetes is highly concentrated in east Texas, the area where I live.  It pains me that these folks were not included in the bill.   The immense health and emotional challenges diabetes brings to  households are burdensome enough; but its economic strain is ruthless  to families not fortunate enough to have insurance.   Because of corporate greed and companies focused only on profits,  Texans without medical insurance face astronomical prices for insulin.  In short, people with diabetes have medical expenses approximately 2.3  times higher than those who do not have diabetes.   The out-of-pocket costs for healthcare and insulin have crippled  hardworking Americans across our country. It has gotten so bad that one  in four people have rationed, rationed lifesaving insulin because they  could not afford proper dosage amounts. This is unacceptable and wrong,  and we must do better.   No one--I repeat, no one--should have to gamble with their health by  rationing insulin to make ends meet. The bipartisan Affordable Insulin  Now Act will save lives, and it is a great step forward. But I will  continue fighting for residents across my district who do not currently  have health insurance but do need insulin. We will continue to fight  until we get it done.                            ____________________
