 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 4:20 p.m. today and that following the recess, Senator  Wyden or his designee be recognized for up to 60 minutes.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:36 p.m., recessed until  4:20 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Blunt).
