 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work.   Hoosiers get it. The recent reports of sexual assault and harassment  in Congress are reprehensible.   I applaud Representative Comstock for her hard work on this  resolution. The House resolution today is an important step in the  right direction. It mandates that everyone working in Congress has the  proper antiharassment training.   We must do more. The AP recently reported that the Federal Government  has spent $17 million in taxpayer money settling harassment claims and  other violations. It is astounding that tax dollars have been spent to  protect Members of Congress and silence victims.   It is not okay. That is why I am filing legislation to stop taxpayer  dollars from being used in this way, to settle sexual harassment claims  against Members of Congress. This legislation will empower victims by  releasing them from nondisclosure agreements that prevent them from  coming forward and telling their story. Let's pass today's resolution  and then keep working to do more.
