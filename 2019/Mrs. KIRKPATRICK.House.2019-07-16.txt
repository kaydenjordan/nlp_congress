 Mr. Speaker, I have a responsibility as a  Congresswoman, former prosecutor, and American citizen to stand up for  the rule of law.   After countless conversations with my constituents, after speaking  with legal scholars and experts, after reviewing the Mueller report,  and after seeing administration officials defy congressional subpoenas,  I have come to the conclusion that the House of Representatives must  open an impeachment inquiry on President Donald Trump.   Following Mueller's alarming report, it is our job as a Congress to  conduct oversight and deliver answers to the American people.  Unfortunately, the President has called upon his administration to  break the law and ignore our congressional subpoenas. Now we have no  choice but to open an impeachment inquiry.   This should not be a partisan fight or a debate about election  strategy; it is about the rule of law.   I know impeachment is risky, but allowing this President to defy the  law is even more risky. If we don't act now, our democracy may be  threatened for years to come.
