 Mr. Speaker, one rainy afternoon during my campaign last  year, I was out knocking on doors. I met a man and asked what he cared  about. He paused as the rain poured down around us, and he uttered a  single word, ``Decency.''   Mr. Speaker, over the last several years, we have watched as our  democracy sinks to new and disturbing lows. We have seen national  leaders dispense with civility and compassion and replace them with  cruelty. We have witnessed a debasement of our traditions and a  devaluation of goodwill.   But decency, that quiet virtue, has not disappeared. If anything, we  have mourned its absence because we know that decency is essential for  any democracy worth wanting. Decency is that basic commitment to treat  each other charitably, to try understanding each other, and to value  our common humanity more than our differences.   This is National Decency Day. Let us reaffirm that commitment to one  another. Decency should be a starting point of all of our  conversations. It should carry us through disagreements, even when  things get contentious. It should guide us through the shoals of our  biggest challenges, today and every day.                            ____________________
