 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a few minutes ago, the majority leader  came to the floor to express his frustration at being accused of  blocking election security legislation. I would make three factual  points.   First, Russia did interfere in our 2016 elections. Every intelligence  agency, everyone who has looked at this is 100 percent clear Russia  interfered.   Two, Russia will attempt to interfere in the 2020 elections and is  already doing it. That is not only what Special Counsel Mueller said  but FBI Director Wray and many other appointees in the intelligence and  counterintelligence agencies appointed by President Trump.   Three, the Republican majority has done nothing--absolutely nothing-- to deal with this problem.   So here is an easy way for Leader McConnell to silence the critics  who accuse him of blocking election security: Stop blocking.   Leader McConnell doesn't have to put the bills that we Democrats have  proposed or the bill the House has passed--they were bipartisan bills-- and we can debate the issue.   America's democracy is at risk when a foreign power interferes. So if  Leader McConnell doesn't like being criticized on election security, I  challenge him: Let's debate it on the floor with amendments. I  challenge him: Support additional appropriations for States to harden  their election systems. In both cases, Leader McConnell has not done  that. In fact, he has said he opposes more money to the States even  though they say--I believe there are 21 attorneys general who have said  they need more money.   Despite our requests, Leader McConnell has not only blocked unanimous  consent requests but has not put any other legislation on the floor to  deal with this.   Again, I repeat, this should not be a political issue. This should  not be a political issue. Whether you are a Democrat, Republican,  Independent, whether you are a liberal, a conservative, in between, you  should despise the fact--any American should despise the fact--that  Russia has interfered in our elections and is attempting to do so  again. Putin wants to disrupt our democracy. He resents that we are a  free and open and wonderful democratic society. And for us to sit here  with our arms folded and do nothing? Unheard of in previous years.   I still don't have a really clear idea why Leader McConnell is so  adamantly opposed to doing anything on election security. Maybe it is  because President Trump, in his childlike way, resents the fact that  people point out that Russia interfered. He thinks it delegitimizes his  Presidential election. But that is not a good enough reason, if that is  the case. We have an obligation. Do you know whom we have an obligation  to, Mr. President? We have an obligation to the hundreds of thousands  of Americans--the millions of Americans who laid down their lives to  defend our right to vote in our free and open democracy throughout the  centuries.   If we are going to let a foreign power interfere and not do anything  about it for some kind of political reason, shame on us. Shame on this  body. And it is Leader McConnell who, as the majority leader, can  determine what is put on the floor, and he has put nothing on the floor  on elections.   When last year we attempted in the appropriations bill to add more  money to help the States harden their systems against cyber attack, to  make sure they have paper ballots in case someone tampers with the  ballots, Leader McConnell opposed it. He said it is not needed. Just  recently, I heard him say it is not needed. That is not true. That  [[Page S5129]]  is absolutely not true. Twenty-one attorneys general say they need it.  Nine States don't have backup systems with complete paper balloting.   So if Leader McConnell takes umbrage at his election security  critics, I challenge him: Prove them wrong. Support our amendment to  the appropriations bill. Bring election security legislation to the  floor because, as the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is chaired  by a Republican, the FBI Director, who was appointed by President  Trump, and former Special Counsel Mueller, who did an extensive  investigation, have all made clear, when it comes to Russian  interference in our elections, the case is certainly not closed.                      Director of National Intelligence    Mr. President, yesterday the Director of National Intelligence, Dan  Coats--a former Member of this Chamber who is renowned for his  integrity and his bipartisanship--announced his resignation. With his  departure, the circle of advisers who are unafraid to speak truth to  President Trump continues to shrink. It seems that if you are going to  speak truth and tell the President something he doesn't want to hear,  you are fired or at least frozen out so that you quit. Coats is one of  many in a long line to whom this has been done. Now, making matters  worse, the President proposed replacing this longtime, fair, decent,  and honorable public servant with a partisan shill--Representative    John Ratcliffe of Texas.   The DNI--Director of National Intelligence--handles some of the most  sensitive responsibilities in the Federal Government. It requires a  high level of expertise. It requires trust from the intelligence  community. And it requires a track record of independence, an ability  in the closed confines of the White House to speak truth to power and  tell the President what is happening, not just what the President wants  to hear. On all these measures, it seems Representative Ratcliffe falls  far short of that high bar.   John Negroponte became the DNI after decades of working in the  Foreign Service. Dennis Blair, James Clapper, and Mike McConnell all  had decades of military experience. Dan Coats served as a diplomat,  Senator, and sergeant in the Army before assuming the post.  Representative Ratcliffe, on the other hand, is a three-term tea party  Congressman who, when he goes on TV, sort of appeals to the President's  sense of stridency and partisanship.   Representative Ratcliffe lacks the experience required to lead an  intelligence agency, much less the entire intelligence community. His  time in Congress--particularly over the past several weeks since it was  rumored he might be picked for the post--has been alarmingly partisan.  He has been a fierce critic of the Russia investigation. He has earned  praise from deep state conspiracy theorists.   During the Mueller hearings, Representative Ratcliffe badgered and  harassed the former special counsel with a baseless line of questioning  and repeatedly interrupted him when he was trying to respond. He showed  little regard for the seriousness of Putin's interference in our  election and the need for election security in the future.   Watching Representative Ratcliffe's performance in the Mueller  hearing, I was reminded of how I felt watching General Flynn. In the  summer of 2016, I saw this three-star general leading chants of  people--``Lock her up''--at the Republican convention and at rallies. I  said: Who is this guy? How does someone become a three-star and do  something like this? At the time I thought: There is something  seriously wrong with General Flynn here.   Well, I had the same feeling watching Mr. Ratcliffe at the Mueller  hearing. The same twisting and subversion and flatout ignorance, the  same partisan demagoguery to appeal to the worst instincts of Americans  all seem to be his MO. There is something wrong here. The DNI is  supposed to be the least partisan member of the President's Cabinet. It  would be a grave mistake for the Senate to elevate this partisan  warrior to that position.   I have to wonder, are my Republican colleagues comfortable with their  party's direction on national security? Are they comfortable going  along with Leader McConnell as he blocks legislation to protect our  elections and deter foreign adversaries from interfering? Are they  comfortable with a polarizing, partisan candidate taking charge of our  national intelligence community? Are they comfortable knowing that this  nominee may well not tell the President the truth when there is  evidence from our brave intelligence operatives around the world that  something we are doing is wrong?   I would hope my Republican colleagues would be deeply uncomfortable  with these developments. Ten years ago, I have no doubt, Mr. Ratcliffe  wouldn't have even been nominated, let alone approved by this body. So  I hope that is the case today. I hope we haven't gone so far away and  in such obeisance to a President who only likes to hear what he wants  to hear that we would nominate someone like this. It would be a shame  and it would weaken America because if we don't know the truth, we  can't act on the truth.   Will our Republican colleagues start speaking up and doing something  about this? When Mr. Ratcliffe comes before the Senate, he will have to  answer for his long history of partisan statements and blind fealty to  President Trump. Mr. Ratcliffe will have to answer tough questions  about Russia's meddling in our election, about his apparent disinterest  in election security, and about his inability or unwillingness to show  independence from the President. If he sounds anything like he did  while questioning Mueller, Senate Republicans would be making a grave  mistake by advancing his nomination--a mistake for the country we love.                                    China    Mr. President, finally, on China, starting today, the United States  will resume trade negotiations with China, which have recently stalled  over Chinese equivocation on a number of issues.   Anyone who has viewed China's behavior over the past year of  negotiations--or for that matter, the past decade of its behavior-- knows China is always reluctant to make concessions that would put its  businesses on a level playing field. China will resist, delay, and  offer bare-bones concessions and then retract them in hopes that it can  avoid meaningfully reforming its economy and playing fair on trade.   So, as negotiations begin again, I urge President Trump and his team  not to back down but to put unrelenting pressure on China to make  significant, concrete, and enduring commitments to trade fairly.   I don't agree with President Trump on much, but he has been tougher  on China than any of the previous administrations, and that is needed.  But to be tough on China and then surrender our leverage at the last  minute for nothing in return would be terrible.   One of our greatest leverage points against China is Huawei, a state- supported Chinese telecom giant that our intelligence agencies have  labeled nothing less than a national security threat. The Trump  administration has correctly sought restrictions on Huawei, even while  they have sometimes waved on their severity.   Now, as negotiations are set to resume, the President must not give  up leverage on Huawei in exchange for anything less than concrete  commitments on market access, intellectual property theft, and forced  technology transfers.   These are issues paramount to the competitiveness of American  business and will cause us to lose millions of jobs and trillions of  dollars in the future, as we have lost in the past and as the President  correctly points out, to China's rapaciousness.   I am concerned enough now about the possibility the administration  will sell out, particularly in the wake of reports that President Trump  has agreed to soft pedal criticism of China over its Hong Kong policy,  hoping for smoother trade talks.   The administration is wrong on two fronts. First, it is always  crucial for the United States to stand up for democracy, human rights,  and civil liberties everywhere. The idea that the President of the  United States would sell the democratic aspirations of the brave people  of Hong Kong down the river in exchange for possible progress on trade  is shocking. But, second, the idea that going easy on China's human  rights record will ease trade talks is backward. China responds to  strength, not flattery or capitulation.   The best way to get China to do something fair is to stand tough on  [[Page S5130]]  Huawei. Don't sell out. Don't give Huawei half or three-quarters of  what it wants. Hold tough, and the Chinese in a few months will come to  us with real concessions. It is a game of who is stronger and who can  last longer. I hope it is us. If it is not, all of the President's  previous actions on China will be wasted and go down the drain.                        9/11 Victim Compensation Fund    There are two more things, including the VCF bill signing. There are  some good things that happened in the last week in Washington. People  think nothing good comes out of Washington. Once in a while, we do  something good. Once in a while, our Republican colleagues will go  along with something that needs to be done, instead of blocking  everything and putting it in a graveyard, which they usually do. That  happened last week when this body finally passed the bipartisan 9/11  Victim Compensation Fund bill, and today the President signed it into  law, closing the book on nearly two decades of advocacy to provide the  care and compensation that 9/11 first responders deserve.   Nothing, nothing should or can get in the way of our first responders  getting their due. Finally, at last, these brave first responders had  to spend too much time here in Washington, often in their wheelchairs,  often dying of cancer, begging Senators to give them the help they  need--the same help we give to veterans who, like our first responders  after 9/11, in a time of war, rushed to danger and suffered injury. We  help them. We help our veterans, our soldiers, and our Armed Forces, in  the same way we should be helping 9/11 first responders. At long last,  we are doing that. It has been a long struggle, but because of the  courage of many who joined the cause, the memory of people like James  Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, Luis Alvarez, and so many others will live on in  this law. Their parents--and I know Mrs. Pfeifer and I know some of the  Alvarez family; I have met them--can know, despite the pain in their  hearts at their grave losses, that the deaths of their loved ones will  not be in vain.                         Bipartisan Background Checks    Finally, my heart is filled with sadness and anger today after  reports of deadly shootings at festivals on opposite coastlines, one in  my hometown of Brooklyn and another across the country, in Gilroy, CA.  There are no words for the senselessness of these tragedies, which  continue unabated while the majority leader once again refuses to even  debate commonsense gun laws.   Put the bill the House passed on the floor. We have had bipartisan  efforts in this body to close the gun show loophole. Let's close the  loopholes and have universal background checks. Almost no Americans  object to preventing felons or spousal abusers or those adjudicated  mentally incompetent from getting guns, but Leader McConnell and the  Republican majority do, and we have made no progress and these awful  events continue.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, viewing the awful conditions at DHS  detention facilities in Texas crystalized my belief that continued  tough, independent oversight and accountability from Congress and  Homeland Security inspector general is imperative to change the  deplorable treatment of migrants. That is why I pushed Mr. Cuffari to  make two critical commitments.   First, the Inspector General's Office must continue frequent and  unannounced inspections of CBP and ICE immigration detention  facilities, and second, he must strongly rebuff any attempts by the  Acting DHS Secretary, Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services,  Acting Commissioner of CBP. or the White House to limit the inspector  general's independence or ability to follow the facts of investigations  wherever they lead.   The horrid treatment of children and families is the direct result of  President Trump's policies, and we Democrats are committed to holding  the Trump administration accountable. If confirmed, I fully expect Mr.  Cuffari to live up to the personal commitments he made to me.
