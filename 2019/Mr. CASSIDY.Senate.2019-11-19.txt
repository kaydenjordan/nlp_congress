 Madam President, the Rotary Club of Lafayette  will turn 100 years old in 2020. I would like to share with you some of  the accomplishments of the club since its founding in 1920. Early in  their history, they underwrote the election to fund the first public  library, they helped to establish One Acadiana and started the first  Lafayette Boy Scout troop. In addition to establishing Rotary Park in  the 1980s, they currently fund annual scholarships for local students,  coordinate food drives for FoodNet, and support Rotary's mission to  eradicate polio worldwide, in addition to supporting other local  charities.   Congratulations to the Rotary Club of Lafayette on this historic  achievement. I wish you all the best of luck in years to come.                            ____________________
