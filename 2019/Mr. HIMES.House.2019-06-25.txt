 Madam Speaker, I am not in the habit of praising the  President from this perch, but I do want to say that I am very pleased  that we are not in yet another shooting war in the Middle East today.   I think we came very, very close, and I appreciate that the President  had the courage to stand down some raids that, undoubtedly, would have  led to a response and led to another war in the Middle East.   I know he does that at the risk of being criticized for potentially  damaging American credibility, but we are not in a war today. That is  an argument for history.   What is not an argument for history is that any aggression, any  military action against Iran, must be approved by the Congress of the  United States. It is clear in the Constitution that a decision to go to  war must be made in this building.   I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to reflect on the reason  for that. If we are going to sacrifice blood and treasure, the  Representatives of the people must make that decision, not one  individual at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.   Now is the time for us to consider whether another Middle Eastern war  makes sense for the people of the United States of America.                            ____________________
