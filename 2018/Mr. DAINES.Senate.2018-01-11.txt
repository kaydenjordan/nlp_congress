 Mr. President, today is National Human Trafficking  Awareness Day. Montana, like much of the United States, is suffering  from the rise in human trafficking. I am grateful that Montana's  attorney general, Tim Fox, has taken this issue head-on. In fact,  Montana has had three times as many human trafficking cases in 2017 as  we had in 2015--a threefold increase. Unfortunately, this number will  likely continue to rise in the coming years, and online platforms are a  driving force for it. Like so many things, the internet has tremendous  power for good as well as for evil.   Having spent 12 years building a startup cloud computing business in  my hometown of Bozeman--a business we grew to over 1,000 employees. We  took the company public. This became a large, global business. I  understand the power of the internet for good. But I also believe we  must and can have better safeguards to protect our children, our  families, and our neighbors from sex trafficking, while at the same  time protecting innovation on the internet.   Unfortunately, a startup business--your business--has the potential  to be used for terrible reasons without your awareness. Even more  upsetting, it is also possible that online platforms do know that bad  actors are using that platform and they do nothing about it. During my  first hearing on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee, we investigated one of these platforms: backpage.com.   Bad actors like backpage.com must be held accountable. That is why  today, on Human Trafficking Awareness Day, I will be joining the Stop  Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. This act strips protections for platforms  that knowingly assist, support, or facilitate sex trafficking. We must  take steps now to stop human trafficking and protect vulnerable members  of our community. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act moves us closer  to that goal.   I tip my hat and I am thankful to Senator Portman for introducing  this bill. I am thankful for the work of the Senate Commerce Committee  to ensure that this legislation protects the millions of companies on  the internet that are building our economy and creating high-paying  jobs and doing so in good faith.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor for  S. 1693, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 10, I voted yea. It  was my intention to vote nay. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I  be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the outcome of  the vote.    Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing the Montana Youth ChalleNGe Academy (MYCA), located in  Dillon, MT. The MYCA is sponsored by the Montana National Guard and the  State of Montana and assists at-risk youth in our state to develop the  skills necessary to become productive citizens. This academy focuses on  the physical, emotional and educational  [[Page S167]]  needs of the youth using a quasi-military style technique of discipline  and motivation. To date, they have graduated over two thousand  students.   I would like to thank six of the original staff who began work at  MYCA when it opened in 1999 and who are still employed there today.  Director Jan Rouse, Deputy Director Trent Gibson, Lead Teacher Carolyn  Bielser, Lead Counselor Ben Stewart, Counselor Tammy Pittman and Cadre  Team Leader Cheryl Miskowic have spent years working to help Montana's  at-risk youth and their work has touched the lives of many. Along with  the other staff at MYCA, they have helped students become contributing  members of our Montana communities. Thank you to all those working hard  at the Montana Youth ChalleNGe Academy in Beaverhead County.                            ____________________
