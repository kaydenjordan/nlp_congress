Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Boone  Drug in Boone, North Carolina, on celebrating the 100th anniversary of  the founding of its original store, opened in North Carolina's Fifth  District by Dr. George Kelly Moose. With this longevity of service in  the community, Boone Drug can truly claim to be a neighborhood  institution. In January 1919, when it opened, it was one of only two  drugstores in Boone, and it has thrived in the midst of the changes of  the pharmaceutical industry through the last century.   For 50 years, customers went to see Dr. Moose, walking from miles  away to buy their medicine at Boone Drug. The upstairs of the building  was occupied by a group of doctors and a dentist, which kept constant  traffic moving in and out of the store. Dr. Moose even kept his  drugstore open until each doctor had seen his last patient, often late  into the night.   In 1947, two brothers, Dr. Odell Kelly--``O.K.'' for Odell Kelly--and  Dr. Wayne Richardson, joined Dr. Moose at the pharmacy. The space was  expanded for a soda fountain and grill, where many locals socialized,  and the town's movers and shakers talked politics.    Joe Miller was next to join the Boone Drug ownership. Having worked  at the fountain in high school, the Richardson brothers convinced him  to go to pharmacy school and eventually made him a fourth owner.   Dr. Miller was joined by Dr. John Stacy and Dr. Jim Furman. They have  kept alive the legacy of customer service, philanthropy, and business  expansion of their predecessors. The Boone Drug pharmacists often  volunteered their services, staying open until 9 p.m.; so that  physicians could work long hours and patients could fill their  prescriptions after a late-night doctor's visit. The store's philosophy  was that anyone who came in with a prescription left with medicine,  even if one didn't have the means to cover the entire prescription's  cost right away.   In the mid-1980s, Dr. Miller broadened the store's horizons, selling  art supplies. The popular art supply store, named Cheap Joe's Art  Stuff, began in the upstairs of the drugstore. At first, art supplies  were placed on shelves between over-the-counter medicines downstairs.  Eventually, what started as Dr. Miller's hobby outgrew the drugstore  and Cheap Joe's Art Stuff moved into its own location, serving  customers worldwide.                                time  1730    Although the drugstore's fountain and grill closed in 2011, the  owners have filled its former space with a nonprofit community kitchen  that feeds the hungry.   Today, there are 17 Boone Drug locations in North Carolina, South  Carolina, and Tennessee. The pharmacists in these pharmacies serve as  direct contacts for medical information without an appointment or the  expense of a doctor's visit.   Boone Drug provides a shining example of the important role that  pharmacies play in supporting healthy communities. They provide  immunizations, durable medical equipment, counseling, and expertise in  healthcare.   I have been a patron of Boone Drug since moving to Boone as a student  at Appalachian State University and always enjoy my visits to the  store. I continue to love all the wonderful employees and am privileged  to represent this small business and local pharmacy. It treats clients  like family, which is the hallmark of a small town drugstore that lasts  a century, and I wish Boone Drug another 100 years of success.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 31 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, January 24, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
