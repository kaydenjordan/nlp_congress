 Mr. Speaker, I could go point by point and prove that  the resolution is false, but time is short. I will just say: Adam tells  the truth.   He told the truth when we were managers on the first impeachment that  resulted in a bipartisan vote for conviction.   He told the truth when we served on the January 6 Committee and found  that the ex-President was the leader of a plot to overturn the  Constitution and the electoral vote.   Why is this before us today?   The truth hurts, doesn't it?   I think it is before us today because the ex-President has recently  been charged with dozens of felonies.   I am a former chair of the Ethics Committee. This resolution is a  departure from what has been the norm in the Congress in terms of  censure. Not only does this resolution disgrace the MAGA Republicans  who advanced it, but it also disgraces this institution.
