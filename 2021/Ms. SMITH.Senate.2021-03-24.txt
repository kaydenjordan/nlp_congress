 Madam President, I want to also just thank my colleague  from Vermont for that lovely tribute to Judge Hall.   I can see that he meant a lot to you and was a great public servant.  So thank you, Senator Leahy.   Madam President, in a year of so much heartbreak and grief and death,  it almost escaped notice that we had gone in this country a year  without a mass shooting in a public place.   But now we face the grim reminder of our American reality. In the  space of a week, two separate mass shootings stole the lives of 18  people. And just weeks ago, we suffered a mass shooting in a health  clinic in my home State of Minnesota.   So here we are again, thrust into a familiar cycle of collective  grief and frustration and anger. Our hearts break for the families and  loved ones of those whose lives were stolen. Our voices cry out for  change to end the scourge of gun violence. And our anger grows as our  voices are ignored and we are told by Republican leaders that there is  nothing that we can do to protect American lives from gun violence.   Colleagues, it is our job to protect American lives.   Today, I want to share with you the voice of Veronique de la Rosa.  Her son Noah, just 6 years old, was murdered in his classroom at Sandy  Hook Elementary, and she delivered this eulogy for her son at his 2012  funeral.   I am going to read it in its entirety so that it can be included in  the Record, the Congressional Record, and can serve as a reminder of  the human toll that our gun culture has taken.   Veronique said:         The sky is crying, and the flags are at half-mast. It is a       sad, sad day. But it is also your day, Noah, my little man. I       will miss your forceful and purposeful little steps stomping       through our house. I will miss your perpetual smile, the       twinkle in your dark blue eyes, framed by eyelashes that       would be the envy of any lady in this room.        Most of all, I will miss your visions of your future. You       wanted to be a doctor, a soldier, a taco factory manager. It       was your favorite food, and no doubt you wanted to ensure       that the world kept producing tacos.        You were a little boy whose life force had all the       gravitational pull of a celestial body. You were light and       love, mischief and pranks. You adored your family with every       fiber of your 6-year-old being. We are all of us elevated in       our humanity by having known you. A little maverick, who       didn't always want to do his schoolwork or clean up his toys,       when practicing his ninja moves or Super Mario on the Wii       seemed far more important.        Noah, you will not pass this way again. I can only believe       that you were planted on Earth to bloom in heaven. Take       flight, my boy. Soar. You now have the wings that you always       wanted. Go to that peaceful valley that we will all one day       come to know. I will join you someday. Not today. I still       have lots of mommy love to give to Danielle, Michael, Sophia       and Arielle.        Until then, your melody will linger in our hearts forever.       Momma loves you, little man.    Veronique should not have had to eulogize Noah, her 6-year-old son--1  of 20 children killed at Sandy Hook.   So I ask my Republican colleagues to think of her when you suggest  that families exaggerate their anguish for political gain.   Just yesterday, one of my Republican colleagues dismissed this grief  as ``theater.'' No. This is life and death.   So I am angry. I am angry because I know that we have the power to  stop this violence, and yet our Republican colleagues stand in the way.  They refuse to work with us. They continue to put the demands of the  NRA above the demands of the people we are elected to serve--that we  stop this horrific gun violence, that we protect the people we are  elected to serve.   Madam President, we need universal background checks. We need to ban  assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We need to end this cycle,  and we need all of us in Congress to find the strength and the humanity  to take action.   I yield the floor
