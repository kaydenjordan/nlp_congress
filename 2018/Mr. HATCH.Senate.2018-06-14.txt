 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable  Utahn whose impact has been felt by generations of Americans every day:  the ``Father of Television,'' Mr. Philo T. Farnsworth. A true American  inventor, Farnsworth's image has graced Statuary Hall in the U.S.  Capitol Building since 1990 in larger-than-life fashion, as one of two  statue contributions by Utah.   Just a few months ago, the Utah State Legislature voted to replace  the Farnsworth statue with that of Martha Hughes Cannon, the first  woman State senator in Utah and the Nation. Her influence as a Mormon  pioneer, a Utah women's rights advocate, and early female physician  opened doors and paved  [[Page S3948]]  the way for millions to follow. In 1896, when she defeated her own  husband to become the first female State senator elected in the United  States, she made history for our State and for women across the  country.   Martha's contributions have been far-reaching in Utah, but in no way  should the changing of the statues diminish the contributions of Philo  T. Farnsworth as one of America's greatest innovators. I have always  been proud to show the thousands of constituents who visit the Capitol  each year the Farnsworth statue. This iconic sculpture has been a  wonderful representation of the traits that our State was founded on:  hard work, innovation, and industry.   Farnsworth was born in 1906 in Beaver, UT, a small rural town settled  in 1856 by Mormon pioneers traveling the road to southern Utah. His  early pioneer roots encouraged a work ethic and can-do attitude that  propelled his lifelong love of learning and invention. From a very  young age, he imagined and later implemented scientific designs,  including a machine to convert electric power in his family home and a  tamper-proof lock, but it was in a high school chemistry class in  Rigby, ID, that he began to sketch an idea for a vacuum tube that would  forever change the media and entertainment landscape. Farnsworth's  sketch was the blueprint for what would eventually become the modern- day television.   Farnsworth had a special knack for taking big ideas from paper to  practice--first, as a student at Brigham Young University, then later  as a businessman. He didn't just stop with television. In fact, his  scientific mind made great inroads in other areas of advancement,  including sterilizing milk using radio waves.   In later years, Farnsworth continued research in further  technologies, including radar, the infrared telescope, and nuclear  fusion. In fact, in 1967, he moved back to Utah to run a fusion lab at  Brigham Young University, which was later relocated to Salt Lake City  operating as the Philo T. Farnsworth Association.   Unfortunately, Farnsworth had to endure legal battles throughout his  career regarding patent claims. He also faced great financial hardship.  He passed away from pneumonia on March 11, 1971, in Salt Lake City, UT,  just as having a home television set became the norm in most American  households. Sadly, Farnsworth did not live to see the full impact of  his revolutionary invention, but his influence lives on.   Whether you are gathering friends to watch the latest playoff game,  laughing at a comedy series, or keeping updated on what is happening in  the world, your life has been touched in one way or another by Philo T.  Farnsworth. Who would have thought that the rough sketches of a  daydreaming schoolboy would one day change the world?   Utah is proud of its native son, Philo T. Farnsworth. He was not only  the ``Father of Television'' but truly one of the most brilliant minds  and creative innovators of the 20th century. His statue will be missed  here in the Capitol, but through his singular invention, Farnsworth's  influence in our daily lives will be ever present.   Farnsworth's statue has represented--and will continue to represent-- the honor and appreciation Utahns have for his monumental life  achievements. His image has honorably served our State well for almost  three decades, and I am hopeful it will find the right home. It has  been a pleasure sharing the Capitol with the image of Philo T.  Farnsworth.                            ____________________
