 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Autism Awareness Month, which we honor in April each year.   Madam Speaker, 1 in 44 children in the United States are diagnosed  with autism spectrum disorder. The prevalence of autism spectrum  disorder has increased 16.3 percent since the year 2000, making it even  more important to expand research and provide adequate resources for  people who are on the spectrum. By increasing awareness, we can support  the more than 5.4 million individuals in America living with autism  spectrum disorder.   Our early childcare programs, especially in schools, must have the  knowledge, resources, and ability to provide assistance to those living  with autism. Early diagnosis and treatment can make all the difference.   I will take a moment to recognize my dear friend, Vincent McLaughlin,  of Saugerties, New York, who truly is an inspiration to me and to all  of us who are standing there trying to help the cause of autism  awareness.   Vincent is an active and dedicated member of his community with full- time employment and doing volunteer work for the fire department and  numerous other not-for-profit agencies in his community. He constantly  strives for increased awareness for autism through his selfless service  and tenacious advocacy.    Vincent is a shining example of how effective and beneficial early  treatment and community empowerment can be for people with autism  spectrum disorder.   It is a privilege today to acknowledge April as Autism Awareness  Month. May all Americans living with autism receive the tools,  resources, and support necessary to live fulfilling lives. Autism  should never be a barrier preventing Americans from achieving success  or pursuing happiness.   Good luck to all of them, and especially my dear friend, Vincent  McLaughlin. Thank you so much for keeping me aware and for inspiring  all of us.                            ____________________
