 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her leadership on  this subject.   I am a doctor, and I have worked in low-income and free clinics, and  I know title X funding works. It has impact. Here is how we also know  it works: by expanding access to full reproductive services under the  Affordable Care Act and contraception, we have seen a dramatic  reduction in the number of unintended pregnancies.   We are debating the wrong thing here. We should be increasing title X  funds right now. We should be debating how we make access to full  reproductive services more readily available. That is what the women of  America want.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this dangerous bill. I urge my  colleagues to understand the women of America are watching.   I also urge, if somehow this makes it to the President's desk: The  mothers and daughters, Mr. President, are watching; so be careful here.  This is about preserving access to care and full reproductive rights.  We are watching.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks  to the Chair.
