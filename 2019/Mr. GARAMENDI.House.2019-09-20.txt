 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may  hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 463, a bill  originally introduced by Representative Walter Jones from North  Carolina, for the purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting  reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the names of  Representative Kildee from Michigan and Representative Luria from  Virginia be removed as cosponsors of H.R. 3193, the Transportation  Emergency Relief Funds Availability Act, of which I am the sponsor.
