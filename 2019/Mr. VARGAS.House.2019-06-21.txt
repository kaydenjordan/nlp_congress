 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Immigrant  Heritage Month and the millions of immigrant families living, working,  and thriving within the United States.   For centuries, our country has welcomed those in search of a better  life and has benefited from their meaningful contributions.   As a proud Mexican American, it is a special honor to celebrate my  family's immigrant heritage and our Nation's entire immigrant  community. Like countless others, my parents came to the United States  looking for hope and opportunity for themselves and for the generations  to follow.   Thanks to their courage and sacrifice, my siblings and I were able to  pursue our American Dreams, an opportunity that is currently,  unfortunately, slipping away for far too many.   Today, we are witnessing the devastating effect of President Trump's  cruel anti-immigrant agenda, where immigrants are demonized and treated  as outsiders; migrants are denied their legal rights to asylum and  safety; children are ripped apart from their parents; and adults and  children are dying while in U.S. custody.   This is not who we are.   Immigrants from far and wide help build and better our Nation. They  have and will continue to be a source of strength to inspire us.   I stand with immigrants today, and I think we all should.
