 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the exceptional  achievement of Dance City, a local dance team based in north  Minneapolis, for their remarkable victory at Starpower National Talent  Competition.   The dedication, talent, and hard work demonstrated by the members of  Dance City have propelled them to extraordinary success on the national  stage, winning them first place in hip-hop, and first overall.   Faced with competition from over 100 teams around the country, the  Dance City girls rallied to the challenge and emerged with their well- deserved victory.   The director and coach of Dance City, Cierra Burnaugh, created her  studio to serve young Black girls in the Minneapolis community. May  their success continue to illuminate the path for future generations of  dancers. I could not be happier to have Minneapolis represented by  these bright young women.                            ____________________
