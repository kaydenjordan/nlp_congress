 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the 50th  anniversary of Milwaukee Metropolitan Community Church in Milwaukee,  WI, an inclusive Christian community of faith. Milwaukee Metropolitan  Community Church began as Prince of Peace Metropolitan Community Church  in 1971 under the leadership of Reverend Paul Sydman. It was renamed  Metropolitan Community Church in 1977 and finally Milwaukee  Metropolitan Community Church in 1993.   In its first 20 years, the church changed worship locations multiple  times within the city of Milwaukee and held services in other churches  before establishing its current home at 1239 West Mineral Street in  Milwaukee's Walker's Point neighborhood in 1993. With this purchase,  the church became the first LGBTQI+ organization to own property in the  city of Milwaukee, as well as the entire State of Wisconsin.   Milwaukee Metropolitan Community Church--MCC--is the oldest LGBTQI+  organization still in existence in Milwaukee and the State ofWisconsin.  The church was originally started to provide a place for LGBTQI+ people  to worship and has a long tradition of welcoming all people looking for  a spiritual place where they can feel welcomed and accepted. It became  a member of the Global Movement of Metropolitan Community Churches in  1984. This denomination was founded by the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and  Transgender--LGBT--community in 1968.   Current Pastor Reverend Tory V. Topjian began his pastorate as senior  minister on June 1, 2016. It was within his first 10 days of service  that the country and the LGBT community experienced the great tragedy  of the Pulse Night Club shooting in Orlando, FL. Reverend Tory and  Milwaukee Metropolitan Community Church took an active role in helping  the Milwaukee community grieve following the shooting.   In 2020, after waiting for nearly 20 years, both the Interfaith  Conference of Greater Milwaukee and the Wisconsin Council of Churches  finally recognized Metropolitan Community Churches to be a viable and  important community of faith. Milwaukee MCC was invited to sit on  councils of both these vital community organizations and offered a  well-deserved voice and vote.   Milwaukee Metropolitan Community Church, like most churches, adjusted  and adapted to the pandemic and its impact on church community since  the spring of 2020. Virtual worship and programming were offered to  keep the congregation safe while maintaining community.   The year 2021 marks 50 years since the beginning of this important  community within Milwaukee, WI, and the LGBTQ community. A welcoming  place for all, its foundation is built on community and inclusiveness.  Earlier this year, the Milwaukee Historical Society honored this  community being the oldest LGBTQI+ organization still in existence. Its  significance and impact on countless members over the years is  profound. Please join me in celebrating this historically and  spiritually important community.                            ____________________
