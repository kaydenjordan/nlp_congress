 Mr. President, today, I express my support for S. 937,  as amended by Senators Hirono and Collins.   Every single one of us is horrified to see our fellow Americans  attacked because of their race or ethnicity. We are united in our  opposition to this despicable violence and to seeing it investigated  and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I have introduced a  resolution to this effect and asked for a hearing to learn more about  Attorney General Garland's review of hate crimes committed against  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.   It is good to see my Democratic friends acknowledge that  bipartisanship is still the way to solve problems in the Senate. We  have come together and, with a bipartisan amendment, improved this bill  and made it more useful. We have gone beyond merely looking at COVID- related hate crimes to all hate crimes, and we have increased funding  for reporting hate crimes.   I would be remiss if I did not say that more bipartisanship could  have made the bill even better. I think a committee markup would have  been useful. I think if Democrats had allowed us to bring a Republican  amendment extending the Violence Against Women Act for a vote, that  would have been useful. Women are suffering from terrible violence  during this pandemic, and this was a missed opportunity.   Passing amendments by Senators Kennedy, Cruz, Lee, and Blackburn  [[Page S2148]]  would guarantee even more support for marginalized communities, by  ensuring Asian Americans are not discriminated against by institutions  of higher learning and that religious Americans are free to worship in  peace during the pandemic.   But I hope nonetheless that this is a moment where the Senate speaks  together about the importance of fighting hate crimes. We all believe  that, even though we have different ideas about the best way to do it.  This bill is the product of that collaboration. I will be voting for  it, and I hope my colleagues will do the same.
