 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Bud Olson of Teton County as Montanan of the Month for his  service to our country during World War II.   Bud was a member of the 82nd Airborne's 325th Glider Infantry  Regiment, which participated in Operation Overlord, better known as D- Day. During that fateful operation, the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment  sustained many crash landings, including Bud's glider.   Bud was the sole survivor after his glider crash landed. Following  this tragic event, Bud went on to help secure the bridge in Sainte- Mere-Eglise, which was the first village in France to be liberated by  the Allies. Bud continued his service in campaigns throughout France,  Holland, and Belgium and took part in the liberation of the Wobbelin  concentration camp.   Military service has always had an influence on Bud. He is a 60-year  member of the Choteau American Legion. For many years, Bud had ``D Day  44'' on the license plate of his car.   After the war, Bud returned to Teton County where he and his wife,  Vi, worked the family's ranch outside of Choteau and has been an active  member of his community. He served as a Teton County commissioner for  15 years, from 1965 to 1980. Bud has been an avid supporter of Choteau  School District's athletics program, attending games in town and even  traveling to cheer on his beloved Bulldogs.   Bud celebrated his 100th birthday on July 29, 2021. In celebration,  Choteau Mayor Chris Hindoein declared it ``Bud Olson Day.'' Residents  were encouraged to fly flags in honor of Bud and to wear maroon and  gold acknowledging his support of the Bulldogs.   Bud epitomizes the heart of a veteran--a Montana hero--whose selfless  service will not be forgotten. On behalf of a grateful nation, I want  to thank Bud for his service to our country, and I wish him a very  happy 100th birthday.                            ____________________
