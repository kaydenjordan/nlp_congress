 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago today  in the midst of the Great Recession, millions of credit card holders  got some needed relief when President Obama signed into law the Credit  Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act, the CARD Act.   Before the CARD Act, some banks took advantage of their customers.  For example, they raised rates and changed the terms of contracts  without any notice to the customer. They even raised rates  retroactively on existing balances.   The CARD Act changed that, barring many unfair and deceptive  practices: no more retroactive rate hikes, no more extra fees for  paying bills online or on the phone, no more aggressive marketing  tactics targeting young people.   The CARD Act has saved consumers an estimated $12 billion a year,  which translates into well over $100 billion in total savings over the  past decade. It is the first 10 years, and we are celebrating this  consumer protection act.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to revise and extend her remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I thank the chair for  her strong support and leadership on the Consumers First Act, H.R.  1500. I urge everyone to vote ``yes'' on this if they care about  protecting consumers from abuse.   Putting Mick Mulvaney in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau was the epitome of a fox guarding the henhouse. We have to undo  all of the damage he did while he was Acting Director of the CFPB.   The CFPB was supposed to, and did, protect consumers and returned a  great deal of money to consumers. All of these protections, or many of  them, he deleted. What this bill does is restore these protections to  consumers.   Let me remind my colleagues of why the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau was created. It was after the worst financial crisis in our  history, where our people lost over $15 trillion in household wealth.  They lost their homes, or they lost their jobs. It was completely  preventable because those were abuses to the financial system.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was a Bureau that was  directed to protect consumers. Consumers were an afterthought, a  secondary thought, a third thought, or not thought about at all in  financial regulation. The whole system exists for consumers, and they  certainly are entitled to be protected from unfair, abusive practices.   To give an example, I was particularly concerned about his hostility  to data. Decisions should be based on data. Under Director Cordray, the  Bureau published a report on the effects of the Credit CARD Act, which  I authored. They would publish it every 2 years.   Mr. Chairman, this is an incredibly important bill, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record an article I wrote for The Hill  about the CARD Act.                       [From The Hill, May 22, 2019]      CARD Act Turns 10: Changes Have Kept Money in Consumers' Pockets                   (By Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.))         Ten years ago, on May 22, 2009, credit card customers got       some needed relief when the Credit Card Accountability       Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act became law. Since       then, the law has saved consumers an estimated $12 billion a       year, which translates into well over $100 billion in total       savings over the past decade. As The New York Times reported,       the CARD Act proved so effective that it led economists       studying the law to a single conclusion: ``The regulation       worked.''        Before the CARD Act, some credit card companies took       advantage of their customers by raising interest rates or       changing the terms of their contracts without notice. Hidden       terms and fees were lucrative for credit card companies but       they were extremely costly to consumers. However, the new law       was revolutionary, establishing strict rules for how credit       card companies must treat their customers, barring many       unfair practices. On the 10th anniversary of the CARD Act, it       is important to remember how far we have come and also to       look ahead to changes we still need to make.        So what did the CARD Act do? For starters, it protected       consumers from arbitrary interest-rate increases by       prohibiting retroactive rate hikes. Companies now are       required to provide 45 days' notice of a rate increase and       cannot raise rates on existing balances. In the past,       companies regularly increased your interest rate if your risk       profile worsened--now they are required to decrease rates if       your credit picture brightens. That is only fair.        But consumers were also getting socked by a host of fees,       so the CARD Act introduced some commonsense changes that made       it much less likely that consumers would be hit by these       fees. The law requires companies to mail credit card bills at       least 21 days before the due date; it prohibits companies       from charging extra fees for paying online or by phone; and       it requires companies to apply payments to balances with the       highest interest rate first. All of these changes save       consumers money.        The law protects young people from aggressive marketing       tactics. Companies no longer can sell cards to individuals       under the age of 21 without an adult co-signer.        The law also protects consumers when they cancel their       credit card. In the past, a company could demand immediate       payment of your balance. Now, a customer has five years to       pay off the balance.        These important changes have kept money in consumers'       pockets. The next battle is to institute fair, common-sense       regulation of the overdraft fees on bank accounts. Some       financial institutions use ``overdraft protection'' to slap       their customers with exorbitant fees. With the growing use of       debit cards, it's easier than ever to overdraw a checking       account, with fees that can run as high as a 17,000 percent       annual percentage rate, according to the Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau. That's not a financial service--it's a       robbery.        That is why, since 2005, I have been introducing       legislation that would ban abusive overdraft practices like       reordering transactions in order to maximize the number of       fees banks can charge, and to require overdraft fees to be       proportional to the size of the overdraft--no more $35       overdraft fees for a $2 cup of coffee. My bill would also       require banks to notify consumers that a purchase or an ATM       withdrawal is about to trigger an overdraft, and provide       consumers with a choice of whether to accept the overdraft       service and fee. That, like the CARD Act, would prevent       millions of Americans from unwittingly losing money to their       banks.        Opponents of the CARD Act said that trying to limit the       fees credit card companies charged would prove unsuccessful       and that companies would just create new fees, But that has       not happened.        So when people tell me that regulation does not work and is       costly, I remind them that well-crafted consumer protections       will not only work, but can save Americans tens of billions       of dollars. The CARD Act is proof.                                time  1230
