 Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act is  vital to the national security of the United States, as is border  security and energy dominance. I am very pleased we are making strides  into these areas with the passage of the NDAA and continue to  strengthen and have a dominant military.   This NDAA includes significant resources to counter China in the  Indo-Pacific, requires the DOD to identify and mitigate land purchases  near military installations, and makes certain the United States  continues to have the world's superior fighting force.   This legislation also funds the National Guard's border security  deployment mission and rejects the Biden administration's plan to  shrink our U.S. Navy.   This bill includes language to require allies to provide proportional  levels of funding for the Ukraine conflict, alleviating the burden on  U.S. taxpayers, yet fortifying the Ukraine freedom fighters.   Importantly, it supports our servicemembers with a 5.2 percent pay  increase, the largest raise in 20 years.   This NDAA strengthens the national security of the United States as  well as the world, and I am pleased to have supported it.                            ____________________
