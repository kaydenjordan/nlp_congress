 Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the life  of Sally J. Michel, a lifelong activist, a staunch advocate for  underprivileged children and Baltimore's parks, and a Baltimore icon  and friend. Sally passed away last week, and while I join with all of  Baltimore in mourning her passing, I also celebrate the lasting impact  her legacy will have on generations of Marylanders to come.   Sally grew up in Roanoke, VA, before attending Goucher College and  settling down with her husband, Robert ``Butch'' Michel, in Baltimore,  where she immediately began devoting her life to our city. She began by  joining the renowned volunteer organization, the Junior League. By  1973, Sally was the Baltimore chapter's president. She used her  position to sponsor a national conference she called For Children's  Sake, which brought together leaders in education, healthcare, and more  to discuss the most pressing needs of America's children and how best  local communities can address them. She brought those ideas home to  Baltimore, often serving as an ambassador for children's welfare issues  across the city.   Her seemingly boundless energy for community service earned the  attention and trust of then-Mayor William Donald Schaefer, who  entrusted Sally with hosting a monthly dinner wherein Baltimore  citizens of all professions and backgrounds were invited to come, eat,  and exchange their ideas for how to improve the city. Sally hosted  these dinners for more than a decade, cultivating hundreds of new,  innovative ideas for bettering Baltimore's schools and neighborhoods  and ensuring that those ideas were executed. Attendees often said that  Sally's dinners made them feel more connected with their city and as  though their experiences and insights truly mattered to the city's  leadership. That is what Sally did best, bring people together and make  sure they knew they were important. Her unparalleled talent for making  Baltimore's residents feel heard, loved, and supported was a gift to us  all.   Later, in the 1980s, Sally turned her focus to improving Baltimore's  public parks. She believed our outdoor spaces were the key to bringing  and keeping communities together and provided critical safe spaces for  children to play and develop active lifestyles. Toward that end, she  founded two Baltimore mainstays: the local Outward Bound School and the  now-legendary Parks and People Foundation.   The Parks and People Foundation was Sally's labor of love. The  foundation invests in Baltimore's parks, gardens, and afterschool  activities and has been so wildly successful that it has become a model  for urban park advocacy nationwide. I was proud to have worked with the  Parks and People Foundation to establish bike trails through our city.  One of the foundation's flagship achievements was the creation of the  SuperKids Camp, a children's literacy program designed specifically to  help elementary school children falling behind their reading level.  Sally always saw the children that were being overlooked and  underserved, and she used the SuperKids program to make sure that they  felt seen. She inspired and supported kids who would have otherwise  lacked the resources to catch up with their peers, and for that, a  grateful city will always remember her. My granddaughter Julia  volunteered at one such camp over the summer, and she spoke with pride  of how many lives she saw positively impacted by their good work.   In the 80 years Sally was with us, she served on the board of  trustees for 57 different State and local organizations. Of those 57,  she chaired 19, including the Baltimore City Planning Commission. In  addition to the programs mentioned, she was a key figure in  establishing the Baltimore School for the Arts, and to date, her  SuperKids Camp program has served more than 30,000 children. The  Outward Bound School has served more than 62,000.   Perhaps most impressive of all, everything that Sally accomplished,  she accomplished free of charge. Sally was never a paid advocate, but a  volunteer, and when asked about her decades of service, she commented  that she received ``psychic income'' and was more than satisfied with  that. Sally's extreme generosity of spirit and selfless devotion to our  community is one of many reasons Baltimore so acutely feels the weight  of her passing. She was a hero to the tens of thousands of children who  benefited from her altruism and creative problem-solving. She was  Baltimore's guardian angel, always there to watch over, protect, and  support the city's families whenever they needed her most.   Sally was fueled by raw empathy and compassion. She took genuine joy  in other people's successes. Beyond her impressive list of  achievements, she was, above all, a kind and generous soul. It is a  tragedy for our city that such a soul was taken from us too soon. Sally  battled Alzheimer's for nearly 10 years, one of the cruelest, most  difficult diseases there is. Sally met it head-on, as she did with  every other challenge she ever faced. I am committed to honoring her  life by fighting for more Federal funds toward curing Alzheimer's and  devising better therapies for managing its symptoms. Sally's story  reminds us that resources for medical research and institutions like  the National Institutes of Health are absolutely critical and that,  when we fail to invest in them, we fail good people like Sally.   That kind of failure is inexcusable because Sally never failed us.  She rose above and beyond in all that she did. Her commitment to  activism and community service was unmatched and led directly to some  of Baltimore's most successful and lasting programs. For that reason  and so many others, Sally's absence will be sorely felt; yet her  presence, through the families she touched and through the fingerprints  she left all across our city, is felt all the more and will be for  decades to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today in great sadness to address  the passing of Senator John McCain, which marks a deep loss for this  country, for his State of Arizona, and, above all, for his family and  friends.   John McCain was an honorable public servant who sacrificed greatly to  serve his country in uniform, and as a lawmaker, he proudly represented  the people of Arizona.   I will always remember the bipartisan luncheon that we had when  Senator McCain recounted his experiences as a prisoner of war in  Vietnam. There wasn't a dry eye in our caucus.   In my visit to Vietnam, I had a chance to visit the Hanoi Hilton, and  I saw firsthand the place where John McCain acted so bravely. He was  truly an American hero.   I would like to express my deepest sympathies and condolences at this  difficult time to Cindy, their children, and their family.   In his final letter to Americans, Senator McCain reminded us:         We are citizens of the world's greatest republic, a nation       of ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a       blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals       at home and in the world.    For nearly a dozen years in the Senate, I have watched my friend  Senator McCain live and act by those ideals on behalf of the American  people and on behalf of our global community. John was my enduring  partner in standing up for universal rights and advancing core American  values. John always expressed his views with passion but respected  civility. He represented the best of the Senate, working across party  lines to get issues resolved.   The Senate has lost a great patriot and a role model for Senators.  The Nation has lost a strong, effective leader for American values.  Arizona has lost a Senator who loved the State and the people he  represented. I, along with many Members--all the Members of this  Chamber--have lost a friend.   Today John's faith in American ideals endures with the Sergei and  Global Magnitsky acts. With these two laws, the United States stands in  solidarity with Sergei Magnitsky from Russia, David Kato from Uganda,  Berta Caceres from Honduras, and the many unsung and unnamed people  around the world who have suffered human rights abuses for uncovering  corruption and fighting for freedom, equal justice, and dignity.   It was John who insisted we ensure that corrupt leaders were held  accountable for their crimes. He truly believed that public officials  have a responsibility to serve and protect their citizenry from harm,  and he had a particular disdain for officials who instead chose to  exploit their citizens for personal enrichment.   Anyone who knew John knows of his disdain for one of the most corrupt  leaders of our time, Vladimir Putin. It was the Putin regime's ruthless  torture and murder of Sergei Magnitsky, after Sergei exposed their  corruption, as well as the regime's repeated attacks on the Russian  people, that inspired Senator McCain and me to work together on the  Magnitsky law. I thank Senator McCain for giving me that opportunity,  for giving me the strength to develop a strategy where we could, in  fact, enact not only the original Magnitsky statute but the Global  Magnitsky statute, which truly provided the U.S. leadership globally.  Many other countries have followed our leadership.   After Vladimir Putin attacked our 2016 elections, Senator McCain  worked with me and others to ensure a new, tough sanctions regime  against Mr. Putin and his oligarchs for their insidious attacks on our  democracy. Senator McCain fought to ensure that our efforts to hold  Russia accountable for these actions made it into law. Just last month,  he joined a bipartisan group of Senators again toward the same goal,  given Mr. Putin's persistent attacks on our democratic system.   Senator McCain and I worked alongside one another to address the  genocide against the Rohingya community in Rakhine, Burma, orchestrated  by the Burmese military. Last Saturday, August 25, marked 1 year since  the outbreak of violence in western Rakhine State, which has resulted  in the mass exodus of over 700,000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh.  In response to this violence and crimes against humanity perpetrated  against the Rohingya community, Senator McCain and I introduced the  Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act.   Senator McCain would stand up for people anywhere in the world who  were victimized by human rights violations.   Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza wrote yesterday that John was  ``an idealist. . . . He believed in his principles and was prepared to  stand on them--regardless of party, convenience, or political  advantage.''   Mr. Kara-Murza has been poisoned twice in Russia as a result of his  standing up against Mr. Putin.   I remember John doing just that during our Foreign Relations  Committee 2013 debate on whether we should arm the rebels in Syria. He  passionately argued that we should do more to support them against  Bashar Assad's ``butchery.''   In 2016, as the Assad regime mercilessly pummeled rebels in Aleppo,  McCain said: ``The name of Aleppo will echo through history . . . as a  testament to our moral failure and everlasting shame.'' Senator McCain  called  [[Page S5998]]  it the way he saw it. He called out what was happening.   John also stood for his ideals as a leader on comprehensive  immigration reform. I remember first coming to the Senate in 2007 and  working on comprehensive immigration reform with Senator McCain,  Senator Kennedy, and President Bush. That legislation ultimately did  not pass, but it showed me that Senator McCain was a serious legislator  who was willing to work across the aisle to get things done.   Senator Kennedy died in 2009 of the same form of brain cancer that  Senator McCain succumbed to this past weekend. They both died on August  25.   In 2013, Senator McCain was part of the Gang of 8, along with Senator  Schumer--the bipartisan group of Senators who wrote a 2013 measure to  overhaul the country's immigration system and border security. I  supported that bill, which passed in the Senate but sadly was never  taken up in the House, although we all know there was enough support in  the House to pass that legislation.   Senator McCain believed in working together to get things done. He  listened and fought passionately for what he believed in, but he wanted  to make sure we got things done in the best tradition of the Senate as  the greatest deliberative body in the world. Senator McCain lived by  that tradition.   In his memoir, Senator McCain said that his failure to enact  comprehensive immigration reform was ``a harder disappointment than  other defeats.''   He continued:         We failed twice, and then once more after Ted had passed       away, despite big majorities in both houses of Congress in       favor of it. . . . I'd like to say I'll try again. But that       is not up to me anymore. . . . That's a harder disappointment       than other defeats have been because first, it's something       that most Americans want, and most members of Congress know       is the right thing to do.    He always called it the way he saw it. He showed his passion, but  respected civility.   The Senate and the American people have lost in John McCain a man who  was the very definition of service to his country. I will miss John  terribly, and I hope all Americans will pause today to remember his  legacy and admire his courage.   I yield the floor.
