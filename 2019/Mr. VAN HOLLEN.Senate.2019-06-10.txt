 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Jim Kurth  for his 41 years of public service and congratulate him on his recent  retirement.  [[Page S3282]]    On May 7, 1978, Mr. James Kurth was hired by the U.S. Forest Service  as a biological technician having recently graduated with a degree in  wildlife management from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. On  Friday, May 31, Jim retired from public service, after a 41-year  career, working mainly with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He  ended his career after serving more than 4 years as the agency's deputy  director for operations.   Jim's story is an inspiring example of dedication to the vital  mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He grew up in Columbus,  OH. He married his high school sweetheart. He picked a career in public  service, quickly finding his way to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  and moving his family across the country as he accepted positions at  Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge, Arthur R. Marshall  Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in Florida, Bogue Chitto National  Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana, Seney National Wildlife Refuge in  Michigan, and Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge in Rhode Island. From  there, he jumped to Alaska where he became manager of the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge, the Nation's largest protected land area at  nearly 20 million acres.   He left Alaska in 1999 and journeyed to the Nation's Capital, to take  the position of deputy chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System,  the world's largest system of protected lands and waters, including  Maryland's Blackwater, Eastern Neck, and Patuxent National Wildlife  Refuges. He served as deputy chief for 11 years and then chief for  nearly 4 years before accepting the job as the Service's deputy  director in 2015.   Former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe said, ``Jim  served as my Deputy twice. Once when I was Refuge Chief, and again when  I was Director. He was fond of saying, `It's better to have a Deputy  than be a Deputy' but Jim was much more. He was a friend and mentor.  The kind of person who would tell you what you needed to hear, not what  you wanted to hear. His strength is his character and deep and  authentic concern for the people who do the organization's work.'' A  culture of character and integrity in an organization like the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service grows through the examples of principled  conduct from those in positions of authority.   For 41 years, Jim Kurth served the American people. His legacy is in  the legions of people whom he has mentored and in the millions of acres  of habitat he has helped conserve for wildlife and for people.   On May 31, 2019, Jim Kurth retired from public service. We are better  as a nation for his service, and we take a moment to celebrate his  career and his example of public service.                            ____________________
