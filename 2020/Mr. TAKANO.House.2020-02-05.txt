 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4305) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry  out a pilot program on dog training therapy, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4305         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Puppies Assisting Wounded       Servicemembers for Veterans Therapy Act'' or the ``PAWS for       Veterans Therapy Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) According to the analyses of veteran suicide published       by the Department of Veterans Affairs in August 2016 and       titled ``Suicide Among Veterans and Other Americans'', and in       June 2018, titled ``VA National Suicide Date Report''--        (A) an average of 20 veterans died by suicide each day in       2014;        (B) mental health disorders, including major depression and       other mood disorders, have been associated with increased       risk for suicide;        (C) since 2001, the proportion of users of the Veterans       Health Administration with mental health conditions or       substance use disorders has increased from approximately 27       percent in 2001 to more than 40 percent in 2014; and        (D) overall, suicide rates are highest among patients with       mental health and substance use disorder diagnoses who are in       treatment and lower among those who received a mental health       diagnosis but were not at risk enough to require enhanced       care from a mental health provider.        (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs must be more       effective in its approach to reducing the burden of veteran       suicide connected to mental health disorders, including post-      traumatic stress disorder (in this section referred to as       ``PTSD''), and new, rigorous scientific research provides       persuasive weight to the growing anecdotal evidence that       service dogs ameliorate the symptoms associated with PTSD,       and in particular, help prevent veteran suicide.        (3) Several organizations have proven track records of       training service dogs for veterans with severe PTSD and       dramatically improving those veterans' quality of life,       ability to re-enter society, and, most importantly, their       chances of survival.       SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PILOT PROGRAM ON DOG                     TRAINING THERAPY.         (a) In General.--Commencing not later than 120 days after       the date of the enactment of the Act, subject to the       availability of appropriations, the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall carry out a pilot program under which the       Secretary shall make grants to one or more appropriate non-      government entities for the purpose of assessing the       effectiveness of addressing post-deployment mental health and       post-traumatic stress disorder (in this section referred to       as ``PTSD'') symptoms through a therapeutic medium of       training service dogs for veterans with disabilities.        (b) Duration of Pilot Program.--The pilot program required       by subsection (a) shall be carried out during the five-year       period beginning on the date of the commencement of the pilot       program.        (c) Conditions on Receipt of Grants.--As a condition of       receiving a grant under this section, a non-government entity       shall--        (1) submit to the Secretary certification that the entity       is an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that--        (A) provides service dogs to veterans with PTSD; and        (B) is accredited by, or adheres to standards comparable to       those of, an accrediting organization with demonstrated       experience, national scope, and recognized leadership and       expertise in the training of service dogs and education in       the use of service dogs;        (2) agree to cover all costs in excess of the grant amount;        (3) agree to reaccept or replace the service dog the       organization provided to the veteran, if necessary, as       determined by the organization and the veteran;        (4) provide a wellness certification from a licensed       veterinarian for any dog participating in the program;        (5) employ at least one person with clinical experience       related to mental health;        (6) ensure that veterans participating in the pilot program       receive training from certified service dog training       instructors for a period of time determined appropriate by       the organization and the Secretary, including service skills       to address or alleviate symptoms unique to veterans' needs;        (7) agree to provide both lectures on service dog training       methodologies and practical hands-on training and grooming of       service dogs;        (8) agree that in hiring service dog training instructors       to carry out training under the pilot program, the non-      government entity will give a preference to veterans who have       successfully graduated from PTSD or other residential       treatment program and who have received adequate       certification in service dog training;        (9) agree not to use shock collars or prong collars as       training tools and to use positive reinforcement training;        (10) agree that upon the conclusion of training provided       using the grant funds--        (A) the veteran who received the training will keep the dog       unless the veteran and the veteran's health provider decide       it is not in the best interest of the veteran;        (B) if the veteran does not opt to own the dog, the entity       will be responsible for caring for and appropriately placing       the dog;        (C) the Department of Veterans Affairs will have no       additional responsibility to provide for any benefits under       this section; and        (D) the Department of Veterans Affairs will have no       liability with respect to the dog;        (11) provide follow-up support service for the life of the       dog, including a contact plan between the veteran and the       entity to allow the veteran to reach out for and receive       adequate help with the service dog and the organization to       communicate with the veteran to ensure the service dog is       being properly cared for; and        (12) submit to the Secretary an application containing such       information, certification, and assurances as the Secretary       may require.        (d) Veteran Eligibility.--        (1) In general.--For the purposes of this section, an       eligible veteran is a veteran who--        (A) is enrolled in the patient enrollment system in the       Department of Veterans Affairs under section 1705 of title       38, United States Code;        (B) has been recommended for the pilot program under this       section by a qualified health care provider or clinical team       based on the medical judgment that the veteran may       potentially benefit from participating; and        (C) agrees to successfully complete training provided by an       eligible organization that receives a grant under this       section.        (2) Relationship to participation in other program.--      Veterans may participate in the pilot program in conjunction       with the compensated work therapy program of the Department       of Veterans Affairs.        (3) Continuing eligibility requirement.--To remain eligible       to participate in the program, a veteran shall see the health       care provider or clinical team of the Department of Veterans       Affairs treating the veteran for PTSD at least once every six       months to determine, based on a clinical evaluation of       efficacy, whether the veteran continues to benefit from the       program.        (e) Collection of Data.--In carrying out this section, the       Secretary shall--        (1) develop metrics and other appropriate means to measure,       with respect to veterans participation in the program, the       improvement in psychosocial function and therapeutic       compliance of such veterans and changes with respect to the       dependence on prescription narcotics and psychotropic       medication of such veterans;        (2) establish processes to document and track the progress       of such veterans under the program in terms of the benefits       and improvements noted as a result of the program; and        (3) in addition, the Secretary shall continue to collect       these data over the course of five years for each veteran who       has continued with the dog he or she has personally trained.        (f) GAO Briefing and Study.--        (1) Briefing.--Not later than one year after the date of       the commencement of the pilot program under subsection (a),       the Comptroller General of the United States shall provide to       the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate a briefing on the methodology       established for the program.

[[Page H778]]      Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4305, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Puppies Assisting Wounded  Servicemembers for Veterans Therapy Act, otherwise known as the PAWS  Act, introduced by Representative Stivers of Ohio.   This bill has more than 300 cosponsors, which put it on the Consensus  Calendar. It reflects this Chamber's desire to pass legislation  addressing veterans' mental health, which I strongly support.   The bill calls for the VA to establish a 5-year pilot program to make  grants available to appropriate nongovernmental entities ``for the  purpose of assessing the effectiveness of addressing post-deployment  mental health and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms through a  therapeutic medium of training service dogs for veterans with  disabilities.''   Mr. Speaker, I think everyone in this room today can agree that  dogs--and animals, more broadly speaking--make great companions. In  fact, in 2018, Americans spent $72 billion on their pets. Years of  research have illustrated numerous positive health outcomes, such as  lowering blood pressure.   I intend to vote ``yes'' on this bill; however, I do have concerns  about this bill becoming law before VA's study examining the possible  therapeutic benefits of veterans with PTSD receiving either a service  dog or an emotional support dog is complete.   Service dogs and emotional support dogs are very different, and it is  important that we understand the efficacy of providing veterans with  PTSD with either type of dog. Relying on the dog for companionship is  far different than using dogs as a form of behavioral health treatment.   Mr. Speaker, like any other treatment, therapy, or pharmaceutical  provided to veterans, research must be performed so informed policy and  treatment decisions can be made. A draft monograph outlining VA's  findings is complete and currently undergoing peer review by the  National Academy of Sciences. The VA anticipates having a final report  to Congress not later than the end of July 2020.   Before this bill was placed on the Consensus Calendar, I had hoped to  wait to have the findings of this study so that we could properly  review and mark up this legislation, ensuring veterans receive  effective, evidence-based treatments for PTSD.   Mr. Speaker, we are passing this legislation without scientific  evidence supporting the effectiveness of service dogs for the treatment  of PTSD. However, I support this bill because its placement on the  Consensus Calendar reflects the will of the Members of this Chamber,  and years of research have shown positive health outcomes related to  owning dogs for companionship.   When we receive the study, I intend to work with our Senate  colleagues to improve and strengthen this legislation so that we can  ensure veterans diagnosed with PTSD receive effective treatments.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Slotkin), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   I ask my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 4305, as amended, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
