 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my amendment with Chairman  Smith, with Chairman Schiff, and Representative Jayapal, to finally end  the humanitarian disaster in Yemen that has been going on year after  year.   Our amendment would end all U.S. logistical support and transfer of  spare parts for Saudi warplanes that are bombing Yemen; that are  bombing schools; that are killing children; that are bombing civilians  in the largest humanitarian crisis around the world.   Now, this body passed the War Powers Resolution to say that we would  not be aiding the Saudi offensive in Yemen. President Trump suspended  the fueling of those planes, and President Biden made that policy  formal.   And yet, the Saudis have not listened. Yet, they have a blockade  where, just last month, in August, in the Port of Hodeidah, no fuel was  let in. They come and they tell the United States one thing: We are  letting fuel in. They lie, again and again they lie.   There is a reason the 9/11 families wanted transparency and the  decommissioning of the reports. There is a reason there was outrage in  all of this country when they brutally murdered Khashoggi.   They need accountability, and we are not going to use taxpayer  dollars to give them equipment for their planes to bomb Yemeni's kids.   Now of course the Houthis are to blame as well. No one says the  Houthis are blameless. Of course they are to blame, and of course they  have had human rights violations.   But the point is, the United States should not be making this war  continue by arming or by giving parts to the Saudis that end up  facilitating the conflict or elongating the conflict and killing  people. It is time for the Saudis to recognize what everyone  recognizes, that they have lost in Yemen. It is time for them to end  the blockade, and it is time for them to allow a peace process that has  a ceasefire in Yemen and a civilian government, instead of trying to  win this by force.   So I hope that everyone who supported our amendment last time--it  passed 240-185 in this body--Jake Sullivan, who is the National  Security Council Adviser; Wendy Sherman, who is the Deputy Secretary of  State; Rob Malley, who is the envoy to Iran, all supported it. So I  hope the administration will support it this time, that it won't get  stripped out of conference; and that it will pass, and we will finally  begin to end this war.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished chair of the Intelligence  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I will end with this. A year ago, this  exact amendment passed this body 240-185. The war has only gotten  worse. Saudi Arabia has not lived up to its commitment to lift the  blockade. The Saudis have not lived up to their commitment to stop the  offensive strikes.   I hope that this amendment will pass with an even bigger majority  this time, and I hope the people in the administration, who supported  this amendment as private civilians, will support it in their current  roles.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
