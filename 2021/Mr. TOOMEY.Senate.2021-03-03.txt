 Madam President, the circumstances that we face today in  the Senate are so disturbing. This is really, really unbelievable. I  mean, there is so much good news out there on the healthcare front, on  the pandemic front, on the economic front. But what we are going to do  in this Chamber is absolutely, absolutely appalling.   The Members of this Chamber came together five times last year and  passed overwhelmingly bipartisan bills to deal with this pandemic, to  deal with the economic crisis that came from the lockdown that we  experienced--five times, about $4 trillion, completely unprecedented in  scope and scale, the nature of it. Never imagined before, but we did  it. We did it because we needed to, and we came together. I think it  was the biggest of the bills passed--the biggest by far--without a  single ``no'' vote in this whole Chamber, completely bipartisan.   So President Biden gets elected, gives a great speech, a great  inaugural speech, about uniting the country, coming together: We don't  have to be divided the way we have been. We can work together and find  common ground.   So 10 Republican Senators go down to the White House and say: Well,  Mr. President, I know you would like to do $1.9 trillion, whatever it  is, but we think there is a good case for $600 billion.   Now, I don't happen to agree with those 10 Republican Senators, as it  happens. I don't think even that is appropriate, but they did. And the  reason that is significant is that there were 10 of them, which just so  happens to be exactly the minimum number needed of Republican Senators  to join with the Democrats to pass anything they want on a bipartisan  basis. So there, handed to him on a silver platter, to the President,  was the opportunity to do a bipartisan bill to figure out where that  common ground was. The Republicans were offering to negotiate from  there. This probably could have ended easily at $1 trillion or so after  just weeks before passing a $1 trillion bill. The President could have  gotten so much of what he wanted, but President Biden didn't want any  part of that. You have to ask yourself, why is that when he campaigned  as the guy who is going to unify America, and he had every Republican  vote he needed sitting in his office, asking him to work this out? He  said: No, not interested. Effectively, that is what he said.    Well, when you look at the bill, it is clear why President Biden  chose this path, because there is no justification for this bill. There  is no medical justification. There is no pandemic justification. There  is no economic justification. This isn't about coming together and  doing something about a crisis; this is about a partisan leftwing wish  list. And, of course, Republicans aren't interested in that kind of  political gesturing that is going to do economic damage.   I am reminded of the words of Rahm Emanuel, who famously said: ``You  never want a serious crisis to go to waste.'' Rahm Emanuel must be very  proud of our Democratic colleagues and President Biden because what  they have done is they have taken a crisis that is rapidly receding-- let's be honest--and they decided this is their chance to make one last  mad dash to the door with a staggering amount of money and presumably  claim credit for the recovery that is already well underway.   The good news is--there is a lot of good news, right? We went through  one of the most trying times we have been through in a very long time  in this country. This pandemic was devastating. It was deadly, it was  scary, and the economic crisis was very, very real. But now we have  over 100 million doses of vaccines that have gone into people's arms.  You figure that we might very well have 100 million Americans who have  had the disease and recovered. We have to have well over half of the  American population who has either recovered or been vaccinated and is  therefore no longer at risk to this disease--not a significant risk.  That is fantastic news.   By the way, the vaccine administration is accelerating. Following  that, we are unsurprisingly seeing this terrific collapse in the number  of new cases. The daily count of new cases of the coronavirus, of  COVID-19, peaked at around 250,000 new cases in a single day. We were  running at that pace. By the time we got to the inauguration of  President Biden, we were down to 185,000, and yesterday was about  60,000. So we are less than a quarter of the number of new cases on a  daily basis that we were experiencing at the peak, and it continues to  drop. It is going to continue to decline probably very rapidly as we  continue to roll out these vaccines. That is terrific.   There is a sort of parallel recovery of the economy underway. If you  go back to April of 2020, when it was at its worst, the unemployment  rate was almost 15 percent, 14.8 percent. That is a terrible, terrible  unemployment rate. As of January of this year, just a few months ago,  the unemployment rate was 6.3 percent, less than half of where we were.  We are not back to the fantastic economy we had a year ago just before  this pandemic broke, but we are getting there. Eighteen States across  the country have unemployment rates below 5 percent, so we are going to  get there.   The economy is growing. After a collapse in the second quarter of  last year, the third quarter came roaring back, and the fourth quarter  grew. The Congressional Budget Office thinks that in this whole  calendar year of 2021, our economy will grow almost 5 percent. Most  private economists think it will be more than that. There is a lively  debate about whether we will even reach 6 or 7 or more percent growth.  We were told never again to expect to see 3 percent. But that is how  strong this economic recovery is because of the resiliency of the  American people, the tremendous ingenuity of the private sector to come  up with vaccines that are incredibly effective--several of them--and do  it in a record time, I mean a fraction of what was the previous record  time. It is amazing.   And yes, you know what, we played a role in this too. I think we did.  The bipartisan cooperation of Congress to pass one bill after another  on a huge scale--like I said, five bills. The biggest was without a  single dissenting--actually, I am not sure any of them had a dissenting  vote in the Senate. And there was almost a trillion dollars in  December, leaving tens of billions of dollars that we approved that  haven't even been spent yet. The intended beneficiaries haven't gotten  the money yet. It takes a little while to get the money out the door.   Given this context, given this history, this is why it is so  dispiriting to see our Democratic colleagues insisting on a bill that  has almost nothing to do with COVID. That is the truth. It is not about  reopening the economy; it is a partisan leftwing spending binge. That  is what it is. Let's take a look at some of the individual items.   We have these so-called stimulus checks--I never heard anything more  inaptly named--$414 billion. The fact is, real, personal income in the  country  [[Page S1017]]  today is higher than it was just before the pandemic. Disposable, real,  per capita income rose at its highest rate since 1984. Personal savings  rate hit an alltime record high in 2020. Why? Because we more than  replaced lost income through all of the bills that we passed. What  about that data suggests we need another round of universal payments to  people? It is not going to stimulate the economy. Even the last check-- 60 percent of that money went to savings accounts or paying down debt.  According to a Penn Wharton study, about 75 percent of these checks are  going to go into savings.   Why in the world are we sending so many checks to tens of millions of  people who never had any lost income? Under this bill, the Federal  Government is going to send out $5,600 to a family of four--$5,600 to a  family of four who makes $160,000 a year and never had a dime of income  loss, no interruption of income, no loss of income. They are going to  get $5,600. By the way, that is on top of the $5,800 they already got  last year, with no need, no demonstrated problem here. So $11,400 of  money that we don't have, we are going to send to people who never had  a dime of lost income. That is a big chunk of this bill.   It may not be the worst. It may be that the worst is the $350 billion  we are going to send to State and local governments to bail out the  mismanaged blue States and cities. The amazing thing is, you can't  possibly make the case that they need the bailout. They don't even need  it. Why do I say that? Well, if you look in 2020--the books are closed  now. We know what we didn't know early in the year of 2020. We are in  2021 now. We know what happened in 2020.   What happened was States and municipalities in the aggregate brought  in more revenue in 2020 than they did in 2019, which was a record year.  So they set an alltime new record for tax revenue collected--alltime  new record. And that does not include the $500 billion we sent them  anyway. I mean, these States are loaded with cash. I don't know what  they are going to do with it   There is $60 billion in rainy day funds. We heard: Oh my goodness,  these States are going to have to cut essential services. All the  teachers are going to be laid off. The firemen and the police officers  are all done.   How is that when they have taken in more revenue than they ever have  before in their history and then we sent them another $500 billion? Now  we are going to send them yet another $350 on top of this? How does  this make any sense at all? We are going to borrow or print this money  so we can send it to a bunch of States, many of which are sitting on so  much cash, they are going to probably cut taxes. It is just  unbelievable.   Then there is the ObamaCare expansion. What does that have to do with  COVID? This is just a decade-long goal of our Democratic colleagues to  continue the endless expansion of ObamaCare. There is $45 billion in  this bill to pay insurance companies more money to cover people who  already have health insurance. That is what they are doing. Sixty-three  percent of these new subsidies will go to people who already have  health insurance through ObamaCare. By the way, it includes huge  numbers of people who make over $100,000 a year. Never miss a chance to  make more people dependent on government.   It has policies, big policies, that will absolutely slow the economic  recovery. Let me be clear. This bill will slow down the economic  recovery underway. Why do I say that? Well, the bill insists on adding  $400 a week on top of whatever States are paying in unemployment  benefits. Well, what does that mean? It means that more than half of  everyone who is unemployed is going to get paid more not to work than  they get paid working. Who could even think this up?   We have had unemployment insurance for decades in this country. We  have never said: Let's systematically make sure that people can make  more money not working than they can make if they go to work.   I hear some of my colleagues talk about the dignity of work. I think  there is a lot of dignity in work. What is our message to people about  the dignity of work when we say: You are worth more to us sitting on  the couch than you are at your job. That is what this is. It is a  terrible idea.   How do you know for sure that nobody on the other side is even  pretending that this is really about the economic recovery? Well, you  know for sure because the Congressional Budget Office has told us that  only a fraction--a small fraction--of this money is even going to be  spent this year. How long do we think the pandemic is going to be with  us as a pandemic? How long do we think we are going to have these  lockdowns? We are going to be out of the woods pretty soon here.   As I said, half of all Americans have already been either vaccinated  or recovered from this. But the school numbers are a good illustration,  the elementary and secondary education. This bill has $128 billion-- $128 billion--and $6.5 billion is going to be spent in 2021. The rest  gets dribbled out for years and years. How long do they think before  schools can reopen? Oh, by the way, this bill doesn't require schools  to reopen. You don't even have to reopen. Just throw billions and  billions of dollars at schools whether or not they are actually having  kids in the school.   Some of these provisions are so blatantly unrelated to COVID or the  economy that it is really just hard to even read them with a straight  face.   There is $86 billion to bail out multiemployer pension plans without  any reform whatsoever. Look, we all know we have a multiemployer  pension problem in this country, and there has been a lot of discussion  about what do you do about these grossly underfunded pension plans and  how do you fix this. The conversation has always been, what kinds of  reforms come with what kind of cash so that these errors of the past  are corrected? There are no reforms here. None. Nothing. Just a big  pile of cash. It is a clear message that you don't have to fix  anything. You don't have to reform the flaws of these programs that got  us here. And by the way, it is the same message to the insolvent public  pension plans of most of the major cities in many States: Don't worry.  Look what Congress will do if the Democrats have their way. They will  just send you so much cash, you don't have to worry about the  insolvency you are dealing with.   What a terrible message.   There is $270 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and  Humanities. That is COVID-related. Thank goodness that is there.   There is $91 million for ``outreach'' to student loan borrowers. I  don't even know what that means.   There is $50 million for environmental justice grants. I have no idea  what that means.   But this one is really rich. There is about $4 billion for ``socially  disadvantaged farmers and ranchers.'' I say ``about $4 billion''  because it says ``such sums as may be necessary.'' Here is what the  money is for. It is going to pay off 120 percent of the debt of these  farmers and ranchers, 120 percent of the borrowings.   So what in the world are the requirements to have 120 percent of your  debt paid off? Well, you actually have to have debt. OK, so you have to  have borrowed money from the USDA farm loan. There are tens of billions  of dollars out there. They lend a lot of money. And you have to be a  member of one of the following groups: African American, American  Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Islanders, refugees,  or immigrants.   As long as you are in one of those categories of mostly racial and  ethnic groups, then the taxpayers are going to pay off 120 percent. It  is not the whole loan but more than the whole loan--120 percent.   The thing that is so disturbing about this is that the essential  criterion is your skin color. The essential criterion is your race.  This is unbelievable to me. By the way, there is no income test and no  asset test for the underlying loans. There is no requirement whatsoever  that COVID caused any problem--caused any lost income or any other  problem. It is not mentioned.   So what is the effect of this?   This means that, if you have a wealthy Hispanic rancher who has a $1  million loan from the USDA, he is going to get $1.2 million and pay off  the loan--200,000 bucks with which to do whatever he likes. Meanwhile,  if you are a poor White farmer in rural Pennsylvania and you have a  $100,000 loan, you get nothing, exactly nothing. How  [[Page S1018]]  is that even remotely fair? I don't even know how that could be  constitutional. It is, certainly, not in any way COVID related.   There was an amendment in the House that would have limited the  payment. It would have allowed the program, which I object to, but it  would have allowed this repayment of debt but only for debt incurred  during the COVID crisis. The Democrats all voted that down. That  failed. This is unbelievable stuff.   Even the provisions that purport to be about public health are  completely divorced from any reality. As I think I mentioned earlier,  we are administering almost 2 million doses of vaccines every day now.  That is terrific. It is actually the highest daily rate of doses  administered anywhere in the world. The government has already  purchased 700 million doses. Now, we have fewer than 350 million  Americans, and not all Americans are going to need two doses. You can  do the math: We have bought more vaccine doses than we need to  administer, and that is fine. Yet how many more do you need to buy when  you have already bought more than enough for every single American?   That is not all we paid for. Through the previous bills that we  passed, we paid for the research and development. We paid for the  production. We paid for the transportation. We paid for all of the  accompanying supplies, like the syringes, the vials, and the dry ice.  We paid for all of that, and we should have. That was the right thing  to do. Insurance covers the cost of the administering of the vaccines.  Between Medicare and Medicaid and private insurance, it is free. What  is left to spend money on? I am all ears, but I haven't heard what we  need to spend money on.   So what do we have in this bill?   We have no justification for it in terms of public health. We  certainly have no justification for it in terms of the economy. We  certainly have no justification for it in terms of basic fairness.  Frankly, it is going to do more harm than good, but you don't have to  take my word for it. We could take the word of prominent liberal  Democrat economist Larry Summers. He was the Treasury Secretary under  President Clinton, and he was the Director of the National Economic  Council under President Obama.   He said about this bill:         [M]acroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II       levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary       pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation.    Or consider the words of Steve Rattner, who is a liberal economist.  President Obama named him the ``car czar.'' You may recall him  administering that program.   He said of the American Rescue Plan, which is, apparently, what they  call this:         The American Rescue Plan is also partly a legislative       Trojan horse--an enormous aid package aimed at addressing       needs that, in some cases, go well beyond the immediate       challenges of COVID. Some of the most expensive provisions       are the least well targeted to help the neediest.    That is from a liberal Democrat who, I think, supports the bill, but  at least he is being honest in his description of it.   So my suggestion, my plea, to my Democratic colleagues and to the new  President is to listen to some of the things you have said. Try an  approach that is actually informed by the facts on the ground--the  health facts, the economic facts, the reality. Look at what the science  is currently telling us about the course that this virus has been  taking. What about actually attempting to bring people together--the  path of unity--after we demonstrated five times last year that we can  work together and do something on a bipartisan basis?   I urge my colleagues: Don't push through this radically partisan bill  that will probably, in the end, do more harm than good.   I yield the floor
