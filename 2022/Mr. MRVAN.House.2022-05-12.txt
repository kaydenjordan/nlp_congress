 Madam Speaker, as the conference committee for the America  COMPETES Act begins to meet, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to  work in an urgent, bipartisan, diligent fashion on behalf of the  American people. This legislation is critical to addressing our  Nation's inflationary challenges and supply chain pressures.   Indiana's First Congressional District is home to an incredible  manufacturing, steel, auto, and industrial complex. The America  COMPETES Act will have a direct impact on their ability to compete and  succeed in our global economy.   Of particular consequence, when there is a chip shortage and they  stop making cars, it affects the automobile industry, the contractors,  and the steel industry. Tens of thousands of workers are impacted  within my district.   I want to make sure that today I stand up for the American worker,  that I stand up for American manufacturing, and that I stand up for the  national security issue. Today, I want to make sure that we look  forward to the final product of the America COMPETES Act which will  invest in American innovation and demonstrate the greatness of our  Nation.                            ____________________
