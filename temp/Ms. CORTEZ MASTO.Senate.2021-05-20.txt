 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at  the  [[Page S3314]]  desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my  own request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 194.    I know of no further debate on the measure.    I ask unanimous consent that the King amendment to  the preamble at the desk be agreed to, that the preamble, as amended,  be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 228, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, that the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening or debate.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  senior Senator from Nevada and the junior Senator from Virginia be  authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or joint resolutions from May  20, 2021, through May 24, 2021.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m.,  Monday, May 24; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 58,  S. 1260; that at 5:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to  resume consideration of Executive Calendar No. 117, Chiquita Brooks- LaSure, to be Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services; finally, that the cloture motions filed during today's  session of the Senate ripen at 5:30 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:40 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, May 24, 2021, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
