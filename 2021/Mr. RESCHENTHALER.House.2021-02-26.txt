 Madam Speaker, the payoff to progressives package  before us today has little to do with the ongoing pandemic. This bill,  which is the most expensive single bill in history, only allocates 9  percent of the $1.9 trillion price tag to actually defeating COVID.   So what are the Democrats spending the rest of the money on?   Corrupt pet projects, of course, and also payoffs to Progressive  liberal special interest groups.   Just look at it: $100 million for a Silicon Valley rail project near  Speaker Pelosi's district. Totally coincidentally, I am sure. Taxpayer  funded healthcare subsidies for illegal immigrants. Fifty million  dollars for Planned Parenthood. Hundreds of billions in bailouts to  blue State Governors, who crush small businesses with their draconian  lockdown measures. And a minimum wage mandate that, right off the bat,  would kill 1.4 million American jobs. The list goes on and on.   But do you know what Democrats aren't putting in this bill?   They aren't reopening our schools. In fact, this bill spends 95  percent of the education funding after the school year.   Democrats also aren't reopening our economy with this bill. In fact,  this bill spends $471 billion on policies that actually reduce  employment.   And they aren't targeting relief to where it is actually needed. In  fact, this bill gives checks to individuals who have not lost any  income and gives taxpayer-funded healthcare to millionaires.   President Biden and congressional Democrats had a chance to make good  on their empty promises to show unity and bipartisanship. They could  have worked with Republicans on a targeted relief bill that sends money  to where it actually needs to go and effectively spends $1 trillion in  the remaining funds that have already been allocated. Instead, they are  using this pandemic as pretext to force through a corrupt bill filled  with Progressive payoffs.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1319.
