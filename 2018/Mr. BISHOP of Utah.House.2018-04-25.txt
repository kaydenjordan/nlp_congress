 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 839, I  call up the bill (H.R. 3144) to provide for operations of the Federal  Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a  specified period of time, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3144.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the sponsor, to introduce this  piece of legislation.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bishop for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Congress created the Bonneville Power Administration, or  BPA, in 1937 on the heels of the Great Depression to distribute power  generated from the development of two federally authorized dams:  Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dam.   Our dams transformed Washington State from what was a barren, dry  land into one of the most productive agriculture regions in the world.   These marvels of engineering also provided the Pacific Northwest with  the Nation's cheapest and most reliable energy supply.   During World War II, it was the Federal power supplied by BPA that  was instrumental in the ramp-up of the aluminum industry that went into  Boeing's B-17s and B-29s, and powered the production of nearly 750  large ships before the end of the war.   In the words of President Harry Truman: ``Without Grand Coulee and  Bonneville, it would have been almost impossible to win this war.''   In 1945, Congress authorized the construction of four large dams  along the Snake River, Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and  Lower Granite, to grow what we call today the Federal Columbia River  Power System.   These four dams can power up to nearly 2 million homes, or a city the  size of Seattle, and are crucial to meet BPA's peak loads during those  hottest days in the summer when the wind doesn't blow or the coldest  days in the winter when we do not have sunlight.   This year, eastern Washington had a harsh winter with many days below  freezing. During the coldest days, BPA relied on the ability of these  four dams to ramp up production and meet the demand.   Without a reliable base load source, I feared, and BPA confirmed,  many in eastern Washington would have lost power.   It is important to look back at history when we think about BPA, the  Columbia River system, and the future of energy in our region.   Last week, BPA made its 34th consecutive payment of $1.3 billion to  the U.S. Treasury. They were able to do this because of the value of  our region's low-cost, carbon-free energy, as a result of selling the  hydropower production along the Columbia River. In fact, in Washington  State, nearly 70 percent of our energy comes from hydropower.   Some argue that these dams in particular have negatively impacted  migratory fish, yet these dams average fish survival rates of nearly 97  percent.   And while recent ocean impacts, which scientists call a ``blob,''  have slowed salmon just the last couple of years, more total salmon  have returned this year than before the dams were actually put in  place.   More than 600,000 fall Chinook are forecasted this year, many times  higher than when they were first listed under the Endangered Species  Act.   These record-setting fish passage rates are a result of significant  Federal investments in new technologies, like fish-friendly turbines,  habitat restoration, and local collaboration.   I mention the local collaboration because I want to quote the  Columbia River system Adaptive Management Implementation Plan that was  produced by the Department of Interior, BPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and  NOAA: ``The Obama administration undertook an extensive effort to  review the 2008 Biological Opinion'' and found ``the 2008 BiOp is  biologically and legally sound, based on the best available scientific  information, and satisfies the ESA jeopardy standard.''   Our river system also functions as a superhighway for agriculture  goods. My home State of Washington is the most trade-dependent State in  the country, and because of the river system, last year alone, it saved  having 160,000 trucks on the roads.   This BiOp is supported by the States, by Tribes, by utilities, ports,  irrigation districts, and other Pacific Northwest water users.   The need for this legislation became clear when an unelected judge  rejected the collaborative work, claiming that he knows better how to  manage the Columbia River than all of the scientists, Tribes, elected  officials, and others that are using the river every day.   This Oregon Federal district judge invalidated the BiOp and set a  course that will likely put BPA's future and the yearly investments of  hundreds of millions of dollars in jeopardy.   He wants us to start at the beginning and put breaching the dams back  on the table.   Electricity rates have gone up nearly 30 percent the last few years,  with an average increase of 5.4 percent for 2018 and 2019. Adding  unnecessary litigation and additional spill requirements only add to  these costs.   For example, Judge Simon granted a spill order on April 3 that will  cost an estimated $40 million to ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest.  Mandating spill means that huge amounts of water will go over the dam  24 hours a day 7 days a week, instead of actually producing  electricity. This spill order is experimental science that will likely  increase power costs, decrease the grid's reliability, hurt habitat,  and actually kill fish.    In 2028, utilities will be renegotiating their contracts, and they  are making decisions now. This uncertainty is plaguing the Pacific  Northwest and the Columbia River system.   As a result, I am proud of the work that we have done, coming  together in  [[Page H3544]]  a bipartisan way to support this legislation to provide certainty. This  bill will codify the current BiOp until 2022, and prevent unnecessary  costs to people and ratepayers all around the Pacific Northwest. It  also reasserts Congress' authority over the dams.   A hearing was held in the Natural Resources Committee last fall, and  the bill recently passed out of committee with bipartisan support.  Technical changes were made to ensure necessary maintenance, and  improvements to the Army Corps dams would continue without  interruption.   We hear the other side talk about being against the status quo,  calling it illegal and an unprecedented assault on the Endangered  Species Act.   Unfortunately, this narrative is misleading and it doesn't take into  account the whole picture nor the success of the dams.   For example, the Port of Clarkston has seen new business from the  American Queen Steamboat Company, tourism that is coming to our  communities that is bringing jobs and bringing people.   This bill is a fiscally responsible alternative to the current  judicial overreach that doesn't take into account all of the river  users. If enacted, the certainty provided will reduce costs on the  people of eastern Washington by stopping this $40 million spill  experiment, encourage clean energy, lower carbon emissions, and save  taxpayers $16 million, while saving fish.   Bottom line, dams and fish can coexist. After more than two decades  in the courtroom, let's let the scientists, not one judge, manage our  river system, and get to work to further improve fish recovery efforts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Washington State (Ms. Herrera Beutler), who lives in this area and  knows firsthand what is taking place there.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from  Washington an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), another person who lives in this area and  realizes that this judicial decision is not necessarily based on  science and can actually do harm to the endangered species.    Mr. Speaker, as one of the eight Tribes that  endorse this bill said: The BiOp exceeds requirements established by  the courts and by the ESA, and yet plaintiffs want more. The court  should uphold the 2008 BiOp.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse), speaking on behalf of the eight Tribes that endorse this in  his area.    Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, NOAA did a study  which simply said that the hatchery production of salmon in this area  more than offsets any loss that comes from the dams. So even though we  have this issue of an endangered species trying to eat another  endangered species, which one are we going to support.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), who  is a member of our committee who understands this particular issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to be here to present this particular  bill, or at least sum up on this, especially as our good friend Mr.  Todd Ungerecht has done so much for this particular bill and it is  going to be his last time on the floor with us. So I appreciate all of  his help on this. He is returning back to his native State of  Washington where he clearly realizes how important this bill is.   Mr. Speaker, this bill has support via policy from Washington, total  support for the bill from Idaho and Montana, as well as eight other  Tribes that live in this area, as well as the National Association of  Counties, the American Farm Bureau Federation, United Power Trades  Organization, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, National  Electrical Contractors Association, Public Power Council, Washington  Association of Wheat Growers, and scores of other individuals.

[[Page H3556]]                                          ____                                           Public Power Council                                                      March 16, 2018      Re Support for H.R. 3144--To provide for operations of the           Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain           operation plan for a specified time.         Dear Members of the Northwest Congressional Delegation: The       Public Power Council (PPC) is a not for profit association       that represents about 100 consumer-owned electric utilities       in the Pacific Northwest on issues regarding the Federal       Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). As purchasers of power       from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), PPC members       and their customers pay for a large share of the region's       fish and wildlife mitigation costs. I write today in support       of H.R. 3144, a bill that would stabilize a portion of these       costs while the administrative process proceeds in the       region.        BPA is on the precipice of a serious financial struggle       created by consistent increases in its power rates over the       past decade combined with a simultaneous drop in the market       price of other power options in the West. As utilities begin       to choose lesser-cost options elsewhere, BPA will not have       the requisite customer base to fund all its statutory       obligations, including regional fish and wildlife efforts.       Without serious action to stabilize rates, BPA will struggle       in the near future to recover its costs, putting all of its       programs at risk.        An important part of the challenge facing BPA is the       volatility of the costs of meeting its fish and wildlife-      related obligations. H.R. 3144 would offer important       assistance in this respect by temporarily keeping in place a       federal hydro operations plan (approved by multiple       Administrations) through the 2021 completion of an ongoing       review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).       Upon completion of the NEPA process, it is expected that the       legislation would effectively expire and the NEPA-supported       plan for the federal hydro system would commence.        H.R. 3144 allows the court-ordered NEPA process to continue       while avoiding a costly and potentially harmful spill       experiment. In addition to its estimated $40 million annual       cost to regional electricity customers, NOAA Fisheries'       Science Center modeling does not show appreciable benefits to       salmon and steelhead from this operation. Higher levels of       spill can harm fish from increased gas saturation in the       water. The fear is that, without this legislation, a spill       regime will be put in place that increases regional power       costs while providing no apparent benefit to the fish it       purports to help.        Another threatening aspect to the proposed spill experiment       is that it would further limit the operational flexibility of       the hydropower system that is essential to reliably meet       electricity demand in the region and integrate other       renewable power resources. Further, it is expected that much       of the carbon-free generation eliminated by this experiment       will be replaced by fossil fuels, greatly increasing regional       carbon emissions, running counter to carbon-reduction goals.        Your support for this bill can help keep the region's       hydropower affordable and can assist in stabilizing BPA       during precarious times. Urgent action on H.R. 3144 will       resonate for years in maintaining a renewable, flexible, and       carbon-free energy resource that serves as the region's       economic backbone. Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                      Scott Corwin,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                        Mason County                                       Public Utility District 3,                                        Shelton, WA, April 23, 2018.      Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Newhouse: Thank you for your support of       federal, state and local agencies that provide cost-based,       carbon free energy to customers throughout the Pacific       Northwest. Specifically, we thank you for your strong defense       of the Bonneville Power Administration and its partners in       the Federal Base System.        We at Mason PUD 3 applaud your efforts, and those of       others, who introduced HR 3144 to protect the viability and       value of the Columbia River hydropower system.        We're pleased that HR 3144 affirms the jurisdiction of the       2014 Federal Biological Opinion for a balanced approach to       managing the Columbia for fish and hydropower. We are       concerned, as are others who depend on the river for their       livelihoods, about the increased role of the courts in       controlling this mighty resource. Management of the river by       appointed judges is precedent-setting. It bypasses science,       the experts who collaboratively wrote the Biological Opinion,       and is not in the best interests of our customers.        PUD 3 is disappointed in a federal court ruling earlier       this month that will result in an experimental water spill       program at Columbia and Snake River dams. This costly       experiment is aimed at determining if sending more water       through dam spillways, instead of using it for power       generation, will help the passage of salmon in the Columbia       River Basin.        The Northwest Power & Conservation Council notes in its       ``2016 Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program Costs       Report'' that public power customers in the Pacific Northwest       paid $621.5 million for recovery and restoration efforts.       Just over $7 million of that came from customers of Mason PUD       3 (based on our proportionate share of the Federal Base       System).        To further burden our customers, and other public power       customers in the region, with the cost of an experimental       spill which has uncertain results, is an unjust judicial       abuse of those who we strive to protect.        Your bill, HR 3144, will give much needed relief to public       power customers in a region that, through its wholesale power       rates, fully pays its way for the operation of the Federal       Base System. Further, through the directed use of the 2014       Federal Biological Opinion, it places management of the river       in the realm of science, not speculation.        We thank you for your support and protection of the natural       resources of the Pacific Northwest. If you wish to       communicate with us on this matter, please contact us at any       time.            Sincerely,                                                 Annette Creekpaum,      Manager, Mason PUD 3.                                   ____                                                       Asotin County                                         Public Utility District,                                                      Clarkston, WA.      Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Newhouse: We are writing to thank you       for your support of hydropower and the Federal Columbia River       Power System (FCRPS) with the recent introduction of--H.R.       3144. As an electric utility whose customers are dependent       upon reliable and affordable power, this bill supports the       hydro system and the many benefits it brings to the region as       a renewable resource.        Your bill provides relief to the endless litigation of       federal hydro system operations by directing the federal       agencies to implement the current BiOp as adopted in 2014.       The current BiOp is based on the best available science and       has been vetted by stakeholders. Implementation of the BiOp       has successfully increased salmon runs due to operational       requirements within, and the installation of new fish passage       technologies.        Despite the success of the current FCRPS BiOp, the judge's       ruling rejecting the plan will add costs to the over $15       billion the Bonneville Power Administration has spent on       infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since 1978. These       improvements and mitigation measures are paid for by our       customers through their electric bills and the ``spill test''       ordered by the judge will be an additional cost that will       result in higher electric bills for everyone.        Your legislation will bring an end to the wasteful       activities and we appreciate your leadership on this issue       with the introduction of H.R. 3144.        Sincerely, Asotin County PUD Board of Commissioners:      Don Nuxoll,        President.      Judy Ridge,        Vice-President.      Greg McCall,        Secretary.                                   ____                                                      Cowlitz PUD,                                       Longview, WA, April 23, 2018.      Re: H.R. 3144.       Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Newhouse: This letter is submitted by       Cowlitz PUD, serving roughly 50,000 electric customers       located on or near the mighty Columbia River. The District       purchases approximately 90% of its power supply from BPA,       which is sourced primarily from the Federal Columbia River       Power System (FCRPS).        We believe the 2014 BiOp is the best solution and we       believe H.R. 3144 puts that solution in place.        We appreciate your leadership on H.R. 3144 and urge other       legislators to follow your lead.            Sincerely,                                                 Steven D. Kern,                                                    General Manager,      Cowlitz PUD.                                   ____                                                      Cowlitz PUD,                                       Longview, WA, April 23, 2018.      Re: H.R. 3144.       Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Newhouse: I write you this letter       individually supporting H.R. 3144.        The 50,000 customers I represent continue to be impacted by       interests other than their own. The Federal Columbia River       Power System (FCRPS) has been bought and paid for by electric       customers but is now being run from the bench of our 9th       District court rather than the labs and control rooms of       scientists and system operators. Experimental spill       operations and targeted political outcomes have no place in       the river system that powers our homes, underpins our       economy, and funds our fish recovery.        I appreciate your leadership.            Sincerely,                                                  Dena Diamond-Ott,                             Cowlitz PUD Commissioner--District #1.

Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Newhouse: On behalf of Kittitas PUD No.       1 we greatly appreciate the support you have shown for       hydropower and, more specifically, the Federal Columbia River       Power System (FCRPS) with the recent introduction of H.R.       3144. This bill supports the hydro system and the many       benefits it brings to the region through renewable, reliable       and affordable power.        Despite the success of the current FCRPS Biological Opinion       (BiOp), Judge Simon, U.S. Western District, Court of Oregon,       rejected the plan and ruled all options need to be reviewed       including breaching or removing one or more of the four Snake       River dams.        Your bill provides relief to the endless litigation of       federal hydro system operations by directing the federal       agencies to implement the current BiOp as adopted in 2014.       The current BiOp is based on the best available science, has       been vetted by stakeholders and was formally approved by the       Obama administration. Implementation of the BiOp has       successfully increased salmon runs due to operational       requirements within, and the installation of new fish passage       technologies.        The Bonneville Power Administration has spent over $15       billion on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since       1978. These improvements and mitigation measures are paid for       by our customers through their electric bills. Their bills       are already higher by at least 15 percent for fish mitigation       programs. The ``spill test'' ordered by the judge will be an       additional cost that will result in higher electric bills for       Northwest families and businesses and likely to be more       detrimental to the fish runs than helpful. Your legislation       will bring an end to the wasteful activities.        We appreciate your leadership on this issue with the       introduction of H.R. 3144 and urge other legislators to       follow your lead.            Sincerely,                                                     Matthew Boast,      General Manager.                                   ____                                                       Lewis County,                                         Public Utility District,                                       Chehalis, WA, April 24, 2018.      Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Newhouse: On behalf of Public Utility       District No. 1 of Lewis County, we appreciate your support       for hydropower and the Federal Columbia River Power System       (FCRPS). The recent introduction of H.R. 3144 supports the       hydro systems many benefits to the region by providing       renewable, reliable and affordable power.        The current FCRPS Biological Opinion (BiOp) is based on the       best available science and has been vetted by stakeholders       and was formally approved by the Obama administration.       Implementation of the BiOp has successfully increased salmon       runs due to operational requirements within, and the       installation of new fish passage technologies. Despite the       success of the current BiOp, Judge Simon, U.S. Western       District, Court of Oregon, rejected the plan and ruled all       options need to be reviewed including breaching or removing       one or more of the four Snake River dams.        The Bonneville Power Administration has already spent over       $15 billion on infrastructure and fish mitigation projects       since 1978. These improvements and mitigation measures are       paid for by our customers through their electric bills. Their       bills are already higher by at least 15 percent for fish       mitigation programs. The ``spill test'' ordered by the judge       will be an additional cost that will result in higher       electric bills for Northwest families and businesses and       likely to be more detrimental to the fish runs than helpful.        Your bill provides relief to the endless litigation of       federal hydro system operations by directing the federal       agencies to implement the current BiOp as adopted in 2014 and       your legislation will bring an end to wasteful activities.        We appreciate your leadership on this issue with the       introduction of H.R. 3144 and urge other legislators to       follow your lead.            Sincerely,      Commissioner Dean Dahlin.      Commissioner Ben Kostick.      Commissioner Tim Cournyer.     Mr. Speaker, here is the bottom line for this  particular piece of legislation:   States agree to it. There are nine Tribes in this area. Eight of them  totally support this particular bill. The Obama administration created  a biological opinion which endorsed the ESA and was legal with the ESA.  A judge decided to change all of that and ordered a spill with no  apparent rationale to it.   Mr. Speaker, there is no one over here who hates salmon. We are not  trying to kill them all. Heaven knows, the only way I would like to  kill salmon is if I am consuming them myself. However, in 2011, another  spill took place on this particular river which had the process of  actually killing this endangered species that was there.   This judge's order, without any kind of rationale to it, could indeed  be one of the situations that actually sterilizes this river and the  species rather than protecting the river and the species.   Let's allow river operators to operate the river. Let's allow  scientists to conduct the science and let judges go back to granting  divorces. Allowing a judge with no background in these issues to  dictate river operations and subvert the science is totally  irresponsible on our part.   This is a piece of legislation that clearly is a win for the  ratepayers to a tune of $40 million that they would have to do if this  decision by the judge stands. It is also a win for taxpayers to the  tune of about $16 million. It is a win for the fish by preventing a  potentially deadly environmental decision that has no basis in actual  science. And, once again, it was the last administration that created  the pattern in which we are going.   Let's go back to that and do it. Now, if another science or  biological opinion needs to be done, let it happen, but don't allow the  judge to change what the river operators are saying is the wisest  policy until you do that. That is the basis of this particular bill. It  helps the power. It helps the fish. It helps all of us. And let's face  it, if you are not using that hydropower, you are going to have to pick  up fossil fuel power to make up the difference--see which one actually  is healthier for the environment.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues for doing this, and I urge all  in the House to support this legislation which is a bipartisan bill  that has bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shuster for agreeing to help expedite  consideration of this bill today.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, April 12, 2018.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 3144, to provide       for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System       pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period       of time, and for other purposes. The bill was referred       primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, with an       additional referral to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.        I ask that you allow the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure to be discharged from further consideration of       the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader.       This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the       subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any       response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural       Resources to memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, April 16, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 3144, to provide for operations of the Federal Columbia       River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a       specified period of time, and for other purposes. As noted,       the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure received       an additional referral on this legislation.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 3144, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on this bill. However, as you noted, this is       conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing       consideration of the bill would not prejudice the Committee       with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill or similar legislation that fall within the       Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. Further, it is our       understanding that mutually agreed upon changes to the       legislation will be incorporated into the bill via an       amendment. Should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       appreciate your agreement to support my request to have the       Committee represented on the conference committee.  [[Page H3558]]         Thank you for your cooperation on this matter and for       agreeing to place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the bill       report and the Congressional Record during consideration of       the measure on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to  the motion.    Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the commitment of  the gentlewoman from Washington, the effort to solve some problems, and  many of the issues that were brought up. Unfortunately, many of the  issues that were addressed simply are not covered in the motion to  recommit at the same time--great speeches, but not necessarily really  relating directly to the motion.   If you actually look at what the motion will do, ultimately, it is  very clear that it will ensure that rates actually do go up; carbon  emissions will go up; and farmers, families, union members, and small  businesses will all have to eventually pay for it.   The underlying bipartisan legislation, though, and not some poorly  worded gimmick that cedes more authority to courts and lawyers will  protect ratepayers and endangered salmon and the whales and the  taxpayers at the same time.   In all due respect, I actually feel happy that I was here when we saw  a display of the Senate actually passing something. So I would suggest,  in all humility to the other side, if they actually want to do  something which would encourage my commitment and my approval of an  MTR, it would be to realize and recognize something that happened 107  years ago this Friday, in which the socialist Member from Milwaukee,  Wisconsin, 107 years ago, Friday, introduced a resolution to dissolve  the Senate.   Now, if that were a motion to recommit, that I would firmly endorse.  That would actually help us move forward. Unfortunately, that is not  the motion to recommit in front of us. The motion to recommit does not  help us move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
