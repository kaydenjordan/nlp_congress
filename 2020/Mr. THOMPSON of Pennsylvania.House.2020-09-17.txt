 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize  tomorrow, September 18, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day.   This important day of respect, reflection, and recognition was  established through a 1979 proclamation by President Jimmy Carter. To  date, more than 83,000 Americans are still missing from World War II,  the Korean war, the Vietnam war, and more.   The brave Americans who rose to the occasion to protect and defend  our country are the bravest among us. Many return home. Far too many do  not. We owe it to those individuals and to the families of those  individuals to continue the search. The pain that these families endure  due to uncertainty is unfathomable.   To ensure that these men and women are never forgotten, a flag, that  I am sure all of us recognize, was designed in consultation with Evelyn  Grubb, wife of an Air Force POW, and Mary Helen Hoff, wife of a Navy  man deemed missing in action.   Today, that flag is displayed in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, serving as  a reminder that we must continue our work on behalf of military  families and continue the search for our POW/MIA servicemembers.                            ____________________
