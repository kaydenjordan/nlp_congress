 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, on January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued  the Emancipation Proclamation to emancipate 4 million slaves residing  in the 11 Southern States that were combatants against the Union.   The proclamation was significant but not totally effective. It did  not include slaves who resided in the States that were not in  rebellion. Lincoln was of the opinion he could only use his authority  against the States who were rebelling.   In addition, there was doubt about the legal efficacy of the  proclamation since Congress had not participated. There were legal  questions of whether the proclamation would expire following Lincoln's  Presidency and, very importantly, whether States would not free slaves  without Federal intervention.   Juneteenth is significant because it marks the day when Federal  troops arrived in Galveston to take control of the State and ensure  that all enslaved people were free. These Federal troops arrived 2\1/2\  years after the signing of the proclamation.   By passing this legislation, Madam Speaker, every American can now  better understand the African Americans'  [[Page H2870]]  struggle for freedom and full citizenship. Every American can now  participate in recognizing the end to slavery in America.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation.
