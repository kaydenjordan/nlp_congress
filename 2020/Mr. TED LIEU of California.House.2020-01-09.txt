 Madam Speaker, I rise because it is one  of the highest forms of patriotism to speak out when a government  engages in reckless military action that could lead us to war.   I previously served in Active Duty in the United States military, and  the goal of any military action should be to make us more safe, not  less safe.   Unfortunately, as a result of Donald Trump's impulsive  decisionmaking, the following negative consequences have happened. Iran  is no longer abiding by any limits on its nuclear program. The Iranian  people who previously were protesting their own leadership have now  rallied behind their government. The Iraqi parliament recently voted to  kick U.S. troops out of their country, one of the goals of Iran. And we  have had to stop counterterrorism actions against ISIS.   This was a lose-lose-lose decision. We don't need the President to  make any more reckless decisions. We don't need him to tweet out flag  pictures. We need the President to articulate a coherent Iran strategy,  which he still has failed to do.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel for  his leadership.   I previously served in Active Duty in the United States military, and  if we are going to put our troops in harm's way, we better have a  strategy. Unfortunately, we don't have a strategy from the Trump  administration. We just have reckless and impulsive decisionmaking by  the President.   Let me just ask a very simple question: What are our goals with Iran?   Is it to get them to come back to the negotiating table on the  nuclear program? Well, we are further away from that goal now because  they have announced they are no longer going to abide by limits on the  nuclear program.   Is the goal to get the regime to collapse? We are further from that  goal, too, because the Iranian people who previously were protesting  their government are rallying behind their leadership.   Or is the goal to work with our allies to contain Iran? Well, we are  further away from that goal, too, because the Iraqi parliament just  voted to kick us out of their country.   Madam Speaker, we are less safe than we were a week ago. Vote ``yes''  on this bipartisan resolution.
