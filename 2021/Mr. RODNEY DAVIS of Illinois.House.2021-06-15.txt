 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I am pleased to lead this effort with my good friend and colleague,  the chair of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee, Ms. Norton.   As Congresswoman Norton said, this important legislation directs the  General Services Administration to provide rent relief to the National  Children's Museum that is currently housed in the Ronald Reagan  Building and International Trade Center right here in Washington, D.C.   Currently, the museum is the only federally designated museum sitting  in a Federal building that is required to pay rent. This bill will give  the museum the same benefits afforded to other congressionally  designated museums.   Prepandemic, the museum offered our children the ability to interact  with exhibits that were focused on science, technology, engineering,  arts, and math. And that allowed children to foster a greater  appreciation for our STEM fields.   As our country reopens and we look to the future, the museum will  continue to build off that success and become even more valuable of a  resource for our youth. In that spirit, I actually look forward to  visiting with some of my colleagues soon and talking about this  important bill. It is just frustrating that it is the only museum that  is congressionally directed that has to pay another government agency,  the GSA, for rent when they weren't allowed to be open.    So this is a commonsense bill. It has been great to work with  Congresswoman Norton, and I support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Norton for  her cooperation on this. It is great to be back on the floor and see  everybody. I enjoy this greatly. I certainly hope everybody supports  this commonsense bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
