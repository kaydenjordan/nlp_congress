 Mr. Speaker, I support the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act, which:   Changes the criminal conduct standard from ``willful'' to ``knowing  or reckless'';   Ends qualified immunity;   Funds independent prosecutors for police misconduct;   Strengthens the pattern and practice reviews at the Federal and State  level;   Establishes national standards for law enforcement;   Invests in public safety innovation grants;   Establishes a public national police misconduct registry;   Requires data collection on the use of force;   Bans chokeholds, and conditions Federal grants on banning chokeholds;   Bans no-knock warrants and racial profiling;   Permits deadly force only as a last resort;   Establishes a duty to intervene by other officers;   Mandates use of body cameras; and   Prohibits sexual acts with anyone under arrest, detention, or in  custody.   I have always supported law enforcement, and I still do, but today  the universal cries for change and justice demand that we hold law  enforcement to the same standards of justice as any other American by  passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act now.
