 Mr. President, on July 2, 2021, a quick succession  of events that lasted only 30 minutes shocked a Louisville neighborhood  and showcased the extraordinary professionalism of the Louisville Metro  Police Department. Together, with the support of MetroSafe Dispatch and  information provided by a vigilant civilian, the stranger abduction of  a 6-year-old girl was witnessed and reported, the suspect's vehicle was  identified and stopped, and the victim was rescued--unharmed--and  returned to her family.   People around the Nation have now seen the emotional bodycam video of  the moment when Officer Burba picked up this young girl and whisked her  to safety. It is a scene that brings a tear to the eye of every loving  parent. Stranger abduction is rare, thankfully, but it is even rarer  that such quick action leads to a conclusion such as this.   While one officer's actions were immortalized on film, today I want  to recognize all of the members of LMPD's Third Division, First  Platoon, Squad One. Each officer was willing to risk personal injury to  rescue this child and capture the suspect. They include Sergeant Joe  Keeling, Officers Stephen Barone, Jason Burns, Travis Elder, Charles  Ennis, Aaron Flannery, Malliccaaii Green, Nicholas Green, Clint Greene,  Jake Harris, Mark Manning, Aimee Mills, Michael Rach, Bradley Russell,  Tom Stettenbenz and Lucero Aguilera Vasquez.   Key members of MetroSafe Dispatch who handled the response were  Dispatchers Emily David and Hannah Hurley, and Jim Intermaggio, who  took the inbound call.   Finally, although several citizens made 911 calls regarding the  incident, Prentiss Weathrford, who witnessed the abduction, pursued the  vehicle and took down critical license plate information.   This LMPD squad, a capable dispatch team, and an alert citizen worked  in concert to redeem what could have been a most tragic scenario. I am  grateful to them, and the community is grateful. And I believe that the  family of this 6-year-old girl would agree that all those who responded  are deserving of this special distinction.                            ____________________
