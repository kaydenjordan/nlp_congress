 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her leadership  and all of my New York colleagues for being here today.   Mike Long was such a special, principled, faithful patriot. He loved  his family. He loved his country. He was willing to lay down his life  for it at any time, valuing our Constitution and our freedoms. Our  State is better off because Mike Long lived this legendary life of  service.   Jerry Kassar, the new New York State Conservative Party chair, has  these really big shoes to try to fill. For all of us collectively,  trying to figure out how to fill these shoes will be a challenge for  us, but we accept that challenge with Mike's spirit and fight, his  inspiration always living within each and every one of us. He was rock  solid to his core, a genuine, great American.    To his entire family--obviously, his wife of nearly 60 years, Eileen,  but they also have nine children, 24 grandchildren, and five great- grandchildren. Everybody who knew and loved Mike Long is mourning the  passing of a truly great public servant.   May Mike Long rest in peace. I thank him for his friendship,  guidance, and service.   Now, it is left to the rest of us to carry on what was a legendary,  inspirational contribution to the greatest country in the history of  the world because of great marines and patriots like him.  [[Page H7240]]    May he rest in peace.
