 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, June 5, 2018, I was  unavoidably detained and was unable to make votes that evening. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' for rollcall 231, H.R. 5005-- To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource  study to determine the suitability and feasibility of establishing the  birthplace of James Weldon Johnson in Jacksonville, Florida, as a unit  of the National Park System; rollcall 232, H.R. 2991--Susquehanna  National Heritage Area Act; and, rollcall 233, H.R. 5655--Camp Nelson  Heritage National Monument Act.                            ____________________
