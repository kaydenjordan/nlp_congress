 Mr. Speaker, America is better off. America is better off  because U.S. crude exports have more than doubled since January 2017,  and production is up 12 percent so far this year alone.   Since Congress lifted the 40-year ban on oil exports in 2015, U.S.  producers now export between 1.5 and 2 million barrels of crude every  day. Lifting the ban has filled pipelines and sparked a surge of  investment in new technology and shipping infrastructure around the  United States.  [[Page H7169]]                                     time  1130    Today, U.S. crude imports have dropped 7.5 million barrels per day,  as we rely on that increased domestic production and our friends in  Canada.   Lifting the ban has allowed us to be in competition with the two  highest producing crude oil countries in the world, Saudi Arabia and  Russia. According to the International Energy Agency, this year, the  United States is expected to surpass Saudi Arabia and rival Russia as  the world's leading producer of crude oil.   This comes as Germany is working with Russia on a pipeline that will  deliver more than 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia to  Germany. During the recent NATO summit in Brussels, President Trump was  right to strategically question Germany's further reliance on Russia's  natural gas.   Our liquefied natural gas and oil delivered to the Adriatic, North  Sea, and Baltic seaports offer our allies in Europe strategic  diversification both from OPEC and from Russian dominance for our  friends in Western and Central Europe, their consumers, and their  industries.   Mr. Speaker, America is better off. I commend President Trump for  raising this important issue on his recent trip to Europe, and I am  proud of our work in Congress to enhance America's global energy  leadership.                          Recognizing Dr. Dan Tullos     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a good friend and a  key figure in education and communication sciences in Arkansas, Dr. Dan  Tullos.   Dr. Tullos recently retired from Harding University, where he served  since 1979 as a professor, program director, and chair of the  Communication Sciences and Disorders Department. Under his guidance,  the communication sciences and disorders program has grown from a major  offered under the oversight of the Department of Communication to a  separate department with two undergraduate majors and a graduate  program.   Throughout his career, Dan has been honored by his colleagues,  students, and industry leaders with well-deserved recognition and  awards. Most notably, he was the 2015 recipient of the Frank R.  Kleffner award, which recognizes an individual's outstanding  contributions to communications.   For his devotion to youth development, education, scouting, and a  better world that has improved the lives of countless individuals  across Arkansas and the globe, I congratulate Dr. Tullos on his great  career and his retirement.                              Honoring Pat Downs     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding leader  who has transformed the realm of nonprofits in Arkansas, Pat Downs of  the United Way of White County.   Pat retired earlier this year as the executive director of the  organization after 29 years of service. Her selflessness, passion, and  work ethic inspire all who collaborate with her in White County, around  the community, and in the workplace.   Helping raise more than $11 million for associated agencies, Pat's  decades of leadership had an indelible impact on central Arkansas. I  thank Pat for her outstanding service to the United Way and send best  wishes for her future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate my good friend,  R.D. Kinsey, on becoming the first African American to be elected as  commander of the American Legion Department of Arkansas.   Kinsey is a Vietnam-era veteran of the Air Force and a retired  Federal civil service employee. He is the founding member of American  Legion Post 74 and has been the post commander every year since that  founding in 2004. He decided to step down this spring to seek the State  commander's position.   He previously served as the vice chairman of the National Legislative  Council of Arkansas and held numerous appointments on the National  Legislative Commission. He is a member of the City of Sherwood Civil  Service Commission and is the founding president of the Sherwood  Citizens Police Academy Alumni Association.   I am proud of my friend, Commander R.D. Kinsey, who has proven his  devotion to community and our State and veterans. He will be a great  leader for Arkansas' American Legion.                            ____________________
