 Mr. Speaker, I had an experience just last week, in a  virtual hearing, when it came my turn to push the ``mute off'' button  on the microphone, it didn't work. I was passed over. Then, when I  texted in to find out why, I was told, basically: That is too bad. We  will catch you at the end.   The only place for us to be in this Congress is where we are supposed  to be, and that is here. We ought to be doing our work together.   Let me read you a quote from General Omar Bradley, a famous general  who understood the cost of leadership. He said, of the Athenians:         In the end, more than they wanted freedom, they wanted       security. They wanted a comfortable life, and they lost it       all--security, comfort, and freedom. When the freedom they       wanted most was freedom from responsibility, then Athens       ceased to be free.    Mr. Speaker, together, we work for the freedom of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I would submit to you that if I am not willing to do  what is necessary to be here, then it is time for me to consider  turning over to somebody else. I would suggest that that ought to be  for all of us who are privileged to represent people in this august  body, which is not like any other parliamentary body in the world, not  like a State legislature. This is the U.S. Congress. Let's act like it.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, may I respond. Education and Labor  Committee last week.    Witnesses.
