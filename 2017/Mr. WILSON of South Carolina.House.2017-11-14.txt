 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, last week, in a column by  Heritage Foundation President Ed Feulner in The Washington Times, it  sadly identified November 7, 1917, as a day of infamy. This day marks  the overthrow of the Russian Government by the Bolsheviks, led by  Lenin, and the establishment of the murderous communist dictatorship  100 years ago.   This revolution led to horrific deaths. Ed Feulner notes historians  estimate that, according to Richard Pipes, 9 million were deceased.  Richard Conquest says at least 20 million and, likely, as many as 30  million died in the Great Terror.   Ed Feulner continued: ``Its legacy is also one of grinding poverty.  Most of the 88 countries that score `repressed' or `mostly unfree' on  the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom are either  communist, former communist, or some type of socialist economy. They  are also the world's poorest nations.''   Americans still hope for democratic reform in Russia, which, with its  extraordinary culture and limitless resources, should be one of the  wealthiest nations on Earth.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Mac  Thornberry for his leadership.   The extraordinary, controversial issue that should be addressed of  the widows' tax has been solved with his leadership and will be so  meaningful to military families.   I am grateful to support H.R. 2810, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   Throughout this past year, as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee,  we heard testimony from each of the Joint Chiefs about the critical  necessity to address the military's alarming readiness shortfalls  across all domains: air, land, sea, cyber, and space.   Sadly, the recent, tragic deaths of 17 sailors in two avoidable  collisions in the Indo-Pacific region provided unmistakable evidence  that readiness has fallen to a dangerous level. We can no longer delay  the maintenance and sustainment problems that plague the military, and  we can no longer defer critical training and modernization that  directly impact the ability to respond rapidly to emerging threats  worldwide. There are numerous important readiness provisions in the  bill.  [[Page H9202]]    I also appreciate the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo), my  friend, colleague, and Readiness Subcommittee ranking member, for her  tireless efforts and participation in this process. The creation of the  NDAA was truly bipartisan and represents real emphasis for readiness  recovery efforts and the enhanced defense of our Nation to promote  peace through strength, protecting American families, as we recognize  freedom is not free.   I strongly support the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018 and encourage my  colleagues in the House to support it as well.
