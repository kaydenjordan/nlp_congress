 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to  this cruel and mean-spirited farm bill, a farm bill that will leave  working families and our children out in the cold.   The farm bill we are debating today cuts $23 billion from SNAP, the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. That would leave 2 million  Americans without the support that they need to put food on the table.   Mr. Speaker, I represent both rural and urban, from Birmingham to the  Black Belt of Alabama, and I can say definitely that every community in  my district will be worse off under this bill.   For children and working families in my district, SNAP means the  difference between a hot meal or going to bed hungry. For farmers and  grocery stores in my district, SNAP is an investment in our food system  that creates 50,000 agricultural jobs across the country.   After the Republicans have shoved down a tax bill that gives the cuts  to the wealthiest Americans and adds $2 trillion to our deficit, they  now want to cut the benefits for hungry children and working families.   I believe this is morally wrong. You see, Mr. Speaker, the face of  SNAP in my district is not the welfare mother trying to get over. No.  The face of SNAP in my district--where 70 percent of the people who are  beneficiaries in my district are children under the age of 17 years  old--the face of SNAP in America are needy children.   We must and can do better. I am going to vote ``no,'' and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
