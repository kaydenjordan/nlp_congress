 Mr. President, I wanted to join Senator Blunt in  thanking the JCCIC staff. I see them up there, all 6 feet apart. They  are incredible and did such a good job in a really difficult  circumstance with this inauguration.   I want to thank Senator Blunt for his great leadership through thick  and thin. There were a lot of hard decisions that had to be made, and  he made the right ones. We worked together really well, and the sky was  blue when the new President got inaugurated. Somehow he pulled that off  as well. So I thank the staff and thank Senator Blunt for his  friendship and his great leadership.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of Dr.  Miguel Cardona's nomination to serve as Secretary of Education and to  urge my colleagues to confirm him to this position.   Dr. Cardona will bring a deep understanding of the needs of students  and teachers, a firm grasp of our educational system, and a fresh  perspective to the Department of Education.   Dr. Cardona was the first in his immediate family to go to college.  He is the father of two school-aged children, and he brings to this  role decades of experience as an educator, having served as an  elementary school teacher, principal, and assistant superintendent.   Throughout his career, Dr. Cardona has worked tirelessly to improve  the lives of students. He has fought to make sure college is accessible  for all students. As the education commissioner for the State of  Connecticut, he was on the frontlines helping his state tackle the  complex issues facing their schools during the pandemic.   In his opening statement before the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee, Dr. Cardona reaffirmed his commitment to forging  opportunity out of crisis. He also recognized the need to address  educational inequities head-on and build a better future for the next  generation.   He has the track record to show he understands the value of education  and knows how to get things done. Under Dr. Cardona's leadership,  Connecticut became the first State in the Nation to ensure that all of  its public school students had access to a laptop and a high-speed  internet connection to engage in remote learning during the pandemic.  At another point in Dr. Cardona's career, he led a task force to help  figure out how to close the academic achievement gap among students in  his State.   The value of education is something that is personal to me.   My grandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines of Ely, and he  never graduated from high school, but he knew the value of a quality  education, saving money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad  to college.   My dad graduated from Vermilion Community College and earned his  graduate degree in journalism from the University of Minnesota. He went  on to be a sports reporter and a newspaper columnist.   My mom was a public school teacher who taught second grade until she  was 70 years old. She loved teaching. Her favorite unit was the monarch  butterfly unit, where we would dress up as a monarch butterfly, and she  would teach the kids about metamorphosis. She would also wear that  monarch butterfly costume to the supermarket. She was dressed as this  big monarch butterfly with little antennas on her head and a sign that  said ``to Mexico or bust'' because that is where the monarch would fly  on its way from Canada through Minnesota and down.   At the visitation on the night before my mom's funeral, I met a  family. I had never met them before, but the mom was sobbing, and she  had an older son who had a severe disability. The mom said, ``You know,  your mom had my son here in school when he was in second grade. Now he  was grown up, and he said he always loved that monarch butterfly unit.  And after he graduated, he got a job bagging groceries, and your mom  would continue to go to the grocery store and she would stand in line  in her monarch butterfly outfit. For years she did this, and would  always give him a big hug when she got to the end of the line.'' That  was my mom, and she loved her kids, and she was a devoted teacher.   I learned the value of education from my parents and grandparents,  and I believe that it is a basic right that we have in this country  that every child should have a right to education. I know that Dr.  Miguel Cardona also believes in that right, and this is why I support  his confirmation as Secretary of Education. I will also note that  several of my Republican colleagues, including Senator Burr, ranking  member on the HELP Committee, have come to the same conclusion.   This past year has been like no other, filled with tremendous  challenges for students, educators, and families. As a result of this  pandemic, parents have had to teach their first graders how to use the  mute button to go to school. The crisis has taken a toll on the mental  health of students and educators. There is major work to do to make  sure that all students can catch up on lost learning caused by gaps in  access to technology and broadband during the pandemic.   Thankfully, there is now light at the end of the tunnel with the  development and distribution of vaccines that protect against the  coronavirus and stand to save millions of lives. Our country now faces  important decisions about how to safely and equitably return to in- person learning, and we need strong, thoughtful leadership to help  guide these decisions and get our country back up and running. That  means leadership we can trust to provide guidance that is driven by  science and by public health experts. It also means leadership that  will support the rights of all students to have a full and enriching  educational experience.  [[Page S888]]    I believe that Dr. Cardona will be a Secretary who will fight for  public education, not against it; a Secretary who takes seriously the  Federal Government's role in making education policy, informed by the  most rigorous science; perhaps most of all, a Secretary who fosters  compromise, not conflict, in addressing our Nation's many educational  challenges.   As one of my mentors Senator Paul Wellstone put it, government should  work to improve people's lives, and we have a lot of work to do with so  many students and families in need. But I come to this Chamber today  optimistic because our country has had a long and strong history of  stepping up during challenging times like these. I look forward to  partnering with Dr. Cardona to meet the needs of this moment and  overcome the obstacles we face to support students, teachers, and  schools as we work to recover from this pandemic and move forward.   With that, I ask my colleagues to support the nomination: Miguel  Cardona as Secretary of Education.                            ____________________
