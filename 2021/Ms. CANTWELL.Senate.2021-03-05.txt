 Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the  American Rescue Plan, but following my colleague from Washington and in  the presence of the Senator from Vermont, I just want to thank them for  how hard they have fought for an increase in the minimum wage.   Our State, the State of Washington, has led the Nation for many years  in the highest minimum wage, and it didn't impact our economy. In fact,  it helped our economy. There are now reports, as we have moved towards  $15 from just a little town, SeaTac, to the city of Seattle, to now a  plan for our entire State to move to $15 over a gradual period of time.   I urge my colleagues--I urge my colleagues to come together with a  plan that can get us to a $15 minimum wage. I know we have it in us. I  know we can do it. I so appreciate our colleagues waging this effort to  continue to make this a priority for our Nation.   I can't tell you enough how much the wages, particularly in a place  like Seattle, are going to matter to people, to have a livable wage. I  know people here have discussed various aspects of this program and the  plans that are in this bill, but I just want them to know that the cost  of living in a very expensive place like Seattle demands that we pay  workers what they deserve. It also means that we deal with big-city  problems like homelessness and deal with making investments, and I hope  that our next infrastructure bill will get to that.   This is not the last time I am going to speak about minimum wage, but  I want our colleagues to know that this battle is not over yet and that  if we want to raise the standard of living in the United States, we  have to pay a livable wage.   So I come to talk about the details of the rescue plan. This is 1  year since a young man from Everett, WA, became the first COVID victim  in the United States of America. Not only did he get sick, but many  loved ones got sick, their families, and they are all waiting now for  vaccines. So this legislation--priority No. 1 for so many Americans  right now is the COVID-19 vaccine.   In my State, the State of Washington, more than 1 million residents  have been vaccinated, and 6 million more are still waiting. Everyone  knows that demand far exceeds the supply. Our healthcare workers are  working tirelessly, along with other government officials, to get shots  in the arms of individuals.   That is why this bill is so important, because it provides $20  billion to invest in vaccine administration and distribution. That  includes launching community vaccine centers, deploying mobile vaccine  units to hard-to-reach areas, and continuing to support an increased  pace of vaccinations. That is job 1 right now--get the vaccine into the  arms of Americans.   That is why this legislation is so important, to continue that  effort, but it also provides other support, like extending unemployment  benefits for millions of Americans who lost their jobs through no fault  of their own a year ago and are now seeing unemployment benefits expire  next week.   We know what today's numbers say. We still have a very high  unemployment rate in the United States of America. So this bill extends  the benefit another 5 months, until August 29. It is a very prudent  measure to continue to put the resources into the American economy.   It also provides $1,400 stimulus payments to millions, and it  supports new efforts for our restaurants, small businesses, and those  devastated by the pandemic so they can use this money for payroll,  rent, utilities, and paid sick leave. This is so important, to continue  to learn from the programs that COVID has started and to refine them to  make them successful for our economy.   This also helps children who are at home, helping provide more money  for E-Rate and broadband connectivity for schools and libraries. This  is so important to individuals.   It also provides critical dollars for Federal health funding to treat  Native  [[Page S1225]]  Americans in urban areas, a community that has been very hard hit by  the pandemic.   Our economy lost 9.8 million jobs in 2020, and our current  unemployment rate, as I just said--we know from this data that came out  this morning--is still too high. We know that, as a result, 19 million  Americans, including 460,000 Washingtonians, rely on those unemployment  benefits. If we don't act by March 14, 11.5 million people will lose  their extended unemployment benefits. So that is why this program is so  important to get passed today in the Senate.   The restaurants, as we know, have been very plagued by this problem,  and the PPP program has been helpful, but I believe this legislation  will be even more helpful. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 110,000  restaurants across our country have closed either permanently or for an  extended period of time, including 2,300 in the State of Washington,  and some are just struggling to hang on.   For example, the Black Cypress restaurant in Pullman, WA, lost more  than 1 million in revenue and had to lay off workers after the initial  PPP loan program ran out. In southwest Washington, restaurants like the  Mighty Bowl in Vancouver and the Depot Restaurant in Seaview are  operating at 50 percent revenue loss.   I talked to one of our restaurant owners, Wassef Haroun, who operates  very popular restaurants in Seattle, including Mamnoon. He said his  restaurants have lost 70 percent of their revenue compared to 2019. And  these are people who are hustling to do standup, popup windows, and all  sorts of things to keep the restaurants and restaurant employees  working.   So the Paycheck Protection Program was critical, and these  improvements were desperately needed. That is why this bill includes a  new $25 billion grant program for restaurants to address those concerns  of rent and utilities and sick leave and other things head-on.   The bill also helps with more funding for the SBA live venues grant  program that we have authorized, helping those venues stay open. For us  in Seattle, music is a thing, and we want these venues to be there.  They are part of our history. They are part of our culture. They are  part of a music story that really is about, well, just a little bit  different take on music than maybe some other parts of the world. So we  are very proud of it, and we don't want to lose these facilities, the  home for growing more music and cultural impacts to our society.   So one of the hardest hit businesses, though, has been businesses  with 10 or fewer employees in underserved areas, like Grays Harbor,  Yakima, Ferry County, or Pend Oreille. This legislation allows $10,000  grants from the SBA program of Economic Injury and Disaster Loan  Program to help with the smaller communities and the small businesses  that have been underserved to date by the programs that we have passed.   But for the first time, in this legislation, there will be support  for the aviation supply chain. We are hearing all sorts of discussions  about supply chain shortages and the competitiveness of the United  States if the United States sees that critical supply chain elements  will not be able to be filled, whether you are talking about the  automotive industry or whether you are talking about aviation.   Well, in the previous bills, certainly, I can say that the Fed made  capital available that, certainly, manufacturers--large-scale  manufacturers--took advantage of. Previous bills made money available  for the airlines to continue operating, as this legislation does as  well. And I would say, I think, we are probably somewhere between 40 to  45 percent of the original capacity for airlines that we were previous  to the pandemic, which means we are making progress, and that is what  we always wanted to see--the ability to return our economy quickly.   But in Washington State alone, we have 30,000 aerospace manufacturing  and supply chain jobs that have been lost. Our aerospace supply chain  is part of a juggernaut for our economy. It helps us with our gross  domestic product, and it helps us in containing and keeping a workforce  that is skilled that can work postpandemic. So in this legislation, we  will be, for the first time, making resources available for that supply  chain.   I want to thank Senator Moran and Senator Warner and a slew of other  Members who worked on providing resources to this supply chain. It will  help us retain and rehire workers in the aviation manufacturing sector.  It will help us keep highly skilled workers who serve as the backbone  of industries so that our Nation can continue to be poised for the  recovery. And it helps us in making sure that we are poised for a  strong recovery. We know that aviation manufacturing jobs mean a lot to  our Nation. Finally, we are going to help stave off the tide of the  huge losses that we have seen in that sector.   We are going to help the mom-and-pop machine shops. We are going to  take those who have been working on small aircraft parts and landing  gears and doors and flight controls and help them with the impact that  they have felt in trying to keep a workforce during this period of  time.   These are all important priorities for us as a nation: the vaccines,  the unemployment benefits, the stimulus checks, the E-rate program for  helping students learn at home, the investment in the aerospace supply  chain. It is important that we get the dollars out the door. This will  help us recover. This will help American families wade through the last  months of this COVID pandemic fight. But, believe me, they need the  help in the last months. This fight is not over, and this will help  sustain us.   I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation.    Mr. President, the sun is coming up in Washington, DC,  and we have to spend all night debating policy and questions to arrive  at this moment, at 6 a.m., with an amendment that is literally robbing  Peter to pay Paul. This isn't the idea of a debate.   The Amtrak and North Corridor System has basically had to reallocate  resources. The 457 Corridor, which is one of the busiest in the Nation,  has over 750,000 people on that system, but because of COVID, it has  lost revenue. It has a 97-percent loss of revenue, and now they are  making drastic cuts to employees and to services that could become  permanent.   This simply helps Amtrak and our busiest corridor stay in business.  We will address the Coast Guard needs in other legislation. I ask my  colleagues to vote no. Stop robbing Peter to pay Paul. Let's fix the  COVID crisis on our transportation system.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1395
