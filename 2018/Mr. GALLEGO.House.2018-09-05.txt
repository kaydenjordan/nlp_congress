 Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, tens of thousands of  Arizona teachers took to the streets to demand that Governor Ducey and  the Arizona State Legislature do right by Arizona students. It did so  because Ducey and the State GOP have crippled the State's public  education system.   Arizona spends the second lowest amount of money per student in the  country, and Arizona's teachers are paid at the second lowest rate in  the country. Students and teachers alike describe textbooks held  together by tape, moldy ceilings leaking on students, and classes so  overcrowded that kids have to sit on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, that is not what schools in the richest country in the  world should look like. That is why Arizona's teachers championed the  Invest in Ed proposition, to secure over $600 million in annual  education funds for Arizona after Governor Ducey failed to provide the  resources our students so desperately needed.   Over a quarter of a million Arizonans signed their names to get the  Invest in Ed proposal on Arizona's ballot this fall. That is democracy  in action. But last week, the Arizona State Supreme Court ordered the  removal of the Invest in Ed proposition from State ballots based on a  small technicality.   This appalling ruling is an insult to Arizona students, teachers,  families, and to democracy. It is a blow to Arizona's education system  and our economy. It is a naked power grab by the GOP that undermines  our democracy by removing the right of voters to choose what is best  for their kids and their communities.   Invest in Ed wasn't defeated because a majority of Arizonans votes  against it. It wasn't defeated because it was opposed by an elected  politician who can be removed from office in the next election. It was  killed by Doug Ducey's supreme court, a court that Ducey and the  Arizona Republicans packed with conservatives.   Governor Ducey fully understood the power a court can wield when he  ran through his court-packing plan in 2016  [[Page H7829]]  to increase the size of the Arizona State Supreme Court. He knew the  incredible power of a supreme court pick, even at the State level.   Mr. Speaker, we in Congress must not underestimate that power,  especially now. Donald Trump has nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to  fill a seat in the U.S. Supreme Court, and here is what we know:   Judge Kavanaugh believes that a woman has no legal right to full  autonomy over her own body;   Judge Kavanaugh believes that the agency created to protect consumers  from fraud and predatory lending is unconstitutional;   Judge Kavanaugh believes that access to affordable healthcare should  be determined by your age or your gender or your preexisting condition;   Judge Kavanaugh believes that the President should be above the law.   Here is what we don't know:   We don't know what is in the hundreds of thousands of pages of  Kavanaugh's records that the Trump White House has refused to release,  contrary to a century of Supreme Court precedent. That is unacceptable.   The Invest in Ed decision in Arizona is a blatant example of judicial  power gone wrong, judicial power used to undermine democracy.   If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh would join a panel of Justices with  this very same power: the power to keep gutting the Voting Rights Act,  the power to keep green-lighting partisan gerrymandering, the power to  keep signing off on GOP efforts to purge the voter rolls.   We cannot allow this to happen. Doug Ducey's State supreme court set  back democracy in Arizona. What Doug Ducey did to Arizona, Donald Trump  will do to America with this Supreme Court. We cannot let that happen.   My colleagues in the Senate should reject Judge Kavanaugh's  nomination. Our democracy depends on it.                            ____________________
