 Mr. President, I just want to thank my colleagues  Senator Graham and Senator Ernst for their outstanding work in this  regard.   We have worked over many years to get a bill that can be agreed upon.  Senator Ernst made sure that her concerns were met in several ways. But  I agree with both of their statements. I do not believe that survivors  of sexual assault and harassment will abuse the ability to file cases  in court.   The bill plainly reads, which is very relevant to Senator Ernst's  concerns, that only disputes that relate to sexual assault or  harassment conduct can escape the forced arbitration clauses. ``That  relate to'' is in the text. The language of the bill specifically  states that ``the term `sexual harassment dispute' means a dispute  relating to conduct that is alleged to constitute sexual harassment  under applicable Federal, Tribal, or State law,'' and ``the term  `sexual assault dispute' means a dispute involving a nonconsensual  sexual act or sexual conduct.''   To be clear, there are no new legal burdens to sexual harassment  established in the bill. This was another concern that Senator Ernst  had. It is all tied to existing Federal, State, and Tribal law.   This bill will basically give survivors the ability to go to court  where they are ``alleging conduct constituting a sexual harassment  dispute or a sexual assault dispute.'' When a sexual assault or sexual  harassment survivor files a court case in order to seek accountability,  her single case may include multiple claims. But as Senator Ernst said,  if those claims on harassment or assault are dismissed, then she would  go back to the arbitration process.   But it is--and this is important to Senator Graham and I--it is  essential that all the claims related to the sexual assault or  harassment can be adjudicated at one time for the specific purpose that  Senator Ernst is well aware of. We don't want to have to make a sexual  assault or harassment victim relive that experience in multiple  jurisdictions. So we want to be able to deal with all the harassment-  and assault-related claims in one goal. But, again, if those aren't  part of it, then this bill does not apply to it.   So you are quite right in your clarification, and that is exactly  what we intended the bill to do.   Every State and Federal court in the country requires a person to  allege certain things in a certain way in order to properly plead a  case such that it won't be immediately dismissed. Victims here must  follow the rules and plead a case correctly, and then they must also  affirm to the Court that they have a good-faith basis for doing so.  Attorneys must do the same thing.   If victims and attorneys break those rules, they can be sanctioned in  court, as Senator Graham mentioned. To ensure that a victim is able to  realize the rights and protections intended to be restored to her by  this legislation, all of the related claims will proceed together.   I yield back to my colleagues.   Can I just read my full statement now?    Do you have more to say, Senator Ernst?    Mr. President, I just want to, for the record, talk  about this legislation and how important it is.   I am extremely grateful for the work of Senator Graham over the last  5 years in writing this bill. And I am very grateful to the majority  leader for meeting with Senator Ernst and Senator Graham yesterday to  make the final decisions on this bill and to close the deal.   Senator Schumer is one of the greatest listeners and has the ability  to bring legislation to fruition, and that is exactly what he did  yesterday. And I am very grateful.   This bill represents one of the most significant workplace reforms in  American history. It will help us fix a broken system that protects  perpetrators and corporations and end the days of silencing survivors.   Too often, when survivors of sexual assault or harassment in the  workplace come forward, they are told they are legally forbidden to sue  their employer because somewhere buried in their employment contract  was a forced arbitration clause, often accompanied by a nondisclosure  agreement.   Instead of being allowed their day in court, these survivors are  pushed into a system designed by the same corporation that they are  challenging. They are blocked from seeking information that could prove  their case, and they are left in the hands of an extrajudicial  arbitrator who is typically selected by their employer and is not  always a trained lawyer.   The arbitration process not only allows the corporations to hide  sexual harassment and assault cases in this secretive and often biased  process, but it shields those who have committed serious misconduct  from the public eye. Across the board, employees are less likely to win  an arbitration than they are in court. Even when they do win, they  typically receive much lower monetary awards. And because the results  of arbitration are secret and binding, there is no chance for an  appeal, and repeat offenders are often not held to account.   Estimates suggest that more than 60 million Americans are subject to  arbitration clauses. Many don't even know it because the clauses are  hidden in the fine print. Forced arbitration clauses are especially  common in female-dominated industries.   The ACLU has reported that 57.6 percent of female workers are subject  to this practice. It is also especially prevalent in low-wage fields  and industries with disproportionately high numbers of women of color.  These clauses leave those women who often cannot afford to challenge  their employers without recourse. But this affects women in every  industry.   A 2018 analysis of sexual harassment claims made on Wall Street found  that in 30 years, just 17 women--30 years, just 17 women--won their  claims before Wall Street's oversight body, and most cases were  dismissed or denied.   I want to share the stories of two survivors to illustrate how broken  the system is.   First is Lora Henry, who worked at a Kia dealership in Ohio where her  boss sexually harassed her, touching her inappropriately, making  inappropriate comments, bringing her inappropriate gifts. When she  reported him, the company did a sham investigation and forced her into  arbitration. She was only able to share her story because Congress  issued her a subpoena. She should not have needed the protection of a  congressional subpoena to speak out. She testified, ``The cycle of  harassment will continue if you force women to be quiet and allow  sexual harassers and the companies that allow them to hide behind  arbitration agreements.''   The second story is about Andowah Newton, who was working for the  vice president of legal affairs at the luxury goods company LVMH Moet  Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Inc., in New York, when she reported being  sexually harassed and assaulted by a colleague. Even  [[Page S628]]  though she filed her sexual harassment case in a New York State court,  the company moved to compel forced arbitration on the grounds that  Federal law supersedes New York State law that attempts to protect  victims of harassment from being forced into arbitration. She said:         Because of forced arbitration and [confidentiality       agreements], I may never know the extent to which [this       perpetrator] sexually assaulted or harassed others, [and] if       LVMH retaliated against others as they did me. . . . His       sexual harassment, attempted assault, and assault made me       feel scared, demeaned, and ashamed. I found myself constantly       agitated, distressed, and hypervigilant, preoccupied with       avoiding the trauma of encountering him.    Even with her legal expertise and experience as vice president of  legal affairs, she was powerless in this system. She said the company  convinced her ``that . . . harassment was just a byproduct of being an  attractive woman who works at a company with a French culture.'' That  is the same company running the arbitration process. That is why this  bill fixes the problem.   Survivors deserve a real chance at justice, and that is what this  bill does.   This bipartisan, bicameral bill would amend the Federal Arbitration  Act to void all forced arbitration provisions for sexual assault and  harassment survivors. Removing those provisions would give survivors  their day in court, allow them to discuss their case publicly, and end  the days of institutional protection of harassers.   This legislation passed with bipartisan, broad support in the House,  and I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this critical  workplace reform in the Senate.   Again, I thank Senator Schumer and Senator Graham.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I want to be clear, there is  nothing in the bill requiring any court to adopt new dismissal  mechanisms for victims' claims. How and when a case moves forward is by  virtue of current existing State or Federal law. There is no new  mechanism in this bill to allow for dismissal, and there is no reason  to require victims to have to prove a sexual assault or harassment  claim prior to trial or have it go back through a forced arbitration  process. Civil assault and battery claims are very difficult to prove  under especially arcane State laws. But this bill allows any conduct  alleging a violation of those laws, and any claims related to such  conduct, to move forward together in one case.
