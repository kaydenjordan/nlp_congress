 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to ask for  unanimous consent for Jay Snyder, our nominee to be a member of the  U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy.   Around the world today, American values are in direct competition  with powerful autocratic regimes. From Iranian protestors struggling  against a misogynistic theocracy in Tehran to the African and Latin- American nations combating Russian propaganda, to the information  warfare China directs across the Taiwan Strait, in every case, a well- run American public diplomacy program is often the best tool we have to  make the case for our vision of the world--a world that respects  international law, that supports free speech, and defends fundamental  rights. And the members of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public  Diplomacy are essential to this effort.   Since 1948, the Commission has worked to understand and inform  foreign publics. And whether it is our people-to-people exchanges that  introduce the world to our country or confronting the deluge of  misinformation meant to undermine democracies across the globe, Jay  Snyder's perspectives and expertise will be critical.   He has a career spanning public service, academia, philanthropy, and  the private sector, working throughout the United States, Europe, Asia,  and the Middle East.   He has served on the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy  before, starting in 2003. He has also served as a representative to the  United Nations General Assembly and in his home State at the New York  State Commission on Public Authority Reform.   In 2009, he founded the Open Hands Initiative, a nonprofit  organization dedicated to public diplomacy, connecting young leaders  and underserved communities across the developing world.   He also serves on Georgetown University's College Board of Advisors  and the University of Southern California's Center for Public Diplomacy  Advisory Board.   This is a nominee who will hit the ground running from day one.   Russia and China are not sitting idly by. They are throwing money and  manpower at an all-out effort to convince the world that democracy  doesn't work. We need to be fighting back. Our Nation cannot afford to  wait another day without Mr. Synder assuming his post to tackle these  challenges.  [[Page S7218]]    So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive  session to consider the following nomination under the privileged  section of the Executive Calendar: PN2451, Jay T. Snyder, to be a  Member of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy; that the  Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate;  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action and the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the  ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, for his remarks and  for the conversation we had before. I appreciate that, and I look  forward to making this happen in the very early part of the new  Congress.   But I will just simply say that the Board, of course, is comprised of  nominees recommended by the majority and the minority, and, ideally,  that is how they would move forward. I am ready to be supportive of  moving forward on other nominees for this position as well.   But as has been said, the reality is that the minority has yet to  make their recommendations, despite having had more than 2 years to do  so--2 years.   So, in a sense, it is not fair to reject those who are waiting and  went through the process and did their disclosures and everything else  and have been hanging out there because the minority has not chosen to  make their nominations.   I understand the Senator is objecting on behalf of his leadership. I  just hope that this draws attention to the Republican leadership so  that they, hopefully, will come up with their two names so that as we  start the new session of Congress, we can get this done right away.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such  notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale  may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert Menendez,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

The estimated total cost was $1.673 billion.       Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $0.978 billion of       this total.        This transmittal reports a correction to the previously       notified ``eleven (11) F100-GE-129D engines (8 installed, 3       spares)'' to ``eleven (11) F110-GE-129D engines (8 installed,       3 spares);'' there is currently no GE aircraft engine       designated as F100. The following non-MDE items will also be       included: ROVER 6Si units with Tactical Network ROVER (TNR)       2i kits; and STINGER MB ground terminal systems. The total       MDE value will remain $0.978 billion. The total case value       will remain $1.673 billion.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided to       correctly identify the designation of F110-GE-129D engines to       be included in this sale. Additionally, the inclusion of the       additional non-MDE items represents an increase in capability       over what was previously notified. The proposed articles and       services will support Bulgaria's purchase of F-16s and       associated equipment and will provide Bulgaria with a       credible defense capability to deter aggression in the       region.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally that       is a force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The L3Harris ROVER 6Si       transceiver provides real-time, full-motion video (FMV) and       other network data for situational awareness, targeting,       battle damage assessment, surveillance, relay, convoy over-      watch operations and other situations where eyes-on-target       are required. It provides expanded frequencies and additional       processing resources from previous ROVER versions, allowing       increased levels of collaboration and interoperability with       numerous manned and unmanned airborne platforms.        The TNR 2i handheld transceiver supports both analog and       digital waveforms enabling interoperability with commonly       fielded US and NATO airborne platforms. In addition to       traditional video downlink capability, TNR 2i provides       bidirectional IP networking (Net-T). This kind of network       connectivity allows for Digitally Aided Close Air Support       (DaCAS), ground force position sharing, chat and large file       transfer capabilities.  [[Page S7246]]         The STINGER MB is a tracking antenna system for long-range       data links, supporting simultaneous transmit and receive       capability in the UHF, L, S, C and Ku frequency bands.        The highest level of classification of information included       in this potential sale is SECRET.
