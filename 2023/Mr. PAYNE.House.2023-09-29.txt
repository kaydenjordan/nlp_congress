 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late U.S. Senator  Dianne Feinstein.  [[Page H4899]]    As a Senator, she served the people of California for 31 years, and  she was the longest-serving female Senator in American history.   Senator Feinstein was a true trailblazer. She was the first woman  elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She was the first  woman elected to serve as San Francisco's mayor. As a Senator, she was  the first woman to chair the powerful Senate Rules and Senate  Intelligence Committees.   Senator Feinstein leaves a legacy of incredible accomplishment. She  wrote the popular assault weapons ban in 1994, a ban that we need to  reintroduce today. She helped create the nationwide AMBER Alert system  to help communities find abducted children. She helped reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act.   She was a strong advocate for women and the betterment of all  Americans, and she will truly be missed in the Senate and California.                            ____________________
