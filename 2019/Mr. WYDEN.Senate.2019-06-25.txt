 Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleagues Senator  Joni Ernst, Congressman Rob Bishop, and Congresswoman Debbie Dingell to  introduce the bipartisan Recreation Not Red Tape (RNR) Act. In Oregon  and nationwide, the outdoor recreation economy is growing. Nationally,  outdoor recreation generates $887 billion in annual consumer spending  and 7.6 million American jobs. As those numbers keep rising,  communities across the country are benefiting from growing American  interest in enjoying the great outdoors. Our bill will help grow the  economic potential of the outdoor recreation economy by opening access,  reducing red tape, and updating Federal recreation guidelines.   Unfortunately, getting outside often requires permits, parking passes  and camping fees that are important to maintaining public lands, but  too often involve confusing, complicated and lengthy processes to  obtain. This bill removes barriers to outdoor recreation, making it  easier for visitors from near and far to get outdoors and enjoy  America's treasures. By streamlining paths for more people to get  outdoors, the Recreation Not Red Tape Act will encourage outdoor  recreation opportunities, giving communities an economic boost.   The RNR Act includes provisions from Senator Heinrich's Simplifying  Outdoor Access for Recreation Act. The bill improves the Federal  outdoor recreation permitting process by eliminating duplicative and  bureaucratic reviews, requiring time limits for processing permit  applications, reducing fees, and simplifying multi-jurisdictional  trips. The bill also ensures recreation permits are available for  online purchases.   The RNR Act encourages all military branches to include information  about outdoor recreation opportunities as part of the basic services  provided to service members and veterans, and encourages all military  branches to allow active-duty service members to engage in outdoor  recreation or environmental stewardship activities without taking away  their hard-earned leave.   For the first time, the RNR Act directs Federal land management  agencies to enhance recreation opportunities when making land and water  management decisions. The RNR Act ensures Federal land managers have  and maintain recreation access goals. Importantly, the RNR Act  highlights the recreational values of public lands across the county  and encourages more National Recreation Area designations in the future  by creating a system of National Recreation Areas to manage recreation  lands in uniform guidelines.   Additionally, the RNR Act encourages volunteer opportunities to help  agencies carry out public lands maintenance projects, such as trail  maintenance on Federal lands. The bill establishes a pilot program to  create uniform interagency trail management standards for trails that  cross agency jurisdictional boundaries.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Portman, and Mr. Van Hollen):   S. 1969. A bill to authorize the Fallen Journalists Memorial  Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of  Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources.
