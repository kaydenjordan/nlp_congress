 Mr. Speaker, this week I am  reintroducing the National Right-to-Work Act with over 60 original  cosponsors.   I, along with over 80 percent of the American people, believe that  every worker should have the power to decide whether to negotiate for  themselves with their employer. This bill would simply listen to the  majority of American workers.   South Carolina has seen firsthand the job creation when we protect  freedoms for American workers. I was present for Michelin Tire Corp.'s  groundbreaking with Governor Jim Edwards to develop their largest plant  in the world. I was with Governor Carroll Campbell for the BMW  groundbreaking in Greer for their largest manufacturing facility. And I  was with Governor Nikki Haley to see the building of Boeing aircraft in  Charleston.   Congratulations to Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work  Legal Defense Foundation, for his success in 27 States.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
