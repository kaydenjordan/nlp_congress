 Mr. Speaker, I come before this body today with a heavy  heart. A dear friend of mine, Mr. Paul Booth, we lost him 12 days ago  to leukemia. Mr. Booth was a man who dedicated his life to the simple  idea of fairness--fairness for workers, fairness in all aspects of  life.   Paul Booth was a leading adviser to nearly every union president over  the last several years at the American Federation of State, County and  Municipal Employees. He also worked hard to lift up dignity in all  aspects of his life.   He was a student organizer and brought attention to the folly of the  U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war, and he had been active in making  Americans' lives better his entire life.   He understood the very simple idea that working people have dignity  and that they must be treated to reflect that dignity by their  government. He also understood that the linkage between hard work and  prosperity should always be close and tight. He recognized that, in our  country today, you can work very hard and still only make it. That is  why he was one of the first people to work for a living wage policy in  this country. He was fighting for a living wage before it was popular.   Paul Booth also happened to have a marvelous partner. Her name is  Heather Booth, and everybody knows Heather.   But I just want to say, when people who make a life of service pass  from this life, it is important that we recognize the tremendous debt  we owe them.   I want to thank Paul and Heather Booth for their mentorship of me and  for their service to our country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker and Members, it is important to understand  the big picture here.   When the Supreme Court takes up Janus, yes, they are going to be  talking about fair share. Is it legal, is it constitutional, for  someone to benefit from being represented by a labor union that has to  fight for them and then still not have to pay anything to help at all.  That will be the question before the Court.   But that is just a very small part of what is really going on. What  is really going on, Mr. Speaker, is that we see the deconstruction of  the American middle class. The question is: Will America be a land of  opportunity; or will it be a land of stagnation where you can work as  hard as you want to, but you are never going to be able to make enough  to really make it?   What is going on here, Mr. Speaker, is that the conservative movement  in our country is trying to break the link between hard work and  prosperity as they rifle money and channel it to the very richest among  us, and working people just have to hope for the best and work hard  just to get back to work for whatever they can scrape together.   Because at the end of the day, labor unions have given workers a  voice which has helped create the great American middle class. The  lightbulb and the semiconductor are not the great inventions of  America. They are great inventions, but the greatest invention of the  United States of America is this big, giant middle class which you can  work hard and get into.   This is what is under threat. This is what we are fighting to uphold  tonight.   Now, Janus is a decision that takes place within the context of other  decisions. Let us not forget Shelby County, a case which attacked our  right to vote. Let's not forget Citizens United, a case which says  corporations are people and they can spend as much money on elections  as they choose. Let's not forget these tax cuts passed just about a few  weeks ago which rifle money to the richest among us and undermine  American workers.   We are in the middle of a battle over whether or not the United  States will continue to be a place where hard work pays. That is what  this fight is about. And that, Mr. Speaker, is what we invite everyone  to understand the union difference. If you are Black, being in a union  means you are going to make more money than other folks. If you are a  woman, it will mean the same thing. If you are a veteran, it will mean  the same thing. Unions have always done more for the people who are in  them, and we want to get more people in unions, not fewer.   The attack that we see tonight in the form of this Janus v. AFSCME is  an attack on that union advantage. But unions have helped everybody,  Mr. Speaker. If you look at wage stagnation in America, what you see  since World War II, right up until the 1970s, is pay going up and up  and up for working people until we see union density begin to break  down, and it is at that point that we begin to see wages flatten out  and stagnate.   Unions create not just good pay and good benefits for their workers,  but they actually create benefits for all workers because unions create  the wage floor and lift up all boats.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that this is African American History Month  only a few days away beginning in February. We must remember people  like A. Philip Randolph, who was not only a union leader, he was a  civil rights leader. We can't forget about E. D. Nixon, who helped  start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which led to the beginning of the  modern American civil rights movement. And let us not forget our  beloved Martin Luther King, whose birthday we celebrated a few days  ago, and who we will recognize the 50th anniversary of his  assassination this year, died fighting for workers of the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Workers, who is one of the  litigants in this case, the Janus case.    So I want to say, if you care about income inequality, if you care  about prosperity for working people, you have got to get on the side of  fighting against this Janus decision. This is what is going on.
