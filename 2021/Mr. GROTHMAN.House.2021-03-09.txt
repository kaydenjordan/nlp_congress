 Mr. Speaker, I will make four points on this bill.   First of all, under this bill, you can have a vote on unionization  within under 15--I am told even 11--days of finding out the vote is  coming. You look at our elections. I know in the State of Wisconsin,  probably similar, you get over 2\1/2\ months between filing and knowing  you are going to have an election and actually the election. It is hard  to believe anybody who really cares about the worker would do that.   Secondly, your privacy concerns. You are even giving the addresses of  all of the employees to the unions. This is supposedly the party of  women. Do you really want to come home at night and have people in your  driveway wanting to talk to you about an election?   Third, we are getting rid of the secret ballot. I don't know how  anybody who cares about anybody would get rid of the secret ballot.   And, fourth, you have a situation here, when it is unclear whether  something right or wrong happened, automatically you go to a union. So  you can have a situation here in which the majority of people did not  vote for a union, and the government bureaucrat says, automatically,  you are unionized.   And one final comment: For people talking about purchasing power, the  most recent COVID bill is a strange bill. Your purchasing power is  going down.
