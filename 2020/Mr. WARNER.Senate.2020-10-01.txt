 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and celebrate  the career of an outstanding civil servant, Mr. Frank Calvelli, who is  one of my constituents. Mr. Calvelli recently announced his plan to  retire after 34 years of government service, most recently as the  Principal Deputy Director for the National Reconnaissance Office, where  he has provided commendable leadership and operational management for  the past 8 years. Mr. Calvelli will complete his government service at  the end of this year.   During Frank's 30-year tenure at the NRO, he has been responsible for  leading various internal organizations and overseeing the acquisition  and operation of many of our Nation's most vital overhead  reconnaissance assets. These platforms perform essential intelligence  collection roles to better inform U.S. Government and allied partner  nation defense policies and deter potential aggressors. Frank  contributed to 11-plus-years of consecutive clean financial audits, an  unequaled record within the U.S. intelligence community. Mr. Calvelli  has played an important role developing a permanent employee cadre and  leading the more than 3,000 people who work at the NRO. When called  upon in 2019 to take on the responsibility of acting in the capacity of  the Director, he often testified on behalf of the NRO before Congress  and specifically the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.   While Mr. Calvelli has shouldered the responsibility of overseeing  large, complex government acquisition programs, his fondest memories  will be of the NRO's people. Like any successful organization, the NRO  relies on its talented and skilled workforce to accomplish its national  security mission. Their wellbeing and success have always been a top  priority for him, and it is especially important that the women and men  of the NRO have leadership that backs them in their primary imperative  as intelligence professionals: to speak truth to power.   I also understand that Frank's love of NASCAR is well known at the  NRO. I, too, share an appreciation of NASCAR and hope he has greater  opportunities to enjoy racing and more time with his family. On behalf  of a grateful nation, as he transitions to future opportunities, I  would like to publicly thank Mr. Calvelli for his valuable  contributions to the Nation and our national security, and I personally  thank the Calvelli family for their critical role in supporting him  throughout his service to the Nation.                            ____________________
