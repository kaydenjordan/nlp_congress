 Mr. Speaker, ever since the Russian invasion of Ukraine,  world leaders have been warning of imminent food shortages, including  our own President.   Two of the largest producers of wheat and oilseed are embroiled at  war. Ukrainian civilians are fighting to protect their homes and their  self-sovereignty. They aren't out planting crops as normal.   Meanwhile, there are breaking reports of Russian soldiers stealing  Ukrainian wheat, selling it at marked-up costs to nations facing food  insecurity in Africa.   Meanwhile, the Russian Navy has blocked grain carriers from leaving  Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odessa in an effort to blackmail the world  into supporting Putin's war.  [[Page H5614]]    The U.N. is trying to broker a deal that will enable Ukraine's grain  to be shipped from ports such as Odessa, but Russia has said it wants  Western sanctions lifted as part of the deal. Twenty million tons of  Ukrainian grain is stuck in Ukraine, at risk of being stolen by  Russians.   What are we doing in this country? We are not producing the way we  could in California. Waters are being shifted away from farmers, and so  our own wheat crops in northern California are dying out.   The Biden administration must roll back the regulations that are  making it hard for farmers in this country to do what they need to do  to be a part of this world solution for food, as famine will soon be  upon us, especially in the 2023 crop year.                            ____________________
