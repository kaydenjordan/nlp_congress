 Mr. Speaker, the aggressive concentration of wealth in  corporate boardrooms, the unending attacks on unions and their attempts  to organize, and the passage of so-called right-to-work laws, which we  now know are really the right-to-deprivation laws, have left America's  workers begging for scraps, rather than receiving the fair compensation  and full benefits they deserve.   My father was a proud member of the Ironworkers Union. He showed up  every day and worked hard, erecting buildings and bridges across New  England.   And while he was at work, he knew that his union was fighting to  defend him and his brothers and sisters and their families by looking  out for our interests at the negotiating table.  [[Page H1150]]    It is thanks to the strong benefits and wages secured by his union  that my parents were able to provide for my sisters and me.   The PRO Act is about making sure that other families have that same  chance. It is about restoring dignity and power to where it belongs:  with our workers.   After all, it is our workers who kept us afloat, fed, housed, and  safe this last year. For that I urge this bill's passage.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in support of this  bill.                                                         AFSCME,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to vote Yes on the       ``Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act'' (H.R. 842). As       the largest public-sector union our members believe that all       workers, both private and public sector, deserve the right to       organize and bargain collectively to improve their working       conditions.        Workers need a voice on the job now more than ever before.       Since the beginning of the pandemic, unions have advocated       for workers' safety and protections. Nurses, teachers, first       responders, bus drivers, grocery store workers and other       essential workers were in desperate need of personal       protective equipment and the right to use paid leave to self-      quarantine or take care of someone who might have been       affected, which unions fought for. Unions also helped to       prevent layoffs and furloughs to save jobs and win additional       premium pay and paid sick time.        The value that unions provide to workers and their families       creates a strong middle class that makes the economy work for       all Americans. With high unemployment and people struggling       to make ends meet, it is important to strengthen workers'       rights and the ability to organize. On average, a worker       covered by a union contract earns 11.2 percent more in wages       than a worker in a nonunion workplace in the same sector.       Living wages and benefits with union jobs can lead to job       competition with nonunion jobs, helping to strengthen local       economies.        The PRO Act strengthens federal laws that protect workers'       rights to organize and collectively bargain for wages, paid       leave, health insurance, retirement benefits, and workplace       protections and safety. The bill increases penalties for       employers that violate workers' rights. It strengthens       support for workers who suffer retaliation. It prevents       employers from misclassifying employees, and it prohibits       employers from interfering in union elections.        AFSCME strongly urges Congress to pass the PRO Act to build       back our country and to get us out of this economic crisis       stronger than before.            Sincerely,                                                Bailey K. Childers,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.
