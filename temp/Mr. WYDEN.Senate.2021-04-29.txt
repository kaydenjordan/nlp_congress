 Madam President, today I have introduced the Retirement  Parity for Student Loans Act. This legislation would permit employers  to make matching contributions to workers under 401(k) and similar  types of retirement plans as if a worker's student loan payments were  salary reduction contributions to the retirement plan. This legislation  will help workers who cannot afford to both save for retirement and pay  off their student loan debt by providing them with employer  contributions to build their retirement savings. This legislation is a  common sense fix to the rules that govern employer-sponsored retirement  plans and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask  unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of bill was ordered to be printed  in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1443         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Retirement Parity for       Student Loans Act''.       SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS AS ELECTIVE                     DEFERRALS FOR PURPOSES OF MATCHING                     CONTRIBUTIONS.

(b) Qualified Student Loan Payment.--Paragraph (4) of       section 401(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is       amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(D) Qualified student loan payment.--The term `qualified       student loan payment' means a payment made by an employee in       repayment of a qualified education loan (as defined in       section 221(d)(1)) incurred by the employee to pay qualified       higher education expenses, but only--        ``(i) to the extent such payments in the aggregate for the       year do not exceed an amount equal to--         ``(I) the limitation applicable under section 402(g) for       the year (or, if lesser, the employee's compensation (as       defined in section 415(c)(3)) for the year), reduced by        ``(II) the elective deferrals made by the employee for such       year, and         ``(ii) if the employee certifies to the employer making the       matching contribution under this paragraph that such payment       has been made on such loan.
