 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the  conclusion of the remarks by the ranking member, that I be recognized.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding previous Senate action on the House message to  accompany H.R. 695, today's motions and amendments remain in status quo  and the earlier motion to concur and the motion to refer with  instructions and amendments Nos. 1923 and 1924 be withdrawn.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent to  complete my remarks.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the  conclusion of my remarks, Senator Paul be recognized for up to 15  minutes.    Mr. President, I have a message to deliver this morning,  but after sitting here and listening through and enjoying the comments  that were made, I wanted to at least make one comment about the Senator  from Texas.   In my real life, for a number of years, I was a builder and developer  in South Texas. I know South Texas very well. I know the border well.  That is why I have been down there so much and am so interested in, of  course, the border wall, which we are going to have. But we have a  wonderful friend and a person who has been a good friend. You would  think he is dead, but he is not. He is very much alive, and he is back  doing his full-time job.   I want to say that the time I spent with him down there in Texas long  before he was even in the position he is in today--he has been a great  hero down there not just to the people in Texas but people all over the  country.
