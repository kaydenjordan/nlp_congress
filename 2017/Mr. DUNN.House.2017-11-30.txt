 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a decorated combat  veteran and distinguished public servant as one of the newest inductees  into the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame.   This week, Governor Rick Scott and the Florida Department of  Veterans' Affairs honored John Thrasher for his continued commitment to  the State of Florida.   John currently serves as the president of Florida State University,  where he earned his bachelor's and law degrees. John joined the United  States Army after graduating from FSU and went on to receive two Bronze  Stars while serving in Vietnam, eventually earning the rank of captain.   He has been an advocate for veterans throughout his entire life,  especially while serving as the speaker of the house in Florida and  later as senator. Under his leadership as president, FSU has become one  of the top universities in the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating FSU President John  Thrasher for being inducted into the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame and  thanking him for his continued service to our veterans.                            ____________________
