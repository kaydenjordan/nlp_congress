 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for that very warm and gracious  introduction. But also let me just thank the gentlewoman for her  steadiness, her persistence, and her perseverance and for bringing the  truth about so many issues about Black people in the diaspora in our  own country to the forefront and providing a moment and, yes, being in  Galveston for the first time where my grandfather W.C. Parish was born.  My great-grandmother was enslaved in Galveston, and I had never been to  Galveston except for this weekend. So I thank Congresswoman Sheila  Jackson Lee for her hospitality.   I also thank her--and I must mention this--that after my friend  championed the legislation for a national holiday, all of the polls,  all of the surveys, and all of the news reports indicate that twice as  many people in our country know about the African-American culture,  history, and what took place before 1865. So that is in large part due  to the tireless effort of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. She said  over the weekend that Juneteenth provides for a moment of unity and for  a moment of healing.   As we move forward now, and the gentlewoman knows I have got to  mention H.R. 40 because that is next in terms of understanding and  developing the commission to study and develop reparations. But I think  this weekend really put us on another path, a more aggressive path now  to get that done. So I thank the gentlewoman very much.   Also, let me thank our chair, Chairwoman Joyce Beatty, for her kind  remarks, but also for really making sure that our message and our power  is brought to the forefront in the United States as it relates to the  Congressional Black Caucus. I know of no one who really understands the  historical context of African Americans and Black people in the  diaspora than Congresswoman Chairwoman Joyce Beatty.   When I think about Chairwoman Beatty, I always think about this bird,  and I mentioned it to her, the sankofa bird in the language of Ghana,  the Ghanian people. It is a beautiful bird with an egg in her mouth  looking backwards and beginning her move forward. Congresswoman Beatty  always works to give reverence and give credit to those who came before  us and remind us of our history looking back, knowing how we got here,  but also reminding us all that we must move forward until this country  provides liberty and justice for all.   So I just have to thank Chairwoman Beatty for always through her  leadership making sure that the whole country understands the sankofa  moment for us as African Americans in our country.   Also, all of our Caribbean Members, I see Congresswoman Yvette Clarke  come in. Her ancestors are from Jamaica, her mother and father. She has  contributed to this Congress, to her constituents, to the country and  to the Caribbean. She is an example of how Caribbean Americans bring  forth their wisdom, their passion, and their brilliance, never  forgetting their heritage. We have to thank them also for their  tremendous leadership here in this body because they have truly made a  major contribution to the United States House of Representatives.                                time  2030    Yes, almost three decades ago, I really fought hard, and we did do  this in a bipartisan way, passing legislation to designate June as  Caribbean American Heritage Month.   President Bush actually signed this into law in 2006. Since then,  June has given us the opportunity to celebrate the tremendous impact  that the people of the Caribbean have made on the United States.   Let me also acknowledge Dr. Claire Nelson, who is a great Caribbean- American leader, for inspiring this effort.   Since the founding of this country, Caribbean Americans have  contributed to every aspect of our society, including greatly to the  fine arts, education, business, literature, journalism, sports,  fashion, politics, government, military service, music, science,  medicine, engineering, technology, and many other fields.   We enjoy the richness of Caribbean-American culture through the  festivals, carnivals, music, dance, film, food, and literature, which  can be found across the United States.   Most importantly, a number of Caribbean Americans have been leaders  in the civil and human rights movement and other social and political  movements in the United States.   It is not surprising that people from the Caribbean are so connected  to our country, those who now live in the Caribbean, who are Caribbean  residents.   The countries of the Caribbean represent the United States' third  border. These countries are important economic and cultural partners of  the United States. We share parallel histories informed by struggles  against slavery and colonialism and for independence, democracy, and  shared prosperity.   We all share the same hopes and aspirations for peace and prosperity  throughout the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the world.   In fact, for these reasons and many more, the Congressional Black  Caucus and I have been pushing hard for the United States to engage  more deeply with our Caribbean neighbors.   We were, a couple of weeks ago, recently, at the Summit of the  Americas in Los Angeles. Several members and our chairwoman-- Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,  Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett, and others--were in Los Angeles  participating at the summit, making sure that the word went out that we  are here to do more engagement and work and bring more parity and more  focus on the Caribbean.   As chair of the Appropriations' State, Foreign Operations, and  Related Programs Subcommittee, I have been  [[Page H5728]]  working with the CBC and the Caribbean Caucus, led by, of course,  Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, to increase our dialogue and investment in  the people and countries of the Caribbean.   As the House takes up the FY23 SFOPS bill, I say to Congresswoman  Jackson Lee that we are working to include further measures to deepen  the United States-Caribbean relationship.   Many influential Caribbean Americans are playing key roles in shaping  the history and future of the United States. Of course, they include  the late beloved Colin Powell, the first African-American Secretary of  State; Eric Holder, our first African-American Attorney General; Karine  Jean-Pierre, the first African-American White House press secretary;  Patrick Gaspard, labor union organizer and social justice advocate; Dr.  Garth Graham, public health leader and healthcare expert; Sherrilyn  Ifill, social justice advocate; the great Patrick Ewing, star of the  NBA's New York Knicks; Harry Belafonte, musician, actor, and activist,  and a very good friend to myself and this caucus; Roberto Clemente, the  first Latino introduced into the Baseball Hall of Fame; and let us not  forget Vice President Kamala Harris, the first African-American Vice  President and the highest ranking Caribbean American even in the United  States Government.   Finally, I cannot neglect to mention my friend and mentor,  Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, as Joyce Beatty, our chair, mentioned,  who was the first African-American woman elected to Congress and also  to run for President, and the first African American to run for  President.   Born in Brooklyn, of Guyanese and Bajan descent, she spent part of  her childhood in Barbados and always considered herself a Bajan  American. I had the privilege to go see her schoolhouse very recently  in Barbados, and it was quite moving to see where she was raised by her  grandmother to be the great woman she became.   With her brilliance and tenacity, she broke through multiple barriers  for Black Americans and for women, and I am here today, in part,  because of her example. I am proud to celebrate her legacy on this 50th  anniversary of her groundbreaking campaign for the President of the  United States.   Again this year, I have introduced a resolution, H. Res. 1161,  honoring these great Americans and the history Caribbean Americans have  contributed to our country. I am honored that several of my colleagues  here have joined as cosponsors in celebrating this rich history.   Let us use this month of June to pay appropriate tribute to the  breadth and depth of Caribbean-American contributions to the United  States. But let us also recommit ourselves to a closer and stronger  engagement with countries in the Caribbean. They are our allies. They  are our friends, and they deserve more support and more engagement  through trade, investment, development assistance, you name it. There  is a lot to do to catch up in the Caribbean.   I thank our Vice President and President Biden, and I thank the  Congressional Black Caucus, our Speaker, and many Members here who have  been so supportive over the years in increasing this engagement. We see  a lot of progress, but we have a long way to go.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for her  leadership on so many fronts and for helping us educate the public  about the unfinished business of America.
