 Mr. President, I come to the floor again today to update  people on what is happening in Ukraine as Russia continues its illegal,  unprovoked, and brutal assault on that country and talk more about what  we can do here in the Congress and as Americans to help the people of  Ukraine during this desperate hour. This will be the 16th consecutive  week I have come to the floor to discuss the invasion while the Senate  has been in session.   We are now on the 118th day of this war on Ukraine. In response, the  bravery and effectiveness of the Ukrainian defenders has been  unbelievable, truly impressive, but not surprising because they are  fighting to defend their homeland, their families, and their freedom.   They have shown again and again the power that comes with that. Just  4 days ago was another example of Ukrainian tenacity and success  against a much bigger and better armed Russian army. Last Friday,  Ukrainian military officials announced that they struck and sunk a  Russian vessel in the Black Sea using two Harpoon anti-ship missiles  supplied by the West. The ship was carrying personnel and anti-aircraft  equipment to Snake Island, which the Russians invaded early on and used  as an outpost to assist in their blockade of Ukraine.   This action marks the first time that Ukraine has destroyed a Russian  vessel with a new, Western-supplied armament. It is an example of what  we can do, the United States and other allied countries, 42 of us who  are helping Ukraine, giving them the tools they need to defend their  homeland.   By the way, the Ukrainians have now sunk so many Russian ships that  the head of the Odessa Oblast military administration remarked that  Ukraine is creating ``an underwater brigade at the bottom of the Black  Sea.''   Despite these successes in the Black Sea, Russia has taken the upper  hand in the critical area east of Ukraine called the Donbas. The Donbas  region is this area of Ukraine in eastern Ukraine where Russia has  really focused its forces. Previously, you recall they took Crimea in  2014, and they took a part of the Donbas--Donbas and Donetsk areas. Now  they are trying to take the entire Donetsk region and more.   Although the Ukrainians are fighting valiantly in this area of the  Donbas, they are simply being outgunned by the Russians, who have  longer range and very accurate Russian missiles. The stakes are really  high right now. The fate of a sovereign country to remain free hangs in  the balance. But not only that, if Vladimir Putin is successful here in  the Donbas in taking more than he already controls, I think it would be  naive to believe he will stop there. Based on his own words, he won't  stop there. The Baltics could be next. He already has a puppet  dictatorship here in Belarus. These countries--Baltics, Poland,  Romania, where I was recently, Moldova--they are all concerned and  rightly so. We cannot allow him to achieve these goals.   Last Wednesday, the Senate Ukraine Caucus, which I cofounded along  with Senator Dick Durbin, hosted six members of the Ukrainian  Parliament, or Rada, leaders in the Parliament who came to talk to us,  along with Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Oksana Markarova.  They offered a very blunt view of the current war, which we have now  heard many times over these past several weeks.   Ukrainian soldiers are fighting very hard to defend their homeland,  but Russia is incrementally advancing, killing 100 to 500 Ukrainian  soldiers every day, as well as dozens of civilians, and destroying  cities in the Donbas area with a steady barrage of missiles. Russia is  sitting back and firing these guided missiles with impunity because the  shorter range Ukrainian missiles can't reach them.   The delegation of Ukrainian Parliament leaders included David  Arakhamia, one of Ukraine's lead negotiators with the Russians. He told  us the Russians are essentially delaying negotiations until Russia has  secured control over this whole area of the Donbas, and then they will  pretend to engage in negotiations while taking that time to recover  their combat power and prepare for yet another offensive.   Russia must not be allowed to continue to gain ground in the Donbas.  We have to get the Ukrainians what they need to protect themselves, the  weapons and equipment they need to be able to succeed so they can have  negotiations with the Russians but on their terms, not the Russians'.   There is a solution to the Ukrainians being outgunned. Over the past  several years, Ukrainian officials have specifically requested the  advanced weapons rocket artillery systems. The United States operates  one such system. It is called the HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery  Rocket System. We have hundreds of these in our inventory, many of  which are not with Active units. They are superior to Russian artillery  in almost every respect--mobility, reload time, accuracy, and most  importantly, range. Yet, during Ukraine's hour of need, it has taken us  too long to respond, and we are providing too few units to make a  serious impact.   Three weeks ago, the administration did announce they would send  HIMARS to Ukraine but just four units.   With the time it takes to train Ukrainian soldiers on how to operate  this platform, the systems will not be combat ready until at least this  week, according to press reports. So we announced it a few weeks ago,  but every day brave Ukrainians have been dying and Donbas cities have  been systematically destroyed and the countryside has been conquered  step-by-step.   We must act more quickly, and we must do more. The Wall Street  Journal editorial board recently expounded on this argument in very  stark terms when they said:         How many rocket systems do our friends need? [Well] a . . .       military adviser [from Ukraine] told [a reporter recently]:       ``If we get 60'' systems ``then the Russians will lose all       ability to advance anywhere, they will be stopped dead in       their tracks. If we get 40 they will [be able to] advance,       albeit very slowly with heavy casualties; with 20 they will       continue to advance with higher casualties than now.''    We are providing four.   When I met with the Rada, they told me that they would need at least  48 advanced rocket artillery systems to have a meaningful impact. So,  again, so far we have only provided four. My hope is, based on  conversations I have had with the administration, that more are coming.  But any new units announced won't reach the battlefield  [[Page S3026]]  with trained crews for roughly 3 weeks. Defense officials know that we  need to move more quickly, and I hope we will.   I am pleased to report that the Brits, the UK, and also the Germans  have offered their own rocket systems similar to ours--in fact, the  British system is bigger than ours--but only three apiece.   To address this, today I sent a letter with my colleagues Senators  Durbin, Blumenthal, and Grassley to Secretary of Defense Austin urging  the administration to rapidly send significant amounts of these  advanced rocket artillery systems to Ukraine, working with our allies.   In our inventory, we have hundreds of these HIMARS, and getting these  systems to Ukraine could be a game changer. We need to send them more  quickly so they have a fighting chance in this war.   With these systems in their arsenal, I believe the Ukrainians could  turn the tables on the Russians, just like they have done in so many  other places. Remember, in Kyiv, the success there. In Kharkiv, they  are having some success pushing back the Russians there.   Even here in the eastern part toward Kherson, they are having some  success, but they need help here with regard to these artillery  systems. It is an artillery battle.   The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board went on to say:         The stakes are high, [but not just] for Ukraine. If the       Russian military mops up the Donbas, Vladimir Putin will have       grabbed more land that he can sell at home as a victory. He       can then regroup and push south[east] toward Odessa--    Down here--       robbing the Ukrainians of their coast line and building a       bridge to Transnistria in Moldova.         Up here.        Europe will be less secure, and Mr. Biden will bear some       responsibility.    The editorial continued with the threat to other nations, saying:         Skeptics of U.S. aid to Ukraine like to say we can't       support the country forever. But that's all the more reason       to get Kyiv the right weapons sooner and in enough numbers so       Ukraine can stop and then roll back Russian advances. That's       the only way to get Mr. Putin to the negotiating table with       any hope of a cease-fire on Ukrainian terms favorable to       NATO.    I think they are right. We just provided $40 billion for Ukraine-- very generous from the U.S. taxpayers. Roughly, $21 billion of that  goes toward military.   I am not suggesting we spend more than that. I am suggesting that we  use the $21 billion in a more effective way to give them what they  actually need to be able to push back against the Russians, given this  current threat.   Russia won't stop at the Donbas. They will conquer the rest of  Ukraine's Black Sea coastline, as was said in this editorial. This, by  the way, would landlock Ukraine, one of the great exporters of the  world. It is an attempt to ruin the country economically.   One thing that has become crystal clear over the past decade, Russia  only responds to strength. When President Putin has sensed weakness,  that is exactly when his aggression has increased. He invaded Ukraine 4  months ago because he believed that Ukraine and the West would not  respond forcefully. He believed he could divide NATO.   Both of these assumptions proved to be wrong, and Russia was  initially pushed back. But note that they just kept coming, now  believing that freedom-loving democracies around the world will become  war weary; that our attention span is too short.   He believes he can outlast us. I am concerned that some are losing  interest. Look at the news coverage. Ukraine often is no longer in the  headlines, not in the nightly news, even though the destruction  continues; the bombing of civilian targets continues; the war crimes  continue.   I am concerned that some are forgetting the global stakes involved in  this war and how important it is to ensure that Ukraine wins and Russia  loses. If Russia senses that the West is weak and distracted and losing  interest in Ukraine, it will continue this war and bring it ever closer  to our NATO allies.   That is exactly why we need to provide Ukrainians what they need to  fight back right now, especially these HIMAR systems. We must  accelerate our deliveries if we are serious about supporting Ukraine.   Fortunately, other nations continue to offer support. During last  week's meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Belgium,  Secretary of Defense Austin urged nations ``not to lose steam'' in  their efforts to aid Ukraine during Russia's invasion. Good for him.    He reported that Germany will offer three long-range artillery rocket  systems with ammunition to follow the UK's example, and Slovakia is  promising helicopters and ammunition. Poland, Canada, and the  Netherlands have promised more artillery. Forty-two nations have  stepped forward, in all, to provide military assistance to Ukraine, not  just us.   Several of these leaders also committed to Ukrainian officials that  the West would not demand any territorial concessions from Ukraine to  appease Russia and will support Ukraine to the end of this war.   That is very welcome news. Making any territorial concessions to  Russia would only embolden Putin and other future would-be conquerors.  The lesson they would learn is that with enough patience, we can wear  down the West and get what we want.   We saw how the territorial concessions worked in the late 1930s. It  only increased Nazi Germany's appetite. Nazi Germany was not led to  think that if they took over one country, that they couldn't take over  the next.   The United States needs to join our allies and continue to reaffirm  our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity. While we  continue our mission, Americans of all stripes have gone to Ukraine to  help, some as volunteers. Some have gone actually to help fight  alongside Ukraine forces to defend that democratic country.   According to reports, two Americans have been taken prisoner by  Russian-backed forces, and a third American is missing. We need to get  our people out.   Just yesterday, the Kremlin's chief spokesman told NBC that the two  Americans are not protected by the Geneva Convention. He stated they  should ``be held responsible for the crimes they have committed.''   By the way, the only ``crime'' they have committed was fighting back  against the Russians and helping Ukraine, an ally and a democracy,  defend its sovereign territory.   The Russians seem to be so accustomed to killing unarmed Ukrainian  civilians that they are shocked when anyone on the other side actually  dares to shoot back.   Let me be clear: These Americans are prisoners of war subject to the  protections of the Geneva Convention, and any unlawful prosecution  would be an unacceptable acceleration, an escalation by Russia. I  expect the administration to develop a plan to address these men's  situation and get them out of Kremlin captivity. That is on the  military side.   On sanctions, when it comes to funding for Russia's war machine, last  week the Treasury Department announced it will allow certain energy- related transactions with SberBank, VTB Bank, Alfa Bank, and several  other Russian entities to continue until December 5.   The United States has already banned imports of Russian oil and gas  and imposed sanctions, but now the administration seems to want to  extend bank transactions on Russian oil and gas sent to European  countries. That doesn't make sense to me. There have been bipartisan  calls here in this Congress to put a halt to sending President Putin  the money to fund his war machine. Remember, the EU is using Russian  oil and gas, dependent on it in many cases, and sending roughly $870  million a day to Russia to fund that war machine. So why would we want  to extend these licenses to early December?   I asked the Department of Treasury about this and was told that it  was to align with the EU sanctions. I fear we are letting EU lead while  we follow with softer sanctions than we must have in order to get  Russia to feel as though there is some impact here; that what they are  doing in Ukraine is hurting their economy.   America needs to lead from the front on sanctions, not lead from  behind. When we do lead, by the way, others follow. This is true with  the revived NATO right now. It is 30 countries strong, and members are  more committed than ever to pushing back against this Russian invasion.  [[Page S3027]]    In fact, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sweden and  Finland have shrugged off a long history of neutrality to apply to join  NATO. I applaud them for this and look forward to voting in favor of  their accession treaties on the U.S. Senate floor here very soon.   Tomorrow, in fact, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is going to  hold a hearing on their interest in joining the alliance. I urge my  Senate colleagues to support this, and instead of causing global  division, as he meant to do, show President Putin that he has brought  NATO together and added to the strength of NATO.   I urge swift consideration of NATO expansion. Let's bring the Swedes  and the Finns into the fold. We can't forget that Russia has claimed  this war started because Ukraine wanted to join the NATO alliance. It  is certainly true that as they reaffirmed in 2014, when they threw off  a Russian-backed corrupt government, the people of Ukraine have been  looking westward, not eastward.   Of course, they want to join NATO and they want to join the European  Union and they want to form ever closer bonds with the transatlantic  community--and they have made significant progress in doing this. This  brutal invasion is just Russia's latest attempt to throw that progress  off course, to stop them from what is their inevitable move to the  West. We must not be deterred.    As I have said before, Ukraine deserves NATO membership and  immediately the NATO membership action plan to provide a clear path to  eventual membership. At the NATO summit in Madrid last week, much of  the attention will rightfully be focused on Sweden and Finland, but I  urge the leaders gathered there to remember Ukraine and Georgia in a  similar situation as well.   Just last Friday, there was some big news. The European Commission  recommended that Ukraine be granted candidate status to join the  European Union. That is not NATO, but it is the European Union, the  political union.   The recommendation by the European Commission, the EU's executive  body, is a significant step forward toward EU membership. The  Commission also recommended EU candidate status for Moldova, a country  with its own troubled history with Russia.   Here we see Moldova between Romania and Ukraine. Transnistria is  right along here, which is controlled by the Russians, a small part of  Moldova. I visited Moldova last month and met with their government,  including their Prime Minister.   We have a very strong partner in Moldova. They, too, are looking to  the West. The people of Moldova want their freedom and freedom from  Russian intimidation. When the leaders of the EU meet next month in  Brussels, I hope they will strongly support both Ukraine's and  Moldova's candidacies toward the European Union.   Soon, the Senate is going to adjourn for a couple of weeks. During  that time, Ukraine will be continuing to defend its territorial  integrity. I have now come to the floor, as I said, every week to  highlight this fight--every week since this illegal, unprovoked, and  brutal invasion began.   The Ukrainian people just want to live in peace, including with their  neighbor, Russia. This is our fight during our generation where  democracy is on the line. How this war develops will have far-reaching  impacts on all of us, all freedom-loving countries, including the  United States of America.   Most of us in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats alike, get  that. We know that America can't afford to stay on the sidelines and be  a spectator in this conflict. At this crucial time in the battle for  freedom, democracy, and the ability for countries to decide their own  future, America cannot afford to be tentative. That is why we need to  supply them with these mobile rocket launchers, the HIMAR system, to  have the range and the ability to protect themselves.   Let's not be tentative. We must remember the lesson of the late  1930s: that appeasing tyrants will not satiate their desire to  violently conquer and subjugate their neighbors. Ukrainians certainly  understand this. They know what it is like to live under the thumb of  authoritarians, the Soviets, the Russians, and they broke away from  that and toward democracy, first in 1991 and again in 2014.   I was in Ukraine after the Revolution of Dignity, which is what they  call it, in 2014, where Ukrainians decided for themselves that they  wanted to turn away from Russian domination and corruption and turn to  us--Europe and the United States--to pursue a more hopeful future of  freedom and democracy.   Now President Putin is trying to extinguish that hope. We cannot let  that happen. The countries of the free world are with us but more so  when we lead. Now is not the time to equivocate.   At this critical juncture, let's work with allies to provide our  democratic brothers and sisters in Ukraine what they actually need to  protect their homeland and to defend democracy.   I yield the floor.
