 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Protecting the  Right to Organize Act, which is a pro-middle-class measure that, if  enacted, would increase incomes, improve benefits, and promote better  working conditions for tens of millions of Americans.   The bill essentially debugs all the outdated gaps and loopholes that  a cottage industry of unscrupulous lawyers and consultants have  exploited over the last 50 years to delay and deny Americans their  right to organize for a better standard of living.   The data is crystal clear. The decline of unions since the 1970s has  coincided with wage stagnation for the middle class and the  skyrocketing wealth of Americans in the top one-tenth of 1 percent, re- creating our new gilded age of outrageous income inequality.   The rights this bill will secure have been internationally recognized  as basic human rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by  the United Nations Charter in the wake of World War II and the Vatican  in Pope Leo XII's encyclical Rerum Novarum in 1891. The right to  organize ``is the natural right,'' Leo wrote, ``and the state has for  its office to protect natural rights, not to destroy them.''   Passage of this bill will protect those rights. Please vote ``yes''  for the PRO Act.   Mr. Chairman, I insert in the Record a letter from 2 million members  of the Service Employees International Union, signed by its president,  Mary Kay Henry, in support of this legislation.                                                            SEIU,                                                        May 8, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of       the Service Employees International Union (``SEIU''), we       write to endorse the Protecting the Right to Organize       (``PRO'') Act of 2019. This important bill would strengthen       working Americans' rights to join together in unions and       bargain for higher wages and better working conditions to       help create balanced, inclusive growth.        In today's economy, too many people are working longer       hours for lower wages, even as corporate profits soar. Unions       are the best solution to leveling the playing field. But       because of a concerted effort to undermine unions in America       over the past forty years, just 6% of private sector working       people have a say in the decisions that affect them at work,       in their communities and in our economy. Too many       unscrupulous employers take advantage of America's outdated       labor laws to stifle the ability of working people to join       together in unions to improve their jobs and build a better       future for their families.        The PRO Act would reinvigorate labor law to help build an       economy that works better for the millions of people who work       for a living--not just those at the top. We applaud the       bill's joint employer provision, which would ensure that       workers can meaningfully bargain with all companies that       actually control their employment. We also endorse the bill's       new standard to stop employers from misclassifying their       workers as independent contractors or supervisors to escape       their responsibilities. These changes would make it harder       for companies to circumvent basic worker protections through       subcontracting arrangements or other evasions.        We also strongly support the PRO Act's reforms banning       anti-worker state laws that supersede collective bargaining       agreements. These so-called Right-to Work laws weaken       workers' voice at the workplace, drive down wages, and       threaten the economic security of all workers--union and       nonunion alike. Working people subject to these laws earn       $1,558 less per year than those who are not. The PRO Act       permits companies and workers to decide for themselves       whether to negotiate fair share agreements in collective       bargaining.        In addition, we are pleased to see PRO Act provisions that       would deter employer misconduct by making remedies       meaningful, penalizing the most egregious violations,       limiting interference in union elections, and facilitating       first contracts with newly formed unions. The bill rightfully       removes restraints on workers' solidarity actions across       different workplaces.        Working people around the country urgently need new laws       like the PRO Act to  [[Page H883]]       make it easier for people to join unions and hold companies       accountable. The PRO Act's much-needed reforms will help       level the playing field for people like Jim Staus who       testified in support of the PRO Act before House Education       and Labor Committee, Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions       Subcommittee on May 8, 2019. Although the federal government       twice found that University of Pittsburgh Medical Center       (UPMC) illegally fired Jim for trying to form a union, six       years later he still has not returned to work at UPMC, nor       has he seen a penny of back-pay. If the PRO Act were law, Jim       and so many other working people around the country would not       have to risk everything to organize their unions to have a       seat at the table in determining their families and       community's future, the same way their bosses and       corporations do.        SEIU members are proud to support the PRO Act. We will add       any future votes on this legislation to our legislative       scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,                                           International President.                                time  1600
