 Mr. Speaker, the past year has seen an explosion in gun  sales and, with it, a 30 percent rise in the murder rate.   Yet, at a time when the data becomes increasingly clear that more  guns in the hands of those who should not have them results in more  deaths of those who should still be alive and with us today, Republican  officials across the country are trying to make it easier for anyone to  wield guns around our children and our families.   Back in my home State of Georgia, our Governor is trying to implement  permitless carry, irresponsible legislation that is dangerous for our  law enforcement, dangerous for our families, and dangerous for the  people that we love and cherish.   We cannot allow these destructive efforts to continue, and we must  reaffirm our dedication to passing meaningful legislation that truly  saves American lives.                            ____________________
