 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I include in  the Record, first a letter from the Commissioner of Revenue Services in  the State of Connecticut, who has detailed out the impact of this tax  on Connecticut residents.                                                   November 8, 2017.      Hon. John B. Larson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Larson: Thank you for opportunity to       comment on the federal tax changes being considered in H.R.       1. We appreciate your leadership in trying to set the record       straight as this partisan effort is rushed to judgment with       no real input and much fiscal uncertainty.        Unfortunately, what we see so far from a national and state       perspective is very troubling. Some of the proposals to       reduce taxes on corporate and pass-through business income       could provide needed economic stimulus nationally and for       states like Connecticut. Unfortunately, on balance, H.R. 1 is       fundamentally flawed:        Even the low estimate of a $1.5 trillion cost is not paid       for and is really massive federal tax deficit spending. The       nation has been down this road before and surely we should       have learned something from the worst economic recession in       modern times.        Otherwise unaffordable tax cuts have long been part of a       political strategy to ``starve the beast.'' Due to its long       term unfunded cost, this Republican tax plan will compel big       cuts in federal funding, such as Medicaid, that are important       to states like Connecticut.        Contrary to all the talk of a ``middle income tax cut,''       the plan actually represents a huge windfall to the very       wealthiest federal taxpayers and is truly regressive. For our       own state of Connecticut, over 75% of the tax cut goes to the       top 1% who would pay 8.5% less on average. Everyone else       would see a trivial 1.2% reduction in federal tax liability       and many will actually owe much more in federal income taxes.        As discussed more specifically below, the proposed plan       shifts most of the tax cost and the least of any tax benefit       to states in the Northeast, Great Lakes and West Coast       regions of the country. Thus, Connecticut and similar states       will even more disproportionately pay in federal taxes far       more than is received in federal benefits--further       subsidizing regions of the country where states make far less       of a state and local tax effort.        Drilling down a bit further, several aspects of this       partisan plan will hit especially hard:        Eliminating deductibility of state income tax paid is worth       an estimated $8.7 billion to mostly middle income Connecticut       taxpayers.        Capping deductibility of local property tax paid at $10,000       will increase federal income taxes for a significant       proportion of Connecticut taxpayers who claim $4.9 billion.        Any benefit to lower and lower moderate income taxpayers       from higher standard deductions and child care credits will       likely be more than offset by the shell game of imposing a       higher lowest rate bracket of 12% and replacing the current       $4,050 personal exemption with a $300 deduction that is       proposed to end in 5 years.        Eliminating deductibility of medical/dental expenses will       be $1.6 billion hardship for Connecticut taxpayers at all       levels who are out of work and have catastrophic medical       costs.        Eliminating deductibility of student loan interest only       adds a further financial burden for primarily younger       taxpayers and their families already struggling with       educational indebtedness.        Sadly, these and many other significant issues of fiscal       irresponsibility and tax unfairness seem to be of no concern       in the partisan rush to pass legislation before taxpayers see       through the slogans and realize the costs. Indeed, glimpses       of what may be in the Republican Senate version suggests that       it will only get worse. Thank you for your efforts to speak       out for our Connecticut taxpayers and set the record       straight.            Sincerely,                                                 Kevin B. Sullivan,                                                      Commissioner.     Second, Mr. Speaker, I include in the  Record a letter out of a cross section of constituents who are directly  and adversely impacted by this tax increase.                             MIDDLE CLASS CUTS               Ms. Diane Hebenstreit--West Hartford, CT 06107         I am a lifetime resident of Connecticut, and I ask that you       do not vote for the proposed Federal Tax plan. From what I       see, it's providing large tax breaks that benefit the rich       and the corporations.        The estate tax benefit we have now is more than generous,       only the very wealthy will benefit from repealing the estate       tax.        The proposed caps on state and property tax deductions       combined with the increased standard deduction, will cause       myself as well as others to use the standard deduction       instead of itemizing. This will eliminate the financial       benefit of owning my home, and I am concerned it will       negatively affect its value.        The personal exemption of $4,050 is going away. This is not       something that's been highlighted in the news. So as a single       payer, I'll receive a $12,000 standard deduction, but loose       the $4,050 personal exemption resulting in more of my income       being taxed than under the current plan.        And at a higher rate! I am currently in the 10% tax       bracket. Under this new plan it will increase to 12%.        This is not a tax plan that benefits me, or I expect any       other middle income resident. Vote No.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  [[Page H9385]]  transcript of an interview with our esteemed chairman, Kevin Brady, and  Heidi Przybyla that appeared on ``Morning Joe.''           Kevin Brady-Morning Joe Transcript--Friday, November 3         Heidi Przybyla, USA Today: This economic growth that you       all are promising, it cannot happen unless the cuts occur at       the same time. In fact the Joint Committee on Taxation's       economic model assumes that the type of tax cuts that you're       doing now that are not paid for could actually be a drag on       economic growth. Can you please speak to that?        Brady: The reason we moved back towards a balanced budget       is one, there is substantial growth, miss, but again, that       won't do it. You have to simplify the code, eliminate so much       of these special breaks on the business and the individual       side as well. It's the combination of both of those that gets       you back to a balanced budget over time. That's why people       complain `Look you're really simplifying the code       dramatically, there's a lot of things that go'. Not everyone       is happy about that but that is what, sort of the tough       choices you have to make, along with growth, to make sure       this moves us toward a balanced budget.        Przybyla: But that is not what's happening here. This is       still, regardless of these loopholes that you're closing,       it's still a big blowhole in the deficit and that is not what       the model was in '86 for instance when Reagan did it. This       model that I'm speaking of still assumes that this could be a       drag on economic growth because you're not doing the type of       spending cuts, not just simplification in the code, but       spending cuts.        Brady: Here, one, there are a number of models on growth       and I'm sure there will be a healthy debate, that's a good       thing. What we know is this dramatically grows the economy in       revenues not just here in Washington, but state and local       levels as well. But you make a great point: tax reform alone,       alone won't get us to a balanced budget, we have to have       spending constraints along with that. As I know, as House       Republicans, we are turning toward welfare reform and how we       tackle our entitlements in a way to save them. That's all       part of the steps it takes to get us back to a fiscally       responsible area. But I do know this, is you want to see       continued deficits and debts, just stay with a slow growth       economy like we saw the last ten years. We know what that       produced.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record  a letter from AARP, who is in opposition to this bill.                                                            AARP,                                                  November 15, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our members and all       Americans age 50 and older, AARP is writing to express our       views on H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. AARP, with its       nearly 38 million members in all 50 States and the District       of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, represents       individuals affected by H.R. 1 in myriad ways. As we did with       the last major effort at tax reform a generation ago, AARP is       prepared to support tax legislation that makes the tax code       more equitable and efficient, promotes growth, and produces       sufficient revenue to pay for critical national programs,       including Medicare and Medicaid. However, H.R. 1 in its       current form does not meet these criteria.        Efforts to restructure all or part of the federal tax       system should in particular recognize the importance of--and       therefore maintain--incentives for health and retirement       security. Such incentives are not only important to assist       individuals in attaining the security they deserve, but are       vital to our nation's future economic well-being AARP is       dedicated to enhancing retirement security, including       retention of the extra standard deduction for those ages 65       or older; improving access to, and targeted incentives for,       work-place retirement saving plans, and protection of earned       pensions for vulnerable retirees and their families. We       greatly appreciate that H.R. 1 rejects proposals to make       significant changes to the tax treatment of retirement       contributions, which would have affected the ability or       commitment of many tax filers to save for their retirement.       AARP also remains committed to advocating for affordable,       meaningful health care, including retention of the medical       expense itemized deduction at 7.5%, preservation of tax       exempt status of employer sponsored insurance coverage;       maintenance of tax subsidies for lower- and moderate-income       Americans to purchase health insurance coverage in health       care marketplaces; and the creation of a new, non-refundable       tax credit for working family caregivers.        As tax legislation advances, changes to the tax code should       not result in a disproportionate, adverse impact on older       Americans According to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT),       H.R. 1 will reduce taxes for millions of taxpayers beginning       in 2019. We are concerned, however, that in 2027, also       according to JCT, the 73 million taxpayers with incomes       between $10,000 and $50,000 would collectively pay $2.9       billion more in individual income taxes AARP has estimated       that H.R. 1 will increase taxes on 1.2 million taxpayers age       65 and older in 2018, and by 2027, 4.9 million older       taxpayers will experience higher taxes In addition, H.R. 1       will provide no tax relief for 5.1 million older taxpayers in       2018 and 5.3 million taxpayers by 2027.        The impact on older tax filers is the cumulative result of       many policy changes made in H.R. 1, but a number of specific       provisions disproportionately affect older Americans. Nearly       three-quarters of tax filers who claim the medical expense       deduction are age 50 or older and live with a chronic       condition or illness. Seventy percent of filers who claim       this deduction have income below $75,000. H.R. 1 also       eliminates the additional standard deduction for filers who       are 65 and older, while at the same time increasing the       lowest tax rate. These provisions, along with other proposals       that more broadly affect the tax liability of millions of       filers, such as the expiration of the new Family Flexibility       Credit in 2023, and the partial repeal of the state and local       tax deduction, result in little tax benefit to many older tax       filers, and for others, a tax increase.        Also troubling is the negative effect H.R. 1 will have on       the nation's ability to fund critical priorities. H.R. 1 will       increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next ten       years, and an unknown amount beyond 2027. The large increase       in the deficit will inevitably lead to calls for greater       spending cuts, which are likely to include dramatic cuts to       Medicare, Medicaid and other critical programs serving older       Americans. The Congressional Budget Office has now published       a letter stating that unless Congress takes action, H.R. 1       will result in automatic federal funding cuts of $136 billion       in fiscal year 2018, $25 billion of which must come from       Medicare.        We urge Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to enact       tax legislation that better meets the needs of older       Americans and the nation, and we stand ready to work with you       toward that end.            Sincerely,                                               Nancy A. LeaMond,                                        Executive Vice President and                             Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer.     Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I include in the  Record a letter from the Congressional Budget Office, which details out  the other shoe to fall in this legislation.                                        Congressional Budget Office,                                                   U.S. Congress,                                  Washington, DC, November 13, 2017.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Democratic Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman: This letter responds to your request for       information about the effects of legislation that would raise       deficits by an estimated $1.5 trillion over the 2018-2027       period, specifically with respect to a sequestration--or       cancellation of budgetary resources--in accordance with the       Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO; Public Law 111-      139).        The PAYGO law requires that new legislation enacted during       a term of Congress does not collectively increase estimated       deficits. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is       required to maintain two so-called PAYGO scorecards to report       the cumulative changes generated by new legislation in       estimated revenues and outlays over the next five years and       ten years. If either scorecard indicates a net increase in       the deficit, OMB is required to order a sequestration to       eliminate the overage. The authority to determine whether a       sequestration is required (and if so, exactly how to make the       necessary cuts in budget authority) rests solely with OMB.        CBO has analyzed the implications of enacting a bill that       would increase deficits by $1.5 trillion over a 10-year       window, without enacting any further legislation to offset       that increase. In accordance with the PAYGO law, OMB would       record the average annual deficit on its PAYGO scorecard,       showing deficit increases of, in the example provided, $150       billion per year. If the bill were enacted before the end of       the calendar year, that amount would be added to the current       balances on the PAYGO scorecard, which for 2018, show a       positive balance of $14 billion. (For years after 2018, the       balances range from a $14 billion credit to a $1 billion       debit.)        Without enacting subsequent legislation to either offset       that deficit increase, waive the recordation of the bill's       impact on the scorecard, or otherwise mitigate or eliminate       the requirements of the PAYGO law, OMB would be required to       issue a sequestration order within 15 days of the end of the       session of Congress to reduce spending in fiscal year 2018 by       the resultant total of $136 billion. However, the PAYGO law       limits reductions to Medicare to four percentage points (or       roughly $25 billion for that year), leaving about $111       billion to be sequestered from the remaining mandatory       accounts. Because the law entirely exempts many large       accounts including low-income programs and social security,       the annual resources available from which OMB must draw is,       in CBO's estimation, only between $85 billion to $90 billion,       significantly less than the amount that would be required to       be sequestered. (For a full list of accounts subject to       automatic reductions, see OMB Report to the Congress on the       Joint Committee Reductions for Fiscal Year 2018, https:// go.usa.gov/xnZ3U.)        Given that the required reduction in spending exceeds the       estimated amount of available resources in each year over the       next 10 years, in the absence of further legislation, OMB       would be unable to implement the full extent of outlay       reductions required by the PAYGO law.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.     Mr. Speaker, let me begin by preempting  [[Page H9386]]  our distinguished chairman and, for the Record, state that a middle  class family in the State of Connecticut, from West Hartford, with a  combined income of $125,000, with a mortgage and a kid in college,  according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and to the Department of  Revenue Services in the State of Connecticut, will see a tax increase  of $767 next year.   Then with the clever clawback provision--that Grover Norquist kind of  clawback provision that gives with one hand and takes away with the  other--in 2023, that hardworking family in the middle class will see a  $1,667 increase.   So why are we here?   It is pretty easy to figure out this. These are honorable people, but  sometimes they are called upon to do a political task, or as Mr.  Collins put it: My donors are basically saying, ``Get it done or don't  ever call me again.''   Speaking of New York, my colleagues in New York and New Jersey,  because we are donor States and because we make itemized deductions, we  find ourselves in the situation where we are paying double taxation.   Don't take our word for it. Just ask a member of your own caucus. Ask  Peter King, who describes this as the most massive redistribution of  wealth at the expense of teachers, machinists, and people who are of  the professional class whom you have found that you want to tax their  success.   But what adds insult to injury above all else, aside from being a  donor State and double taxation, is the cruelest cut. We take a Pledge  of Allegiance. We pledge allegiance to the Constitution. But some of  you pledge allegiance to Grover Norquist. In doing so, you want to make  sure that you can shrink Social Security and Medicare up so small you  can drown it in the bathtub.   That is what this does: $25 billion will come out of that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley), the chairman of the Democratic  Caucus and a great leader on the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  New York an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the son of a preacher man,  who always speaks truth to power.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the lead Democrat on the Foreign  Affairs Committee who understands the impact of double taxation from a  donor State.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the voice of Houston.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)
