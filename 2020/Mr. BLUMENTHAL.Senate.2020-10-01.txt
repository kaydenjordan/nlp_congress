 Madam President, we are here today on probably one of  the most serious national security issues that we will confront. I say  that as a member of the Armed Services Committee, having received a  variety of classified briefings on threats to this country. Some of  them regarding ongoing foreign interference in our election are truly  chilling. But the threat to our national security from White  supremacists, now operating so openly that the Director of the FBI has  said they are one of the paramount threats and an ongoing security  threat to our Nation, demands that there should be action now.   The bill that my colleague Senator Durbin is offering passed  unanimously by the House of Representatives within recent days. Let me  repeat. It passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. It  reflects the real and urgent danger of this threat.   The President has refused to denounce White supremacists. The  President has told one of the most prominent of those groups to stand  by. That failure--an abject failure on the part of the Commander in  Chief--to respond to an ongoing security threat demands this action  now. We must stand up for the integrity of our elections, the security  of our Nation, and the fundamental freedoms that we prize as American  people.  [[Page S6012]]    We will not allow this cancer to metastasize in this country and  thwart the will of Americans who are going to the polls, in effect,  right now. The ballots are being cast. The threat to our electoral will  is ongoing.   I am proud to join my colleagues who are here on the floor who  represent an ideological spectrum, as did the House of Representatives  in unanimously approving this bill. The paramount threat to our Nation  and the integrity of our elections is White supremacy, violent  extremism, and nationalism that potentially jeopardize the very pillars  of our democracy.   I yield the floor.
