 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and legacy of an  American treasure, Bobby Kennedy.   Robert Kennedy lived his life with courage and conviction, never  afraid to challenge a divided nation to face its moral failings. Bobby  challenged us all to take a step back from the stale, cheap politics of  the moment and to do better by each other. His service to this Nation  will never be forgotten.   Today, 50 years after he was brutally assassinated, we pause to  acknowledge the brilliance and beauty that rested in his vision of  America--a vision that led him to seek the highest office in this land,  a vision of love, wisdom, compassion, and justice. Bobby believed we  all have a shared responsibility to leave this world just a little bit  better off than when we came.   ``Few will have the greatness to bend history itself,'' he once  said, ``but each of us can work to change a small portion of events,  and in the total; of all those acts will be written the history of this  generation.''    History may not repeat, but it often rhymes. Conditions are different  now, but a lot of the anxiety and tension that swept through this  country in 1968, at the height of Bobby's political career, echoes the  anxiety of today, especially the economic anxiety felt by millions of  Americans who are working harder than ever but feel opportunity  slipping away from themselves and their children.   Too often our political and business leaders refuse to see this.  Instead, they hide behind macroeconomic statistics, using them as a  shield to dismiss the concerns of the American people as faulty,  wrongheaded, or even nonexistent. Robert Kennedy understood that  America's national economy is not the same as the economic well-being  of its people. In a 1968 speech at the University of Kansas, he spoke  eloquently about the differences between them, and here is what he  said:         [Our] Gross National Product counts air pollution and       cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways       of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the       jails for the people who break them. It counts the       destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder       in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear       warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots       in our cities. It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife,       and the television programs which glorify violence in order       to sell toys to our children.        Yet the gross national product does not allow for the       health of our children, the quality of their education or the       joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our       poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of       our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.       It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our       wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our       devotion to our country.        It measures everything, in short, except that which makes       life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America       except why we are proud that we are Americans.    Consider three statistics: corporate profits, the stock market, and  unemployment. Today, corporate profits are up--corporate profits that  count gun sales from manufacturers whose weapons are used to massacre  children in our schools and our streets, corporate profits that count  revenues from drug companies when they quadruple prices for the sick  and the desperate, corporate profits that count revenues of banks like  Wells Fargo as they rip off millions of American consumers.   The stock market is up as giant companies pocket trillions in  taxpayer money stolen from middle-class families. The market is up as  CEOs shut down plants and factories in the United States and move them  overseas. The market is up as business leaders, flush with cash, turn  their backs on workers while they plow millions and even billions into  stock buybacks to goose investors' returns and CEOs' bonuses.   Unemployment is down, but wages have barely budged in a generation.  Unemployment is down, but for millions of people, the exploding costs  for housing, for healthcare, for childcare mean that it now takes two  jobs to do what one job covered a generation ago. Unemployment is down,  but the numbers fail to count the millions living in rural and urban  American communities alike that have given up the search for a job.   Corporate profits, the stock market, unemployment--these statistics  tell us everything about the American economy, but they tell us very  little about the lived experiences of today's Americans. They do not  speak to the citizen who fears police violence or the police officer  who fears gang violence or the immigrant who cannot speak out about  sexual assault at the hands of her boss or the toxic rhetoric flowing  through our politics and seeking to turn neighbor against neighbor.  They do not account for our devotion to our communities, to our  churches, to our children. They tell us virtually nothing about our  trials, our challenges, our hopes, or our principles.   Robert Kennedy understood this. He knew we cannot simply run our  economy for those at the top and assume it will solve America's  problems. In the intervening years since his speech, America ran that  experiment anyway and watched it fail miserably.   It is time to try something different. It is time to challenge each  of us to do better by each other, to see the dignity in one another, to  put our values first. I believe together we can make that Robert  Kennedy's legacy, and I am proud to fight for it.   I yield the floor.
