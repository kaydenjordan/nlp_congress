 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Dr. James C. Metts, Jr., who passed away on Monday, January 20, at  the age of 88.   Dr. Metts had dedicated his life to public service, working as the  Chatham County coroner for more than 40 years. He started in 1973, when  the officials associated with Chatham County asked for his help in  finding a replacement for the retiring coroner. When nobody signed up  to run for the county coroner position, Dr. Metts volunteered himself.   His colleagues remember him as someone who would always answer his  phone, call you back, and perform his duties as coroner with class.   In one of his most famous cases, Dr. Metts was called to court to  testify about the body of Mr. Danny Hansford, which eventually became  the centerpiece for the book, ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and  Evil.''   As a doctor, he continued his public service by working hard to lower  the rate of heart attack and stroke deaths by founding the Community  Cardiovascular Council.   Dr. Metts will be deeply missed throughout our community. His family  and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers in this most difficult  time.                            ____________________
