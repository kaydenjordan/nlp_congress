 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Winston Churchill said:   We sleep safely at night because rough men stand ready to visit  violence on those who would harm us.   The men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces sign up for no small task.  They join to serve their country; not for money, not for fame, not  because it is glamorous in any way. They sign up because they  understand that Winston Churchill was right--that the blessings of a  free society are possible only if there are those willing to put the  safety and well-being of their country ahead of their own safety and  ahead of their own lives when necessary.   That solemn, sacred responsibility, the responsibility that every  member of our Armed Forces has committed so nobly to upholding,  deserves our utmost respect.   Regrettably, on August 9 of 2021, the Secretary of Defense issued a  message to the force indicating his intent to require COVID-19  vaccination for all servicemembers. This mandate went into effect on  August 24, 2021.   There were a lot of promises made at the time--promises suggesting  that individual needs would be taken into account; individual needs  including good-faith, sincerely held religious beliefs that might make  it impossible for a servicemember to be vaccinated without violating  his or her sincerely held convictions.   Unfortunately, it hasn't really panned out that way, as I will  explain in a moment.   But in a nutshell, since the implementation of this vaccine mandate  over almost the last year and a half, the United States military has  dismissed 8,200 servicemembers for declining to receive the COVID-19  vaccine.   That is over 8,000--more than 8,200--individuals, and it is not just  the individuals themselves. Many, if not most, of these individuals  themselves are mothers or fathers. They have got mouths to feed,  families to care for--all of whom are placed in a really unfair  position as a result of this mandate. Serving our country shouldn't  require you to surrender your fundamental right to make medical  decisions that are right for you, no matter the reason, and yet that is  precisely what the Department of Defense continues to do.    My office has received hundreds of accounts from brave members of our  Armed Forces detailing the hardships and the retaliation they have  experienced for declining to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. One first  sergeant in the Air Force writes:         I was involuntarily separated and my enlistment was       curtailed. I was a First Sergeant with the U.S. Air Force       Reserves at the time the COVID mandate was put into place. I       did everything I could to be allowed to continue to serve my       country. I filed my Religious AR, and when it got denied, I       also filed an appeal, and that got denied.    She goes on:         All I wanted to do was to continue to take care of the       members of my squadron and continue to serve this great       country.    Likewise, a Marine officer writes:         My family was forced to move on very short notice back to       the U.S. from Okinawa, Japan due to the loss of a job and the       threat of travel restriction if we remained unvaccinated. . .       . Many are far worse off than me.    Another lieutenant colonel with the Marine Corps Reserve was placed  on ``inactive status'' with ``no warning or notice that this would  happen'' and in the process lost TRICARE health insurance that his  family relies on to  [[Page S7210]]  provide expensive medical supplies for his special needs daughter, even  though his appeal for a religious exemption was and is--remains still  today--pending.   It seems in this and other circumstances, the Department of Defense  has issued something of a pocket veto, not acting on these requests for  an exemption but instead refusing to act and therefore leaving the  servicemember with few options.   This person writes:         My entire family was--was without notice or warning--      dropped from TriCare left scrambling to find health       insurance.    These brave men and women represent just a tiny fraction of the  servicemembers who have reached out to my office. Many are in  desperation. They are pleading for someone to recognize the injustice  they are experiencing. They deserve better, and we owe them more than  this.   So, as we consider this year's National Defense Authorization Act,  the blueprint for the defense budget that directs policy for our  military, we should adopt this simple amendment that would: No. 1,  immediately repeal the COVID vaccine mandate; No. 2, prohibit DOD from  replacing the current COVID-19 vaccine mandate with a similar mandate  absent express congressional approval; No. 3, provide remedies for any  servicemember negatively impacted by the mandate, including the right  to reinstatement, if desired, and to petition for a change in status if  they received a negative discharge based on whether or not they were  vaccinated, correcting for any loss of rank, pay or retirement  benefits; and, No. 4, require the DOD to make every effort to retain  unvaccinated servicemembers.   We, of course, can't take back the hardship that the military vaccine  mandate has inflicted on countless servicemembers. We can't do that.  That is in the past. But there are some things we can do. By adopting  this amendment, we can recognize an injustice and take steps to restore  the affected brave men and women who deserve our best.   We owe them that, and we owe them so much more. So I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment and stand with those who  themselves ``stand ready to visit violence on those who would harm  us.''   It is the right thing to do.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  Senators be permitted to speak prior to  [[Page S7238]]  the votes in relation to H.R. 1437: Senator Lee for 5 minutes and  Senator Scott for 1 minute.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment to  the Senate amendment to H.R. 1437, with amendment numbered 6541, as  modified, with the changes at the desk.    Mr. President, we find ourselves back in the same place. It  is like deja vu all over again. We have been through this process year  after year. I have been here 12 years, and it seems more often than  not, we are in a very similar circumstance.   We are just a few days away from Christmas, and we are being asked to  [[Page S7240]]  move the deadline for the expiration of government funding, potentially  leading to a shutdown even closer to Christmas. Today, we are being  asked to move it to the day before Christmas Eve.   Obviously, we need to keep the government funded. We don't want a  shutdown. No one wants a shutdown. A shutdown would be particularly bad  at this time of year. It would be horrible for our constituents, people  who rely on the government for a paycheck or for this or that program.  It would all be bad, and we all feel the weight of that.   We also feel the weight, as we approach Christmas, of wanting to be  able to make good on our promises to our families to spend the holidays  with them rather than here in Washington.   As a result of that, every year, knowing this, there seem to be  people who want to make sure that all spending decisions are wrapped  into one spending bill. Very often, those are wrapped together in one  omnibus spending package and then held off until a day or two-- sometimes just hours--before the government is set to shut down.   That is when the magic happens. But it is not good magic; it is  really bad magic. That is when these twin threats of sacrificing  Christmas on the one hand or running into a government shutdown on the  other hand--they operate like paired scissor blades to cut through what  would otherwise be an insurmountable task. And that task involves  convincing Senators to vote for a bill 3,000-plus pages long--likely  this year containing 7,500 or so earmarks--a bill that they have never  seen; a bill that does not, as we speak right now, exist without ever  having seen it.   We all know that this is wrong. We all know that this is a corrupt  way to run a government. This is a corrupt process that brings about  all kinds of special interest giveaways. And in the absence of the  light of day, they pass with the threat--the extorted threat--of a  government shutdown or canceling Christmas--Members end up voting for  that which they know they have no business supporting.   That is why my amendment is simple. My amendment simply gives us the  flexibility to make these decisions not under duress, to make these  decisions with clarity of mind and not influenced by this dual threat  of a shutdown and cancellation of Christmas.   Now, look, whether you are for this omnibus bill that has yet to come  into existence, that has yet to make a public appearance to see the  light of day--whether you are for it or against it, you should support  my amendment, because if you support my amendment, you are just giving  us more flexibility.   The American people deserve nothing less than to allow us to make  decisions consciously, knowingly, under the light of day, with clarity  of mind, and not under duress. That is what my amendment affords them,  extending this out to March 10.    Mr. President, we will be voting in a moment on my  amendment. Again, this amendment is something that everyone in this  Chamber should be able to support, whether you like the omnibus or  whether you hate the omnibus. The Senate should be in a position to be  able to review the omnibus with a clear head without the pressure of an  imminent threat at Christmastime of a shutdown. The American people  deserve this, and so do we. This is the only way to make this right. I  encourage all of you to vote for my amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jonathan  McKernan, a detailee on the Banking Committee, be given floor  privileges throughout the remainder of this Congress.
