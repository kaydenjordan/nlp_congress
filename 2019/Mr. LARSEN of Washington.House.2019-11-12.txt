 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I,  I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my  support for H.R. 4863, the United States Export Finance Agency Act,  which reauthorizes the Ex-Im Bank's charter for 10 years. The Ex-Im  Bank is a proven job-creating success story.   For years, I have met with small- and medium-sized manufacturers in  northwest Washington State who rely on the Ex-Im Bank to compete in the  global marketplace. Since 2014, companies, suppliers, and other  manufacturers in my district who rely on the Ex-Im Bank have generated  nearly $24 billion in total export value.   Vista Clara Inc. in Mukilteo is a small, veteran-owned business which  used Ex-Im funds to develop and manufacture advanced nuclear magnetic  resonance, NMR, geophysical instruments for groundwater, environmental,  and energy resources investigations.   The Ex-Im Bank levels the international playing field for U.S.  exporters and workers, enabling them to respond to foreign competition  when it is backed by export credit agency support. It also supports  large manufacturers like Boeing, America's largest exporter.   I represent nearly 18,000 current employees at Boeing's Everett  plant, which depends upon the Ex-Im Bank to support millions of dollars  in total insured shipments, guaranteed credit, or disbursed loans.   The U.S. can be an attractive alternative to China by employing a  strategic approach combining development assistance, ensuring  protections for the environment and worker rights, and supporting good  governance and the rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to voting for H.R. 4863 this week to  provide much-needed certainty for the Nation's manufacturers, and I  urge my colleagues' support.                            ____________________
