 Mr. Speaker, sometimes we don't even realize that we are  surrounded by heroes. Today I rise to celebrate the courageous actions  of a Yorkville resident, Lieutenant Timothy Corey from my district. He  was recently honored with the New York State Senate Liberty Medal, one  of the highest civilian honors in New York State.   While on vacation in North Myrtle Beach, Lieutenant Corey discovered  a young boy stuck in an outdoor pool intake pipe. In an instant, he  jumped into the water and rescued the young man and for 8 minutes  breathed air into the drowning boy, ultimately saving his life. The  young boy was released from the hospital just 6 days later.   The bravery displayed by Lieutenant Corey often goes unrecognized,  so, Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to now recognize Lieutenant  Timothy Corey as a true hero in our community.                            ____________________
