 Mr. President, I take this time to propound a unanimous  consent request concerning our Federal workforce. The reason for doing  this is we have gone through shutdowns before. It has been our view  that our Federal workforce should receive their pay. That has been a  bipartisan effort after each of the shutdowns.   I can tell my colleagues our Federal workforce is concerned. They are  concerned as to those who are on furlough, whether they will receive  their paychecks when the government opens up again. I was pleased to  see a comment come out of the White House, where the White House said  they support the pay for our Federal workforce. I think it is important  we give them that assurance.   I understand there is disagreement as to what has happened to date  and how we are going to reopen government, but let's not make our  Federal workforce have anxiety where they should not have it. Our  Federal workforce has suffered long enough under furloughs and CRs and  pay raises that have been less than cost of living and shutdowns, et  cetera.   So I would hope, on a bipartisan basis, that we could do what we have  done every shutdown; that is, to tell our Federal workforce that when  we resolve these issues, we will make sure they are paid if they are  furloughed today.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 290, S. 2274; I further ask unanimous  consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the men  and women of our armed services should not be left to suffer at the  hands of political obstruction. These troops are deployed in harm's  way, and left behind are their families and colleagues training to  replace them. It is irresponsible that their pay, to include imminent  danger pay, would be delayed because the Democrats are insisting that  we deal with illegal immigration exclusively on their terms.   Let me remind the Senate that we have an All-Volunteer Force that  doesn't ask much of us, but we are obliged to pay and support them. We  owe them the certainty of a full-year funding bill. Therefore, I  object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1301    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 36, H.R. 1301;  that the McConnell amendment at the desk, which provides for full  funding for authorized activities in the National Defense Authorization  Act, be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered  read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I might,  what Democrats and, I hope, Republicans have been trying to do is to  get a budget for this country. That is what we have been saying. Let's  stay here and negotiate the budget. Let's pass a very short-term CR.  Let's get these budget numbers done so that not only on defense but on  nondefense we can provide the support they need.   I came to the floor to make sure our Federal workforce knows we are  behind them and to make sure they understand that whether they are  furloughed or not, they are going to be paid for their services. That  is what we have always done together.   I take this time because I want to get a budget for the entire  country. We are not going to be able to divide the issue and say we are  going to take care of some but not all. That was not the purpose of my  unanimous consent request.   Therefore, for those reasons, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Montana.
