 Mr. Speaker, today I have the honor of introducing my  friend, the Reverend Dr. Andrew Chaney, along with his wife, Christine,  and my wife, Barbara, in the gallery, and the Hargis family from  Springfield, Missouri, members of the First and Calvary Church.   Reverend Chaney is a third-generation minister. Reverend Chaney  serves as the senior minister at the historic First and Calvary  Presbyterian Church in Springfield, Missouri, a church that is a very  special place for my family. Reverend Chaney serves as an important  spiritual voice for us and the Springfield community.   Congress has a longstanding tradition of beginning each day in  prayer. I am privileged and honored to have the opportunity to welcome  Reverend Dr. Andrew Chaney to the people's House as he opened today's  session in prayer.                            ____________________
