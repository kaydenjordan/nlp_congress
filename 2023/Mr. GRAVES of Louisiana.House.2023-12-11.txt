 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Arkansas and the gentlewoman from Oregon for their cooperation on this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I note that my friend from Arkansas, whether he has the  electronic stamp or the physical stamp, I feel that the ducks in  Arkansas are safe. I have seen him shoot and am confident that those  ducks are safe.   Seriously, Mr. Speaker, oftentimes, when Congress acts, I think the  American people need to be very concerned.  [[Page H6752]]  In this case, I think it is a really good thing that is happening  today.   As my friends have discussed, back in 1934, President Roosevelt  signed the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act into law.  Today, over 1.6 million hunters go out and buy a physical duck stamp  every single year.   This has resulted in over $1.1 billion being invested in  conservation. This has benefited over 6 million acres of our national  wildlife refuges around the United States. This is a great program.   As my friend from Arkansas indicated, there is a compliance issue.  With the great work that was done in 2013 to allow for an electronic  duck stamp, there is a lag time between when the duck stamp is  purchased and when the physical stamp comes in. You could find  hunters out of compliance, despite the fact that they bought a stamp.  Simply, this legislation fixes that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Senate cosponsors of this legislation who  have jumped in, Senators Boozman, Manchin, Marshall, and King, for  introducing the House companion--I want to be clear, the House  companion. This was a House bill and has already passed out of the  House, but now, the Senate is refusing to take our bill up, so we find  ourselves here.   In any case, I think this is good news. We are going to take the win.  I appreciate the opportunity to move forward.   The bottom line is that this ensures that hunters can be compliant  and are not going to get fined for not having the physical stamp.  Importantly, it preserves the physical stamp that will continue to be  mailed. It still is available to be purchased at local sporting goods  stores and post offices all around the United States.   We can continue to ensure compliance and ensure the enjoyment of  waterfowl all over the United States, whether you are in North Dakota  or south Louisiana or even in the chairman of the Natural Resources  Committee's State, Arkansas.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman   Mike Thompson from California, who  is the bipartisan cosponsor on this legislation. I urge adoption.    Mr. Speaker, this body is often fighting  over things. We are at one of the most polarized points in our Nation  that I have ever experienced, but in this case, this is an instance  where Republicans and Democrats are coming together. I thank my good  friend,   Steve Cohen, not just for this bill but also for the 5-year  authorization that we passed out of this Chamber back in July. I also  thank Rick Larsen, the ranking member of the full committee; and, of  course, Sam Graves, the full committee chairman, a good friend, and  probably the best expert on aviation in the entire House of  Representatives, for their work on aviation this year.                                time  1530    Mr. Speaker, I often hear people quote John Dingell, who said that  the other party is the opposition, but the Senate is the enemy. In this  case, I think that is exactly what we are experiencing.   Right now, we are in a situation where the House of Representatives,  in this very polarized environment, passed a bipartisan FAA bill that  we worked on for over 18 months.   The aviation team did an amazing job going through and distilling  over 2,000 requests from Members of Congress and stakeholders and  generating a bill, while not a metric of success, over 900 pages,  ultimately passing the House Transportation Committee unanimously and  passing the House of Representatives by a vote of 351 to only 69 people  who didn't understand the bill.   Mr. Speaker, that shows huge momentum. We were able to work through  complicated issues, as you heard others say, things like improving the  passenger experience and making regulatory decisions for the FAA to  ensure that we continue to play the leadership role in aviation  innovation; to ensure that we have regulatory certainty and that we are  not sending innovators and entrepreneurs to other countries to make  investments because we don't have regulations, stability, or  predictability in the aviation sector where new entrants are coming in  at a remarkable rate; to ensure that we move the ball forward and  properly strike that balance, as I know the full committee chair is so  concerned about, between general aviation and commercial aviation; and  to ensure that commercial space travel is properly regulated and has  the certainty that they need.   Mr. Speaker, we reorganized the FAA. We improved the training of air  traffic controllers. We improved addressing the major cliff that we are  going over on pilots, A&P mechanics, and others involved in the  aviation space who are so critical to this country.   Rather than sending a bill to the President's desk to do a long-term  reauthorization of the FAA for 5 years, which addresses most of the  problems in the FAA, we find ourselves now doing a 3-month extension  until March 8 because the Senate has been unable to get their job done.   Just 2 weeks ago, we had a hearing in the Aviation Subcommittee where  we went through and explored these issues. We looked at this.   The FAA now finally has an Administrator. I am fully supportive of  the Administrator of the FAA, Administrator Whitaker, for being in  there, but we have to have long-term certainty.   While I am voting for this bill and support it, it does not address  the problems in the aviation space. They will not be addressed until  the Senate takes up the bill and, ultimately, goes to conference with  the House to where we are working on a conference report and sending a  long-term authorization to the President.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the other members of the Big Four:  Mr. Cohen, Mr. Larsen, and Mr. Sam Graves. I thank everybody for  working on this. I thank the aviation team on both sides.   I support this legislation, and I urge its adoption, but we cannot  take the pressure off of the United States Senate to ultimately do  their job and pass a long-term FAA reauthorization.
