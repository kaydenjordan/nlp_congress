 Mr. President, I rise today to condemn the violence and  threats of violence against the men and women of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation.   I take these threats seriously. This July 1, I chaired the Judiciary  Committee hearing on law enforcement officer safety and the threats our  law enforcement officers are facing. I have repeatedly made clear that  violence against law enforcement is never--never--acceptable no matter  what ideology motivates it, but here is the reality.   In the past month, following the FBI's execution of a search warrant  at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, the FBI has faced a flood of  threats against its employees and its facilities, and these threats  have been egged on by the former President and his allies.  [[Page S4832]]    The men and women of the Federal Bureau of Investigation literally  put their lives on the line every day to keep all of us safe. They put  themselves in harm's way to stop armed criminals, drug traffickers,  terrorist organizations, and others who threaten our communities. They  serve on the frontlines of the opioid epidemic and investigate and hold  accountable those who traffic illegal opioids and who illegally  prescribe pharmaceutical opioids. They investigate crimes against  children and human trafficking--some of the most heinous crimes  imaginable. They work day in and day out to combat international and  domestic terrorism, and they carry out judicially issued search  warrants every day. That is part of their job and an important role  that they play in our justice system.   Unfortunately, ever since the August 8 Mar-a-Lago search, their  dedication has been repaid with a flood of baseless attacks and violent  threats. Attacking the FBI for his own political advantage is nothing  new for the former President, but the attacks haven't stopped with him.  His allies and followers have spewed anti-FBI vitriol online and across  the airwaves. In recent weeks, there have been calls from Republican  Members of Congress to ``destroy'' and ``defund'' the FBI. There have  been calls from Republican congressional candidates to ``gut'' the FBI  ``like a fish'' and ``shoot FBI, IRS, ATF, and all other feds on  sight.'' So it is no surprise that such outrageous and irresponsible  rhetoric coincides with a stunning increase in violent threats against  the FBI.   Last month, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued a  joint intelligence bulletin detailing an increase in violent threats  and acts of violence against Federal law enforcement officials  following the August 8 Mar-a-Lago search. These include threats to  place a ``dirty bomb'' outside of the FBI headquarters and online calls  for civil war and armed rebellion.   On August 11, a man wearing body armor--armed with an AR-15 assault  rifle and a nail gun--attempted to breach the FBI's Cincinnati field  office. On August 16, another man was indicted for threatening to  murder everyone at the FBI, from Director Wray to the custodial staff.  On August 25, a man jumped the fence at FBI's Chicago field office but,  thankfully, was detained and taken to a local hospital for evaluation  before he could hurt anyone.   In response to the joint intelligence bulletin and these incidents, I  asked the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to have a private  briefing with Members of the Senate's Judiciary and Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs Committees last week. That briefing only added  to my concern.   I cannot share the specifics from this closed-door briefing, but I  will say this: It should go without saying that the men and women of  the FBI risk their lives every day on our behalf, but the increase in  threats to their personal safety since the August 8 Mar-a-Lago search  warrant is shocking. Beyond the direct threats and violence, there are  also rising concerns about the public spread of personal information  about the FBI's employees and families--a practice known as doxing. I  fear the situation may get worse.   Last Thursday, former President Trump kept up his threatening  rhetoric against these law enforcement officers. He said that if he  were indicted for his actions, ``I think you'd have problems in this  country the likes of which, perhaps, we've never seen before. I don't  think the people of the United States would stand for it.'' That is  exactly the kind of language President Trump used after he lost the  2020 election to incite the January 6 attack here at the Capitol.   As I have said many times, political violence and threats of violence  in the furtherance of any cause--any cause--is unacceptable. It is time  for the Senate to stand up and support the men and women of the Federal  Bureau of Investigation who have been threatened and attacked for  simply doing their jobs and working to protect America. Let's condemn  these baseless attacks on the men and women of the FBI and the  despicable political game they represent.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 775, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, this resolution which just passed without  objection from any Member of the Senate will be a reminder to the men  and women who serve in law enforcement, particularly in the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, that we stand behind them and that those who  would exploit political events at the expense of the safety of these  men and women are beyond the pale of constitutional conduct. We want to  stand behind those who are standing for us--to protect us and our  families.   I thank the Senate for agreeing to this resolution. It is timely; it  is important; and it is clear.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I listened to the Republican minority  leader, Senator McConnell, speak on the floor this morning. I have to  tell you, on the issue of immigration, there are several things which  he said which are not accurate and that I would like to clarify for the  Record.   First, this morning, Senator McConnell said:         Orderly, legal immigration is part of what makes America       strong. Anarchy and open borders make us weak.    I don't know of any rational person who would disagree with that  comment.   But I think, for the record, we should make clear that, 8 years ago,  when we considered comprehensive immigration reform--a bipartisan  bill--on the floor of the U.S. Senate, the Senator from Kentucky voted  against it. There were 14 Republican Senators who voted for this  measure. It passed the Senate. It was the product of a bipartisan  Commission--a self-appointed committee, really--the so-called Gang of  8. I want to recount the names of those who were on that committee who  produced a comprehensive immigration reform bill. I was on the  committee with Chuck Schumer, Senator Bob Menendez, and the Senator  from the Presiding Officer's home State of Colorado, Senator Michael  Bennet. On the Republican side, it was led by Senator John McCain,  Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Marco Rubio, and then-Senator from  Arizona Jeff Flake.   We worked for months. We put in all of the effort that was expected  of us to address an issue which had not been addressed by Congress for  25 years, which was to try to upgrade our immigration system--to do  what Senator McConnell says needs to be done: orderly, legal  immigration. That was what the bill sought to achieve. There were 14  Republicans who joined us in voting for it. Senator McConnell did not,  and we have not had another measure since then.   The bill we passed in the Senate was sent over to the Republican- controlled House of Representatives. They refused to even consider it  in committee or on the floor or to bring it to a vote. We missed an  opportunity, and it was an opportunity on many different levels. It  would have finally addressed the issue of legal immigration in America,  which is a critically important measure.   Throughout our history, without exception, year in and year out,  legal immigrants have come to this country.  [[Page S4833]]  There have been some terrible laws passed by Congress in relation to  those having been allowed in this country. The reality is we have  acknowledged from the beginning of America as we know it that  immigrants have been a part of our present and are a part of our  future, and now we face the same reality again without the benefit of  having an update in the laws, which the Republican leader voted  against.   I recall specifically the work of Senator Bennet from Colorado. He  did a remarkable thing, something that people didn't think was really  possible. He managed to bring together all of the interest groups on  the issue of legal immigration for those working in agriculture. He  managed to find an agreement among all of these groups as to the humane  and sensible treatment of these individuals. If that would have passed,  it would have changed the circumstances we have today--circumstances  wherein we do not have nearly enough legal immigrants to work in the  agricultural sector of America. It is estimated that one out of two--50  percent--of all of the ag workers today are undocumented. We still eat  the food that they pick and harvest, and we still take advantage of  their hard work in the meat processing plants. Yet the reality is that  we know, in our heart of hearts, that they are not being treated in a  sensible, reasonable, humane way.   Senator Bennet, time and again, has shown leadership on this issue as  he did with the Gang of 8. Once again, we find ourselves, because the  bill failed in the previous Congress, without a guiding law on  standards of immigration.    There were other things said by Senator McConnell this morning which  I want to make reference to as well, particularly as to the busing of  those currently in the United States, as new, legally recognized  immigrants, to various cities around the United States.   Governors from the States of Texas, Arizona, and Florida have been  busing those who have been crossing the border and who are legally  recognized to stay here until further hearing to communities like New  York, Washington, Chicago, and even to Martha's Vineyard in  Massachusetts. The thing that we have got to keep in mind is that these  Governors do not call local officials first. They don't even contact  the Governors of these States where they are sending these people. So  they arrive, helter-skelter, in unpredictable numbers and conditions,  and the local officials are expected to take care of them.   Listen to what Senator McConnell had to say in describing what I have  just told you.   He said:         Out of desperation, a few Governors along our southern       border are now giving some Democrat-run States and cities       just a tiny, tiny taste of what border communities have been       enduring literally for years.    What he is trying to say to us is this is an act of political spite.  It is a political stunt by these Governors. And what are they using to  make their point? Innocent people--here legally in the United States-- who are being shipped off, many times, with deception and promises that  will never be kept in terms of opportunities for them in these various  places.   Senator McConnell went on to say:         All those cities combined have had months to accept between       them approximately 1 day's share of our Nation's illegal       immigration.    Immigrants--about four dozen--were given secure transportation,  according to Senator McConnell, ``to the wealthy, liberal destination  of Martha's Vineyard, filled with millionaires' mansions''--so-called  sanctuary destinations.   Do you see the point that is being made here? These people are being  bused without any warning as to where they are going to end up--where  their final destinations may be--simply to make the political point  that the Democrats have to be reminded of the Republicans' position on  immigration. We are doing this at the expense of many innocent people,  and we are doing this in a dangerous fashion.   I will tell you that I visited the Salvation Army center in Chicago,  IL, about 10 days ago, and I met with these families and individuals.  Little children are involved in this calculation.   Why is it that whenever the Republicans want to make a point on  immigration, it always ends up being the children who are the pawns,  whether they are kids in cages or forcefully removing children from  their parents or in this case, busing them off with their parents to  communities they have never heard of? Why does it always involve  families with small children? You would think there would be more  sensitivity on the Republican side to that reality.   Then Senator McConnell made a statement which I want to correct. He  said the Biden administration has been flying and busing illegal  immigrants around the country on a regular basis. This is not true. We  checked again this morning with the Biden administration. They are not  exercising that right.   What we have going on are the transfers of those who are not in legal  status back and forth between various facilities and the transfers of  unaccompanied children, with escorts, to places like Chicago and other  cities where, for decades, they have been cared for until their legal  status is resolved. But this statement that the Biden administration is  guilty of busing people back and forth is not true at all. I think the  record should be clarified, and I hope the Senator from Kentucky will  do so when he receives the first opportunity.   The Biden administration has said: We have the authority to do it,  but we have not exercised it and will not unless we confer with  Congress and also notify local officials as to whether anyone will be  moved.   Now, there are circumstances and have been in the past that I know of  personally on the border of Texas and Mexico where people had come and  been released. They found they had credible fear. They asserted it.  They have legal status, and they want to go to a specific location  where they have friends and family. In those cases, there is help given  to them to reach those destinations. But it is not the current  situation where the Governors of Florida, Texas, and Arizona are  deceiving these people onto these buses and sending them to places they  have never heard of and not letting those who are in their destinations  even know what it coming.   What is the right thing to do? The right thing to do is what we did 8  years ago: a bipartisan approach to fixing the immigration system.  Instead of exploiting it for political purposes, let's fix it.   We have done that. We passed legislation on a bipartisan basis even  in this evenly divided Senate. The CHIPS bill--this important  semiconductor chip production bill--was a bipartisan bill. The  infrastructure bill--the biggest highway program in the history of the  United States since Dwight Eisenhower--was a bipartisan bill. The gun  safety bill--a controversial issue, just as controversial as  immigration--we passed that on a bipartisan basis. We can do it, but we  have to stop exploiting these people who are here with children. We  have to do it by stopping exploiting this issue and work together on a  bipartisan basis, with give on both sides. That is how we can reach a  bipartisan solution.   I am ready to do that. In the Senate Judiciary Committee, we would  start as soon as we have Republicans of good will willing to sit down  with Democrats and work together. But continuing to exploit these  people and the children and these families is just plain wrong. It is  not consistent with American values. It doesn't reflect well on our  Nation.   I hope that the people who are inspired to do this--the Governors in  Florida, Texas, and Arizona--will think twice about these kids and  their families before they try it again.
