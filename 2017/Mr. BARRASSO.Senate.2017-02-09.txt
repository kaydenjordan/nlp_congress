 Mr. President, I come to the floor to, one, thank my  friend and colleague, the Senator from  [[Page S1012]]  Georgia, for making his comments about Tom Price, President Trump's  nominee to be Secretary of Health and Human Services.   I have known Tom for over 20 years. We are both orthopedic surgeons.  I know his professional ability. I know his passion for patients and  health care. I am delighted and confident that he will be confirmed to  be the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I think he is the right  person for the important task that lies ahead.
