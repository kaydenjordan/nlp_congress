 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, Tribal  recognition is a very serious matter. It is not one that should be  undertaken lightly. Given the sacred nature of Tribal recognition and  the significant impact it has both on the Tribe in question and on the  U.S. Government, as well as on surrounding communities, we have an  orderly process by which this needs to be done.   In 2009, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, having considered the argument  by the Little Shell, concluded it had failed to meet three of the seven  categories that are typically considered for Tribal recognition, and on  that basis, the Bureau turned down its application. It has been  suggested that there is still an appeal pending--a challenge to that  finding--by the Little Shell.   I am not aware of any legal analysis suggesting that the Bureau of  Indian Affairs got it wrong. This is not to say that Congress cannot or  should not or could not decide on its own to recognize it. Yes, this is  a power that Congress has. Yet, as I see it, those seven criteria ought  to be considered and considered carefully. I am aware of no  [[Page S7972]]  legal analysis indicating that the conclusion by the Bureau of Indian  Affairs in 2009 was inadequate or flawed.   For that reason, I object.
