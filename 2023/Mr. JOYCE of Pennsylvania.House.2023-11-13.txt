 Mr. Speaker, today, our national debt  stands at over $33 trillion, which is an increase of nearly $5 trillion  since President Joe Biden took office.   By borrowing money from China to subsidize Green New Deal initiatives  like windmills, solar panels, and electric vehicles, President Biden  has failed to rein in spending and sent our national debt soaring to  unprecedented levels.   As Congress looks to address next year's funding, it is clear that a  change needs to be made and that cuts to government waste are needed in  order to right the ship and restore sanity to our budget.   Right now, we are on an unsustainable trajectory that will put making  interest payments on our debt the largest single line item in the  Federal budget, surpassing Social Security, Medicare, and all other  spending programs.   It is time to chart a new course and help return to fiscal solvency  while supporting the priorities that matter the most, priorities like  protecting seniors, funding our military, and securing our border.   Pennsylvania families and, in fact, all American families cannot  afford President Biden's reckless spending, and I call on my colleagues  to join me in working to pass a budget that is responsible and shows  that Congress is working to be solid stewards of American taxpayer  dollars.               Recognizing National Lung Cancer Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, this November, as we  recognize National Lung Cancer Awareness Month, Congress must look to  find new and innovative solutions to treat this terrible disease. Each  year, lung cancer takes the lives of over 127,000 Americans, more than  any other type of cancer in America.   Unfortunately, at a time when we should be looking for new  innovation, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, has led to a slowdown  in research and development of new drugs and therapies that could be  critical to saving American lives.   New price controls, which were established by the IRA, create a  system of disincentives for smaller, innovative drug manufacturers that  are working to treat rare diseases, including cancer.   To address this issue, I have been joined by a bipartisan group of my  colleagues to introduce the ORPHAN Cures Act. This legislation would  amend the IRA to create a new exemption that would incentivize  researchers to explore the development of new medications to treat rare  diseases and cancers.   The clock is ticking, and now is the time for Congress to pass this  bipartisan solution for our constituents and the patients who are  currently battling cancer and other rare diseases.                            ____________________
