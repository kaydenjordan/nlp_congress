 Mr. Speaker, nearly 8      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. HIGGINS of  New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1  minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, nearly 8    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Today, the families of flight 3407 are in attendance at the Senate  nomination hearing for the new Secretary of Transportation. Their  presence is an urgent reminder that the work of Congress and the  administration still remains to be done.   In 2010, Congress passed landmark flight safety legislation with the  families of 3407 leading the charge. Since then, there have been nearly  8 years of no fatal commercial crashes on domestic U.S. airlines. Now  the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization is on the horizon,  and we must further strengthen flight safety measures.   It is essential that we continue to stand alongside the families of  flight 3407 and fight attempts to roll back pilot training and safety  provisions. We must not forget those we lost nearly 8 years ago and do  all that is possible to prevent another tragedy of this kind.                            ____________________
