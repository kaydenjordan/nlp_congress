 Mr. President, my colleagues from Kansas, Ohio, and  Missouri have raised a raft of questions to which I will offer a few  timely and simple answers: Look up. Look back. Look ahead.   To my colleague from Kansas, his predecessor Bob Dole, a Senator who  was a great leader in this Chamber, was a champion for the power of  humanitarian aid around the world. And I will not yield without  speaking to a piece of this supplemental that has been largely ignored:  the critical role of humanitarian aid in sustaining our partners and  allies, in averting humanitarian catastrophe, and, yes, in sustaining  both Ukraine and Israeli national security.   But, first, if I might, let's look back for a moment to history. My  colleague from Ohio complained that we somehow had not thoroughly  debated Ukraine. I believe we have, but I am happy to have us engage  for hours more because there are critical lessons from the past that  inform the strong, broad, and bipartisan support for aid to Ukraine.   The last time I went to Kyiv, I traveled with his predecessor,  Senator Rob Portman--a cochair of the Ukraine Caucus in this body and a  determined and committed supporter of Ukraine's. Why? Let's look back  for a moment.   In the runup to the Second World War, a famous American aviator,  Charles Lindbergh--a man who was decorated for his exploits and his  exploration--joined a nationwide movement whose slogan was ``America  First.'' ``America First'' seemed to say that we should stay out of the  roiling conflicts in the Pacific and in Europe; that we should step  back and allow the armies of the Nazis to advance across Western Europe  and allow the armies of imperial Japan to advance across Asia because  those were not our concerns. In fact, he gave a publicized speech in  favor of neutrality just on the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor.   History proved that ``America First'' almost risked ``America Alone''  in a world overcome by authoritarians.   I will tell you, that mistake is a mistake my colleagues risk making  now. If they want to make America weak again, they can go back to the  arguments of the isolationist Republicans on the verge of the Second  World War.   But to my colleague from Kansas, I will say you don't really have a  debate with us. You have a debate with your own leadership. I have  heard on this floor clear, forceful, focused speeches in defense of  Ukraine--the critical role of our support for Ukraine--not from  Democrats alone but from some of the most seasoned and capable and  leading Members of the Republican caucus, including my colleagues from  Texas and from Kentucky.   There is broad support for Ukraine. I, frankly, think, to answer the  question of my colleague from Ohio: How are these possibly connected,  the attack of Hamas on Israeli civilians, the attack of Russia on  Ukrainian civilians?   I say, you would need only look up. What is that sound? It is Iranian  drones and missiles raining death on innocent civilians in Israel and  Ukraine. These conflicts are profoundly connected.   My colleague from Ohio suggested that President Biden has thrown the  world into chaos. I do not have the time to fully rebut this ill- informed point, but I will suggest that Vladimir Putin's aggression in  Ukraine and, in particular, the terrorism of Hamas in Israel is not the  cause--of that, President Biden is not the cause but, in fact, has been  a forceful, timely, and responsive leader. His response to the attack  on Israel, I hope, has earned broad bipartisan support because it was  personal, forceful, and timely.   All of us here are standing, calling for the release of hostages by  Hamas, standing in strong support of Israel, and insisting that we  advance at the same time the aid that is desperately needed by our  close allies.   My colleague from Kansas asked a critical question: Will we show the  United States is a fair-weather friend? To my colleague I will say:  Sir, that is exactly why I join my colleagues in objecting to this  narrow, Israel-only aid package, because we cannot show that we will  fail to aid Ukraine.   Last, it was asked by several of my colleagues: Why would we send  humanitarian aid into Gaza? It will inevitably all fall into the hands  of Hamas, who support this.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, if I might, a  letter from the Israeli Embassy to the Congress of the United States.        There being no objection, the material was ordered to be       printed in the Record, as follows:     Emergency Supplemental Funding--Humanitarian Assistance Component         Please find below an overview of Israel's position,       regarding the humanitarian assistance component of the       Presidential request for emergency supplemental funding.        It is in Israel's view that humanitarian assistance to Gaza       could and should play a significant role in helping Israel       achieve its long-term strategic goals to remove the Hamas       threat in Gaza, and enabling a post-Hamas Gaza that is       demilitarized and does not pose a threat to Israel.        Israel's position is that this assistance should be       designed in a way that ensures that it does not fall into the       wrong hands, Palestinian or international.        In light of this, we support appropriating significant       funding as part of the supplemental, for the following       purposes and under the following terms:        a) Funding for short-term emergency humanitarian       assistance, so long as it will be allocated and delivered in       coordination with Israel, inspected and monitored by Israel       and which is consistent with Israel's objectives in Gaza.        b) Designated funding for a post-Hamas Gaza. Significant       humanitarian assistance under the supplemental is required in       order to rebuild a demilitarized and profoundly changed Gaza       following the uprooting of Hamas.        c) Egypt-Gaza border: As part of the supplemental, we seek       funding for the Egypt-Gaza border, including the upgrading of       the Rafah crossing--all designed to ensure that Gaza will not       be able to remilitarize. As such, this part of the       supplemental will be vital for Israel's security. We stand       ready to share our thinking on how to achieve the above       mentioned goal.        The bottom line is that the supplemental, properly       allocated, would contribute to humanitarian solutions on the       ground, while bolstering Israel's national security. We       believe that US funding in this matter will draw       contributions from additional actors and stakeholders from       the region and from the international community. We are more       than willing to answer any questions you may have and look       forward to continuing our dialogue on this and other matters.     Who supports humanitarian aid into Gaza with appropriate  measures of inspection? The Israeli Government. They say it is critical  to bolstering their national security.   Look up. Look back. Look forward. Look up; you will see the missiles  and drones of Iran raining down on innocent civilians. Look back; you  will see the mistakes of isolationism. Look forward, and you will see  there is a bipartisan path to supporting humanitarian relief globally,  to supporting aid to Israel against Hamas, to investing in border  security, and to taking up and passing a robust supplemental, as we can  and as we should.   For that reason, I join my colleagues in opposing the motion made by  my colleague from Kansas.   I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota.
