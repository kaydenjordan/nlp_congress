 Mr. Speaker, a few months ago, a woman from my district  walked into my office and told me about her daughter, a young lady  diagnosed with acute mental illness at just 4 years of age.   A decade later, the stories that that young mom shared would split  your heart: stories of countless ER visits, endless fights with  insurers and courts,  [[Page H2296]]  a little girl being boarded at a hospital for 21 days while they  searched up and down the East Coast to find a bed where she could stay.   At 14 years old, she has now spent half of her life in residential  care. But it was how her mother ended that story that has stuck with  me. She looked me in the eyes and told me that: ``Compared to other  people I know, we have been lucky.''   Mr. Speaker, that is not luck. This is a mental health system so  broken that it is hard to recognize.   And how have our Republican colleagues followed up in response? They  have offered a piece of legislation that is one of the largest assaults  on our mental health system in recent history.   The GOP repeal bill will remove guaranteed behavioral health coverage  for everyone covered under the Medicaid expansion. It will abandon  those suffering from substance abuse disorder to fend for themselves in  a country ravaged by opioid abuse. It will allow work requirements for  care, forcing countless people to somehow choose between getting  treatment and keeping their job. It will help insurers further skirt  parity laws that require them to treat the mentally ill fairly. It will  send out-of-pocket costs soaring for the most vulnerable among us.   Mr. Speaker, one in five Americans today suffer from mental illness.  These brave men and women and their families that love them deserve  more than the cheap luck of a broken system. They deserve more than the  empty rhetoric of a bill that ``might'' cover or ``could'' cover the  care that they need. They deserve an ironclad commitment from their  government that we will have their back. This bill does not do that.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for adding her  voice on such an important issue before our country today and for  leading our efforts here this afternoon on the House floor.   There are an awful lot of important components to this bill that we  are debating now and that will supposedly come before us tomorrow  afternoon. One of the critical pieces of it is how we are going to  treat people suffering from mental illness.   Now, the bill itself does a number of things across insurance  marketplaces and across Medicaid and Medicaid expansion, but I think it  is critically important that we look at this through the framework of  what health care is supposed to be all about. Health care, at least  from my understanding, boils down to one simple principle. It is how we  treat each other in our time of need and this commitment that we make  as a country to each other, that, yes, I care about you and your family  and want to make sure that you get the care that you need when you need  it. Because with health care, at some point, I am going to need that  same care as well: a loved one of mine, my children, my family members,  and I hope that you would be there for me the same way that I would be  there for you.   So if you look at this bill through that prism, one of the pieces  that stands out is the fact that, for the Medicaid expansion  population, about 11 million people across our country, this bill  strips what is called the essential healthcare benefits from those 11  million people. Now, that is a bureaucratic term, but it means some of  the most basic aspects of health care: maternal care and newborn care,  preventive services, wellness, ambulatory care, and, yes, mental health  services and addiction, behavioral health.   So what does that actually mean? It means that because of existing  legislation, the Federal law, mental health parity, which says that if  mental health benefits are, in fact, offered as part of a healthcare  package, insurance package, that it has to be offered in the same way  that physical health care is. You should treat your access to  behavioral health care the same way we would treat access to health  care if you needed cancer treatment or a broken leg. But the mental  health parity law does not require mental health benefits to be offered  at all. The Affordable Care Act, however, says that in order for a plan  to be qualified, it does have to offer an essential health benefits  package, included in that being access to mental health care.    So those two laws together work in tandem to have created a massive  increase in access to behavioral health and mental health services,  including, critically for the moment that we are in our country, access  to opioid treatment.   What this bill does is strip those essential benefits, including  access to addiction services and mental health care, from that  essential benefits package and says to the States: Good luck, you can  pay for them if you want to, providing nowhere near the sufficient  funding to cover all of the demands that our Republican colleague says  the funding will be there for.   Now, to make matters even more convoluted in this, it was clear,  during the debate in our committee 2 weeks ago for 28 straight hours,  that some of our colleagues actually thought these protections were  maintained when we pointed out that, in fact, they were stripped. There  was then a different version of this bill that was brought forth for  consideration called the manager's amendment. That manager's amendment  happened to reinstate those benefits, which was great, and I applaud my  Republican colleagues for doing so, aside from the fact that they then  realized that they included those benefits and they offered an  amendment to strip them back out, just in the past 36 hours,  recognizing that there was a bill that they thought offered these  benefits--the package of essential health benefits--for 11 million  people to begin with, they found out that it didn't, in fact, offer it;  they fixed it and put them back in a bill, realized they did it  inadvertently and took it out again and are now laying that bill  supposedly before our consideration tomorrow.   If health care is, in fact, that commitment we make to each other in  our time of need, how does this bill answer that question? The average  cost of a birth in this country is roughly $10,000. Medicaid itself  pays for half of the births in our Nation. Maternal care and newborn  care are covered under the essential health benefits, but not anymore  for the Medicaid expansion population. For that population, having a  child could very literally bring you to bankruptcy. That is the bill  that this Republican Congress is putting forward for your consideration  tomorrow.  [[Page H2337]]    That is one of the many reasons why I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
