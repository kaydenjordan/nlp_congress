 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee  for yielding. I congratulate him for his efforts down at the Rules  Committee in acting and acting swiftly.   I appreciate the remarks of Mr. Cole, for whom I have great respect,  but I disagree with his sense of a lack of urgency in action. I do  agree with him of the consequences of our action. There are  consequences to actions, and the actions of the President of the United  States demand urgent and clear action by the Congress of the United  States.   The chairman of the committee introduced the remarks and put them in  the Record, but I want to reference the remarks of the chair of the  Republican Conference, which is the analog to the Democratic Caucus. It  is all the Republicans elected to the Congress of the United States in  the House of Representatives. And they elected Liz Cheney, the daughter  of the Vice President of the United States, the former whip of this  House, Dick Cheney, with whom I served in the eighties.    Representative Cheney, from Wyoming, a conservative Republican, said  this: ``The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled  the mob, and lit the flame of this attack.''   That is not some irresponsible new Member of the Congress of the  United States. This is the daughter of the former Republican whip and  former Vice President of the United States of America. She knows of  what she speaks.   She said this as well: ``There has never been a greater betrayal by a  President of the United States of his office and his oath to the  Constitution.''   This is not, as Liz Cheney says, just some action. She characterized  it as the biggest betrayal of any President of the United States in our  history.   Mr.   John Katko--not a backbench Republican who just got here and  doesn't know what is going on--Mr.   John Katko, who is the ranking  Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, says this: ``To allow  the President of the United States to incite this attack without  consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy.''   This is not some backbencher on their side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker.  It reflects the sense of outrage and the sense of historic  dissimilarity from the actions of any previous President.   Then Mr. Adam Kinzinger, a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee and a senior Member from Illinois--so we have a Member from  Wyoming, a Member from Illinois, and a Member from New York. There will  be others on this vote who will join them. Mr. Kinzinger said this:  ``If these actions''--he hasn't had any hearings; he doesn't need any  long, drawn-out consideration--``If these actions are not worthy of  impeachment, then what is an impeachable offense?''   There is no doubt in my mind that the President of the United States  broke his oath and incited this insurrection.   I tell my friend, Mr. Speaker, a gentleman for whom I have great  respect--he is my friend, and I say that honestly, not just as rhetoric  that we say on this floor, because there are some that I don't consider  friends, whose values I do not share. That is not Mr. Cole. We have a  difference. Liz Cheney,   John Katko, Adam Kinzinger, and other  Republicans whom I have talked to within the last 24 hours believe this  action is required.  [[Page H155]]                                     time  0945    Mr. Speaker, I see the gentleman from Ohio is on the floor. He likes  to say that we Democrats were elected and the first thing we wanted to  do was impeach this President. He is shaking his head in agreement  because, like the President of the United States, he denies the facts.  Trump-like. Fake news.   Mr. Speaker, December 6, 2017, Mr. Green, who I am going to refer to,  offered a motion because he saw the danger that confronted our country,  and he filed a resolution of impeachment. On December 6, 2017, we had a  vote on that, and the majority of Democrats voted ``no''--actually,  they voted ``yes'' to table--so that we did not proceed in 2017.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green) thought, however, the next year  that there was still a danger to our country. Some of us shared that  view, but we were not confident that the case could be made or that the  transactions that preceded would lead to conviction. So, on January 19  of 2018, we had a motion to table Mr. Green's resolution, and the  majority of Democrats voted to table that resolution.   What a rush to judgment.   And then, on July 17, 2019, 9 days before the call to Ukraine to get  the Ukrainian leader to act on the political behalf of the President of  the United States and where he withheld money to defend the Ukrainian  people from Russian involvement and offered that as a bribe, on July  17, the majority of Democrats voted to table that resolution.   Mr. Speaker, there was no rush to judgment.   Then that call to which I just referred was on July 26, 9 days later.  I call that the ``a-ha moment.'' Yes, I knew what I thought, but that  was proof.   Some gentlemen have lamented that we didn't know the whistleblower,  because, after all, if we knew the whistleblower, we could intimidate  everybody else from coming forward. This President has done everything  he can to intimidate whistleblowers, people who came forward and told  the truth. And we had witness after witness after witness who confirmed  what the whistleblower brought to our attention.   So, Mr. Speaker, the reason I rise today--and I am going to speak on  the resolution itself at some later time--is to recognize the  contributions that Al Green from Texas has made to getting us to this  place.   I am not going to read all of the resolution, but I want to read some  excerpts from the resolution he has introduced. We won't be considering  his resolution. We will be considering Mr. Cicilline's resolution which  over 200 others have signed on to.   Mr. Green had a resolution be introduced: ``Resolved, that Donald  Trump, President of the United States'' . . . `'is impeached for high  misdemeanors, and that the following Articles of Impeachment be  exhibited to the Senate.''   Article I says, ``In his capacity as President of the United States,  unmindful of the high duties of his high office and the dignity and  proprieties thereof, and of the harmony and courtesies necessary for  stability''--to which my friend spoke, the gentleman from Oklahoma-- Donald John Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath to  faithfully execute the Office of President ``has harmed the society of  the United States, brought shame and dishonor to the Office of  President of the United States, sowing discord among the people of the  United States'' by weaponizing hate for political gain.   He went on to say, ``On January 6, 2021, in a speech at the National  Mall, President Donald Trump weaponized the hate that resulted in  violence, the deaths of multiple people, an assault on democracy, and  an insurrection against the Capitol of the United States of America by  inciting a mob''--who said that? Liz Cheney said it, and Al Green said  it--infected with white supremacists carrying a rebel flag, erecting a  gallows structure with a noose, wearing shirts and hateful messages  such as ``Camp Auschwitz: Work Brings Freedom'' and ``MAGA Civil War,  January 6, 2021.'' ``MAGA Civil War.''   They had the hats on of the army of MAGA, which I refer to as ``Make  America Grieve Again.'' We grieved at Fort Sumter; we grieved on  December 7, 1941; and we grieved on 9/11. And, yes, we grieved on  January 6 of this year.   He goes on to say what the President told this mob that Liz Cheney  said was recruited by the President of the United States. This is the  President talking to this mob:   ``All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen  by bold and radical left Democrats''--like the Secretary of State in  Georgia and the Governor of Georgia--``which is what they are doing,  and stolen by the fake news media.''   Inciting, riling up, creating anger with the fake news and lies that  the President of the United States said to these folks.   ``That is what they have done and what they are doing,'' the  President continued. ``We will never give up. We will never concede. It  doesn't happen. You don't concede when there is theft involved.''   And so what did they do? Incited by this President, as Liz Cheney  said, as   John Katko said, as Adam Kinzinger said, and, frankly, what  Secretary Chao acted upon and what the Secretary of Homeland Security  acted upon and what so many others in the administration have acted  upon--disgusted, dismayed, and disheartened by what their President had  done, they got out. They quit.   The President further emboldened them, saying--this is the Green  resolution. We are not considering it, but it is the Green resolution.  The President further emboldened them, saying, ``You will never take  back our country with weakness.''   We had a display of non-weakness, criminal insurrection-like conduct,  recruited by and deployed by the President of the United States to come  to this Capitol and ``stop the steal.''   The ``steal,'' of course, was: We assembled, accepting what all the  courts that considered it said was a fair and accurate election of Joe  Biden and Kamala Harris as President and Vice President of the United  States.   After his National Mall speech, a mob of his supporters proceeded to  the Capitol complex. We know that.   And so Mr. Green's resolution ends with, ``Wherefore, to prevent  national harm to our society, Donald John Trump, by such conduct,  warrants an immediate impeachment trial and removal from office and  disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or  profit under the United States Constitution and the 14th Amendment.''   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Green is going to speak after me, but, in  conclusion, let me tell my friend Mr. Cole: I have been here some time;  he has as well. I served with Ronald Reagan, with George H.W. Bush, and  George Bush. I had respect for all of those Presidents. They cared  about our country, they honored our Constitution, and they executed the  duties of their office consistent with the Constitution and laws of our  country.   That is not true of this President, and, therefore, he ought to be  removed. We have that opportunity to do so. Is there little time left?  Yes. But it is never too late to do the right thing.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   This is a troubled time, a sad time. It is a time where all of us  have stood almost to a person and lamented the violence and the assault  on this Capitol and the assault on democracy itself.   It was right to do that. But this impeachment ought to be put in the  perspective of what the Republican chair of the Republican Conference  said it was. She said the President of the United States summoned the  mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of that attack. There has  never been, she said, a greater betrayal by a President of the United  States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.   That is why we are here today. That is why we are here today just a  week before that President, at the request of the American people, will  leave office.   The issue is, what do we, the 433 of us, I believe, who are here, do  on behalf of the American people to respond to what Representative  Cheney described that happened on the 6th of January: a mob assembled  by, summoned by, and then spoken to, to light the flame of the attack.   To ``stop the steal,'' as we sat here, exercising our constitutional  duty. And to his great credit, the Vice President of the United States  followed the Constitution of the United States of America,  notwithstanding the fact that he was opportuned by the President not to  do so. That mob sent by the President to ``stop the steal'' did so for  a few hours, not the ``steal'' but the constitutional duty that we had.  [[Page H186]]    So, we ask ourselves, what do we do? What is our responsibility? What  should we say in light of only the Civil War as an analogy?   That doesn't mean there haven't been demonstrations in Washington  before and demonstrations throughout this country before. But it is the  first and only physical presence, other than the 9/11 attack, on this  Nation, which came from abroad and had a plane aimed at our Capitol  dome.   This attack was not from abroad. It was, as Liz Cheney said,  summoned, assembled, and inflamed by the President of the United States  of America. In Liz Cheney's words, there has never been a greater  betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath  to the Constitution.   I pride myself as a Member of this Congress who for 40 years has  worked in a bipartisan fashion with many of your leaders and do to this  day. But are we to remain silent in the face of Liz Cheney saying this  was the greatest betrayal of the duty of the President of the United  States in history? Are we to stand silent? Will we stand silent? Will  we not stand up and say this is not acceptable?   Madam Speaker, for 4 years, Donald Trump has made no efforts to hide  his ambitions or his lacking of Republican principles--not our  principles, but the principles that Abraham Lincoln was just quoted as  having said. Your President, our President, has never displayed those  in the 4 years he has been President of the United States.   He has allowed little constraint on his worst inclinations. His  desire for autocracy and his glorification of violence have not been  tempered but rationalized by those who sought to profit financially and  politically from their proximity to power.   Upon the foundations of virtue, reason, and patient wisdom laid down  by George Washington as our first President, Donald Trump has  constructed a glass palace of lies, fearmongering, and sedition. Last  Wednesday, on January 6, the Nation and the world watched it shatter to  pieces.    There can be no mistaking any longer the kind of man sitting in the  Oval Office or his intentions and capabilities. The curtain has been  pulled back. The office to which he was elected could not temper or  reform him.   Washington's legacy was passed down to us, not as written decrees but  understood norms, how we ought to act, how we ought to conduct  ourselves.   Term after term, each occupant has observed those norms out of a  recognition that our Constitution's Articles are not the only  preservative of our democracy. For more than two centuries, Madam  Speaker, whenever those norms were tested and strained, good and  virtuous citizens on both sides of the aisle found common purpose in  reaffirming those norms. But memory fades, and from time to time, it  must be refreshed.   Madam Speaker, as the Framers emerged from the Constitutional  Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked whether they had made America a  monarchy or a republic. Probably all of us know his response. A  republic, he answered, if you can keep it.   That is the question today, if we can keep it. And the way we keep it  is to say no to actions and words that do not promote the keeping of  that republic.   For millennia, people have understood that a republic is only as  stable and lasting as the citizens and leaders who commit themselves to  its upkeep. This President has shown us he is not committed to that  project. His tweets every day have shown he is not committed to that  project. Indeed, he openly disdains it and appears to prefer the  alternative.                                time  1545    But what of the rest of us, those of us who have the honor and the  great privilege and the weighty responsibility to represent the views  of 750,000 of our fellow citizens?   We, in this Congress, have an opportunity--no--a duty to demonstrate  our commitment both as leaders and as citizens to keeping America a  republic that resolves its differences, not through being ordered to  come to the Capitol to prevent them from stealing the election, which  was an absurd assertion from the very first day it was made.   We cannot erase the last 4 years, Madam Speaker. We cannot turn back  the clock, but we can look to the ideals and principles inherited from  great Presidents like Washington; like Jefferson; and, yes, certainly  like Abraham Lincoln; and like Franklin Roosevelt. And from outstanding  Americans like Frederick Douglass; Harriet Tubman; Susan Anthony; Cesar  Chavez; Martin Luther King; Thurgood Marshall; our beloved John Lewis;  and, yes, RBG, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who all taught us a lot about  equality and inclusion.   Madam Speaker, it is up to us to restore the vibrancy of our  democracy by reaffirming our commitment to the norms they passed onto  us and entrusted to our care. But to make that possible, Madam Speaker,  we must rise to this moment and not only affirm the virtues we cherish,  but reject the vices we abhor. That is what I am asking my fellow  Representatives on both sides of the aisle to do today.   We all stood and we abhorred the violence that occurred and the  threat to the very democracy that we hold so dear and that we swore an  oath to protect and uphold. Reject deceit. Reject fear-mongering.  Reject sedition, tyranny, and insurrection. Reject the demand for  fealty to one man over fidelity to one's country.   When I addressed the House during the debate over the Articles of  Impeachment in December of 2019, I said the following: We need not ask  who will be the first to show our courage by standing up to President  Trump. The question we must ask: Who will be the last to find it?   Senator McConnell, Representative Cheney, and a number of other  Representatives who have spoken on this floor with great courage, Madam  Speaker, because there is much fear of Donald Trump. There is much fear  of Donald Trump's tweets. There is much fear of Donald Trump's  retribution for opposition. In my view, Donald Trump demands absolute  loyalty and gives none in return.   I hope others will join Liz Cheney. I hope others will be honest with  themselves and with their constituents as Liz Cheney was, saying,  ``There has never been a greater betrayal of a President of the United  States to his office and to his oath to the Constitution.''   Don't dismiss that. She is the daughter of a Vice President of the  United States, who was the whip when I came to Congress. As she has  taken a stand, I hope others will as well, Madam Speaker.   Soon, the Clerk will call the roll and ask for our votes. Make no  mistake, this will be no ordinary roll call. This is about our country,  our Constitution, and our democracy. These votes will be inscribed on  the roll of history, a record of courage and of our commitment to  country and Constitution, of our commitment to the rule of law and  renewal of that which we inherited and hope to pass on unbroken,  unshattered.   With just 7 days left in the President's term, this vote is not about  timing. It is about principle and fidelity to our Constitution. It  concerns the clear and present danger facing our country not only in  these final days of the Trump administration, but in the weeks, months,  and years that will follow. It is about the necessity to demonstrate to  this generation and to future generations the duty we share to protect  our democracy every single day.   Do not pretend, my friends, that it was simply those who came into  the Capitol, encouraged by our President to ``stop the steal'' at any  cost.   By the way, if the Vice President doesn't do my bidding and follows  the Constitution, sweep him away.   We know that this President would never emulate George Washington and  give up his power for the good of our Republic, even after losing an  election.   Somebody talked about a peaceful transition. There has not been a  peaceful transition. I don't know what you are talking about. You are  not living in the same country I am. It was just days ago that the  President, after committing this terrible act, thought he had to admit  that Joe Biden might, yes, be President of the United States.   We know that this President neither recognizes norms, nor reflects  the rule of law. We know that this President is not a patriot.   Madam Speaker, so I ask this House: Who among us will be recorded on  the roll of history for their courage, their commitment to the  Constitution, and their country?  [[Page H187]]    We do this today not for politics. We don't need this for politics.  Georgia showed that. There was no mistake in this election. We do this  today to preserve and protect this great democracy. We do it for the  America we love, our America the beautiful, whose Founders' sacrifices  we praise in song: ``O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating  strife, who more than self their country loved and mercy more than  life.''   Sadly, Madam Speaker, as our current President, the appropriate words  would be: Who less than self his country loved and victory more than  truth.   Vote for this, for America, for our Constitution, for democracy, for  history.
