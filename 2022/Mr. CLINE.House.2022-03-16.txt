 Madam Speaker, when I travel around the Sixth  Congressional District of Virginia, folks regularly share their  struggles with me in the face of President Biden's inflation crisis,  economic crisis, and energy crisis.   They tell me that their hearts sink when they check out at the  grocery store and see the price on the screen tick well past what they  used to pay to feed their families. They tell me they dread going to  the gas station because every time they drive by, they see prices  getting higher and higher. They pray their car doesn't break down  because they can't afford to fix it or replace it given the rise in the  cost of car parts.   They worry about their kids hitting a growth spurt because new  clothes are just getting too expensive. And they tell me the  disappointment they felt when they let their kids know that the  vacation they had been looking forward to had to be canceled or scaled  back because the rising cost of flying and lodging made it nearly  impossible.   Madam Speaker, folks in rural parts of this country are struggling,  and 40-year high inflation rates serve as a tax on all Americans. It is  unacceptable that the soaring price of goods cost the average family  $3,500 last year.   If Members of Congress truly want to provide relief to their  constituents, then they must rein in spending and cut taxes to get our  country's economy back on track.                            Cave Spring Basketball     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Cave Spring High  School boys' basketball team from Roanoke, Virginia, for winning this  year's class 3 State championship. Following a near perfect season, the  Cave Spring Knights were crowned sole State champions this year after  being named co-winners with Lakeland in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic.   From the moment last week's final tipped off against the Petersburg  Crimson Wave, it was a great showing from both teams.   After an impressive second-half comeback by Petersburg, Cave Spring  was down by 2 with only 1 minute and 45 seconds left on the clock. A  quick Knight's basket tied the game, and the Crimson Wave took  possession as the seconds passed by. But a timely steal by Cave  Spring's senior guard, Owyn Dawyot, gave the Knights one last chance.   As Dawyot headed toward the basket, he was fouled sending him to the  free-throw line with just 3 seconds left. After missing the first shot,  the pressure was on, but he kept his cool and made the second shot for  the final score of the game.   The Knights prevailed, winning 76-75, marking the program's fifth  State title and the second under Coach Jacob Gruse.   Congratulations to Cave Spring on this hard-fought win. It was well- earned.           Recognizing Virginia's Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears     Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Women's History Month, we  recognize the list of women who have contributed to moving the United  States forward over the past 244 years.   I rise today to recognize one trailblazer in particular, Virginia's  current Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Sears. Born in Kingston, Jamaica,  Lieutenant Governor Sears moved to the United States at the age of 6  and has since dedicated her life to serving others and her country.   Outside of politics, she ran a homeless shelter, provided ministry to  prisoners, and spent 3 years wearing our Nation's uniform in the Marine  Corps. It was also an honor to serve with Lieutenant Governor Sears in  the Virginia House of Delegates.   Since entering public office, Lieutenant Governor Sears has served as  a Presidential appointee to the United States Census Bureau, as a  distinguished member of the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans to the  United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as the vice president of  the Virginia State Board of Education, and, as I mentioned, as a  delegate in the Virginia General Assembly.   Upon her swearing-in on January 15 of this year, she became the first  female veteran to serve as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and the  first Black woman to hold statewide office in the Commonwealth.   We applaud the Lieutenant Governor's lifelong accomplishments and  thank her for her service to her community, her Commonwealth, and her  country.                            ____________________
