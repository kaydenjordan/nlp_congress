 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Mueller report made crystal clear that  the Russian Government interfered in the Presidential election of the  United States of America in the year 2016. They called it a ``sweeping  and systematic fashion'' of interference.   I know this better than some because, in my home State of Illinois,  the Russian intelligence service literally hacked into our State Board  of Elections' voter file and gained access to a database containing  information on millions of voters in my State. Then the Russians  extracted the data on thousands of those voters. They also targeted  other State election authorities, county governments, and election  equipment and technology vendors.   Federal law enforcement and intelligence officers have repeatedly  warned us that these interference efforts will continue into the  election of 2020. In fact, former KGB Agent Vladimir Putin recently  mocked us and openly joked that Russia would definitely interfere again  in the U.S. elections. Congress cannot sit back and ignore this threat.  We must take action to help State and local election officials prepare  for the 2020 elections and those beyond.   I am pleased that the leader, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, finally  relented on his opposition to any further funding to assist State and  local election officials with election security efforts. Yet the $250  million included in the fiscal year 2020 Financial Services and General  Government appropriations bill is clearly inadequate. We need to boldly  invest in our election security. It is literally the cornerstone of our  democracy, and we need to provide sustained funding to State and local  election officials so they may respond  [[Page S5938]]  to these threats that are far beyond any State's capacity to deal with.   There are 40 of us who cosponsored the Election Security Act that  Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, introduced in May. I was proud to  join her as one of the original cosponsors.   The legislation would provide critical resources to election  officials through an initial $1 billion investment in our election  infrastructure, followed by $175 million every 2 years for  infrastructure maintenance. It would also require the use of voter- verified paper ballots, strengthen the Federal response to election  interference, and establish accountability measures for election  technology vendors.   Let me bring this down to Earth in simple words. If we cannot trust  the outcome of an election to accurately reflect the feelings of those  in America, we have lost the cornerstone of our democracy. There are  nations, including Russia, that have proven they are doing everything  in their power to stop us from having safe, accurate election counts.   The question for this Senate and for this Congress is, Do we care? Do  we care enough to spend the resources so our States can protect the  integrity of voters? I am not just talking about blue States from the  Democratic side of the aisle. Every State, red and blue alike, would  benefit from this legislation. If the Republicans want to demonstrate  that they are joining us in putting country over party, they should  join us today and protect our democracy by passing this legislation.   I have been asked to make a unanimous consent request at this point  before I finish my remarks, and I thank the Senator from Louisiana for  being on the floor.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1540    Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Rules and Administration be discharged from  further consideration of S. 1540, the Election Security Act; that the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read a  third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, is there an objection?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5  minutes.    First, let me say this. I do respect the Senator from  Louisiana. We have been cosponsors on important legislation. I hope we  will be again. We see eye-to-eye on many things but not on this bill.   A billion dollars? The Federal Government spends $1,500 billion every  year. Is the integrity of our voting system worth $1 billion?   Do you know what it has cost us to reach this point in our history  where our democracy is reliable and respected around the world? It has  cost more than money. It has cost the lives of men and women who went  to war to fight for that, to make sure that we had the last word when  it came to the future of our democracy.   A billion dollars is an overwhelming number; right? Divide it by 50,  and understand what is at stake here. What is at stake here is whether  we care enough to invest money in our election process--not with  Federal mandates. We say to the States: You decide how to spend it. You  have the authority over the State election procedure and the color of  the curtain on your booth. If you want to mandate that by State law, be  my guest.   But what it comes down to--and I have to disagree with my friend from  Louisiana--is that the money we have sent to the States already has all  been obligated, and it is going through the purchasing and procurement  policies of each of the States. It isn't as if they can't figure out  what to do with it.   Upgrading our voting machines to make sure that they reflect  technology today makes a difference. Have you bought a new cell phone  recently? Have you watched any ads on television talking about the  security of your cell phone? Have you listened to anyone talk about the  privacy of you as an individual? It is because every single day, every  single minute, and every second someone is trying to figure out how to  get into your mind and into your life, and we are trying to keep  technology up with this reality.   Now, what is the reality of the technology we use for voting? In my  State, we have paper ballots to verify what is actually cast, but our  technology is 20 years old. The Russians know that; the Iranians know  that; and the Chinese know that, and they are mocking us. They are  laughing.   If you were amused by the story of the Senator from Louisiana--and he  is the best storyteller in the Senate--think about how amused Vladimir  Putin is to listen to this debate.   We can't afford to spend the money to ward off Vladimir Putin's next  attack in 2020. That is what I hear from the other side of the aisle. I  disagree. I think what is at stake here is so basic and so fundamental  that shame on us if we will not invest the money to make sure we keep  up with the attackers.   Now, people say: Well, 2018 went off without a hitch. It was not only  the good work of State election officials. It was the hard work here in  Washington of our intelligence agencies, and the Senator knows that. We  didn't sit back and say: Well, I sure hope they don't hit us again. We  went after them. I can't be more specific because we are told not to be  more detailed in our response.   We invested a heck of a lot of money in stopping them from ruining  the 2018 election, and we are bound to do it again, and I hope we do.  But to say we can't afford to protect the integrity of our vote--then,  what is a democracy worth? What is it worth?   It is worth human lives, and it is worth our investment in this  generation to make sure that those votes count, whether you live in a  red State or a blue State. I am not talking about just sending this to  Democratic State officials. I am talking about across the country. I  want an election to truly reflect the way the American people feel  about candidates and issues that are before them, and that is why I am  so disappointed by the Senator's objection.   Yes, I will carefully consider his bill. Maybe there is some room  here. But when we say $1 billion disqualifies you from being considered  seriously, when it comes down to the integrity of our voting system--$1  billion is too much--it turns out the Republican leader has suggested  one-fourth of that amount, and nobody blinked.   I happen to think $1 billion is more realistic in terms of helping  our voting systems across this country. Shame on us if the result of  the Presidential election is later found to have been tampered with by  our enemies overseas. Shame on us if we didn't do everything we were  supposed to do in the Senate, in the House, and in this government to  protect that God-given right for a democracy that we cherish so much.   The Mueller report made crystal clear that the Russian Government  interfered in the 2016 presidential election in a ``sweeping and  systematic fashion.''   In Illinois, the Russian intelligence service hacked into our State  Board of Elections, gained access to a database containing information  on millions of Illinois voters, and then extracted data on thousands of  those voters.

And Federal law enforcement and intelligence officials have  repeatedly warned that these interference efforts will continue in  2020.   In fact, former KGB Agent Putin recently mocked us, openly joking  that Russia would definitely interfere again in the U.S. election.   Congress cannot sit back and ignore this ongoing threat--we must take  action to help State and local election officials prepare for future  elections.   I am pleased that Leader McConnell finally relented on his opposition  to any further funding to assist State and local election officials  with election security efforts.   But the $250 million included in the FY 2020 Financial Services and  General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill is not nearly enough.   We need to boldly invest in our election security--and we need to  provide sustained funding to State and local election officials to  respond to these evolving threats.   That is why 40 of us have cosponsored the Election Security Act,  which Senator Klobuchar introduced in May. I was proud to join as a  lead cosponsor.   The legislation would provide critical resources to election  officials through an initial $1 billion investment in our election  infrastructure, followed by $175 million every 2 years for  infrastructure maintenance.   It would also require the use of voter-verified paper ballots,  strengthen the Federal response to election interference, and establish  accountability measures for election technology vendors.   If Republicans want to demonstrate that they are capable of putting  country over party, they should join us  [[Page S5940]]  today and protect our democracy by passing this legislation.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from California  (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren), and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr.  Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.

[[Page S5947]]     Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 258,  S.J. Res. 50.    Thank you, Mr. President.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2659         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Tomorrow's       Workforce Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 percent of       the Nation's Gross Domestic Product on labor market policies,       less than half of what the United States spent on labor       market policies 30 years ago.        (2) The number of workers receiving federally supported       training has declined in the past 3 decades as advances in       technology have simultaneously shifted labor market demand       over time.        (3) As much as 47 percent of all jobs in the United States       are at risk of being replaced by automation technology, and       job losses from automation are more likely to impact workers       making less than $40,000 annually.        (4) Strong Federal investment in expanding training       services for workers whose jobs may be lost due to automation       could prepare the United States workforce to better adapt to       changes in the labor market and enter into skilled positions       in technologically-oriented occupations and industries.        (5) A focus on preparing the workforce of the United States       for jobs that utilize advanced technologies could grow wages,       increase economic productivity, and boost the competitiveness       of the United States.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to make it  easier to apply for Federal student aid, to make that aid predictable,  to amend the Federal Pell Grant program, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2659         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Tomorrow's       Workforce Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 percent of       the Nation's Gross Domestic Product on labor market policies,       less than half of what the United States spent on labor       market policies 30 years ago.        (2) The number of workers receiving federally supported       training has declined in the past 3 decades as advances in       technology have simultaneously shifted labor market demand       over time.        (3) As much as 47 percent of all jobs in the United States       are at risk of being replaced by automation technology, and       job losses from automation are more likely to impact workers       making less than $40,000 annually.        (4) Strong Federal investment in expanding training       services for workers whose jobs may be lost due to automation       could prepare the United States workforce to better adapt to       changes in the labor market and enter into skilled positions       in technologically-oriented occupations and industries.        (5) A focus on preparing the workforce of the United States       for jobs that utilize advanced technologies could grow wages,       increase economic productivity, and boost the competitiveness       of the United States.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
