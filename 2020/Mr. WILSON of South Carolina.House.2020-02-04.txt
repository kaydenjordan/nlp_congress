 Mr. Speaker, as the President in the  State of the Union reviews his achievements from the vantage point of  the White House, I have lived his successes on the ground level, in  South Carolina and overseas.   In Orangeburg, his Opportunity Zone legislation with Senator Tim  Scott has prompted a $20 million spec building for jobs.   In Munich, Germany, with Senator Lindsey Graham, I saw his urging  NATO defense spending.   In Aiken, Chancellor Sandra Jordan has achieved the funding for the  Advanced Manufacturing Collaborative in USC-Aiken.   In New Delhi, India, and also in Houston, Prime Minister Narendra  Modi assured his alliance with President Trump.   In Cayce, Lou Kennedy of Nephron Pharmaceuticals continues her  success, growing over 2,000 jobs.   And in Manama, Bahrain, it was heartwarming to see our Arab allies  appreciate peace through strength.   In Columbia, I joined Governor Henry McMaster to visit Fort Jackson  to meet our reinforced troops.   In Krakow, Poland, our allies appreciate the 5,000 U.S. troops to  stop Putin aggression.   In Barnwell, foreign investments at Swiss Krono have reached half a  billion dollars.   In Israel, citizens are more grateful for the President's moving of  the Embassy to Jerusalem.   Our prayers for Rush Limbaugh, an American icon of truth telling.                            ____________________
