 Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to the Senator  from Wisconsin.   I echo my support for this legislation. We worked together nonstop to  get this accomplished, as has been mentioned.   This passed the Senate 100 to nothing already. We are hopeful to wrap  this up. The House just sent us a vote back, and we will continue to  work nonstop to get this done because it is the right thing to do.   I think of the McLinn family in my home State, and they are a  representation of families all over the country struggling with the  same challenges. Our job is to try to make their lives a little bit  easier, a little bit better, so that all of the people who are  struggling with Right to Try challenges can get a chance to live their  life to the fullest and for a long time.   So, the hour is late. I just want to second the efforts of my friend  and colleague from Wisconsin, and we will continue to move forward.
