 Mr. Speaker, a recent Washington Post University  of Maryland poll asked Americans whom they blame for causing  dysfunction in the U.S. political system.   It is no surprise that 88 percent of respondents said the news media  caused some or a lot of the dysfunction. Given that the liberal media  unfairly blames President Trump for nearly all the problems in our  country, they bear the burden of this dysfunction.   Months of liberal biased reporting have shredded the media's  credibility in the eyes of most Americans. The media should report the  facts objectively. That begins with fair coverage of the President and  his administration. So far this year, the media has been anything but  fair.   According to a new Harvard study, media coverage of the President's  first 100 days was 80 percent negative, a  [[Page H9191]]  record for recent Presidents. Until the media becomes less slanted,  they will continue to be a source of dysfunction in our political  system.                            ____________________
