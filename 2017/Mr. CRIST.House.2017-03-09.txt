 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  strengthening the Affordable Care Act. Last Saturday, we held a  townhall meeting in my home of St. Petersburg, Florida. Over 550  Pinellas County residents showed up, and the message was overwhelming:  Work together, fix health care, don't destroy it, put people above  politics.   The Republican bill unveiled this week would drive up healthcare  costs, strip away important protections, and leave millions without  coverage. It is wrong for senior citizens. It is wrong for women. It is  wrong for the poor and the disabled. We are judged by how we treat the  least among us.                            ____________________
