 Madam Speaker, many families across the country have  felt the crushing economic burden of the pandemic, but additional help  is on the way.   The American Rescue Plan is delivering on President Biden's promise  to help working families make ends meet. This once-in-a-generation  investment includes an expanded child tax credit, and many American  families are eligible for a refund of up to $3,600 per child, with $300  monthly payments beginning on July 15.   This direct assistance to families will help parents put food on the  table, buy clothing for their children, or pay for other expenses while  building better lives for their families. These tax credits will also  help lift millions of families and children out of poverty, including  more than 145,000 children in my district of Ventura County in  California.   Ending childhood poverty will help increase educational attainment  and lifetime earnings, allowing for a prosperous future for America's  families and children. The expanded child tax credit also ensures  families can keep more of their hard-earned money and keep our Nation  on the path to recovery.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule  providing consideration for my bill, the Equal Access to Contraception  for Veterans Act.   As you know, this rule is necessary to bring critical veterans'  healthcare legislation to the floor, because last week House  Republicans failed to support the Equal Access to Contraception for  Veterans Act when it was considered under the suspension of the rules.   They voted ``no'' despite the bill having passed in the 116th  Congress by voice vote with broad support.   They voted ``no'' despite the fact that veterans' service  organizations overwhelmingly support the bill.   They voted ``no'' despite the fact that women veterans have put their  lives on the line for our country and overwhelmingly want equal access  to healthcare.   They voted ``no'' despite 87 percent of the American people  supporting women's access to contraception.   While it is both disappointing and perplexing to me that anyone would  vote to deny women veterans equal access to healthcare--the same  healthcare we give women currently serving in the military--I am  grateful the Speaker and the majority leader have given us--all of us-- a second chance to do what is right. I thank the Committee on Rules for  its swift action.   Contraception is a medication used by millions of Americans for a  wide range of conditions, and it is estimated that 62 percent of our  Nation's 2 million women veterans use contraception. In addition to  family planning, contraception is used to treat or alleviate migraines,  acne, endometriosis, and PCOS.   In fact, the median number of contraception methods used by women in  the U.S. is three, and nearly one-third of women in the U.S. have used  five or more methods over their lifetime. Contraception is essential to  a women's whole health and to her economic security. Yet women veterans  who use VA healthcare are not treated the same as women in the military  or civilian women.   Addressing this inequality is long overdue. All veterans and former  servicemembers deserve the very best healthcare without any unnecessary  barriers. They earned it, and they deserve it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to demonstrate their commitment  to the patriotic women who make up 20 percent of our military and 10  percent of our veteran communities and vote ``yes'' on the rule so we  can bring the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans back to the  floor.   Let's do the right thing, for equality, health, and economic security  for our women who bravely served our country for all of us to have the  same.
