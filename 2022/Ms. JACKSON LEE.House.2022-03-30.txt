 Madam Speaker, in a building that conspicuously  marked its exterior with the word ``children,'' the brutal Putin bombed  without stopping this safe house in Mariupol. Obviously, it was  completely destroyed. There were 300 people dead and little children  sitting around the dead bodies of their parents.   The whole city has been leveled. The whole country has been attacked  by a brutal dictator. Of course, we know the peace talks are going on,  I encourage that. As well, I believe that the allies should continue to  give weapons and there should be some process for giving them fighter  jets.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Secretary of Homeland Security for  recognizing that we will have to receive Ukrainian refugees, Haitian  refugees, and, yes, refugees from the border. We are, in fact, a humane  country. We have the ability to be able to assure the world that we  will be a refuge and, as well, protect the American people.   That is what we do: we protect the American people, provide them  jobs, give them safety, but, as well, we are a refuge for the world.   Madam Speaker, I thank the Secretary for his work. Let's let Ukraine  win this, either in peace or in war.                            ____________________
