 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise today to put the full force of the American people and this  Congress behind dismantling the savage Kremlin war machine.   This legislation shows President Zelenskyy, Ukrainians, and the world  that America will boldly confront Russia's savage attacks on the  Ukrainian people. This bill also holds Belarus to account for its  complicity in Russia's murderous aggression.   They each will learn what every tyrant must: If you invade another  nation, normal trade within our global economy is over.   While President Biden marshals the free world to fiscally cripple  Putin and his oligarchs, this Congress will also move to crush Russia's  militarized economic might.   So this legislation also reviews Russia's and Belarus' access to the  World Trade Organization, and it extends and strengthens the Global  Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, both of which will further  clip Russia's economic wings.   The grisly, heartbreaking images President Zelenskyy showed us  yesterday made clear that Russia must be punished. And with this  legislation, the people of Ukraine and every global democracy can count  on America to help make that happen.
