 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of the bill to amend the Fentanyl Sanctions Act.  Across our Nation, Americans are increasingly becoming exposed to the  impact of the illicit distribution of fentanyl. Our local news is  reporting on another overdose caused by a lethal dose of illicit  fentanyl with increased frequency. This synthetic opioid is making its  toxic presence known in our communities.   Fentanyl is similar to morphine but almost 100 times more potent. It  is manufactured at a low cost in labs overseas, primarily in China. It  is then smuggled into the United States through Mexico.   In cases of overdose, the individual is not aware that it contains a  lethal dose until it is too late.   This body recognizes that the People's Republic of China is failing  to effectively regulate and implement illicit trafficking of fentanyl.   In December 2019, we called for the establishment of the Commission  on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking. Specifically, this  Commission was designed to work with the executive branch in developing  a consensus on a strategic approach to combating the flow of synthetic  opioids into the United States.   The underlying bill recognizes the importance of this Commission and  the work that is still needed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as noted, the battle we wage against the illicit  distribution of fentanyl is ongoing. Extending the time allows the  Commission to provide us a better understanding of the challenges we  face and includes a strategy to address it. The valuable work of this  Commission is critical to addressing this poison in our Nation.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of the War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act.   Sadly, we live in a world where crimes against humanity still occur.  We have seen three declared genocides in just the last 20 years: in  Darfur in 2004, by ISIS in 2016, and the one in Xinjiang that was  formally declared by Secretary Mike Pompeo before he left office  earlier this year.   We have, of course, also seen the horrific ethnic cleansing against  the Rohingya in Burma. We have seen atrocities committed by Assad  against his own people in Syria.   But bringing the criminals behind these massacres to justice can be  difficult. That is why, 35 years ago, we enacted the State Department  rewards program. It authorizes the Secretary of State to offer rewards  for the arrest or conviction of some of the most dangerous people in  the world.                                time  1345    Originally written to be used against international terrorists, this  successful program has since been expanded to include drug traffickers,  war criminals, and perpetrators of genocide.   As the world changes and as international criminals evolve, we need  to make sure this important program evolves with them.   That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the War  Crimes Rewards Expansion Act. This bill makes clear that these rewards  are not just meant to support international tribunals. They can also be  used to bring these dangerous criminals to justice here in the United  States under United States law.   I want to thank the author of the bill, the gentlewoman from North  Carolina, Dr. Virginia Foxx, for her work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Libya Stabilization Act.   After years of civil war and violence, there are finally glimmers of  optimism in Libya. Elections are scheduled for December. We hope these  elections will help Libya continue on the path to democracy.   Unfortunately, as we have seen many times in this conflict, there is  still the possibility that spoilers could upend this peace process.   We need to incentivize all parties to embrace a productive political  track to establish stable governance in Libya and end the violence.  That is the purpose of the legislation before us today.   Under this bill, if individuals are threatening the peace, security,  and stability of Libya, they will be subject to sanctions.   Throughout this conflict, violent militias and foreign actors have  threatened Libya and its citizens.   Russia is using the chaos in Libya to its advantage. As AFRICOM  publicized last year, Russia deployed high-performance fighter aircraft  to Libya.   Through this bill, we are turning up the pressure to ensure that  Russia and other unhelpful foreign actors withdraw from Libya and to  incentivize Libyan actors to support the emerging political process and  a peaceful future for the people of Libya.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to thank  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) and the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for their leadership on this bill, and I urge all  Members to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume, and I rise today in strong support of the Cambodia  Democracy Act, which was introduced by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot).   As a cosponsor and as an advocate for the Cambodian community in  southern California, I am especially proud to speak on this measure  today.   The people of Cambodia have been living under the iron-fisted rule of  Hun Sen for decades. Under his reign, he has denied Cambodians almost  all of their political rights and prevented free and fair elections  from taking place. In recent years, Hun Sen has resorted to violence  and attacked peaceful protesters. He has undermined Cambodia's  democracy by dismantling the country's only viable opposition party.   The work of NGOs has also been limited, and critical media outlets  have been shut down. Like many other dictators, he fears the day when  he will no longer be in power.   As the beacon of hope and freedom to the rest of the world, a key  pillar of our foreign policy must be to support the expansion of  democracy in other countries.   The Cambodia Democracy Act will help push back on Hun Sen's regime by  applying asset blocking and visa sanctions on any government officials  or security forces who have undermined the democratic process or  committed human rights abuses.   The strong bipartisan bill has passed the House in successive  Congresses and is a touchstone of congressional support for the people  of Cambodia and their desire to democratic governance.   Members of both parties have long supported this important piece of  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to continue that support.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the ranking member of the  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia, and  Nonproliferation, and the author of this bill.    Madam Speaker, in closing, I would like to  thank Congressman Chabot for introducing this bill and for all of his  work on behalf of the Cambodian people.   I would also like to thank Congressman Bera for supporting this bill  as the lead Democrat sponsor.   Helping restore Cambodia's democracy is in line with the American  values that we all share. It is also a good national security strategy,  as holding Hun Sen's regime accountable will pressure him to stop  serving as a willing puppet of the Chinese Communist Party.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
