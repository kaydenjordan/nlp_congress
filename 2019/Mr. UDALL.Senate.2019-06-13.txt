 Mr. President, Today I wish to honor Private William Tully  Brown, a Navajo code talker who never considered himself an American  hero but who was.   Private Brown enlisted in the Marines in 1944 and was trained as a  code talker at Camp Pendleton. Training was intense. The code talkers  underwent extensive training in communications and in memorizing the  complex code that included Navajo words used for 450 military terms  that didn't exist in the Navajo or Dine language.   Private Brown was part of the Second Marine Division. In July 1945,  he shipped out of San Diego to Pearl Harbor, then to Saipan in the  Mariana Islands, and finally to Nagasaki and Sasebo on the island of  Kyushu, Japan's most southern main island. They landed in Nagasaki's  harbor on September  [[Page S3471]]  23 with the mission of occupying the island. They were armed in full  combat kit with fixed bayonets and full magazines. They didn't know  what to expect from the defeated Japanese. Nagasaki had been bombed on  August 9 and was devastated. Private Brown's division, along with other  troops, successfully and peacefully secured the area in short order.   Our Nation owes a great debt to the Navajo code talkers. They  transmitted thousands and thousands of strategic military messages  during World War II, but their code was never broken. Their skill,  bravery, and commitment to country were integral to winning the war.   Private Brown, like so many of our code talkers, was humble and  modest about the courage he showed during the war. While Private Brown  did not consider himself a hero, I do, and so does our country, which  is why he and his fellow code talkers were awarded the Congressional  Silver Medal in 2001 for defending the freedoms and liberties we enjoy  today.   Private Brown lived a long and productive life. After the war, he  married Sarah Francis and fathered five children. He has 3 surviving  children--Romero Brown, Vee Browne-Yellowhair, and Julie Brown--and 44  grandchildren an 2 great-great-grandchildren.   Private Brown served his country, his community, and his family. We  can ask no more of anyone. He is part of an American legacy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to New Mexico  Senator John Pinto--the longest serving member in the New Mexico  Senate, who passed away May 24 of this year at the age of 94.   John Pinto was born December 15, 1924, in Lupton, AZ, near the New  Mexico border, on the Navajo Nation reservation to a family of  sheepherders. He was Black Sheep born for the Red Running into the  Water Clan. He was the oldest of seven children and had a tough  upbringing. He was raised by relatives in Lupton until he was 12 years  old, when his parents took him to their home in Gallup, NM. They lived  in a small wooden shack. They sometimes went hungry. To eat, at times  John hunted rabbits with a sharp stick.   At that time, the Bureau of Indian Affairs picked him up and sent him  to boarding school at Fort Defiance, AZ. Fort Defiance was the first  boarding school on the Navajo reservation. John entered school at age  12. He spoke no English. They placed him in the beginner class, made up  of 5-, 6- and 7-year-olds. A person of small stature, he would joke  that was the last time he was the biggest one in the room.   John joined the Marines in 1941 and was trained as a Navajo code  talker. It was intense training. Approximately 400 Navajos trained as  code talkers during the war. Famously, their code, based on the  unwritten Navajo or Dine language, was never broken by the Japanese.  John was ready for deployment when the war ended. He received the  Congressional Silver Medal in 2001 for his service as a code talker. He  was one of the last remaining surviving code talkers.   After discharge from the service, he met the love of his life, Joann  Dennison Pinto, to whom he was married for 65 years until her death in  2017. Together they had two daughters, Flora and Karen, and two sons,  Cecil and Galen.   After the war, he held odd jobs and then, on the advice of a BIA  worker, he moved to Albuquerque to attend the University of New Mexico.  He failed the English exam twice and was in tears that he wouldn't  graduate and would be sent home. He hired a tutor, studied for 10  weeks, and passed. He was 39 when he received his college degree. He  went on to earn a master's degree in elementary education and spent his  career in the Gallup-McKinley County school system.   Senator Pinto was first elected to the Senate in 1976, representing  District 3, comprised of parts of San Juan and McKinley Counties in  northwest New Mexico. The Navajo Nation makes up much of the district.   In order to get to the State legislature, in January 1997, he took a  bus from Gallup to Albuquerque and then began hitchhiking to the State  capitol in Santa Fe. As he waited on a snowy street corner, up pulled  another State senator, Manny Aragon, in his old Cadillac. Senator  Aragon assumed the hitchhiker was a transient and picked him up.  Senator Aragon asked his passenger why he was going to Santa Fe, and  the hitchhiker replied, ``I'm a state senator.'' And off they went to  the beginning of the legislative session together.   During his 42 years in office, Senator Pinto worked tirelessly for  the people of New Mexico and his district. He went into politics  because he saw the overwhelming needs of his people and wanted to make  a difference. He was instrumental in establishing the New Mexico  Department of Indian Affairs and setting up a Tribal infrastructure  fund for much needed projects for Tribes. Over the years, he pushed for  dozens of projects for roads, power lines, water systems, and public  buildings. He was responsible for widening U.S. Highway 491 from two to  four lanes to increase public safety and commerce. During his last  session in the senate, this year, he was successful in securing a $1  million appropriation to begin a Navajo code talkers' museum. He had  fought for this project for years to honor this group of brave and  skillful men who were so instrumental to U.S. success in World War II.   Senator Pinto was a beloved and respected figure in the State senate.  He loved to sing, and every year he sang the ``Potato Song'' to the  chamber in his Native language--a song about planting, growing, and  harvest potatoes on the reservation.   He is not only the longest serving Native American in the New Mexico  Senate, he is one of the longest serving Native legislators in the  county.   On May 17 of this year, Senator Pinto was awarded the first honorary  doctorate of public service to be issued by Navajo Technical University  in Crownpoint, NM. He was immensely proud of that honor.   I have traveled all over the Navajo Nation with Senator Pinto. He  would call me often to talk about ways to help. He cared deeply for his  people and, in return, was loved by them.   Senator Pinto said, ``My philosophy is to be happy, to meet people,  to love people, all the races . . . they all need good water to drink,  good food to eat, a good warm place to stay, and they need good jobs-- that's the basic needs.'' Senator Pinto understood what it is like not  to have the basics in life, and he worked decades to make sure his  people and all New Mexicans had those basics.   Senator John Pinto: educator, statesman, Navajo code talker, brave  Dine warrior, loving husband and father. He is a New Mexico legend and  an American hero. I am proud to have known him and to have called him  my friend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor William Sauble  of Maxwell, NM, for decades of outstanding service to his community.   Bill was born into a ranching family in Maxwell, in North Central New  Mexico, and has lived in that community almost all his life. After  graduating with honors with a bachelor's degree in animal science from  New Mexico State University in 1970, he married his high school  sweetheart, Debbie. He then entered the Navy, where he served 2 years  of Active Duty and 5 years in the Reserve. After returning home from  the Navy, Bill and Debbie took up the family ranching business. They  are the proud parents of two children, Troy Sauble and Tara Sauble  Foster, and grandparents of two grandchildren.   Bill has been a leader in the community and in ranching in New Mexico  all his life. The number of civic organizations that Bill has been a  part of is too numerous to list. He has served as president of the New  Mexico Cattle Growers Association, the Colfax County Farm Bureau, and  the Colfax County Fair Association, and as chair of the New Mexico  Livestock Board, the Agricultural Advisory Committee to the New Mexico  State Land Office, the city of Raton Extra-Territorial Zoning  Commission, and the American Farm Bureau Public Lands Committee.   As a tribute to their ranching skills and acumen, in 2012, he and  Debbie were awarded the New Mexico Farm and Livestock Farm Family of  the Year. That same year, Bill was named Cattleman of the Year by the  New Mexico Cattle Growers Association. Bill has not only worked hard  for his own family ranch, but he has worked tirelessly to improve the  cattle business throughout New Mexico, spending countless hours  traveling the State on behalf of cattle growers and the livestock  board.   Bill has the respect of his community and served on the Colfax County  Commission between 2009 and 2018. As chair of the commission, he  doggedly pursued Transportation Investment, Generating economic  recovery, or TIGER, grants to obtain capital investment for  transportation projects for his county. When Amtrak threatened to  discontinue Southwest Chief service between Dodge, KS, and Albuquerque,  NM, Bill worked with me, the rest of the New Mexico congressional  delegation, and the Kansas and Colorado delegations to secure funding  from Congress and commitments from Amtrak to continue this critically  important service.   Bill is a person of integrity and character. He has a heart of gold.  All his life he gave back to his community and our State. New Mexico  owes him a debt of gratitude. I wish him and his family my very  best.                            ____________________
