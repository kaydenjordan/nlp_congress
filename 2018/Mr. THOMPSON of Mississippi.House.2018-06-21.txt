 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from California for yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the closed rule for H.R.  4760. I was proud to sign on to the bipartisan discharge petition to  force a vote on a Dreamer bill. Passage of this rule will not only kill  that discharge petition, but any hope of this Congress considering the  one bill that has enough bipartisan support to deliver a meaningful  remedy for the Dreamers.   What are we voting on instead? H.R. 4760 is an antifamily bill that  maintains the cruel zero-tolerance policy, limits access to asylum,  shrinks legal immigration, ends the diversity visa lottery program,  abolishes protections for unaccompanied children, and builds President  Trump's border wall.   We are considering only H.R. 4760--a measure that may not have the  votes to pass--to placate the most extreme elements of the Republican  Conference. Mr. Speaker, something is fundamentally wrong and broken in  this body when the will of a handful of extremists overrules the will  of a bipartisan majority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4760, a bill that doubles down on  the President's cruel zero-tolerance policy. This harsh anti-immigrant,  anti-American bill is the realization of the President's cruel  immigration and border security rhetoric and policies.   Remember when the Republican Party used to say it was the party of  family values? H.R. 4760 is focused on families, but not in a good way.  It is focused on separating families, incarcerating families, and  eliminating pathways for family-based immigration.   Remember when the Republican Party used to say it was the party of  law and order? Well, it does take action with respect to local law  enforcement, but not in a good way. It would withhold Homeland Security  and other law enforcement grants from so-called sanctuary cities that,  for the purpose of public safety, seek to foster trust from immigrant  communities.   Law enforcement officials across the country oppose this provision  because it would make their communities less safe. For example, Latinos  in three major cities have been reporting fewer crimes since President  Trump took office, particularly as it relates to domestic violence and  sexual assault.   Finally, remember when the Republican Party used to say it was the  party of fiscal discipline? Well, no more.                                time  1315    If enacted, H.R. 4760, would require billions of taxpayers' dollars  to be wasted on the President's border walls, which I seem to recall  hearing that it will be paid for by the Mexican Government. Now they  want the taxpayers of America to pay for it.   It also waives the paygo scorecard. So now you pull a hat trick. You  spend the money, but you don't score it. So, ultimately, it won't show  up in our budget numbers. Shame on you.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 4760, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings), the retired chief of  police of Orlando, Florida.    Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the  sovereignty of our country, but we also recognize its diversity, and we  all are immigrants. So let's get over it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New York  (Miss Rice).   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that we are wasting  our time today on two bills that are harmful and hyperpartisan when we  all know that the USA Act, introduced by Representatives Aguilar and  Hurd, have the votes to pass on this House floor.   This bipartisan solution would finally provide our Dreamers, college  students, veterans, servicemembers, and business owners with the status  and certainty that they have long deserved. The USA Act would also  effectively secure our borders without wasting taxpayer money on a wall  that would not make us any safer.   The bills being considered today are simply not what most Americans  want. They deny Dreamers a path to citizenship. They abandon our  obligation to protect those fleeing persecution and violence. And they  do nothing to reunite the families who have already been torn apart by  the Trump administration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge you to do the responsible thing, to finally  govern, and allow the bipartisan USA Act to come to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as you heard, H.R. 4760 is fatally flawed. We are here  only today debating it because the Republican leadership was  essentially extorted by extremists within its ranks.   Instead, we should be here debating legislation to give Dreamers a  path to citizenship. We should be here debating legislation to give  safe haven to refugees from Haiti, El Salvador, Sudan, and Nicaragua.   We should be here debating a measure to end zero tolerance and family  separation. Even before the Trump administration created this family  separation crisis, America's image was suffering the effects of the  Trump slump due to the President's inflammatory and cruel immigration  and border security policies and rhetoric.   In fact, last June, the Pew Research Center released an international  survey that concluded that sentiment regarding the U.S. had taken a  dramatic turn for the worse.   What the President and supporters of H.R. 4760 do not understand is  that what makes America great is its people, both native-born and  immigrants.   Let's send a message to the President that we know what makes America  great. Let's defeat H.R. 4760.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  this closed rule and the sham underlying legislation.   As the Ranking Member on Homeland Security, one truism that I hear is  that you do not negotiate with terrorists.   Yet, that is exactly what the House Leadership is asking us to do  today.   When the President said, in September, that he has ``a great heart''  for Dreamers, we were hopeful that a deal could be reached.   However, since that time, the Trump Administration has executed a  ``campaign of terror'' in furtherance of one objective--getting  Congress to pay for a border wall.   On September 5th, the President announced the repeal of DACA.   Then, on September 18th, he announced the end of the TPS program to  give safe haven to Sudanese nationals.   On November 6th, it was ended for Nicaraguans.   Two weeks later, it was canceled for Haitians.   In January, Salvadorans also lost these immigration protections.   Arguably the cruelest, most inhumane tactical maneuver of the Trump  Administration came on April 6th, when the ``Zero Tolerance policy''  was announced.   The ``DACA crisis'', the ``TPS crisis'', and now the ``Family  Separation crisis'' are all crises of the President's own making.   And it is people--it is children--who suffer.   Make no mistake, the measure before us today will not end the  suffering.   Instead of family separation, it offers family detention, an approach  that DHS' own advisory committee has stated is ``neither appropriate  nor necessary for families'' and is ``never in the best interest of  children.''   For these reasons, I urge a ``no'' on this rule and H.R. 6136, an  Anti-Family Values bill.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as  follows:              An amendment to H. Res. 953 Offered by Mr. Polis         Strike all after the resolved clause and insert:        That immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       6135) to limit the separation of families at or near ports of       entry. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary and the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Homeland Security. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6135.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this fake DACA bill, a bill that  we just found out 10 minutes ago that we are not going to even vote on  tomorrow. So all this time, all of the comments we have heard from the  other side about how important it is for us to do our work, well, they  have now decided it must not be too important. We are not going to vote  on it.   So again, this is a fake DACA bill. Obviously, someone has lost their  nerve, because we are not going to even vote on it. So I have trouble  believing that President Trump did not know that his unilateral  decision to implement the zero-tolerance policy in April would result  in thousands of children being ripped from their parents' arms.  [[Page H5488]]    Over the past 6 weeks, Americans have grown more and more alarmed by  the images and voices of children who, with little or no warning or  explanation, were separated from their loving parents. For weeks, both  the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen,  repeatedly refused to accept responsibility for creating this  humanitarian disaster.   They blamed immigration laws. They blamed the Democrats. They blamed  Congress. They blamed parents for the dangerous journey north to seek  safe haven for themselves and their children.   None of this was true. The lies did not fly. That dog didn't hunt.   This past weekend, several of us in the Democratic Caucus flew down  to the border to see for ourselves what was happening to the families.  The President, seeing the news stories of suffering children and  families, succumbed to his base desire for better press and finally  acknowledged what we all know: He is responsible for the family  separation crisis.   The executive order he signed yesterday doubled down on zero  tolerance and provides no relief to the families who have been  separated. Like the executive order, H.R. 6136 does not resolve the  family separation crisis. This does nothing to stop CBP's unfettered  ability to separate families in various situations, including for those  seeking asylum at ports of entry.   The solution H.R. 6136 offers is to detain children indefinitely with  their parents while they wait to be prosecuted in facilities that do  not have to comply with court-ordered requirements for clean drinking  water, toilets, and medical assistance. It ignores the 2016 findings of  the Department of Homeland Security's own advisory committee that  studied the question of family detention. In it, the experts concluded  that family detention is neither appropriate nor necessary for  families, and that it is never in the best interest of children.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to take a stand against the  cruel, inhumane immigration enforcement policies of the Trump  administration by voting down H.R. 6136. We can send a strong message  to the President to stop family separation.   Mr. Speaker, many Members came into this week expecting to consider  and vote on a measure that trades border wall funding for a Dreamer  fix. H.R. 6136 is not that bill.   This legislation would compel the expenditure of billions of  taxpayers' dollars for decades to come on an unnecessary border wall,  while maintaining the cruel zero-tolerance policy, limiting access to  asylum, shrinking legal immigration, ending the diversity visa lottery  program, and abolishing protections for unaccompanied children.   There is nothing profamily or prosecurity about this bill. This is a  fake DACA bill. There were no hearings, no witnesses, no stakeholder  engagement, no markup, not even a CBO score. Now we find out at this  hour that we have been debating a bill that we won't even vote on  tomorrow. I wonder why. It is probably because some other people have  found out that this is a fake DACA bill and probably not worth the  paper it is printed on. But we shall see.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
