 Mr. President, Pfizer released a study this week showing how  antibodies from its vaccines respond to the Omicron variant in a lab.  [[Page S9058]]    The company claims that three doses should provide some protection  against the variant. It also showed that those who had previously had  COVID and recovered demonstrated stronger immunity to the Omicron  variant.   While natural immunity comes at a cost, studies have shown throughout  the pandemic that it works. Those who have recovered from COVID have  significant protection from both catching the virus again and from the  most severe symptomatic infections. While this is not always the case,  and vaccination may improve immunity further, natural immunity is real.  There are data to prove that.   A study conducted in Italy showed that natural immunity is more  effective than vaccines at reducing risk of future infection. Another  study of half a million people in Denmark showed that natural immunity  provides significant, lasting protection against infection.   Finally, a study from three separate hospitals in Israel found that  natural immunity from a previous COVID infection was ``twenty-seven  times more effective than vaccinated immunity in preventing symptomatic  infections.''   This, of course, is good news, especially considering that natural  immunity is combining with vaccinated immunity in the general  population. Recent data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence  Survey shows that almost 92 percent of Americans over the age of 16  have COVID antibodies from vaccination or infection. The vast majority  of Americans have at least some protection against COVID-19--92  percent.   I believe the vaccines are generally safe and effective. I have been  vaccinated, as has my family. I see these vaccines as a miracle, one  that is helping protect many millions of Americans from the dangers  associated with COVID-19.   But I also recognize that millions of Americans are separately  protected, separate and apart from anything else that might be there,  as a result of immunity built up through their natural defenses because  they have previously contracted and then recovered from COVID.   Now, the science shows that this immunity is strong, that it is  effective, and that it is really widespread in America. Astoundingly,  that information is not frequently shared in the media and never  mentioned by the Biden administration. In fact, the administration  makes no effort to recognize natural immunity in its mandates or in its  formal guidelines.   I have asked the Biden administration to provide clarity on its  research on natural immunity as well as meaningfully address the  research being conducted by other countries that show natural immunity  is strong and effective and valid. However, the Biden administration  has yet to respond to my inquiries, inquiries that I asked, reasonably,  to be answered no later than the beginning of this week.   Tragically, tens of millions of Americans have superior protection  against the virus, even from new variants, and yet this administration  would still fire them if they don't comply with the administration's  mandates regarding vaccination. It is as irrational as it is cruel.   I have heard from hundreds of Utahns who are worried about losing  their jobs due to the mandate. They are just a few of the half a  million workers who are at risk of losing their jobs in my State. There  are 45 million Americans altogether who could lose their jobs due to  this unconstitutional, illegal, and immoral overstep.   The Senate, thankfully, recognized that these jobs were worth saving  last night. Fifty-two Senators, including Democrats and Republicans,  stood with American workers. Now, that resolution could, of course,  fail in the House, but it could, of course, be vetoed by the President.  Nevertheless, regardless of that outcome, the Senate's statement last  night rings loud and clear.   Moreover, I hold out hope that the American people are being heard-- they are being heard in the Senate, as evidenced by last night's vote;  they are being heard in the House of Representatives, which will take  up this measure in the coming days.   I hold out hope that the House, too, will pass this measure, and I  implore the President to consider allowing it to become law.   But regardless of what else happens, these workers need immediate,  real, lasting protection from the threat of the mandates. One way to  have a significant portion of these jobs protected is to recognize the  benefits of natural immunity.   So today I am offering a bill that would require that Federal  Agencies recognize, accept, truthfully present, and include natural  immunity in any regulation. This bill does not say that vaccines are  bad or unhelpful; it merely asks the Federal Government to respect  widely available science.   I am glad to be joined in this effort by Senators Braun, Tuberville,  and Sullivan, who are with me as cosponsors.   This bill would keep Americans employed and help us beat the pandemic  in a smart way. I urge my colleagues to support it.   To that end, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration  of S. 2846 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.  I further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, it is important to remember that the fact  that someone holds a government post and is an expert in a field does  not make that person capable of making laws.  [[Page S9059]]    Yes, there are lots of experts in our government; some of them hold  high bureaucratic or other executive posts. It doesn't mean that they  may make laws.   By operation of the Constitution, we are the experts for purposes  relevant to making law. We are the only organ of the Federal Government  that may make law.   And so anytime someone starts to say they are the experts, therefore,  they get to make the law, that is a problem.   To call this a ``nonsense idea,'' to refer to this as an idea that  wastes the time of the American people, ignores the plight of almost 45  million Americans whose jobs are being threatened right now.   My friend and distinguished colleague, the Senator from Washington,  has made an argument against this that doesn't match her conclusion.  What she is stating is not that natural immunity makes no difference-- although her conclusion would seem to suggest that--what she is saying  instead is that someone who has had COVID and recovered and therefore  developed natural immunity could develop additional resistance to  future infections by also being vaccinated.   I understand this argument. In fact, it is an argument that I myself  have used. I had COVID, I recovered from COVID, and I have been fully  vaccinated. But the question is not whether you can gain additional  protection from that; it is whether or not you can look at an original  COVID infection from which someone has recovered and accept the fact  that it offers at least a comparable degree of protection as one can  obtain from a vaccine.   So let's be honest about what we are and are not talking about here.  We are talking about 45 million Americans whose jobs are being  threatened as they head into the holidays at a time when economic  conditions make that unusually intolerable--intolerable as a result of  many conditions that the Federal Government itself put in place.   In all events, this is really a bare minimum of what we can do for  the American people. The burden should not be on them to prove why they  should not be fired--fired by a company being threatened by the  President of the United States with crippling fines. This is cruel. It  is barbaric. It is not authorized by statute or the Constitution. And  in this circumstance, they are ignoring science.    I object.    Mr. President, it is important to remember every Agency  within the Federal Government has an inspector general. Inspectors  general play an important role in every Agency, and they are there for  the purpose of independently reviewing the actions of those who operate  that Agency.   Everywhere you look, these inspectors general serve with  independence, and what we see from them is work product that is  publicly released and can be digested by the public. It is a helpful  resource not only for the American people but also to us personally as  Members of the U.S. Senate, who, in our capacity as Senators, have the  ability and, in fact, the duty of exercising oversight over Federal  Agencies.   With respect to the U.S. Department of Justice, a body that really is  all about law and has a lot of lawyers, to put it very mildly, you end  up with a dichotomy--a dichotomy that can't be found anywhere else.   In every other Federal Agency, the inspector general is able to do  his or  [[Page S9063]]  her job, to conduct research, to do evaluations, issue public reports.  And those reports allow us to exercise our oversight responsibilities.  They also allow the American people to know what is going on in the  Agency in question.   We have got a difference within the Department of Justice. If you are  a lawyer within the Department of Justice, you are covered by the  Office of Professional Responsibility.   Now, I want to point out a couple of differences within the Office of  Professional Responsibility--between OPR, as it is called, and the  Office of Inspector General. These don't reflect any idea that one is  bad and the other one isn't. They are just different.   The Office of Professional Responsibility does operate on a  confidential basis. It operates in secret. And I don't use that term  denigratingly. It is there to perform a specific, highly specialized  role.   See, lawyers have a separate set of ethical rules and standards they  are expected to abide by. The Department of Justice, employing a lot of  lawyers, wants to make sure that there is some degree of consistency  and discipline within the practice of law. They want to make sure that  the relative interests, the privacy, and the professionalism of the  attorney can be balanced with their other investigative demands.   But the inspector general has a different function. The inspector  general isn't there to evaluate whether or to what extent and in what  way any of the highly specialized, sometimes complex, nuanced rules of  professional responsibility affecting lawyers in the practice of law  are concerned. No. The inspector general has a much different role.   So that is one difference, is that one has a public-facing role; the  other one has a private-facing role affecting the individual attorney  or attorneys under investigation.   Secondly--and this one is perhaps even more significant in its  impact--the inspector general operates independently of the Attorney  General. The head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, by  contrast, reports directly to the Attorney General of the United States  and can be fired by the Attorney General of the United States.   This is a big difference, and it is a difference we don't see  replicated in any other Federal Agency--not with lawyers, not with any  other regulated professional class that I am aware of--nor should we,  because, if we were to do that, we would end up creating problems.   So this is not about a perceived inadequacy or a perceived culture of  corruption within the Department of Justice created by the Office of  Professional Responsibility.   That is not at all what I am saying. In fact, I believe the people  who operate the Department of Justice, the lawyers of the Department of  Justice, including those who operate the Office of Professional  Responsibility, by and large do their job and do their job well and  faithfully. But insofar as we allow them to do their job in such a way  that it precludes any ability by the inspector general of the  Department of Justice to penetrate section 8E of the Inspector General  Act insofar as it insulates the operations of the U.S. Department of  Justice from investigation of the sort that we have come to expect and  rely on from the Office of Inspector General, it is going to be a  problem.   Within the Department of Justice in particular, it is a big problem.  I think it would be unwise in any Federal Agency for us to say: OK, the  IG can do anything that the IG needs to do unless there is a lawyer  involved. I think that would be dangerous anywhere because you do have  lawyers involved, but it is especially dangerous at the Department of  Justice because so much of what they do is law, is necessarily  performed by people who are lawyers.   What happens is that we see countless dead ends where, because the  Office of Professional Responsibility has jurisdiction, the inspector  general may not tread. They hit dead end after dead end. In the absence  of evidence of actual criminal misconduct, they can't proceed, and  nobody else can penetrate it. It ought not take evidence of criminal  accountability--of criminal liability to enable the inspector general  to do his or her job.   There are myriad circumstances where someone might engage in  unseemly, unethical, unwise behavior within the Department. Whether  they are lawyers or whether they are not and separate and apart from  whether those deviate from the professional standards imposed by the  State bar of any State, by the rules of any court, or the professional  standards for lawyers operating within the U.S. Department of Justice,  there is an adequate, independent, freestanding interest that the  American people have in being able to gain access to that information.  But, alas, since 1988, section 8E of the Inspector General Act has  precluded his visibility. This needs to stop.   As my friend and colleague the Senator from Illinois stated so well  moments ago, this bill is not either Republican or Democratic; it is  not liberal or conservative. I have been a proud supporter of this bill  and sponsored this bill during a Republican administration because I  believe that regardless of who is in power, we need visibility into the  Department of Justice--visibility that we have in every other Federal  Agency, every one. We lack it here. We lack it here with respect to a  whole lot of what the Department of Justice does because of this  loophole in section 8E. What benefit does this bring to the American  people? To the extent there are benefits there, I respectfully submit,  they don't even come close to offsetting what we lose in terms of  visibility.   We need this. We need it now as much as ever. I implore my colleagues  to support it.    Mr. President, I agree with and echo the observations made  by my friend and distinguished colleague, the Senator from Illinois. I  would like to add a couple of things in response to the observations  and remarks presented by the Senator from Arkansas.   One of the points that he made that I feel compelled to respond to is  he expressed concern about what he describes as potential weaponization  of--I feel compelled to respond, in particular, to his argument that  the Inspector General Access Act could result in the weaponization of  allegations of attorney misconduct within the Department of Justice and  that this could be used in circumstances to intimidate, threaten, and  harass Department of Justice attorneys, including prosecutors, for  either taking or not taking actions in retaliation to the same.   This is always a concern. It is a concern that follows government,  generally. It is, in particular, a concern that follows Federal  prosecutors. It is also not a concern that is unique to the Inspector  General Access Act.   With or without passage of this, there is always a risk of that  happening. Nothing about that risk that we immunize ourselves from by  leaving intact the loophole--and it is a loophole. It is a deliberate  carve-out in Section 8E of the Inspector General Act. It is a loophole.  And my friend from Arkansas is right, it is not unintended. It is  intentionally created. It was there for a reason. I don't mean to  suggest any nefarious motive on the part of those who created it, but  it might have been a shortsighted move at the time. It has, at least,  in time, exposed a vulnerability in Democratic and Republican  administrations alike.   If the risk is weaponizing allegations of professional misconduct  against Department of Justice lawyers, that is not something that we  are immune from today. It is something that I am certain the Office of  Professional Responsibility deals with all the time. It doesn't mean we  make ourselves more vulnerable to it. It is simply by allowing the  inspector general of the Department of Justice to do his or her job  without regard to who is a lawyer and who is not, and without regard to  this special carve-out for this one Federal Agency that makes it  different from every other Federal Agency, including what makes  Department of Justice lawyers different from attorneys in every Federal  Agency.    If the risk is that you might have people who, for bad reasons, might  make up allegations of misconduct, there is no more risk of that with  an inspector general than there is with the Office of Professional  Responsibility.   Here, again, they perform different functions. One of them is there  specifically to deal with the rules of professional responsibility  within the practice of law by Department of Justice lawyers. That is  their focus. Their focus is not a broad one. Their focus does not  include or extend to issuing a public report to inform the public about  abuses of power.   My friend from Arkansas is right. They can go in--if there are  allegations of criminal misconduct and if they have evidence of the  same that they have to pursue--yes, they can do that. That doesn't mean  we don't need an inspector general capable of doing the job of the  inspector general.   He also made the argument that there is no expertise among and  between inspectors general with regard to handling allegations of  attorney misconduct. If that is true, the same can be said of all other  attorneys and all other departments.   My friend from Arkansas does correctly point out that attorneys  within the Department of Justice--at least some of them do--perform  different functions than what we see from attorneys in other Federal  Agencies. That part is true. But that doesn't mean inspectors general  assigned to the Department of Justice don't have the expertise  necessary to investigate the types of allegations that they typically  investigate.   My friend from Arkansas also points out inspectors general tend to  focus on allegations of waste, fraud, and abuse. Yes, this is  absolutely true, and this is absolutely why we should not limit the  access that inspectors general in the Department of Justice have to  attorneys. Remember, this is a department that is all about law. It is  focused on law. It is, therefore, not surprising that they have an  unusual abundance of lawyers.   You know what the Office of Professional Responsibility is not  focused on--is not really their role; they are not involved in; they  are not trained in--their focus is not on issuing public reports and  informing the American  [[Page S9066]]  people of allegations of things like waste, fraud, and abuse,  generally. They have a much narrower function and perform that function  especially well. They perform it laudably, and they do a great job of  doing it.   It is not the same thing as an IG. We need IGs with access to  visibility into the Department of Justice. We don't have it now. We  haven't since 1988. Thirty-three years is long enough. Let's close the  8E loophole and give the Department of Justice inspector general the  access needed.    Madam President, when the Grinch stole Christmas, it was a  relatively simple operation, one that required a relatively simple  solution.   Unfortunately, cold, unfeeling regulations and entrenched  bureaucracies do not have undersized hearts; hearts that can somehow  grow three sizes.   Protectionist laws and labor support shortages do not warm to holiday  cheer.   The COVID-19 pandemic has caused our already deeply troubled economy  problems, and it has caused our already deeply troubled supply chain to  become mired with challenges of all sorts, including truckdriver  shortages, outdated port technology, lack of container storage  capacity, port labor difficulties, and scarce freight equipment.  [[Page S9068]]    In fact, as situations become more dire with the supply chain crisis,  with inflation, and with shortages all over the country, our own  regulations do a whole lot to delay and disrupt solutions that we need  the most at the time we most need them.   Americans are feeling the pain of skyrocketing prices, of shipping  delays, and empty shelves as our laws and bureaucracies fail to respond  to shipping backlogs and labor shortages. The system just is not  working. And President Biden's press release policies have not fixed  it. In fact, they have made it much, much worse.   Like so many problems during his Presidency, President Biden is not  touching them with a 39\1/2\-foot pole.   As the holidays are here, we see the problems continuing to mount.  And these problems needed solutions many, many months ago, but there is  still hope. My STOP the GRINCH Act can help us fix the supply chain  crisis and save Christmas.   This is a bill that focuses on the problems that are actually slowing  down our supply chain, and it is a bill that, if enacted, would get  products off of ships, onto trucks, and into stores so that people in  Utah and across the Nation could get the things they need for everyday  life and especially for Christmas.   By suspending a number of Federal restrictions on ports, on ships,  and on trucks, we can help clear the backlog at our ports, get products  onto shelves, and get the presents under the trees.   The bill will help solve our truckdriver shortage by temporarily  lowering the commercial driver license age to 18 for interstate travel,  and it would waive for 1 year the hours-of-service requirements,  specifically, for those involved in transporting containers into and  out of ports.   The bill would allow for more ships to move more freely and to move  cargo between American ports by waiving the Jones Act, and it would  also allow for Federal land that has been designated as appropriate for  multiple use to be used to temporarily store cargo containers. That  would do a lot in and of itself to help us break our port logjams. A  combination of these things would do so masterfully.   And, finally, my bill would help ease the lack of freight equipment  by allowing excess Department of Defense equipment to be used to help  move cargo. A lot of our problems can be traced to a lack of available  truck chassis, and if we open up those that are deemed excess, we can  do a lot to move freight.   While this bill doesn't address every challenge with our supply  chain, it does provide tangible solutions that, if enacted into law,  would solve real problems right now.   Look, we can end this nightmare before Christmas. We can stop the  Grinch, save our holidays, and secure our economy.   My STOP the GRINCH Act is the start to a merry Christmas and a happy  new year.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate, today, will pass a bill that,  quite literally, gives a blank check to President Biden and the  Democrats. They will use it to pass the ``destroy America bill,'' which  they call Build Back Better.   There is literally a blank check in the bill. It is literally a blank  check. The Senators who gave that blank check don't want you to know  that they did it. They used procedural jiujitsu to hide their votes.  Republicans are hiding behind Democrats, and Democrats are hiding  behind Republicans, but the American people see through it.   They closed the doors, held their noses, and created a new way to  pass bad bills and claimed that it was just this one time.   Mark my words: This bill will be one more tool repeatedly used to  abuse the American people.   This debt ceiling increase is a blank check for the Democrats'  reckless tax-and-spending bill. It should have never happened.                            ____________________     Mr. President, On December 2, 2021, the Senate confirmed  C.B. Sullenberger III to be Representative of the United States to the  International Civil Aviation Union--ICAO--with the rank of Ambassador.  After receiving responses to a series of written questions to the  nominee, I remain concerned about this nominee's approach to the  Ambassador position.   In response to questions on balancing regulation with the need for an  open environment for innovation, Mr. Sullenberger emphasized a position  that favored more regulation at the expense of innovation, as well as  deference to standards established internationally rather than those  generated in the U.S. I do not disagree with the need for essential  safety standards to protect the flying public; however, I believe Mr.  Sullenberger's views cross a threshold in which the automatic  preference for government regulation, particularly international  government regulation, risks stunting the growth of aviation startups  in emerging technology, entrench the largest players, and result in the  exclusion of State and local jurisdictions from conversations in  emerging areas of unmanned flight below the airspace of manned  aviation.   Finally, based on Mr. Sullenberger's responses, I am not convinced  that he would properly advocate that the United States lead at ICAO in  setting standards that would swiftly bring civil supersonic air travel  to fruition. For these reasons, I did not offer my consent to confirm  Mr. Sullenberger unanimously and instead requested a voice vote.                            ____________________
