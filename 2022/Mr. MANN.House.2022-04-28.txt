 Madam Speaker, in preparation for reauthorizing the farm  bill in 2023, I rise today to deliver the eighth installment of my farm  bill impact series, where I am highlighting various aspects of the farm  bill that deserve Congress' awareness and support.   The food aid programs within the farm bill not only support the  nutrition of millions of Americans struggling with hunger, but they  also help to stop global conflicts before they start.   Kansas is the Wheat State, and wheat is the number one commodity used  in U.S. donations for international food aid. If you combine all the  aid destinations, they amount to a top 10 market for U.S. wheat.   The last two farm bills have granted USAID flexibility in  implementing aid programs, which has resulted in the U.S. purchasing  from other countries more than half of the total food we give out.   That is a noble thing to use our resources to help hungry people  overseas, but our government should prioritize the commodities of  American farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers as we carry out  this good work abroad.    International food assistance programs work alongside legislation to  help stabilize countries ravaged by famine and war, reduce terrorism,  and give people an alternative from fleeing their homeland just to find  food.   For instance, I introduced a resolution condemning and prohibiting  the  [[Page H4582]]  use of hunger as a weapon, which some bad actors do in countries  suffering from war and natural disasters. Food aid programs work  alongside the legislation to avert food shortages in such countries,  making it more difficult for anyone to use hunger as a weapon in the  first place.   The farm bill has some excellent programs for international food  assistance that I believe should be reauthorized.   The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust is a special authority in the  2018 farm bill that allows USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance  to respond to unanticipated food crises abroad. I just sent a  bipartisan letter earlier this month asking the President to release  BEHT.   Food for Peace is another great program through which our country  responds to humanitarian crises and food security problems globally.  The idea for this program actually came from a meeting of the Southwest  Kansas Farm Bureau and first appeared in 1954 when President Eisenhower  signed the Agriculture Trade Development and Assistance Act into law.   Today, USDA and USAID partner with organizations to implement Food  for Peace and other food aid programs, stopping global conflicts from  escalating into humanitarian disasters.   The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child  Nutrition Program, named in part for Kansas' own Bob Dole, helps  support education, child development, and food security in low-income,  food-deficit countries around the globe. The program provides for the  donation of U.S. agricultural commodities, as well as financial and  technical assistance to support school meal programs as well as  maternal and child nutrition programs.   I supported this program in fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023  appropriations because it has a proven track record for reducing  hunger, improving literacy in children, and helping provide nutrition  for pregnant and nursing mothers, infants, and preschoolers.   Earlier this month, Nicole Berg, president of the National  Association of Wheat Growers, spoke to the House Agriculture  Committee's Livestock and Foreign Agriculture Subcommittee. In her  testimony, she gave us her eyewitness account, from her 2019 trip to  Kenya and Tanzania, of how international food assistance helps those  people in most need.   She visited refugee camps where the World Food Programme is feeding  98 percent of the 200,000 people there who hail from nine countries.  She said that witnessing U.S. food shipments saving lives firsthand  changed her life.   I want to make sure that, going forward, we use U.S. commodities  while we carry out this good work abroad. If America is going to  conduct international food assistance in an effective way, the Biden  administration is going to have to get a grip on the agricultural  impact of its trade and foreign policies.   Sadly, on an international scale, the Biden administration is turning  a blind eye to agriculture. Russia's assault on Ukraine is one of the  most horrifying humanitarian crises in recent memory, and it has grave  food security implications for Europe.   Ukraine is known as the breadbasket of Europe. It is the third- largest grain exporter in the world. You would think this  administration would want a point person to develop a strategy for  addressing this looming problem, but President Biden still hasn't  appointed either a USDA Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign  Agricultural Affairs or a Chief Agricultural Negotiator for USTR.   The Biden administration has also sat back and done nothing to hold  China accountable for stiffing American farmers out of $16 billion in  the Phase One trade deal, and the President left agriculture out of his  Indo-Pacific strategy entirely.   I, along with American farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers,  am appalled at this shortsightedness. You cannot take food for granted,  which is why the Biden administration needs to wake up and why Congress  must think carefully about the reauthorization of the international  food assistance programs in the farm bill.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series. America's farmers, ranchers, and agricultural  producers are American heroes who are bearing the responsibility of  feeding hungry people around the world.   Their efforts deserve the full support of Congress because the food  security and, therefore, the national security of America hangs in the  balance.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great Kansan, Dennis  Jones, on the occasion of his retirement.   In 1982, Dennis moved from Colorado to Kansas to begin working at the  Tyson Fresh Meats plant in Holcomb. He started out as an hourly  employee on the harvest floor and worked his way up. Soon after proving  himself to be knowledgeable and committed to his job, he moved up to  the role of department head.   Dennis spent time at the Amarillo plant, learning about different  departments and operations within the business, after which he came  back to Holcomb in 2006. He quickly became the new operations manager  and then moved up again to his current role as complex plant manager.   I love Dennis' story because it exemplifies hard work, tenacity,  looking for open doors, and staying committed to a calling that  requires skill, intuition, attention to detail, and relationship- building.   Dennis is the type of guy that embodies grit, agriculture, and  conservative Kansas values.   On his last day at Tyson, Dennis plans to return his computer in the  morning and then spend the rest of the day with the hourly employees on  the harvest floor.   This is a great man whose career and legacy I am proud to honor here  today.   Congratulations on your retirement, Dennis.                            ____________________
