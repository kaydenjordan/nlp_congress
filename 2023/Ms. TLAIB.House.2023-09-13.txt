 Mr. Speaker, I recognize the Jack and Jill of America,  Oakland County, Michigan chapter. For 45 years, they have brought  leadership and mentorship programming for our African-American young  people across Oakland County.   Founded in 1978, the Oakland County chapter of Jack and Jill of  America was the realization of a dream of two mothers, Robbie Johnson  and Bobbye Wilhite, who were looking for more opportunities for their  young children.   The 39 charter members were united in seeking a better quality of  life and opportunities for success for young African Americans in our  community.   The Oakland County chapter is currently one of 262 chapters  nationwide whose programs are centered on education, public service,  health, cultural awareness, and recreation.   Please join me, Mr. Speaker, in recognizing the Jack and Jill of  America, Oakland County Chapter as they celebrate 45 years of service,  education, and excellence in our community.                                SUPPORTING UAW     Mr. Speaker, I am the proud daughter of the UAW. My family  knew the power of being part of a union family.   My dad, who came to the United States with only a fourth grade  education, felt human dignity for the first time when he worked at the  Ford Motor Company in Flat Rock on the assembly line and became a  member of the UAW.   We know this week hundreds of thousands of workers are fighting for a  fair contract to support their families. Their current contract, Mr.  Speaker, expires at midnight on September 14.   The right to strike in our country is the single most powerful tool  to fight corporate greed. In the first 6 months of this year alone, the  Big Three: Ford, Stellantis, and GM made a combined $20 billion in  profits.   The Big Three CEOs received a whopping 40 percent increase in pay  while the majority of workers today are living check to check.   Did you know that since 1948, every single UAW contract had a cost- of-living adjustment, a COLA. In 2009, something spectacular happened,  workers came together and helped the Big Three stay afloat. They  decided to put COLA aside, allowing the companies to create tier  systems.   In 2023, the contract doesn't have the cost-of-living adjustment.  These are the same workers, Mr. Speaker, that sacrificed so much, and  now the Big Three are refusing to have their backs when they are  struggling.   Two workers doing the same job side by side should not be receiving  drastically different wages and benefits due to tiers that were put in  place during the Great Recession. Tier systems have no place on an  assembly line.   These companies should not be able to find loopholes to hire  supplemental workers just so they can get away with paying them lower  hourly wages and no retirement benefits.   Mr. Speaker, my dad in the 1980s was vested in health benefits within  90 days. There was no five, six, seven, eight--I even met a young girl  who said it took her dad 10 years to get on top of that tier.   Folks don't realize the majority of the UAW workers in our country do  not have a pension today. It is 2023. Autoworkers should be able to  retire with dignity. Every worker deserves a guaranteed pension and  healthcare when they retire.   The Big Three need to value their workers more than they value  profits and their own CEO pay increases. They need to do what is right.  They have record profits, and that should result in a record contract.                            FUNDING FOR CHILDCARE     Mr. Speaker, I am, as you know, a proud mother and a proud  founder of the Congressional Mamas' Caucus.   When we passed the American Rescue Plan, I was proud to have included  a Federal investment for childcare; keeping childcare providers open  and ensuring working parents could access childcare when they needed to  go back to work.   The American Rescue Plan included $24 billion in funding for  childcare stabilization, $15 billion alone for childcare programs for  low-income families, and so much more.   This Federal funding was critical in enabling providers to pay  personnel costs and keep programs afloat.   These critical funds are already running out in many States and are  set to expire at the end of this month. Without immediate action here  in Congress to invest in childcare, there will be dire consequences for  working families.   It is estimated, Mr. Speaker, that we will lose 3.2 million slots.  That is 3.2  [[Page H4272]]  million less children that will be able to have childcare nationwide,  and it also includes 56 children in Michigan alone.   As the founder of the Congressional Mamas' Caucus, we are fighting,  many of us Members, for fair and equitable access to childcare, paid  leave, benefits for our care workers, and so much more. We must come  together, Mr. Speaker, to find solutions to address this childcare  crisis.   To all my colleagues, please realize that childcare isn't a luxury.  It is a necessity for working families. Childcare is essential, and the  Federal Government must renew this critical funding.                            ____________________
