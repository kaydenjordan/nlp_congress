 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight during this Special Order to speak in  opposition to H.R. 3755, the Women's Health Protection Act. It is  misappropriately named, given the many unborn girls, women, and boys  that will be murdered should this act be enacted.                                time  2030    Earlier this year I spoke on the floor defending the Hyde amendment  as Democrats, for the first time in over four decades, decided to  remove it from the fiscal year 2022 appropriations.   Tonight, I am back to fight for the rights of the unborn as Democrats  attempt to push through another item of their radical pro-abortion  agenda. This legislation is extreme. It would impose nationwide  abortion on demand until birth laws making every State a late-term  abortion State.   This bill would create a national standard to allow for abortions for  any reason and at any stage of pregnancy. It would abolish virtually  all past, present, and future pro-life State laws, ultimately  overriding State laws that prevent discriminatory abortions based on  the identity of the baby--of the yet-to-be-born child--and based on a  baby's sex, race, or disability.   We should be putting forth legislation supporting a culture that  values life and respects the health of mothers and children, born and  unborn. We must always be a voice for the voiceless, and that is why I  will continue to fight for the lives of the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for leading this Special  Order. It is a righteous cause.
