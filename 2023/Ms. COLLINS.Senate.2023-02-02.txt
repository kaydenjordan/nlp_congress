 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Asylum  Seeker Work Authorization Act of 2023 with my colleagues Senator Sinema  and Senator King. It is my hope that the changes proposed by our bill  will lessen the burden on the budgets of communities hosting asylum  seekers, while allowing these individuals and their families to support  themselves as they want to do, bringing needed skills to the cities and  towns in which they settle.   This legislation would allow individuals seeking asylum at ports of  entry to be eligible for employment authorizations starting 30 days  after applying for asylum, provided their applications are not  frivolous; they are not detained; and their identities have been  verified, with their names run through the Federal Government's  terrorist watch lists. This change would allow asylum applicants to  work, support themselves, and contribute to society without being as  dependent on assistance from local governments while their claims are  being adjudicated. By encouraging asylum seekers to enter the country  through official ports of entry, this legislation would also help  create a more orderly asylum application process.  [[Page S236]]    Under current law, asylum seekers must wait extended periods of time  after filing their applications before they are allowed to obtain work  permits. This waiting period places the burden of care for these asylum  seekers onto communities across the Nation. One such community is  Portland, ME. Over the span of the last 2 years, a historic number of  asylum seekers have arrived in Portland after crossing our southern  border. Currently, hundreds of asylum seekers are being housed in  emergency shelters and other facilities by the city of Portland. These  asylum seekers could give a much needed boost to Maine businesses that  are facing labor shortages--our State's unemployment rate is just 3.8  percent--but the lengthy work authorization process prevents these  asylum seekers from getting jobs, even to support themselves.   While the Federal Government has provided assistance to Portland and  other communities around our country dealing with a surge in asylum  seekers, it would be a better solution if those seeking asylum were  able to join the workforce and achieve self-sufficiency as quickly as  possible while awaiting the outcome of their cases.   I encourage my colleagues to support this win-win solution that will  allow asylum seekers to work, as they are eager to do.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Collins):   S. 265. A bill to reauthorize the rural emergency medical service  training and equipment assistance program, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
