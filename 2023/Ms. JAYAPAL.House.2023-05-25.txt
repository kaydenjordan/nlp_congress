 Mr. Speaker, this is an outrage. Republicans want to  drive us over the cliff into default and catastrophe, cut off  healthcare and Social Security payments, and drive up interest rates so  more people are homeless and hungry.   Five Republicans could join all 213 Democrats and lift the debt  ceiling right now, but they went home.   My constituent Amy called me absolutely terrified that she is going  to miss her Social Security payment. If that happens, then she can't  pay her rent and won't have a place to live.   Amy heard Republicans yesterday say the quiet part out loud. They  said: We don't want to negotiate with our hostage.   Well, Amy is your hostage. She and millions like her--teachers,  firefighters, seniors, veterans--are demanding that Republicans stop  playing games with their lives.   Donald Trump presided over the third largest deficit increase in the  debt ever because they spent almost $2 trillion on tax cuts for the  wealthiest billionaires, and now they want poor and working people to  pay that bill.   Stop it. Pass a clean debt ceiling right now.                            ____________________
