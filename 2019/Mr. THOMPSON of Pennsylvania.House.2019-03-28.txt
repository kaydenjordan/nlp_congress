 Mr. Speaker, in the 1970s, Congress  made a commitment to provide a free and appropriate education to  students with disabilities.   While we have made tremendous progress, thanks to the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act, we have also failed to fully fund the  cost of special education that was promised by Congress at that point  in time.   Congress promised to cover 40 percent of the extra cost of special  education, but we have never come close to fulfilling that promise. In  fact, current funding remains only at 14 percent of the targeted  amount.   Mr. Speaker, that is shameful.   This means our students and schools suffer, it means that the  programs will be cut, it means schools won't be able to recruit and  retain qualified teachers, and above all else, it means that students  with disabilities will not be able to succeed, not without the  appropriate high-quality services they deserve.   That is why I proudly cosponsored the bipartisan IDEA Full Funding  Act, which would mandate gradual increases in IDEA funding to reach  that full commitment made by Congress of 40 percent by fiscal year 2029  and each subsequent fiscal year.  [[Page H2890]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and uphold the  promise to provide students and schools with the resources they need.                            ____________________
