 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  which I think would be very destructive.   Earlier this year, the former head of Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral  Phil Davidson, warned that the Chinese Communist Party could make a  move on Taiwan within the next 6 years. Within the next 6 years, we  could be facing a crisis unlike anything we have seen in our lifetime.   This assessment was concurred by the chief of naval operations, the  commandant of the Marine Corps. And the idea that we are going to do an  across the board 10 percent cut, an indiscriminate across the board 10  percent cut to the Pentagon, at a time when we are facing a serious  national crisis, I think, makes absolutely no sense.   The ranking member pointed out the irony and tragedy that the other  side is proposing to spend $3.5 trillion on social welfare spending,  and then telling us that we have an explosion in defense spending, when  defense spending, as a percentage of GDP, is still at lows relative to  what we spent during the Cold War.   Does anyone seriously believe that by releasing a press release or  engaging in a security partnership with the Taliban we somehow ended a  war? Does anyone seriously believe that the struggle against Salafi  jihadism is somehow over because we have surrendered in that struggle?  Absolutely not.   And the reason and the irony that defense spending has gone up, if  you can even compare the Obama cut in real terms to the Reagan defense  build-up, it is not because of missiles or ships or bombs, it is  because of increasing personnel costs, right? It is healthcare and  retirement costs.   So as an empirical matter, what you are arguing is simply not true.  As for spending too much money on defense, what costs a lot of money is  when you stumble into war on someone else's terms, and the best way to  do that is to project weakness. Weakness invites aggression. We can  achieve peace only through strength.                                time  1700
