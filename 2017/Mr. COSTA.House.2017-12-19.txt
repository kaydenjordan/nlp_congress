 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand with the DREAMers, both  in the San Joaquin Valley and throughout our country. Protecting our  DREAMers is the responsible, moral, and just thing to do.   The majority of Americans want legal protection for our DREAMers, and  Congress must listen. I have been listening to those who have visited  my offices, university presidents, religious organizations, my  constituents, who simply want us to provide legalization for these  individuals who have come to this country at an average age of 6 years  of age. This is the only country they have ever known.   Passing the Dream Act is a priority for Democrats and has strong  support for many Republicans. We just need to vote on the bill.   I am a cosponsor of the Dream Act, and I have joined nearly 200 of my  colleagues signing a discharge petition to bring this legislation to  the floor. I now call on my Republican colleagues to do the right thing  and allow a vote on the Dream Act.   I will continue to advocate for policies that protect our DREAMers. I  urge our DREAMers to continue to make their voices heard, as they have  across this country, and to urge people in Congress to do the right  thing.   We must stay vigilant in our efforts to protect these individuals,  and we as Americans understand what these individuals mean to our  country.   Pass the Dream Act now.                            ____________________
