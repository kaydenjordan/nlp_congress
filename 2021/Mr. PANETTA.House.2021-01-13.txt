 Madam Speaker, a week ago was the culmination of carnage  caused to our country by this President. Four years ago, he said he  would stop such devastation. Instead, the President has continued to  debase our democracy with assaults on our elections and incitement at  the Ellipse and the battery at our Capitol.    American exceptionalism is not guaranteed; we must always work to  grow it. That includes our work today to hold President Trump  accountable. American carnage started with this President. A vote for  impeachment will stop it for our posterity.
