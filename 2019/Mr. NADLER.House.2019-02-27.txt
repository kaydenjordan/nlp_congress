 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H2243]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background  Checks Act of 2019.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that today we are considering H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. We have promised the American  people that Congress would take steps to reduce gun violence, and this  bill is a critical first step toward doing so.   During the past 4 weeks, as the Judiciary Committee, and now the full  House, have discussed the issue of gun violence, I have cited grim  statistics. Nearly 40,000 Americans lost their lives because of guns in  2017. In fact, every day in America, on average, 34 people are murdered  with a firearm, and more than 183 people are injured in an attack.   Gun violence of this magnitude is a distinctly American problem. A  country-to-country comparison is shocking. For example, in 2011, the  United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71;  Portugal, 142; and Japan, just 30. The United States, that year, about  35,000.   A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that,  compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate  in the United States is 25 times higher. Even when you adjust for  population differences, Americans are disproportionately killed by gun  violence.   Almost 25 years to the day after the Brady Act was first implemented,  expanding our current background check requirement to cover virtually  all gun transfers is one of the steps we must take to address this  crisis.   Under current law, only licensed firearms dealers are required to  conduct a background check before transferring a gun to another person.  This means that gun shows, online sales, and other private sales can  completely evade this vital tool for ensuring that guns do not get into  the wrong hands. It is time to close this dangerous loophole.   This bill would make it illegal for any person who is not a licensed  firearm importer, manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any  other person who is not so licensed without a background check.  Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be  required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary  background check before the transfer could be finalized.   The bill also provides a number of exceptions to this requirement,  including gifts to family members and transfers for hunting, target  shooting, and instances of imminent death or great bodily harm.   The FBI's internal assessment demonstrated that checks processed  through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, often  called NICS, are approximately 99.3 percent to 99.8 percent accurate,  and in 90 percent of cases, the background checks are completed within  90 seconds. H.R. 8 will provide an accurate and speedy mechanism to  help ensure firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.   There is no reason to continue to make it easy for people who are  legally prohibited from possessing firearms to acquire them by  circumventing the background check process. H.R. 8 would close this  dangerous loophole and save many, many lives. That is why I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of this vital legislation today.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass), the chairperson of the Crime, Terrorism and  Homeland Security Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), the chief author of this legislation and the  chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I will point out that the bill says:         Nothing in this act . . . shall be construed to authorize       the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a national       firearms registry.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell).    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).  [[Page H2251]]         Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the distinguished majority leader.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out the penalty in  this bill that is being cited as $100,000 is in fact $1,000.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Yes, I have one more.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), who is the distinguished author of the bill.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, we have heard the other side here say that some people lie  on the forms; they are not prosecuted. Well, that may be, and maybe law  enforcement ought to prosecute more people.   That doesn't negate the necessity for the bill. It doesn't negate the  fact that too many people who shouldn't have guns, who are mentally  unstable, who have committed crimes, and who are abusers get guns  because they buy a gun at a gun show or not from a registered gun  dealer and, therefore, do not have to undergo a background check.    Everyone who gets a gun should have to undergo a background check,  with the few exceptions we put in the bill.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 8 is legislation that is long overdue for passage  by this body and for enactment so that we can take a critical step  overwhelmingly supported by the American people to protect us from gun  violence.   We have had too many moments of silence, too many expressions of  sympathy, too many deaths--39,000 deaths from guns last year--but  little action here in Congress on this issue.   Today we act. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this vital  bill to start taking back our streets from the killers, to start  blocking people who shouldn't have them from having guns.   Save our lives.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment because  it is fatally flawed and would undermine the public safety impact of  the bill.   The amendment would add an exception to the background check  requirement for anyone who is a participant in the TSA PreCheck program  by the Department of Homeland Security.   By exempting those who have obtained a TSA PreCheck from the  background check requirement, the amendment would allow many dangerous  people, including people with disqualifying mental health conditions  and some criminal convictions, to obtain firearms without a background  check.   The current background system, the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System, was designed specifically for background  checks pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.   The system, often called the NICS, contains the information that no  other Federal database contains, and the TSA does not check NICS when  determining a person's eligibility for the TSA PreCheck program.   Although participants in the TSA PreCheck program have had their  criminal backgrounds vetted, the standards for approval and  participation in the TSA PreCheck program are not the same and, in many  cases, are more lenient than those which prohibit firearm possession  and purchase.   For example, the NICS searches the records of people prohibited for  mental health reasons during a firearms background check. These mental  health reasons, though, are not part of the TSA PreCheck search.   As of January 31, there are more than 5.7 million of these mental  health records in the NICS indexes, making it the second most populous  category of prohibited records for firearm purchase.   Because the Department of Homeland Security does not have access to  these mental health records for TSA PreCheck program purposes,  individuals who have been adjudicated to be disqualified to own  firearms for reasons of mental condition or have been committed to any  mental institution may be accepted under the TSA PreCheck program but  are not legally able to possess a gun. Under this amendment, they would  be legally exempted from the background check requirement and would be  able to get a gun, despite being legally prohibited from doing so.   The TSA bars people convicted of certain criminal offenses, such as  rape or aggravated sexual abuse, from participating in the TSA PreCheck  program only temporarily. It doesn't restrict people convicted of these  serious crimes for more than 7 years, and it wouldn't bar people  released from prison for these crimes within the last 5 years.   Under current law, these felony convictions prohibit possession or  purchase of a weapon, but, under this amendment, people released from  prison within the last 5 years for these crimes could get the weapons-- could get the weapons.   The TSA PreCheck program does not have a minimum age requirement, and  this amendment would allow people under the ages of 18 and 21 to  purchase firearms illegally and without a NICS background check.   Furthermore, the TSA PreCheck program only requires a background  check every 5 years, and the PreCheck system may not be advised that a  firearms disqualifying offense has taken place after the initial  PreCheck background check has occurred.   In other words, you get the TSA PreCheck, and if you are convicted  afterwards, within 5 years, for a very serious crime, under this  amendment, you could get the gun, although, legally, you shouldn't  without a background check, and the TSA PreCheck program would not have  picked it up.                                time  1400    These shortcomings of the TSA PreCheck system make it an inadequate  and dangerous substitute for a NICS background check. To prevent  potentially prohibited purchasers from obtaining firearms, licensed  dealers should conduct background checks on participants in the  PreCheck program as they would with any other member of the public.   The blanket exception of this amendment for anyone who participates  in the TSA PreCheck program would undermine the bill's ability to  enhance public safety because it would enable people convicted of  serious crimes, people adjudicated to have serious mental illnesses, to  purchase guns without a background check, even though the TSA system  would not pick them up.   The TSA system is not a substitute for the background check system.  It doesn't pick up many of the crimes. It doesn't carry it forward. And  it is not a substitute for this system.   To pass this amendment, which would allow people who have qualified  under the TSA PreCheck program not to have background checks, would  allow a lot of people who shouldn't have guns to have them. Therefore,  I strongly oppose this amendment, and I ask that my colleagues vote  ``no'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, which clarifies  the bill's exemption for the background check requirement in instances  of imminent threats or great bodily harm would apply to someone who is  at risk of committing suicide.   The amendment makes clear that the limited number of exemptions to  the background check requirement include circumstances in which someone  feels that they are a danger to themselves. They may temporarily  transfer a firearm until the danger has passed. This is a limited and  reasonable exemption that only applies to those who fear they will harm  themselves, so that they may temporary surrender their weapon.   I listened to the gentleman from Georgia, and I appreciate he doesn't  think that the amendment goes far enough or solves the underlying  problems of the bill, as he sees it. But even from his point of view,  it should go in the right direction. So I urge everyone to support this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I simply want to say I support this amendment, which  clarifies that great bodily harm is included in the exception to the  bill's background check requirement, includes domestic violence, sexual  assaults, stalking, et cetera. It is a good amendment. I urge people to  support it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Speaker, I reserve a point of order.    Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, let's remember what we are dealing with.  We are dealing with the fact that current Federal law with respect to  firearms background checks is dangerously limited and flawed because  background checks are only required for sales by licensed gun dealers  and that many, many people get a gun at a gun show or from someone  else. Something like 20 percent, I think the figure is, or 25 percent  of gun sales escape background checks.   So all kinds of people who may be criminals, who may be mentally ill,  and who may be domestic abusers who shouldn't have guns get guns, and  that results in lives forfeited. It results in people killed.   This bill goes a long way toward solving that by saying we are going  to require background checks of everyone who gets a gun, with some  exceptions, with some reasonable exceptions which are in the bill.   Now, along comes this motion to recommit, which is a total red  herring having nothing to do with the purpose of the bill, and says  that, if someone fails a background check because he is illegally in  this country, you should report that to ICE.    First of all, if he fails a background check because he is illegally  in the country, that means the system knows he is illegally in the  country. It means they already know that.   So what is the point of reporting him? He has to be in the system as  illegally in the country in order to fail the background check because  of section (g)(5). So we already know that, and this is totally  circular, number one.   Number two, this is just a red herring to try to mix up the  immigration issue with the gun violence issue, and they really have  nothing to do with each other.   Number three, for 8 years, we couldn't get a hearing--not a hearing  in a committee--on this bill or on any real bill to stop the plague of  handgun violence in this country.   Madam Speaker, 150 people killed in Great Britain, 95 in Austria or  wherever, 39,000 in the United States--no one will tell me that  Americans are 10,000 times as mentally ill as Europeans or Japanese.  The problem is we don't have adequate protections on guns. This bill  goes in the direction of doing it, and they want to sabotage the bill  with a phony issue raised by this MTR.   Now, there is an issue. If people fail the background check for  various reasons, then you can make a case it should be reported to  local law enforcement agencies. Mr. Cicilline has a bill to do just  that. I am going to yield to him in a second. But the fact is it has  nothing to do with this bill. It is just an attempt to sabotage this  bill.   If you believe that we ought to cut down on the plague of gun  violence in this country, that we ought to save lives, that we ought to  get rid of all these people who shouldn't have guns having guns, and  that we ought to have background checks in sensible situations, then  vote against the motion to recommit and for the bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, let us not accept this red herring. Let us  not divert. Vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and ``yes'' on the  bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to the instructions of the House  on the motion to recommit, I report the bill, H.R. 8, back to the House  with an amendment.
