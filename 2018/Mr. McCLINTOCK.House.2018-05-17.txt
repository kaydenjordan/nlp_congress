 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, farm subsidies, essentially taking money  from taxpayers to inflate the price of their own groceries, was never a  good idea. They are the poster children of corporate welfare since the  vast proportion of them go to large corporations, not to small family  farms. And 60 percent of American farms get no subsidies at all,  contradicting the claim that somehow American agriculture couldn't  exist without them.   We spend about $20 billion a year subsidizing about 40 percent of our  farms. That is $160 a year out of the direct taxes of an average family  in America, and that doesn't include the cost to consumers from higher  prices. As we just heard, the sugar program alone costs taxpayers $3.7  billion a year in higher sugar prices. That adds about $30 more to  their grocery bills.   Subsidies hurt taxpayers, they hurt consumers, and they even hurt  farmers in the long run. The decline in farm economy since the last  farm bill ought to warn us we are doing something wrong.   Prices are signals sent by consumers over what they want to buy and  the amount that they are willing to pay. If left alone, they tell  producers what consumers want more of and what they want less of. If  consumers want less soybeans and sugar and more wheat and cabbage,  prices for soybeans and sugar decline and prices for wheat and cabbage  increase. Producers respond by planting less soybeans and sugarcane and  more wheat and cabbage, unless--unless--the government distorts those  price signals through subsidies. Producers end up planting more of what  consumers don't want and less of what they do. Thus, producers are  artificially induced to perform below their potential productivity.   Many of the subsidies today are in the form of crop insurance.  Farmers get heavily subsidized insurance to guarantee them profits for  their products. Who pays those subsidies? Taxpayers. What is insurance?  It is the monetization of risk. It is the way markets assign a dollar  value to the risk that one undertakes in any human enterprise. The  higher the risk, the more expensive the insurance.   By subsidizing crop insurance, we once again corrupt the price  signals that farmers need to make rational decisions. If crop insurance  for soybeans is expensive, the market is warning farmers not to rely on  soybeans. If taxpayers subsidize the cost of that insurance to lower  its price, we are encouraging very risky behavior by masking the cost  of that risk.   Once again, that produces bad outcomes for taxpayers, for consumers,  and ultimately the farmers themselves because they have been led toward  higher risk by distorted price signals.   Nor is subsidized insurance necessary for farm loans. Bankers loan to  other non-subsidized parts of the farm economy without subsidized  insurance. There are no good arguments for continuing these subsidies.  Most farmers don't get them right now. Those who do tend to be major  corporations and not family farmers.                                time  1600    Now, my amendment preserves subsidies for the next 2 years and then  gradually phases them out over the next 10 years, assuring that  producers who have grown dependent on these subsidies have plenty of  time to adjust their operations. But at the end of this 12-year  process, we have a much more efficiently functioning agricultural  market that is accurately responding to the needs of consumers rather  than to the whims of government bureaucrats.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would remind the ranking member that  the reason the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill ended up costing us more is  because we ended up adding a whole new series of subsidies to it.  Experience is important to heed.   New Zealand has four times more dependency on agriculture than the  United States--they are four times more dependent--and it once  maintained an extensive subsidy program just like ours. In 1984, New  Zealand ended those subsidies. Well, what happened? Farm productivity  rose, farm earnings rose, farm output all rose.   What did New Zealand farmers who opposed the ending of subsidies say  once those subsidies were removed and the economy responded? The  Federated Farmers of New Zealand says that it ``thoroughly debunked the  myth that the farming sector cannot prosper without government  subsidies.''   Mr. Chairman, it is long past time to debunk that same myth in our  own country, restore to consumers the power to command what producers  grow, and restore to producers the accurate price signals they need to  maximize their productivity in a free and undistorted market.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4184]]         Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment does two things: It  increases from 20 percent to 70 percent the percentage of able-bodied  adults in SNAP that would be required to comply with the work  requirements in the bill, and it requires the use of the E-Verify  system to assure that work training is available only to legal  residents in this country who are legally entitled to work.   H.R. 2 provides for a requirement that work-capable, nonemployed  adults look for work or train for work in order to receive SNAP  benefits. That is important. When Maine implemented a work requirement  for able-bodied welfare recipients, they found that 84 percent of this  population left the welfare rolls and, within a year, had doubled their  effective pay. Alabama saw the same results.   Unfortunately, H.R. 2 would only engage about 20 percent of this  population--20 percent. This amendment would boost the work  participation rate to 70 percent of able-bodied adults in the program.  It does so by implementing changes recommended by The Heritage  Foundation.   H.R. 2's work requirement affects parents of children under age 6.  This amendment reduces the exemption to those with children under age 3  but with an important difference: H.R. 2's requirements extend the work  requirements to both spouses of children under the age of 6. This, in  effect, is a marriage penalty that treats married couples as if they  were single.   The amendment I offer applies to only one spouse in the family,  allowing the parents to share domestic and work responsibilities  between themselves in any manner they feel is appropriate. This  recognizes, encourages, and rewards marriage as the stable and  nurturing environment that it is.   H.R. 2 allows States to waive the work requirement in geographic  areas defined by them with higher-than-normal unemployment rates above  6 percent. This amendment deletes the waiver for an important reason:  Where there is high unemployment, there is also more reason to  encourage job training and job searching in order to equip recipients  to compete in tighter job markets. Sidelining these individuals is  self-defeating both for them and for the local economies.   Also, the amendment removes the ability of States to define these  geographic areas in a manner that would defeat the work requirement in  the first place.   H.R. 2 also allows States to exempt 15 percent of the able-bodied  population from this work requirement. This amendment takes it to 5  percent.   Finally, this amendment requires that SNAP recipients be screened by  the E-Verify system to assure that training is going only to those who  are obeying our laws and are legally in this country. This requirement  is essential to the enforcement of our immigration laws. Otherwise, we  are spending taxpayer money to train illegal immigrants whom Federal  law prohibits from being employed.   This amendment transforms the work requirement in H.R. 2 from an  empty and symbolic gesture covering just one-fifth of the able-bodied  population receiving food stamps to more than 70 percent.   It rewards, rather than penalizes, married couples and recognizes  that the shared responsibilities of marriage are one of the single  greatest factors in reducing poverty. Children born into homes with  single parents are five times more likely to live in poverty. It is  time our policies reflected the importance of marriage in protecting  our children.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my time to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), my colleague on the House  Budget Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
