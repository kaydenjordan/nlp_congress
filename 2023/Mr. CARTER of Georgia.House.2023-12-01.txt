 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  William ``Lou'' Reed on being named Rincon's new fire chief.   Reed started with the Rincon Fire Department in November of 2011 and  has served as a firefighter, an engineer, and a captain.   Lou was appointed to be the Rincon fire chief on September 11 after  having led the department on an interim basis for 20 months.   He recently received a bachelor's degree in fire administration and  is working toward a master's degree in public health administration.   As the new chief, he has already created goals to reduce the number  of fires and fire-related deaths by analyzing response data, providing  safety education programs to residents, and enforcing State and local  fire prevention codes.   Lou has already shown he has the skills of a true leader. I am  excited to see what he accomplishes further as the new Rincon fire  chief.                            ____________________
