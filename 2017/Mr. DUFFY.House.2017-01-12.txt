 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Add at the end of title III the following:       SEC. 318. PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL                     PROPERTY.         The Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) is amended       by inserting after section 4t the following:       ``SEC. 4U. PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL                     PROPERTY.         ``The Commission is not authorized to compel persons to       produce or furnish algorithmic trading source code or similar       intellectual property to the Commission, unless the       Commission first issues a subpoena.''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 40, the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the support of the gentleman  from Texas and his insight in this amendment. I was a prosecutor in a  former life, and we care a lot about due process, making sure that the  government can't take something from a private individual just because  they want to take it.   As an American, I know that protecting intellectual property is a  cornerstone of our free enterprise system. That is why I am concerned  about the CFTC's rule on automated trading,  [[Page H425]]  which takes the unprecedented step of requiring a wide array of market  participants engaged in algorithmic trading to maintain a source code  repository and make it available for inspection by the CFTC or the  Department of Justice without a subpoena.   Now, this is highly sensitive source code. This is intellectual  property that helps the functionality of our marketplace, and to think  that this kind of sensitive data can be taken by the Federal Government  without a subpoena should shock our conscience. There are times when  the government should get this information; but if they should have it,  they should be able to use a subpoena and lay out the cause and the  case for why they need to have it.   That is not just my only concern. But the CFTC is potentially going  to be taking this source code from all different market players and  holding it in a warehouse or a repository, and so we have a concern for  hacking. It has been a big conversation as of late. But instead of a  foreign entity hacking in to individual companies, they just have to  hack the CFTC and they get all the source code. Just think of the  malicious things that can happen if you have the source code of market  players, how you can disrupt it, how you can take it down. It is  absolutely frightening.   So I think we should have great pause, take a little time to reflect  on our Constitution, and continue to respect and support due process,  which means, if the government wants this information, they should have  a subpoena, lay out their case, and that is the avenue by which they  get it, not just because they want it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    I appreciate the gentleman for yielding.   Again, as an American, when the government wants to take very secure  intellectual property and data, we do have this belief that they should  be able to get a subpoena to access it. Again, we don't have a  disagreement that the CFTC, in circumstances, we want them to get  access to this information.    But highly sensitive intellectual property, we think,  similar data, should require a subpoena.    If the gentleman would yield, is the gentleman saying that  if the government just wants highly sensitive and intellectual property  they should be able to go in and just ask for it and require it to be  delivered?    But it is the government.    But it is the government.    But it is the government.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to clarify that in the proposed  rule there is no requirement for a subpoena. That doesn't exist. Now,  they might have told you that they want to reform that rule, but that  is not the way the proposed rule stands today. Again, if our government  wants information from the private sector, we all believe they should  have a subpoena for it, number one.   Again, on the concern of hacking, I wrote the Chair of the CFTC and  asked for additional information about how they can preserve and  protect this very sensitive information, and, in essence, they said: We  can protect it because we say we can protect it. That doesn't give me  great confidence.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. LaMalfa    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in  part B of House Report 115-3.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of title III, insert the following:       SEC. ___. DETERMINATION OF PREDOMINANT ENGAGEMENT.         Section 2(h)(7)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.       2(h)(7)(C)), as amended by section 314 of this Act, is       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(v) In determining whether a person is predominantly       engaged in a business or activity for purposes of clause       (i)(VIII), there shall be excluded revenues and assets that       are, or result from, any transaction that is entered into       solely for purposes of hedging or mitigating commercial risk       (as defined by the Commission for purposes of subparagraph       (A)(ii)).''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 40, the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a simple, straightforward  one, bringing clarity to the law and relief, again, to the end users,  such as farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers that use swaps to hedge  commercial risks associated with their business, including volatile  markets and price fluctuations on a day-to-day basis. This critical  financial tool allows them to do their jobs and provide products in an  affordable and accessible manner, keeping consumer costs low.   Discussing Dodd-Frank, Congress always intended that these end users  should not have to clear the swaps entered to hedge these commercial  risks and provide the end-user exemption to that end.   The Commodity Exchange Act defines as a financial entity a person  predominantly engaged in certain financial activities. The Fed's  rulemaking when defining financial activities repeatedly states the  rule is for the purpose of title I; therefore, bringing it in to title  VII was something they did not have in mind when issuing their  definitions of predominantly engaged for financial entities. Therefore,  financial entities cannot rely on this end-user exception.   However, because of a catchall in the definition of financial  entities, end users who engage in successful hedging programs could be  regarded as financial entities, thereby creating barriers and  unnecessary restrictions to their business operations. This completely  turns the concept of being an end user in title VII on its head.   My amendment today ensures end users will not lose their ability to  rely on the end-user exception, which is a clearing requirement due  simply to the position performance of a transaction entered into solely  to mitigate commercial risk.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H426]]
