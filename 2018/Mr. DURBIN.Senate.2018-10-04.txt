 Mr. President, today I want to honor my friend Frank  Libby for his extraordinary service to my home State of Illinois. Last  month, after 42 years of service to the brothers and sisters of the  Union Brotherhood of Carpenters, Frank Libby retired.   A decade after the Great Chicago Fire, in 1881, a group of 35  carpenter leaders met in a Chicago warehouse and hammered out an  agreement to form a single, unified union. The United Brotherhood of  Carpenters was born. Ever since, the Carpenters union has been a  leader, building and growing communities by bringing countless skilled  women and men to the construction industry.   Frank Libby is an outstanding part of that rich history. Throughout  his career, Frank held a variety of positions. As a member of Local 10,  he has served as warden, recording secretary, business representative,  financial secretary-treasurer, and president for the past 24 years. In  2008, Frank became the 24th president/executive secretary-treasurer of  the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters, representing working  families across 72 counties throughout Illinois and eastern Iowa.   Under Frank's leadership, the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters  flourished, becoming the largest building trades union in the State of  Illinois with a membership in the tens of thousands. He fearlessly  confronted the unprecedented challenges facing the union and had the  courage to make the necessary decisions enabling the union to not only  survive the great recession, but actually thrive.   If that wasn't enough, Frank Libby also served as a member of the  executive board of the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters and the  Chicago Federation of Labor and as a trustee on the Carpenters' Welfare  and Pension Fund and the Carpenters' Apprenticeship Training Fund.  Frank also served on the Illinois State Council of Carpenters'  executive board and as a past board member to the Chicago Convention  and Tourism Bureau, but his legacy will be realized by the generations  of carpenters who, because of his leadership and vision, will receive  fair wages and healthcare for their family. Frank Libby has given the  gift of peace of mind to countless future carpenters and their  families, who can retire with dignity because of the benefits Frank  fought to secure. They will know that Frank's hard work earned and  ensured a safe work environment where carpenters return to their  families at the end of each workday.   I want to congratulate Frank Libby on his distinguished career and  thank him for his outstanding service to the people of Chicago. I  especially want to thank Frank's wife Gail and their daughter Cynthia  for sharing so much of their husband and father with our community. I  wish him and his family all the best in their next chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this year, the Young Women's Christian  Association, YWCA, celebrates its 160th anniversary in the United  States. It is the world's oldest and largest multicultural women's  organization, fighting at the forefront of the most critical social  movements, from women's empowerment and civil rights to affordable  housing, pay equity, violence prevention, and healthcare.   The YWCA traces its origins to the battlefields of the Crimean War in  1855. Formed in London, philanthropist Mary Jane Kinnaird and her  friends, the organization helped nurses returning from the war find  homes and improved the lives of those caught up in the Industrial  Revolution. Women were working long hours in poor and unsafe  conditions, and they had few opportunities for healthy activity. The  YWCA's early hostels evolved to become the organization we know today.   By 1858, the year we are honoring, the YWCA crossed the Atlantic and  created residences in New York and Boston. It opened its first U.S.  boarding house for female students, teachers, and factory workers in  1860. Since forming in the United States, the YWCA has grown to include  2.6 million members and 300 local associations in the country.   Throughout history, the YWCA has been the vanguard for social change.  In the 1870s, it held the first typewriting classes for women.  Typewriting was considered a man's job at the time. During the same  time, it also opened an employment bureau for women. Normal, IL, had  the first YWCA student association in 1873. In 1877, the YWCA Chicago  started providing medical services at the homes of the sick. This is  the precursor to the Visiting Nurses Association.   In the 1890s, the first African-American YWCA branch opened in  Dayton, OH. A YWCA opened for Native Americans in Oklahoma during the  same time. The YWCA was helping immigrant women adapt to the United  States in 1909 with bilingual instruction. These were revolutionary  changes.   In 1919, the YWCA convened the first meeting of doctors, the  International Conference of Women Physicians, with attendees coming  from 32 countries to focus on women's health issues.   The YWCA Convention in 1920 was an early advocate for the 8-hour  workday with no night work and the right of labor to organize.   The YWCA also fought on the frontlines of civil rights. In 1915, the  YWCA held the first interracial conference in the South in Louisville,  KY. In the 1930s, it worked toward desegregation and encouraged its  members to speak out against the violence against African Americans. In  1946, the YWCA adopted its interracial charter, a full 8 years before  the U.S. Supreme Court decided against segregation. The Charter  declared, ``Wherever there is injustice on the basis of race, whether  in the community, the nation, or the world, our protest must be clear  and our labor for its removal, vigorous and steady.''   From opening Atlanta's first integrated public dining facility in  1960 to being a sponsor of Dr. Martin Luther King's March on  Washington, the YWCA continued the fight for equality.  [[Page S6538]]  In 1970, the YWCA created `One Imperative' to end racism wherever it  exists.   The modern YWCA is just as committed to the same principles that it's  always had and is needed more than ever in the times we live in right  now.   The YWCA's annual Stand Against Racism campaign and its racial  justice programs and services engage 140,000 people every year. It  serves more than 122,000 women annually with economic empowerment  programs, including job training, financial literacy, salary  negotiation, and leadership development. And it continues to offer  housing and childcare programs, helping build a supportive foundation  for families.   More than 900,000 women and families participate in the YWCA health  and safety programs and services, including domestic violence and  sexual assault services, fitness programs, and health resources. These  programs often are critically important to communities of color where  high-quality health wellness programs are not readily available.   For twenty years, the YWCA has hosted a Week Without Violence to help  end gender-based violence with workshops, community service  opportunities, and public awareness events.   As we celebrate the YWCA's 160 years of work here in the United  States, we are reminded daily that we need to continue the fight  against racism, sexism, and economic inequality. And the YWCA is  leading the way--just as it did 160 years ago.                            ____________________
