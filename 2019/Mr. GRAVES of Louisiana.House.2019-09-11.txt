 Madam Chair, I thank the ranking member for  the recognition to talk about this legislation.   Madam Chair, we are talking about legislation that has to do with  energy policy and energy production. We are talking about the goals  here, as I heard different speakers talk about protecting our fisheries  and our environment. I heard speakers talk about protecting our  military mission, those military servicemembers and that military edge  and the technology we have. I heard people talking about jobs and the  threat of spills.   Madam Chair, I support those objectives, and I know that this may  sound counterintuitive: This bill undermines the very objectives that  it is purported to advance. Let's go through them. Let's go through  those things.   Number one, talking about the environment, that this bill will cause  damage to the environment and it will undermine ecological  productivity. Madam Chair, if you take a look at this graphic right  here, you probably think this is where energy infrastructure is. You  probably think that is what this is. This depicts the intensity of  energy infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico from the Texas coast to  right there in Alabama.   In reality, oh, my goodness, look at that, if it is not red snapper  landings. This is actually where the fish are. This shows the landings  of where the fish are. This actually increases ecological productivity  by creating habitat for fisheries.   I heard a speaker on the other side talk about how there was  devastation of fisheries in the State of Florida after the spill, the  disaster in 2010. In 2011, the State of Florida had 117 million pounds  of fisheries. In 2011, that was more than the fisheries they produced  in the most recent year recorded. Let me say that again. In the  immediate aftermath of the spill, in 2011, there were more fisheries  landed worth more money than there was in the most recent year  recorded, which is 2017.   I hate to sit here and continue to undermine all these narratives,  but let's go on.   We are saying that this bill is designed to protect our environment.  Actually, Madam Chair, you can look at statistics, and as far as I  understand, they use cars and airplanes and have air-conditioning in  Florida. That requires oil and gas. Since you are producing it and need  it, the safest way to transport is to produce it domestically and then  put it in a pipeline. That is not my statistic; it is from the National  Research Council.   Once again, Madam Chair, you are not protecting habitat; you are  actually preventing habitat from being established. You are not helping  ecological productivity; you are undermining it. You are not protecting  the environment or preventing spills; you are providing a greater risk  for that. My friend from California (Mr. McClintock) made reference to  the Valdez spill. That was a boat.   Let's go on to the other one, the military. I heard a speaker say:  Oh, we can't have energy production here because that is going to  prevent our ability to fly and practice with weapons in the Gulf of  Mexico.   Madam Chair, when we go into war and go up against adversaries, do we  say: Hey, we need you to take that building down so my missile can  shoot straight in?   No. That is absurd. You operate under real conditions, which  includes, in some cases, obstructions.   I want to make reference here that we are talking about thousands and  thousands and thousands of square miles. You can produce here with  very, very little surface infrastructure. Most of it is subsea, having  zero impact.                                time  1530    Now, Madam Chair, I heard somebody talking earlier about 2006 and how  Congress stepped in and provided a moratorium. Yes. But do you know  what that moratorium is provided in exchange for? Moving the Military  Mission Line to the east.   There was an agreement. The 181 leasing areas, that was agreed to. We  actually added more production areas in exchange for a temporary  moratorium. But what is being proposed now is a greater threat to the  environment. It is putting a moratorium in place, and it is not doing  any type of balance.   We can step in and protect our military mission, we can protect our  environment, and we can have jobs and energy production in the United  States.    Madam Chair, I also heard talk about the  Land and Conservation Water Fund and, yes, the irony of the fact that  there is legislation that the chair pushed that permanently authorizes  the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Legislation moving it permanently  funds it at $900 million; $150 million a year goes to the Historic  Preservation Fund.   But in reality, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is not limited  to $900 million. It is not. I have heard people say it over and over  again. That is not accurate.   There is an additional 12.5 percent that comes from revenue sharing  that  [[Page H7629]]  also goes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, putting it over $1  billion a year. Plus, you add $150 million from the Historic  Preservation Fund.   Plus, just to put it in perspective, Madam Chair, when you add up  just between 2011 and 2016, $55 billion--$55 billion--was generated for  the U.S. Treasury from energy production on Federal lands and waters.   Madam Chair, that doesn't just fund the Land and Water Conservation  Fund and Historic Preservation Fund. That funds our veterans' benefits.  It funds environmental programs. It funds healthcare for our elderly.  It funds early childhood education. It funds infrastructure.   This, according to the Government Accountability Office, is one of  the largest nontaxed streams of revenue. And we are talking about  stopping it.   Production doesn't go on in perpetuity. You need additional layers.  It takes 10 years to go from leasing to production, so we have got to  start planning now to produce safely to ensure we can continue to have  a vibrant economy, jobs, to continue having a safe environment.   This bill undermines the very objectives that it was purported to  advance. Madam Chair, I urge objection to this uninformed legislation.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I am in its current form.    Madam Speaker, we sat here for hours talking  about the objectives of legislation to impose a moratorium on offshore  energy production. I have heard the advocates for the legislation talk  about the objectives of protecting our environment and preventing  energy spills of oil. I have heard advocates talk about the objective  of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I have heard objectives discussed  regarding creating jobs, perhaps green jobs, and ensuring that we have  economic activity here in the United States.   Madam Speaker, I share those objectives. This bill doesn't do it. So  let's go one by one and address the various objectives and address the  facts associated with them.   Number one: Madam Speaker, when we stop producing energy  domestically, we don't stop using energy. We don't change the form of  energy. What happens is, as statistics prove, as the Department of the  Interior officials have reported to the Natural Resources Committee, we  increase our dependence upon imports from other countries.   When you import energy, they have lower environmental standards. You  release greater greenhouse gas emissions, and by putting it on a ship,  you have a greater chance of spilling the energy. The safest thing you  can do is produce it domestically and put it in a pipe.   Secondly, Madam Speaker, you have heard the discussion about ruining  coastal habitat. You have heard the discussion about ruining coastal  communities.   Madam Speaker, when you look at the statistics, in 2017, California  produced about 209 million pounds of seafood; the State of Florida,  about 111 million pounds; the State of South Carolina, about 10.5  million pounds. Louisiana, which has four times more energy production  in the offshore than all other States combined, we produced 90 times  that of South Carolina, or 900 million pounds of seafood, valued at  more than $360 million.   In addition, these funds go toward--the revenue sharing under  offshore energy production goes to the resilience of your coastal  ecosystem and the resiliency of your communities.   Madam Speaker, I shudder to think down the road, if we stop offshore  energy production, what happens when a hurricane comes in and  devastates communities, because we put a moratorium in place preventing  the availability of revenues to protect those very communities.   In regard to the emissions, the United States has reduced greenhouse  gas emissions more than the next 12 countries combined. We have done it  without mandates, without requirements--more than the next 12 countries  combined.   A BOEM report says emissions could increase in the absence of a new  OCS leasing program. Madam Speaker, that was a report under the Obama  administration. This bill does just that. It prevents additional  leasings in new areas.   Case in point, when the State of California tried to impose their  renewable energy portfolio, they have increased their dependence upon  oil from Saudi Arabia. In New England, they have imported natural gas  from Russia. These policies don't make sense as evidence has proven.   In regard to creating jobs, when President Obama was in office in  2011, one-half of this Nation's trade deficit, one-half, was  attributable to us importing oil from other countries. Those countries  do not have the safety record, the safety regime we have in the United  States.   I join the Laborers' International Union of North America's president  in believing that this bill is purely for political purposes. The union  members working in the energy sector are being targeted. Instead of  working to enact real job-creating infrastructure legislation, union  members see their jobs, once again, being denigrated and belittled.  Energy development can coexist with environmental stewardship.   Lastly, Madam Speaker, this motion to recommit is about gasoline  prices. A run-up in world oil prices is effectively a tax on every  American family's discretionary budget, except that the  [[Page H7637]]  money goes to the OPEC cartel rather than the U.S. Treasury.   Let me say that again. A run-up in world oil prices effectively  attacks every American family's discretionary budget, except that the  money goes to the OPEC cartel rather than the U.S. Treasury. Those  aren't my words. Those are the words of Senators Cantwell, Menendez,  Markey, and Schumer.   This amendment ensures that this legislation does not result in a  disproportionate impact on the poor by raising gasoline prices and  energy access to Americans across the board; of course, again,  disproportionately impacting those of low income.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
