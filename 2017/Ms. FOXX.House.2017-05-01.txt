 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Roby for leading this  Special Order, but a special thanks to you for introducing H.R. 1180,  the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017. Everyone in the private  sector, men and women, are grateful to you for doing this.   I may repeat some of the things that some of my colleagues have  already said, but, Mr. Speaker, they bear repeating.   This proposal, this bill, is about freedom, flexibility, and  fairness. Workers, not the Federal Government, should have the freedom  to choose what is best for them and their families. Hardworking men and  women need more flexibility to balance work, life, and family, and  there should be fair workforce policies that don't put private sector  employees at a disadvantage to those in the public sector.   Across the country, there are moms and dads who wish they had more  flexibility to make their child's baseball game or dance recital,  students who can't find enough time to study for college finals while  working full time, and individuals who are struggling to care for an  aging relative. There are many workers who want flexible work  arrangements instead of rigid 9 to 5 schedules so they can attend to  their personal needs.   This bill will improve the quality of life of many Americans by  offering workers eligible for overtime pay a choice between paid time  off and cash wages. Outdated Federal labor rules currently prohibit  private sector workers from exercising this choice.   More than 30 years ago, Republicans and Democrats amended the law to  give public sector workers the option of comp time. This was a positive  step, but it created double standards. It is time to ease this double  standard by leveling the playing field between private sector employees  and government workers when it comes to workplace flexibility. That is  exactly what this bill does. It is a commonsense idea that should  receive the support of workers on both sides of the aisle.   As my colleague from Alabama said, the decision to choose comp time  is completely voluntary and requires a written agreement between the  worker and employer. Those who want to continue receiving cash wages as  overtime pay are always free to do so. It also explicitly prohibits  employers from coercing workers into electing comp time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is, again, about fairness, and it is so  difficult for me to understand how Democrats would be opposed to that.  We should have the same rules in the private sector as we do in the  public sector. I think that Democrats have run out of excuses not to  provide workers this choice. All we are doing here is giving a choice.   No one, Republican nor Democrat, should think they know what is best  for individual workers and their families.   Mr. Speaker, when we vote on this bill this week, I hope all of our  colleagues will come to their senses and see that they are  discriminating against the private sector by denying them the  opportunity to take their overtime as comp time and that they will vote  with us.   Again, I thank my colleague from Alabama for her leadership on this  Special Order, but particularly her willingness to introduce this bill  and take the lead in promoting it.    Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Charter Schools Week,  I want to highlight my recent visit to Success Academy Harlem 1, which  is 1 of 41 charter schools in the largest and highest performing public  charter school network in New York City.   Success Academy current serves 14,000 students and has more than  16,000 families on its wait list. Founded in 2006, Harlem 1 is Success  Academy's first school, and founder Eva Moskowitz served as its first  principal.   With a focus on developing the whole child, Success Academy aims to  make its schools joyful places of learning. I am here to tell you that  these schools are getting results, and they are joyful.   Five of the top five schools in the State of New York in math and two  of the top five schools in English are Success Academy schools.   Every student in every school deserves an excellent education, but  unfortunately we are falling far short of that goal as a nation.  Thankfully, innovative charter schools like Success Academy Harlem 1  are providing thousands of families with new hope and opportunity.                            ____________________
