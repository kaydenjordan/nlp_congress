 Today, the Purple Heart Homes nonprofit is celebrating  their 750th completed project.   Headquartered in Statesville, North Carolina, Purple Heart Homes is a  nonprofit founded by combat-wounded veterans to help aging and service- connected disabled veterans in their housing needs.   Founded in 2008 by John Gallina and the late Dale Beatty, they  established Purple Heart Homes with a mission to help those that have  given so much to our Nation.   Whether it is building ramps or constructing new homes, they step in  to fill the void in programs designed to serve our deserving veterans.   I congratulate John and his diverse team on their incredible  accomplishments to serve our heroes.   I recently met with John and his team, and while they have unique  backgrounds that they bring to this mission, they are all united by one  thing: They are called to serve.   I congratulate John and his team, and I also congratulate Purple  Heart Homes.                            ____________________
