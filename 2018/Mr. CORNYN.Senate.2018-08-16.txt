 Mr. President, today we will confirm two more appellate  judges, bringing our total to 26 since the Trump administration began.  This has been one of the hallmarks of the President and of our agenda,  and it is critically important. So I thank the President, as well as  all of our colleagues who have worked so hard to fill these vacancies  on our Nation's courts.   There have been many accomplishments this last year and a half, but  perhaps the greatest has been the new, energized state of our economy.  This is a direct, tangible impact on the quality of life of all  Americans. The Declaration of Independence designates, among the  unalienable rights, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. I like to think that by getting our foot off the neck of the  economy, by repealing unnecessary overregulation, and by cutting taxes  and letting people keep more of what they earn, we are pursuing those  unalienable rights on behalf of the American people--certainly the  pursuit of happiness.   The Labor Department reported earlier this month that unemployment  had fallen to 3.9 percent in July, which is close to the 18-year low  that was achieved in May of this year. One of the highlights of the  jobs report was that high school dropouts and others who struggled  during the Obama-era recession are doing significantly better. Their  unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent, the lowest since the government  started collecting data on those without a high school diploma. Of  course, this is pointed out particularly at a time when labor is in  short supply; that is, there are a lot of good-paying jobs for which  there are not trained workers who could qualify for those jobs. I think  it makes it incumbent on us, at all levels of government--Federal,  State, and local--to do more to help train workers so they qualify for  these good, well-paying jobs that right now are going unfilled because  of a shortage of trained workers. That is one of the imperatives, I  believe, of a tight job market caused by a booming economy.   The July report showed that the economy grew by 4.1 percent in the  second quarter. That is an incredible number. The economy is literally  on fire, and that is a good thing for the American people. All of this  positive economic news is complemented by the tax reform package I  mentioned a moment ago that we passed last December, which has become  perhaps the biggest game changer of all, opening doors and offering new  opportunities for American workers.   In order to make the rates of taxation in America competitive  globally, we lowered the corporate rate from 35 to 21 percent. This is  something that Democrats, like President Obama, as well as Republicans,  have supported in the past, recognizing that we were chasing investment  overseas and any earnings on investments overseas were not coming back  to the United States to be invested here in workers and infrastructure.  This was a self-inflicted wound that we have now cured. We also were  successful in helping working families by doubling the child tax  credit.   One of the tangible benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is that  more than 700 companies have used the tax savings to benefit their  employees as well as their customers. They have announced pay raises  and 401(k) retirement match increases. Utility bills have been cut for  seniors and those on fixed incomes, because when investor-owned  utilities got their tax rates lowered, they had to lower rates that  they charge on utility bills.   This legislation has resulted in bonuses and other benefits for  American workers, perhaps too numerous to mention, but it is worth  mentioning because, unfortunately, in the fog that represents the news  coverage that comes out of Washington, DC, sometimes these tangible  benefits are overlooked. It is important for us to demonstrate that we  are keeping faith with the American people--the people who sent us  here--and we are doing the work of governing in a way that directly and  tangibly benefits each of them--something, again, that gets lost in the  fog that emanates here in Washington.   But it is not just the economy that deserves mentioning. The  judiciary is the third and coequal branch of government. I believe the  confirmation of  [[Page S5680]]  Federal judges is one of the most important things that we do here in  the Senate. It is not something the House of Representatives has any  role in. Under the Constitution, it is our responsibility to provide  advice and consent on Federal judges, and who gets selected as a  Federal judge and the judicial philosophy they have is one of the  reasons why I believe President Trump won the election over Hillary  Clinton. People understood, based on a list that the President made  public before he was elected, the type of people he would be looking at  to fill these judicial vacancies--judges who would faithfully interpret  the Constitution and would say what the law is, not what their personal  policy preferences might be or what they wish the law to be. That is  our job, and that is the reason we run for election in the political  branches of government--the executive and legislative branches.   Judges were, in the words of Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist  papers, called the least dangerous branch. By that he meant that their  job was to figuratively call balls and strikes. In other words, they  were not seen as policymakers, or else they never would have given  judges lifetime tenure. They are insulated from politics. It is  precisely because they are insulated from politics that they should  perform the critical but limited role of interpreting the Constitution  and laws as written.   Of course, the most notable example of a judicial confirmation we  have had during the last year and a half was the confirmation of Neil  Gorsuch to fill the seat left by Justice Scalia. But now, on September  4, Chairman Grassley on the Judiciary Committee has announced that we  will begin the hearings on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to succeed  Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.   But it is not just the Supreme Court that is important. It is the  courts below the Supreme Court that do the day-to-day work of the  Federal judiciary, including the 26 appellate judges that I mentioned  earlier. That includes Texans like Don Willett, Jim Ho, and Andy  Oldham, all of whom now serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Of course, we should mention the very talented district court judges  whom we have confirmed as well--three of them from Texas. Karen  Scholer, David Counts, and Fernando Rodriguez are three of those  talented district court judges whom we have confirmed.   Overall, we have confirmed more than 50 of President Trump's judicial  nominations. Again, I believe this is one of the most important jobs we  perform here in the Senate.   Third on my list of accomplishments that I want to talk about today I  alluded to a moment ago when I talked about the economy taking off. One  of the most important things we have done since we have been here  during the Trump administration is repealing overly burdensome, Obama- era regulations through something called the Congressional Review Act.  We have used this device 16 times to eliminate agency rules that were  sometimes snuck in during the waning hours of the Obama administration.   On top of that, we repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board,  or the IPAB, under ObamaCare. This will allow senior citizens and their  families to take better control and greater control of their own  healthcare decisions without being subjected to the whims of unelected  bureaucrats. Also, we made ObamaCare voluntary by eliminating the  individual mandate, which is a tax on middle-income and low-income  people who couldn't afford to purchase the ObamaCare policies.   ObamaCare's main problem was that it represented perhaps the most  intrusive government mandate into the lives of the American people by  saying: You don't have any choices anymore when it comes to your  healthcare. You must buy this government-approved healthcare policy,  and, by the way, it doesn't make any difference if it has coverage that  you don't want or can't afford. You have to buy it. If you don't buy  it, we are going to fine you.   We have repealed that tax on low-income and middle-income Americans,  and we truly have made healthcare more available by allowing a market  to be created where people have choices. Kudos to our Secretary of  Labor, Mr. Acosta, who worked with the administration to provide for  access to healthcare policies across State lines, and the  administration, the Health and Human Services Secretary, recently  announced that people can buy policies on an annual basis that are  subject to renewal that provide them greater choice and flexibility.    This is part of creating a market, which is the best regulator of  all, as opposed to government. People wonder why conservatives believe  Big Government is a bad thing sometimes, and it is precisely because  when government gets bigger, our freedoms shrink in proportion to that  growth in the flow of the Federal Government.   That is pretty important, repealing those regulations and eliminating  the individual mandate. The fourth major accomplishment, I believe, is  providing relief to America's community and midsized banks and credit  unions, which have been hit hardest by some of the one-size-fits-all  rulemaking approaches under the Dodd-Frank bill.   Again, one of the problems about legislating and regulating in  Washington, DC, is we live in a big and diverse country, and one-size- fits-all doesn't work or, if it does, it often has collateral damage.  In this case, while we were aiming at the excesses of Wall Street,  small banks and credit unions were the collateral damage. What that  meant is, consumers didn't get access to the credit they needed, small  businesses didn't get access to the loans they needed in order to start  a business or to grow a business.   The next thing I want to mention, in terms of the accomplishments of  the last year and a half, has to do with our commitments to  servicemembers and our military as well as veterans. We have restored  America's defense with the greatest investment in the military in  decades, including the largest troop pay raise in nearly 10 years.   If you think about all the things the Federal Government does, not  all of them are equal. Some are more important than others. I would put  at the top of the list providing for our common defense because it is  that defense of our freedom and our liberty and our way of life that  makes possible all of the other things we enjoy, the blessings of  liberty we enjoy as Americans. Making sure our military is properly  funded and that we take care of the troops who wear the uniform of the  U.S. military is the most important job of the Federal Government.   Then, it is important to keep our commitment to our veterans when  they take off that uniform. We did that this year in passing the VA  MISSION Act, which makes significant reforms to the Department of  Veterans Affairs, strengthening the healthcare and community care  options that are available to America's veterans.   We are all aware of some of the scandals in the VA system, where  veterans have had to travel hundreds of miles or wait months to get  access to care. We have addressed that with the VA MISSION Act, which  reinforces Veterans Choice. In other words, if you would rather go see  a healthcare provider in your local community, if the wait is too long  to be seen at a dedicated VA facility, or, if you have to go too far to  get to a VA facility, you can get access to a local healthcare provider  in your community, and the VA will pay for it. To me, that is a really  important element of our veterans' healthcare system.   Last, but certainly not least, is our sixth achievement of this last  year and a half during the Trump administration and Republican  majorities in both Houses. We have taken steps to rebuild and protect  our local communities. We passed nearly $147 billion in disaster relief  for storms like Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Texas 1 year ago  this month.   On top of that, we have enacted the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking  Act, which provided resources to fight the rape kit backlog and improve  school safety by a bill I sponsored called Fix NICS to make sure people  who are illegally disqualified from purchasing or possessing firearms  are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and prevented, if  possible, from getting access to those firearms.   These are just a handful of ways we are doing what we told the  American people we would do if they would entrust us with the great  privilege of being stewards of that public trust. We put money back in  Americans' pockets. We have rolled back regulations that  [[Page S5681]]  have made their lives easier. We strengthened the military. We have  given healthcare flexibility to our veterans. We have protected our  communities from harm.   Of course, there is more work that needs to be done. Just before the  State work period concluded this last week, the Senate voted to proceed  to a conference on the farm bill. This bill is of great importance to  the people of my State. City dwellers may not fully appreciate it, but  according to the 2012 census, agriculture employs one out of every  seven working Texans. With 28 million Texans, that is a huge number of  farmers and ranchers directly affected by what we do in the farm bill.   What people don't realize, however, is that nutrition programs--not  agriculture funding--account for almost 80 percent of the cost of the  farm bill. This includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,  formerly known as food stamps.   Although I was proud to support the Senate's version of the  legislation, I was somewhat disappointed it did not include stronger  reforms to some of these nutrition programs, including work  requirements for people who are able-bodied or training requirements  for people who need additional training or community service for people  who can't work or don't want the training but at least provide some  service to their local communities.   I appreciate what the House has done to provide for those work  requirements in the bill that my friend Chairman Conaway included in  the House version. These reforms are not last-minute additions. There  was a long, thorough process leading to the introduction of the House  farm bill. Chairman Conaway held more than 20 hearings on these  nutrition programs, including some during the Congress, and afterward  he put together some very commonsense work requirements that were based  on broad stakeholder input.   During this record of low unemployment across the Nation, it is not  unreasonable to try to use this opportunity, which comes only once  every 5 years, to take a look and ensure our Federal dollars are being  spent wisely, that able-bodied adults are getting the training they  need in order to earn good pay, and that Federal assistance is only  used to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves.   A scholar from the American Enterprise Institute, Michael Strain,  wrote about this recently. He wrote that the question of ``[w]hether  there should be a mandatory work component in public policies designed  to assist low-income households is in part a question of . . .  economics,'' but it is also moral and philosophical as well.   Whom should we expect to work in our society? Should a healthy person  in the prime of their life who doesn't have young children at home be  working--yes or no? In other words, does that person owe some share of  his or her energy, ability, and intelligence to the rest of society  from which we all benefit, including them? Some think it is nobody's  business but the individual's whether they work or not and still  receive these benefits, but I disagree with that.   When the question involves Federal benefits that are paid for by all  taxpayers, whether to work or not is no longer just a private, personal  decision. We as a country have decided that part of our social contract  with each other will be providing a safety net where needed, and that  is important. The flip side is, to benefit from that safety net, there  also ought to be certain obligations. In other words, you can't have  rights without responsibilities. One of them should be to work, if you  are able to do so.   While I wish the members of the conference committee my best as they  try to reach consensus on the farm bill, I encourage them to take  another look at Chairman Conaway's ideas on work requirements. I hope  my colleagues will be willing to revisit this issue in the conference  committee on the farm bill.   I yield the floor.
