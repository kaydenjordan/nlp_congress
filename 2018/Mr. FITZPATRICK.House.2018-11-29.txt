 Mr. Speaker, we recently returned to Congress after  celebrating Thanksgiving, a time when we pause and reflect on the many  blessings that our community bestows upon each one of us.   Today, I am proud to recognize an outstanding citizen from Bucks  County, Pennsylvania, who worked tirelessly for over three decades to  ensure residents were able to enjoy the holiday surrounded by friends  and good food.   Lois Wheeler of Lower Makefield began serving Thanksgiving meals to  the underprivileged in our community in 1980. Known as ``Bountiful  Harvest Feasts,'' Lois hosted between 125 and 200 people yearly at the  Masonic Lodge in Fairless Hills.   Lois' dedication to serving the hungry began in high school. While  attending Neshaminy High School in Langhorne, Lois saw a classmate who  was not able to afford lunch. Wheeler was so moved, she would bring him  sandwiches to eat. When they were not available, she would give away  her own lunch.   Lois is truly beloved in our community. Her continued generosity has  earned her the nickname ``Sister Wheeler,'' and she has also been  called the ``Mother Teresa of Bucks County.''   While Lois' health prevented her from participating this year, her  legacy of service to Bucks County cannot be erased. We applaud Lois for  her charity and generosity, and wish her and her husband, George, all  the best.                                time  1045   Recognizing the Lingohocken Volunteer Fire Company and the Council Rock                     School District's ACHIEVE Program     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize students and  public servants in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who recently teamed up  to spread awareness of fire safety and vocational training.   Last month, the Lingohocken Volunteer Fire Company met with students  in the Council Rock School District's ACHIEVE program, which is geared  towards providing students with special needs the tools and skills  needed for self-sufficiency.   The Lingohocken Volunteer Fire Company's presentation, which took  place in a fire safety trailer to simulate real-life emergencies, was  aimed  [[Page H9698]]  at preparing students to respond to a fire hazard.   I would like to thank Council Rock ACHIEVE staff John Engelhardt, Dan  Bartleson, Steve Ruane, and David Marcinkowski for their work in  preparing Bucks County students for the future.   I would also like to thank Lingohocken Chief David James, along with  firefighters Gary Davis, Charlie Vaughn, Ted Middleman, and Glenn  Forsyth of Newtown Township Emergency Services for their dedication to  our community.   At a time when our fellow citizens in California are experiencing  devastating wildfires, firefighters' skills and expertise are  appreciated and so sorely needed. We need them now more than ever.                        Recognizing Lindsey Spritzler     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a student  from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, for her outstanding achievements.   Lindsey Spritzler, a senior at North Penn High School in Lansdale,  was recently selected as a member of the 2018 All-National Honor Mixed  Choir and is performing at their annual conference this week in  Orlando, Florida.   Lindsey was one of only 240 individuals across our country to be  selected to join the vocalist team. This is certainly no small feat. In  order to even qualify, Lindsey had to be selected for the Pennsylvania  All-State Chorus and place near the top of her section.   I applaud Lindsey for her hard work and exceptional talent.   We are also proud to recognize Music Department Chair Matthew Klenk  for his commitment and dedication to our community and for his service  to the North Penn School District as well.   On behalf of our entire community, we all look forward to seeing what  Lindsey will accomplish in the future. We know they will be great  things.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, every day throughout the private  sector, businesses obtain feedback from their customers to improve  their products and improve their services. However, this is much less  common--if not nonexistent--within the Federal Government, where  agencies could be doing far more to improve the customer service  experience of every citizen in this country. The latest American  Customer Satisfaction Index found the Federal Government is near the  bottom of the list when it comes to customer satisfaction.   H.R. 2846 requires certain Federal agencies to collect voluntary  feedback from individuals about their interactions with the government.  People who interact with government agencies will have the opportunity  to give feedback on their experience. Using feedback provided by the  public, agencies will figure out just how effectively they are at  serving the American people.   The result, Mr. Speaker, will be a win-win. The American public  receives better services and customer care, while agencies achieve  greater impact and ability to fulfill their missions.   H.R. 2846 also sets guidelines for agencies' solicitation of  voluntary feedback from the public. The questionnaire will be no longer  than 10 questions, and the response must be anonymous. Agencies are  required to work with the General Services Administration and the  Office of Management and Budget to formulate their surveys to ensure  feedback is both reliable and useful.    However, customer feedback on its own will not improve the  relationship between the American people and the Federal Government.  H.R. 2846 requires agencies to report publicly on the voluntary  feedback that they collect.   This report will include information about the feedback received and  a description of how the agency will go about improving customer  service. The Government Accountability Office will also create customer  experience scorecards for the agencies to foster accountability.   I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 2846.
