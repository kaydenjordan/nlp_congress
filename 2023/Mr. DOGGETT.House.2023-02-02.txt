 Mr. Speaker, I was prepared to vote for this resolution.  Socialism is clearly not the best path for America.   Who wants to be associated with Stalin and the others whom this  resolution denounces?   They were really thugs who were masquerading as socialists.   But when the promoters of this worthless resolution rejected the  Takano amendment to protect Social Security and Medicare, their goal  became clear.   They have a long history of rigorously attacking most every new  social initiative--originally claiming that Social Security would  ``enslave workers'' and ``Sovietize the country''--and they have long  denounced Medicare as ``Socialism.''    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On February 2, 2023, on page H637, in the second column, the  following appeared: initiative--originally claiming that Social  Security would enslave workers and sovietize the country--and they  have long denounced Medicare as socialism.      The online version has been corrected to read: initiative-- originally claiming that Social Security would ``enslave workers''  and ``Sovietize the country''--and they have long denounced  Medicare as ``Socialism.''    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Some Republicans would even privatize the Veterans Administration  with its socialist structure of government-run hospitals and employees.  It is a system our veterans love.   This resolution is the foundation for continued attacks on better  Medicare for more Americans and their attempt to cut Social Security  benefits.   Like their cult leader, Donald Trump, they use this resolution to  attack our allies in Germany and Sweden at the very time Republicans  are considering cutting aid to Ukraine.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On February 2, 2023, on page H637, in the second column, the  following appeared: at the very time they are considering cutting  aid to Ukraine.
