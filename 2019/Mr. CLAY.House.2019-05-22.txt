 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution  recognizing women and minorities in housing, acknowledging their  efforts in the face of historical discrimination, and promoting  diversity and inclusion in business.   Although the U.S. has become more demographically diverse, the  financial services industry, especially at leadership levels, remains  mostly White and male.   President Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act on April 11, 1968, 1  week after the assassination of Dr. King. The Fair Housing Act was a  monumental step forward for the civil rights movement and pivotal to  establishing equal opportunity in housing for all Americans.   Home ownership has proven to be one of the most consistent paths to  obtaining wealth in America and narrowing the wealth gap. Closing the  racial wealth gap will be an essential path towards countering historic  discrimination and predatory lending.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman for yielding, and I rise  today to enthusiastically support the Consumers First Act, a bill that  returns the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to its intended role  as a nonpartisan consumer watchdog that elevates the interests of  American taxpayers above those of special interests.   The Bureau was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act following the financial crisis to ensure that  Americans have a regulator working solely on their behalf in order to  protect them from predatory and abusive actors. Under Director Richard  Cordray's leadership, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau helped  over 30 million consumers who were harmed and addressed over 1.2  million complaints about financial institutions.   As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development  and Insurance, I am pleased to see that this critical legislation  restores the supervisory and enforcement powers of the Bureau's office  tasked wit combating discriminatory lending practices, which have been  responsible for causing the racial wealth gap to continue to grow,  especially after the financial crisis of 2008.    This is a commonsense bill that, again, puts the American consumer  first and ensures that, in the regular course of business and commerce,  people are not forgotten.
