 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a recent community  forum I held at Binghamton University to raise awareness about the  heroin and opioid epidemic ravaging our country.   Every day in America, more than 144 Americans die of a drug overdose.  In Broome County, where our forum was held, 76 people died of an  overdose last year, 90 percent from opioids.   Before the forum, I had the opportunity to tour the New Horizons  Alcohol & Chemical Dependency program at United Health Services to see  firsthand the arduous work our healthcare professionals are undertaking  to fight back against this disease.   In addition to the tour, the forum highlighted that our panel of  healthcare professionals, law enforcement agencies, and community  organizations continues to struggle to keep pace with the rise of  addiction, and it became clear to me by the end of the forum that more  resources are needed.   It was an honor to bring together members of our community to talk  about solutions and highlight that there is hope for the future. I look  forward to taking those ideas that I learned at the forum and putting  those ideas into action by working with my  [[Page H8131]]  colleagues to reduce and eliminate the scourge of addiction.                            ____________________
