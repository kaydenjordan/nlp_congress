 Mr. President, I do not think we should vote on a bill  that would touch every single human being in this country when one  party is locked out of the debate--not able to read the bill and not  able to discuss it and help make suggestions and changes. I think that  families all across this country should be able to see this bill and be  able to evaluate the impact on themselves and on their families.   I am here today, in part, because of a little boy named Nicholas, who  was born way too early, who is 2 years old, and who just received a  diagnosis of autism, in addition to his other medical challenges.  Nicholas is a recipient of Medicaid. I talked to his mother today. She  wants to know whether this bill is going to cut Nicholas' care and what  this means for Nicholas and his future.   I think it is wrong for Republicans to push through a bill when  Nicholas' mother cannot evaluate what the impact will be on her and on  her child. So I believe we should post online any bill that is going to  affect families like theirs.   Mr. President, for that reason, I ask unanimous consent that a  substitute or perfecting substitute amendment offered to Calendar No.  120, H.R. 1628, not be in order if the text of the amendment has not  been filed at the desk and made available on a public website for at  least 72 hours, along with an analysis by the Congressional Budget  Office of the bill's budgetary, coverage, and cost implications.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Hawaii.    Mr. President, I get letters and emails every day from  families begging me not to let Republicans in Congress tear up  healthcare in this country. People aren't writing because they find  themselves with a lot of extra time on their hands. They are not  writing because they are professional activists or political  organizers. They are not writing because they like writing letters and  emails. They are writing because they are scared. They set aside all  the other things they need to do in their day--the sink full of dishes,  the load of laundry, the overflowing inbox--and they steal some time to  write these letters.   They write these letters because they are terrified--terrified down  to their bones that if they don't speak out, their family is going to  lose their healthcare coverage, their children will be shut out from  care, their elderly parents will lose the assistance they need to pay  for nursing home care, their own insurance costs will be going up, and  their financial security could be hanging by a thread.   A lot of people write letters and send emails, and a lot of people  make calls too. Every week since the Republicans started their cruel  effort to take away healthcare from tens of millions of people in this  country, my office has been getting phone calls from worried  constituents.   Last week, something changed. We went from our regular quota of calls  about this terrible Republican healthcare bill to an avalanche of voice  mails and phones ringing off the hook.   Since last week, I have gotten more than a thousand phone calls from  people who are pleading with me to do whatever I can to stop  Republicans who are going forward with their brutal plans. People are  literally in tears on the phone. They are scared, and they are angry.  They are calling because they know that 13 Senate Republicans--13 men-- are locked away in a secret room, behind closed doors, writing a secret  plan to trade their health insurance for tax cuts that will go to the  wealthiest Americans in this country.   The bill the Republicans are negotiating behind closed doors isn't a  healthcare bill. It is a tax cut for billionaires bill, and it is paid  for by cutting healthcare for tens of millions of other Americans.   The Republican healthcare bill has $663 billion in tax cuts in it-- $663 billion in tax cuts for the richest people in this country and for  wealthy corporations, tax cuts that would blow a giant hole in the  American budget.   The Republicans didn't let that slow them down. They kept their eye  on the prize. For the Republicans, the most important thing about this  healthcare bill is the tax cuts for the rich. They decided to cut  Medicaid by $834 billion in the same bill so they can pay for their tax  cuts.   This is a straight-up trade. The Senate Republicans say that  Americans should cut health insurance for little babies or for seniors  in nursing homes or for people getting treatment for opioid addiction-- all so that millionaires and billionaires can get their tax cuts.   That is not a healthcare bill. That is a statement of values. And it  says that tax cuts for a handful of millionaires and billionaires are  more important than healthcare for millions of hard-working Americans  and their families. There is only one word for what the Senate  Republicans are doing with this bill--``shameful.'' It is shameful.   The Republicans negotiate in secret, behind closed doors. They refuse  to let anyone see the bill. They will not tell anyone what is in it.   Senator McCaskill asked Chairman Hatch on the Finance Committee if he  would hold a hearing on the bill, and he said no. Senator Murray asked  Chairman Alexander on the HELP Committee if he would hold a hearing on  the bill, and he said no, no plans to do so--no, no hearings, no  reviews, no public look at what the Republicans are up to.   What is going on here? I will tell you what is going on. Senate  Republicans don't dare let the people back home see this bill. They  don't dare let voters see this bill. Instead, they have decided to try  to ram this bill through with no hearings, no public discussion, and  get it signed into law.   They hope, once that is done, people will not see much point in  learning about the details and holding Republicans accountable. They  hope that if they can do a quick vote, everyone else will just give up.   I have news for Senate Republicans. That is not going to happen.  Senate Republicans may not want to hear from families who are worried  about losing their insurance coverage in the middle of a battle with  breast cancer. They may not have time for stories about premature  babies who need Medicaid so they can get lifesaving care. And maybe  they don't want to hear about the grandparents with Alzheimer's who  could get kicked out of nursing homes.   Senate Republicans may not want to hear from these people, but I have  a message for these Senate Republicans. We don't care how long we have  to stand up here. We don't care how many times you try to dodge the  question about what is in your secret healthcare bill. Democrats are  here to keep demanding that you show us this bill, and we are going to  keep insisting that you account for its shameful contents.   I know you would prefer to take the phone off the hook so you don't  have to hear it ring, and I know you would like to pretend that there  aren't families in your State who would be hurt by this bill, but I am  going to take some time to read you a handful of the letters I have  been receiving about exactly what is at stake in this debate about  healthcare. These families deserve to be heard.  [[Page S3592]]    A few months ago I received a letter from Jenny in Worthington, MA.  She wrote to me about how she and her husband got good healthcare  coverage through the Affordable Care Act and how Medicaid was there  when they needed it most, when Jenny was diagnosed with breast cancer.   A few days after President Trump's inauguration, Jenny's son Liam  wrote a letter to the President. Liam asked President Trump not to take  away his mother's healthcare. I don't know if President Trump ever read  that letter, but I am going to read it right now into the Congressional  Record.         Dear President Trump,        My name is Liam Barry, and I am ten years old. My mother       has been very ill. Thanks to the ACA, my mother has been able       to have the care and medication she needs. If you repeal the       ACA, my mother will not be able to get the care she needs. I       know there are millions of kids in the same situation as me.       Please think of them when you read this.        Sincerely,        Liam Barry    Thank you for speaking out, Liam. We are fighting for your mom, and  we are fighting for you.   Kristine from Cambridge also wrote to me about her fight against  cancer. She wrote:         I ask that you and fellow Senators PLEASE fight for the       Affordable Care Act. I am a cancer survivor. When I was 28       years old, I got the news no one ever wants to hear, ``You       have cancer.'' Luckily, for me, I had a job that had       wonderful insurance, and I was able to get medication,       surgeries, and treatment to win the fight--and to not go       broke doing so.        However, I know many young people and old people and       children who would not be here today if it was not for ACA. I       know people who are still fighting their battles with cancer.       They are frightened and losing hope, not because of cancer,       but because they don't know whether they will be able to       continue to get the treatments necessary to stay in the       fight.        I am now 30 years old, and have my whole life in front of       me. Because of what [President] Trump is proposing, I am now       afraid that if I lose my job or if I wish to change jobs, I       might not be able to get the necessary coverage, because I no       longer qualify.        I really didn't think this is what I would be worried about       two years ago after having been through 8 rounds of chemo, 20       rounds of radiation and surgery to clear me of this disease.        Please, I ask that you fight for us. Fight for those who       are in the chemo chair right now, at this very moment, who       are miserable, bald and bloated. Fight for the cancer warrior       who is now crying with worry because she doesn't know, come a       month from now, if she will be able to continue to receive       the life-saving treatment she is entitled to!    That is why we are here tonight. We are fighting for you, Kristine.  We are in this fight. Thank you for speaking out about your own fight  against cancer and for others who are currently battling cancer and  worried about the future of their healthcare.   I also heard from Sarah, who lives in Shrewsbury, MA, and who wrote  to me about her concerns that the Republican healthcare bill would  endanger coverage of birth control and access to services at Planned  Parenthood. Sarah wrote to me this past weekend, while I was out  dancing in the Boston Pride parade.         As I type this you are at Boston Pride, which I would have       loved to be at to support my friends, but, due to my       endometriosis pain, here I sit.        I am extremely concerned about the GOP plan to reduce or       strip away insurance coverage for birth control. As a 21-      year-old woman suffering from endometriosis, a very common       disease among young women, I know firsthand that birth       control does more than just prevent pregnancy--in fact, for       many, it is the only treatment for them.        In 10 days I will be undergoing endometriosis surgery, and       for the past 6 months since I've been diagnosed until the       surgery, birth control was the only thing enabling me to       stand up straight most days. Even while taking oral       contraceptives, there were many days I was unable to get out       of bed (today being one).        I am so lucky to have access to an amazing endo specialist       at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and to have access to the       medication and surgery that I need. But every time I groan       about having to go to an appointment, I think about how many       women are suffering from the same debilitating pain, but       without the resources to overcome it. Many women rely on       Planned Parenthood not just for abortions, but to provide       them with the medicine that will enable them to stand up       straight in spite of the pain they deal with every day.       Endometriosis doesn't discriminate, and it cannot be cured,       only treated. Until endometriosis becomes a prominent focus       of medical research, which I feel it should be, we must       protect the right to be treated for it, which means       protecting insurance coverage of birth control, and       protecting Planned Parenthood.        I know that you are a warrior for women's rights, and you       are the patron saint of Planned Parenthood. I know these are       issues you fight for, and I cannot even begin to thank you       enough for all you have done thus far. I hope that by adding       my voice and my personal story, I can fuel your fire and       somehow be a small part in protecting my fellow females and       my fellow endometriosis sufferers (1 in 10 women in the US).        Thank you for fighting for us. Thank you from the bottom of       my heart.    Sarah, thank you for writing, and thank you for fighting. We are  going to fight to save your coverage, and next year I expect to see you  on the parade route at Pride.   I also heard from Dr. Hemal Sampat, who is a doctor at MGH in Boston.  He wrote in with his personal story, and I want to read parts of his  letter.         I actually grew up in a low-income family myself. My       parents immigrated to the U.S. My mother is brilliant but       only had a 7th grade education because my grandfather       couldn't afford to send her to school. My father is college-      educated, but struggled frequently with unemployment. My       older brother has multiple disabilities. He's blind and       brain-damaged from a stroke during childhood, epileptic,       intellectually disabled, and has a transplanted kidney. I am       fortunate enough to have been healthy my entire life.        For most of my life, my family was on Medicaid, as well as       other forms of public assistance. . . . My brother,       additionally, due to his kidney disease, got Medicare as       well, but Medicaid was always his secondary insurance. He       sees multiple different specialists and has done very well       over these years.        In spite of us having multiple financial struggles, we       never had to worry about his healthcare being paid for. His       transplant from childhood lasted 19 years, and then about 10       years ago he was transplanted again and has done well with       that.        My parents still live in the same house I grew up in, in       Maryland. Right now, they're cared for by Medicare and       Medicaid. My brother lives with them, receives SSI, and his       health needs are met by Medicare and Medicaid. Although none       of his chronic medical conditions can be cured, they are all       well taken care of.        In the meantime, I grew up healthy, was able to attend       Georgetown through need-based financial aid, was able to get       into medical school at the University of Maryland and pay for       it using Federal student loans (which I'm repaying through       the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program), got into a       dual-specialty residency of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics       at Penn State, and am now working at Harvard and MGH.        My family's story goes to show that Medicaid is about       helping families that struggle, about helping children with       complex medical needs, and about how providing for the good       health of a family can achieve positive outcomes for the       long-term future.    Today, Dr. Sampat works at Harvard at MGH. He makes sure his patients  on Medicaid get excellent care. He told me about one of his patients  who came in to urgent care in Chelsea. This little girl wasn't even 2  years old yet and was wheezing and had a fever. Here is what the doctor  said:         This child and her mother were on Medicaid through       MassHealth. [As] I asked questions, I found out more about       this mother. She was working two to three jobs in order to       make ends meet. Her daughter was in daycare during the day       and then [the] grandmother took care of [the little girl]       most evenings. This mom took care of her daughter on the rare       days she had off and clearly loved and cared for her       daughter.        This young girl's wheezing was probably some of the       earliest signs of what will become asthma. [Her] mom has       asthma, too, and it runs in their family. Asthma is a       completely controllable illness with medication, but it       requires monitoring by a doctor and access to medication.       Because the child has Medicaid, I feel much more confident       that, in spite of how much the mother is struggling       financially, the child has a good shot at growing up healthy.       Without Medicaid, this child could live a life in poor health       from a treatable condition.    These are some of the people the Senate Republicans want to kick to  the curb so they can deliver a big tax cut for millionaires and  billionaires--a 10-year-old kid with a sick mom, a cancer survivor, a  woman with endometriosis, a boy kept healthy by Medicaid so he could  grow up to become a doctor at one of the best hospitals in this country  and help a little girl with asthma.   Senate Republicans are willing to tear away health insurance from  these families to deliver tax cuts for their buddies, but we are not  going to let that happen. We can't let that happen. You are fighting  back, we are fighting back, and we will keep right on fighting.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
