 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks President  Donald Trump's first 6 months in office, and I appreciate his many  successes for the American people.   His leadership for jobs has inspired record highs today for the Dow,  S&P 500, and NASDAQ. President Trump has advanced a decisive foreign  policy positively addressing the Muslim world, upholding the United  States commitment to NATO, and working with our allies for peace  through strength. Additionally, the President has taken firm action  against rogue regimes.   In Syria, President Trump was clear that America will not tolerate  chemical weapons attacks by the Assad regime against his citizens. In  North Korea, the President has made clear that he will challenge the  continued provocation by the communist, totalitarian regime; and that  the U.S. will expose Iran for their ballistic missile testing and human  rights abuses.   As of June 30, the House has passed 269 bills, the most of the last  five administrations, with 37 laws signed to date, the most of the last  five administrations.   I look forward to continuing to work with President Donald Trump and  Vice President Mike Pence for positive achievements to promote American  families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
