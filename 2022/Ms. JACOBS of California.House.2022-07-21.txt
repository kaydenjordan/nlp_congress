 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  making sure this bill could come to the floor so swiftly. I thank my  friend, Congresswoman Manning, for her partnership on co-leading this  bill with me. And I thank Speaker Pelosi for her continued leadership  in this post-Roe reality.   Madam Speaker, this bill could not be more important because, for me  and for tens of millions of Americans, these threats from Justice  Thomas and the Supreme Court to take away our right to contraception  are not abstract.   I have lived my entire life with this constitutional right to  contraception, and it is a right I have exercised for decades, whether  it was the birth control pills I used when I was a teenager to address  debilitating cramps, the IUD I have relied on for years, or the Plan B  I have used at times that was, thankfully, available over the counter  when I needed it.   I am probably the first person ever to speak about using Plan B on  the House floor, and I know I am the first person in at least 35 years  to talk about my period here. But you know what? We should be talking  about it.   We should be talking about periods and birth control and the  healthcare that millions of Americans need for our everyday lives  because this is not a side issue that only affects some people. This is  a kitchen-table issue.   The decision of how, if, and when to grow a family are decisions that  are personal and private and should never be decided by the Supreme  Court or Congress. It is a decision that is fundamental to our  autonomy, our agency, and our ability to control our own lives.   As a young woman, reproductive healthcare is my healthcare, and I am  so grateful that, today, we will take a step to codifying that access  into law.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
