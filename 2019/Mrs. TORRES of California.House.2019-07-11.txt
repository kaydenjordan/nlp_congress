 Mr. Chair, for 17\1/2\ years, I worked as  a 911 dispatcher.   My average day consisted of handling incidents, such as coordinating  police vehicle and foot pursuits, talking to suicide callers,  negotiating with barricaded suspects, and talking to their victims.   One call that has stayed with me and threw me into a political world  that I never wanted to be a part of, I answered a call from a little  girl who was  [[Page H5630]]  murdered at the hands of her uncle. I was her only witness. I heard her  scream. I heard her head being bashed against the wall. I heard the  five shots that ultimately took her life. Her last words: ``Uncle,  please don't kill me. It's not my fault.''   This work requires a lot of training and tough attitude to deal with  critical emergencies. Unfortunately, the Federal Government currently  classifies 911 dispatchers as clerical workers--secretaries. My  amendment would finally recognize the critical work they do by  reclassifying them as protective service occupations.   This provision costs nothing, zero, but it would bring 911  professionals, civilian workers--primarily single moms--the dignity  that they deserve.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its passage.
