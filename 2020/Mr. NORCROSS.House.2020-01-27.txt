 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 943) to authorize the Secretary of Education to award grants  to eligible entities to carry out educational programs about the  Holocaust, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 943         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Never Again Education Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States has demonstrated a commitment to       remembrance and education about the Holocaust through       bilateral relationships and engagement in international       organizations such as the United Nations and the       International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance; the United       States works to promote Holocaust education as a means to       understand the importance of democratic principles, use and       abuse of power, and to raise awareness about the importance       of genocide prevention today.        (2) The Congress has played a critical role in preserving       the memory of the Holocaust and promoting awareness,       including by authorizing the United States Holocaust Memorial       Museum as an independent establishment of the Federal       Government to ensure that ``the study of the Holocaust become       part of the curriculum in every school system in the       country'', as well as by establishing a national Holocaust       Remembrance Day in 1978.        (3) 75 years after the conclusion of World War II, with the       decreasing number of eyewitnesses and growing distance of       students and their families from this history, it is       important to institutionalize education about the events of       the Holocaust such as the German Nazis' racist ideology,       propaganda, and plan to lead a state to war and, with their       collaborators, kill millions--including the systematic murder       of 6,000,000 Jewish people; as well as the persecution and       murder of millions of others in the name of racial purity,       political, ideological, and behavioral grounds, among them       Roma, the disabled, the Slavs, Communists, Socialists,       Jehovah's Witnesses, and homosexuals.        (4) As intolerance, antisemitism, and bigotry are promoted       by hate groups, Holocaust education provides a context in       which to learn about the danger of what can happen when hate       goes unchallenged and there is indifference in the face of       the oppression of others; learning how and why the Holocaust       happened is an important component of the education of       citizens of the United States.        (5) Today, those who deny that the Holocaust occurred or       distort the true nature of the Holocaust continue to find       forums, especially online; this denial and distortion       dishonors those who were persecuted, and murdered, making it       even more of a national imperative to educate students in the       United States so that they may explore the lessons that the       Holocaust provides for all people, sensitize communities to       the circumstances that gave rise to the Holocaust, and help       youth be less susceptible to the falsehood of Holocaust       denial and distortion and to the destructive messages of hate       that arise from Holocaust denial and distortion.        (6) Currently, 12 States (California, Connecticut, Florida,       Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York,       Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island) require by law that       schools teach students about the Holocaust; more schools and       teachers, including those in underserved communities, can and       should deliver quality Holocaust education.  [[Page H541]]         (7) For more than 30 years, the United States Holocaust       Memorial Museum has worked to build and support the field of       Holocaust education, and advance the quality and       sustainability of Holocaust education at the local, State,       and national levels, by engaging teachers and students across       disciplines and grade levels.        (8) The Federal Government, through support for educational       activities of national museums established under Federal law,       can assist teachers in efforts to incorporate historically       accurate instruction on human rights atrocities, including       the Holocaust, in curricula.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Antisemitism.--The term ``antisemitism'' means a       certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred       toward Jews.

Holocaust distortion refers to       efforts to excuse or minimize the events of the Holocaust or       its principal elements, including collaborators and allies of       Nazi Germany, to blame the Jews for causing their own       genocide, or to portray the Holocaust as a positive       historical event.        (6) Holocaust education center.--The term ``Holocaust       education center'' means an institution that furthers the       teaching and learning about the Holocaust by offering       programs for students and training for teachers and other       types of professional leadership audiences.        (7) Holocaust education program.--The term ``Holocaust       education program'' means a program that has as its specific       and primary purpose to improve awareness and understanding of       the Holocaust and educate individuals on the lessons of the       Holocaust as a means to raise awareness about the importance       of preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry against any group       of people.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials on H.R. 943, the Never Again Education  Act.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today on International Holocaust Remembrance  Day in support of H.R. 943, the Never Again Education Act, introduced  by my colleague, Carolyn Maloney, chairwoman of the House Committee on  Oversight and Reform.   The Never Again Education Act will help ensure the atrocities of the  Holocaust are never repeated. It will authorize $10 million over 5  years for a new program to help teach the Holocaust in schools. The  program will be run by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,  which will develop curricula, train teachers, and partner with local  organizations to promote Holocaust education.  [[Page H542]]    The Holocaust was the systematic and state-sponsored persecution and  murder of 6 million Jews and an additional 5 million others who the  Nazis deemed inferior. Yet, while it might seem hard for the older  generations to believe, many younger Americans today do not know the  basic facts about the Holocaust.   A new study from the Pew Research Center found that half of Americans  know that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. The research  found that education and trips to Holocaust museums directly impact  respondents' knowledge. The figures highlight the need for greater  Holocaust education in America.   Today, anti-Semitism is on the rise. I hosted an event last week with  leaders of the Jewish community and law enforcement. They talked about  their security concerns, and they made a pledge to stand up for others  by challenging bigotry in any form.   We must speak out against hate and educate one another to prevent and  stop the rise of anti-Semitism.   Soon, younger generations will not be able to hear from Holocaust  survivors, as we have firsthand. They will depend on their schools and  their teachers to learn the facts.   We were recently in Belgium on a trip led by Speaker Pelosi to  commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, where over  19,000 Americans were killed in that battle, joining with the Allies to  fight against hate and evil.   We won, and after World War II, we said, ``Never again.'' But we  realize this struggle continues, and it is very real today.   On the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, I urge my  fellow Members to support the Never Again Education Act and keep the  lessons of the Holocaust alive.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chairman of the Education and Labor  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the lead sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Illinois an  additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on  either side, please.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Right up the road from where I live in New Jersey, there is a woman,  Rosalie Simon, a Holocaust survivor, who settled there right after  World War II. She returned this past week to Auschwitz for the first  time since she was a prisoner there in 1945, when she was 12 years old.  She said the following:         I want to go back as a survivor and look back on what I       went through. I want to go back as a human being, not as an       inmate.    We must honor Rosalie and many like her and all of the survivors and  victims by supporting H.R. 943, the Never Again Education Act, to  ensure the Holocaust is never forgotten and never repeated.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
