 Mr. Speaker, this legislation is related, as  you heard, to the duck stamp.   In 1932, President Roosevelt signed into law legislation that  authorized the duck stamp that allowed for hunters to get this stamp in  order to go hunt waterfowl.   This program has been incredibly successful over the 90-year period,  selling today approximately 1.6 million stamps every single year. This  has generated approximately $1.1 billion, and all of these proceeds  have been invested back into conservation, into the Migratory Bird  Conservation Fund. This has benefited over 600,000 acres of our  National Wildlife Refuge System and benefited conservation. I will say  it again, this program has been wildly successful.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, in 2013, legislation was signed  into law that created an electronic duck stamp. The thought there was  that with the internet and with the ability to improve access to  compliance, we would allow for a digital duck  [[Page H4367]]  stamp to provide 45 days of authorization to go hunt.   The problem was that the physical paper stamp often missed that 45- day window. Someone would pay to get a duck stamp, and they had a 45- day authorization window, but the physical stamp didn't come in until  after the end of that period. So, the hunter would be out of  compliance, yet they did everything right.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is very simple. It just allows for the digital  authorization, the electronic authorization, to be extended throughout  the season.   Importantly, Mr. Speaker, it still preserves the physical stamp that  so many people treasure and collect annually, so it does require the  stamp be physically mailed later on.   Mr. Speaker, I give a huge shout-out to the cosponsor of this  legislation, Congressman   Mike Thompson, a fellow sportsman from  California. I thank Senator Boozman and Senator Manchin, who have  cosponsored the Senate companion bill, and I thank Bruce Westerman, the  chair of the committee, and Ranking Member Grijalva, for working with  us to clear this legislation. It is really important that this move  forward.   Mr. Speaker, before I close, I will share how this came about. I love  it whenever you are out there in the field, meeting with constituents  back home, and people bring up ideas. In this case, it was actually a  sportsman in our office, Taylor Playforth. We call him ``Bailer''  because he sunk his boat, but that is a whole other story. Taylor  Playforth, who is an avid sportsman, actually came up with this idea.   We were able to get this turned into legislative text, worked with  Senators to introduce it, and worked with the Congressional Sportsmen's  Caucus and others, which ultimately yielded this legislation. I am  hopeful that my friend from Arizona is going to ensure that we pass  this legislation unanimously today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the folks who worked on this. I thank  Vivian, Sandra, and the staff of the Committee on Natural Resources,  and I urge adoption of this legislation.
