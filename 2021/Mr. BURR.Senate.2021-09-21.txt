 Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to Paul  Matulic, a dedicated member of the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence staff for over 16 years. Paul's total service to the U.S.  Senate spans 27 years, the first 11 of which were spent as foreign  policy adviser to Senator Orrin Hatch. Since joining the staff in 2005,  Paul has been resolute and unwavering in his commitment to the  committee's oversight mandate. He has managed an array of critical  responsibilities ranging from oversight of intelligence community  covert action programs and regional monitoring of America's national  security hotspots and warzones, to making key contributions in support  of the committee's most sensitive and high-profile investigative work.  Paul never got anything but difficult assignments because I trusted him  and I knew he would do an excellent job.   Through it all, Paul maintained an erudite and exemplary  professionalism that bettered both his colleagues in the performance of  their oversight work and the intelligence professionals who he oversaw.  Paul was exacting as an overseer, but he always balanced his demanding  expectations with a heartfelt, genuine admiration for the extraordinary  men and women of the intelligence community he helped oversee. Paul  enjoyed relationships of trust and respect with his colleagues and  members of the committee alike because he was thorough, he was  prepared, and above all, Paul always gave you the truth, whether you  wanted to hear it or not.   Before coming to work for the Senate in 1994, Paul served as the vice  president of Hill & Knowlton, a global public relations consultancy in  New York City. Prior to that, Paul spent several years as an editorial  and research assistant in the office of former President Nixon. Paul  earned a master's degree in international affairs and political economy  from Columbia University, and a bachelor of science in international  affairs from St. John Fisher College in Rochester, NY. Prior to  college, Paul experienced life at its grandest and grittiest, working  from one side of the North American continent to the other, all the way  into the Yukon Territory, spending time as a gravedigger, a magician, a  ranch hand, a construction worker, a janitor, and a bartender.   Paul's work for the committee, by its very nature, defies elaboration  in this public forum. It is enough to say that Paul approached every  day in the office with one ideal in mind: Democracy is underwritten by  a vigorous system of checks and balances and that accountability is all  the more necessary when it is applied to intelligence activities that  might otherwise escape public  [[Page S6582]]  scrutiny. The pride and purpose Paul took from being a part of that  oversight mechanism were evident in the seriousness with which he  approached his work. I am personally grateful to Paul for everything he  did on the committee's behalf.   Paul plans to spend his retirement with Margo, the great love of his  life, at his side. He intends to travel, read, and walk the woods of  the Rock Creek Park where he has found so much comfort and solace over  the years. The son of European immigrants, who emigrated himself from  Canada when he was 4 years old, Paul's story is a distinctly American  one. Everyone who got to play a role in it these past 16 years is  better for it.   It gives me great joy to publicly thank Paul for his contributions to  the work of the committee, the integrity of congressional oversight,  and the security of this great Nation. He has been a credit to what we  do from the moment he joined the staff.   Congratulations and best of luck to you in retirement, Paul. Neither  your expertise, your good humor, nor your wise counsel will soon be  replaced.                            ____________________
