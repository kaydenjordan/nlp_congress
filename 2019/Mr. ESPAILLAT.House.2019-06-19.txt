 Madam Speaker, the Carnegie Medal, the prestigious  award that annually recognizes authors focused on literature for  children or young adults, has been widely coveted since its  establishment in 1936.   Surprisingly, the medal has never been awarded to a woman of color in  its 83-year existence--that is, until Dominican-American poet Elizabeth  Acevedo's win for ``The Poet X,'' a critically acclaimed piece of  literature named after its main character, Xiomara Batista.   ``The Poet X'' artfully illustrates the journey of X, a shy Dominican  girl of African descent who joins her school's poetry club in Harlem, a  place I represent and know well.   Elizabeth's brave exploration of societal structures in ``The Poet  X'' is remarkable. Her childhood upbringing and tribulations gave  Elizabeth unique authority and intimacy of X's journey. The resulting  poem will inspire young voices who follow her footsteps.   Congratulations to Elizabeth for her monumental accomplishment.                            ____________________
