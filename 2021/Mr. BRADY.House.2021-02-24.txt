 Madam Speaker, today we gather as a grieving delegation  and as a proud Nation to recognize the life and legacy of our colleague  and friend, Congressman Ron Wright.   Texas born and bred, Ron worked with and for the people of Texas in  some way for the past 21 years. Throughout his courageous battle with  lung cancer, his good spirits never faltered, and he remained a  steadfast champion of his conservative principles.   To many of us, it seemed like Ron never had a bad day. In fact, the  last two bills he introduced in Congress protected the unborn and the  sanctity of life, something Ron always passionately supported. Think  about that. As his life was waning, he was protecting the lives of the  innocent unborn.   The Texas people have lost a real fighter, and all of us have lost a  true friend. Cathy and I and our entire Texas delegation hold Ron's  wife, Susan, close to our hearts, and our deepest condolences go out to  his children, grandchildren, and staff.   Godspeed to you, my friend. You will be missed.
