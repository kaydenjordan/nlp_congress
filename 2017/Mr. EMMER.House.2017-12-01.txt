 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.   Mr. Speaker, 22 million Americans live in manufactured homes. The  majority of these homes are in rural America. In fact, more than 6 out  of 10 manufactured homes are located in rural areas. In my home State  of Minnesota, manufactured homes are the State's largest source of  affordable homeownership.   Unfortunately, a provision in Dodd-Frank has put homeownership out of  reach for these Americans. Specifically, Dodd-Frank and the CFPB  modified the criteria and expanded the types of loans from lenders to  manufactured home buyers, which are considered to be ``high cost.''   As a direct result, lenders are struggling to make these loans  because of a high legal risk associated with this ``high cost''  definition, ultimately harming low-income buyers in Minnesota. The  consumers are being harmed in Minnesota and around the country.   This is why Republicans and Democrats have come together in support  of H.R. 1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act,  authored by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), our friend, to help  millions of Americans become homeowners.   This legislation provides clarity and certainty regarding the changes  made by Dodd-Frank and the CFPB. H.R. 1699 will ensure that home buyers  in rural and low-income areas are able to afford manufactured housing  and are not unfairly targeted by the very agency that was created to  protect them.    Mr. Speaker, when it comes to achieving the American Dream,  government should not be standing in the way. As Members of Congress,  it is our duty to stand up for and against this continued overreach,  support the American Dream, and vote ``yes'' for H.R. 1699.
