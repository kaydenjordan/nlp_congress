 Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to talk  about what I believe is an excellent choice that President Trump made  on Monday, and that is in selecting Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the  vacancy on the Supreme Court.   Judge Kavanaugh's credentials are those of a person very well suited  for the U.S. Supreme Court. He excelled as an undergraduate and as a  law student at Yale and clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is  retiring--the man he would replace--and was also a clerk for two  Federal appeals court judges. He served in a very critical position in  President George W. Bush's administration.   Beyond his resume is a record of respect and effectiveness. Judge  Kavanaugh is highly regarded by his colleagues in the Federal  judiciary. I think that says a lot about his potential and his  character in terms of potential to become a Supreme Court Justice. He  has also impressed others over his long and very prestigious career.   We saw his wonderful family on Monday night. We can tell they are  very proud of their dad and their mom, and I was very honored to have  the opportunity to meet all of them, along with Judge Kavanaugh's  parents.   He has been very effective. As a matter of fact, this Supreme Court  has adopted his reasoning in their opinions on 11 separate occasions,  and the 300 opinions he has written are frequently cited by Federal  judges all across the country.   But perhaps Judge Kavanaugh's most qualifying characteristic is  something I heard him say at the White House on Monday evening. When  the President announced his nomination, Judge Kavanaugh committed to be  open-minded in the cases that come before him as a Supreme Court  Justice. Open-minded--I think that is critical, and his record backs up  that commitment.   He has a long and clear record of fairly applying the text of our  Constitution and our laws. There will be a lot to consider on Judge  Kavanaugh because he has such a long and very clear record of writing,  and the President mentioned his very precise writing skills.   When I consider nominees for the Supreme Court, I don't look for a  person who promises particular policy outcomes or someone who is out to  actually create laws; what I look for is a person who reflects  experience, fairness, and respect for the Constitution as it is  written. That is because the Constitution assigns legislative authority  to us, to elected representatives in the Congress. Accountability to  the American people is diminished when unelected judges pursue their  own policy goals.   A newspaper in the Northern Panhandle of our State, the Wheeling  Intelligencer, editorialized today:         Kavanaugh has said that if confirmed to the Supreme Court,       his allegiance will be to the Constitution as it is written,       not to his personal preferences. That is precisely what the       Nation needs.    Another editorial appearing in West Virginia today--this one from the  Daily Mail--said:         A conservative Supreme Court justice interprets the U.S.       Constitution for all, not just those on the right or the       left.    I believe Judge Kavanaugh truly understands a Justice's and a judge's  proper role, and I think no one puts that better than the judge  himself. I would like to read a portion of a speech he gave last fall:         One overarching goal for me is to make judging a more       neutral, impartial process in all cases, not just statutory       interpretation. The American rule of law, as I see it,       depends on neutral, impartial judges who say what the law is,       not what the law should be. Judges are umpires, or at least       should always strive to be umpires. In a perfect world, at       least as I envision it, the outcomes of [cases] would not       often vary based solely on the backgrounds, political       affiliations, or policy views of judges. This is the rule of       law  [[Page S4892]]       as the law of rules; the judge as umpire; the judge who is       not free to roam in the constitutional or statutory forest as       he or she sees fit.        In my view, too, this goal is not merely a preference of       mine but a constitutional mandate in a separation-of-powers       system.    I believe that Judge Kavanaugh and I share the belief that  faithfulness to the text of the law as written, not the pursuit of a  particular policy outcome, should be the goal of a judge.   In the same speech last year, Judge Kavanaugh discussed his meeting  with then-West Virginia Senator Robert C. Byrd during his confirmation  process to the DC Circuit. Most West Virginians and Americans know the  reverence that Senator Byrd had for the text of the Constitution.  During his speech, Judge Kavanaugh spoke of reading the text of Article  I with Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd was among the Democrats who voted to  confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the DC Circuit. I think Judge Kavanaugh's  record on the DC Circuit and his experience merit a bipartisan  confirmation process--the same type of bipartisanship that Senator Byrd  showed when he voted for Judge Kavanaugh.   For all of the noise and debate outside of this Chamber, the  confirmation process for a well-qualified Supreme Court nominee does  not have to focus on trying to guess how a Justice Kavanaugh might rule  in a particular case. As a matter of fact, I think that will be a  futile exercise and quite damaging to the process at the same time. If  we are looking for a fair umpire, which we are looking for, there is no  reason a nominee with a strong record of applying the text of the  Constitution and the law should not be confirmed with overwhelming  support.   President Trump made clear in his campaign that he would appoint  judges with respect for the Constitution. I believe he kept his  commitment when he nominated Brett Kavanaugh to become a Supreme Court  Justice.   The process is just beginning where Judge Kavanaugh's record will be  scrutinized to the nth degree. We are going to have hearings, and I  hope all of us--and I am certainly putting myself in this category-- will have the opportunity--and I think we will--to sit down one-on-one,  to talk with Judge Kavanaugh, to make our own judgments about his  qualifications and his abilities in terms of becoming a Supreme Court  Justice.   I look forward to advancing the process, and I look forward to  meeting with Judge Kavanaugh.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the loss of one of  West Virginia's brightest and recognize the life of a dedicated  advocate, educator, veteran, and good man: Roger L. Sherman.   Throughout his life, Roger was known for his dedication to  responsible forestry and the people of rural West Virginia. From  championing economic development to advancing graduate-level education,  Roger made significant contributions in the areas of public advocacy,  education, and community service that benefit West Virginians to this  day. Above all, Roger was highly regarded as a man of conscience, whose  integrity pervaded every aspect of his life and work.   A veteran, Roger served in the U.S. Army for 3 years until 1969. He  graduated from North Carolina State University with a bachelor's of  science in forestry and went on to obtain a master's degree in forestry  from Yale University. He joined Westvaco as public affairs forester in  1977, and from there, embarked on a more than 40-year career advancing  the interests of private landowners in West Virginia. During this time,  he served as volunteer chair of the legislative committee of the West  Virginia Forestry Association, WVFA, a position he held for 38 years.  He also received numerous awards and recognitions, including the  Outstanding Service to Forestry Award  [[Page S4910]]  and the President's Service Award from the WVFA and the Society of  American Foresters' John A. Beale Memorial Award; and in 2011, he was  inducted into the West Virginia Agriculture and Forestry Hall of Fame.   In addition to his storied career, Roger was an active participant in  his community and various organizations. He was a board member of the  West Virginia Chamber of Commerce and forcefully advocated for the  interests of rural West Virginia, organizing the informal rural caucus  in the West Virginia House of Delegates. He also organized and obtained  funding for a graduate-level course in economics that he cotaught with  professors at West Virginia University.   Above all, Roger was a man of faith and family. He is survived by his  beloved wife, Marlo, and son, Zachary, as well as his mother and  sister.   Roger's love of forestry and West Virginia lives on through the  positive impacts he made on the State and countless West Virginians. He  approached his job with integrity and positivity, and I think I speak  for many when I say he will be sorely missed. It was an honor to call  him a friend and fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 11 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
