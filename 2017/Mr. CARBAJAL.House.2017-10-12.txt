 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against provisions in the  House and the Senate National Defense Authorization Act that would  allow the transfer of all surplus pistols to the Civilian Marksmanship  Program--or CMP--for sale to the public.   Allowing the transfer of this large volume of guns for sale to the  public moves the CMP into the retail gun market and away from its  statutorily mandated functions. This is a program meant to instruct  citizens in marksmanship and promote safety in the use of firearms, not  to deal firearms.   The Army has opposed such provisions in the past, and I am here to  oppose any NDAA provisions that would allow the transfer of any surplus  Army firearms to the CMP.   I join my colleague, Mr. Langevin, in calling for all surplus  firearms to be melted down and not distributed to the public.   There are over 300 million guns in America, nearly one for every  citizen. We have lost way too many lives to gun violence.   The Department of Defense should not participate in freely  distributing their guns onto our streets.
