 Mr. President, today I want to recognize and honor KOBI- TV/NBC5 in Medford on its 70th anniversary. KOBI went on the air on  August 1, 1953, and is an integral part of its parent company  California Oregon Broadcasting, Inc., founded in 1933 by William B.  Smullin.   In classic KOBI and ``Oregon Way'' fashion, this TV station is  celebrating seven decades of public service serving southern Oregon by  teaming up with the United Way of Jackson County for a ``United in  Kindness'' campaign.   This community campaign is gathering stories of kindness, civility,  generosity, and charity that will be featured throughout this year on  the air and online.   What a wonderful example of how KOBI informs and lifts up its  community. That has been the case since 1953 when Bill Smullin founded  the station--the first VHF TV station in Oregon. Seventy years later,  it remains one of the very few locally owned and operated TV stations  in the United States.   Bill Smullin's daughter Patricia C. ``Patsy'' Smullin has guided KOBI  since 1985 as owner and president of California Oregon Broadcasting,  Inc., Ms. Smullin has earned numerous honors in that time. Among those  honors are the Chuck Sherman Television Leadership Award from the  National Association of Broadcasters in recognition of an individual  demonstrating leadership, service and commitment to local television in  medium and smaller markets; and the Oregon Association of Broadcasters  Tom McCall Award for outstanding service to the State and to the  nation.   When I am in southern Oregon, for townhalls, community meetings and  more, I make it a regular practice to come into the KOBI studio. There,  I can count on a thorough and fair discussion from well-prepared  interviewers about issues affecting southern Oregon.   For 70 years, viewers in southern Oregon have been equally able to  count on KOBI's steadfast commitment to local journalism. I know I  speak for all those viewers when I say thank you for that commitment  the past seven decades and here is to many more decades of success.                            ____________________
