 Madam Speaker, I rise with a broken heart  today. On Monday, two of our police officers were shot during a routine  stop.   Sergeant Craig Johnson was a leader in Tulsa, serving on the police  force for over 15 years. Sergeant Johnson had a strong relationship  with local leaders and took pride in keeping the community he loves  safe. He was a strong friend to fellow officers and a compassionate  leader with a servant's heart.   Sergeant Johnson died from his wounds earlier today. Officer Aurash  Zarkeshan remains in critical condition.   Craig and Aurash are examples of the remarkable men and women who  choose to put themselves in harm's way to protect us every day.   The best sound a police officer's spouse can hear is the sound of the  Velcro of the officer's vest coming off at the end of the shift.  Instead of that sound, Sergeant Johnson's wife had to get the worst  call a spouse can get.   Madam Speaker, Black lives matter and so do those who wear the blue.   My prayers are with his wife, Krysta, his two children, and the many  ones he left behind.                            ____________________
