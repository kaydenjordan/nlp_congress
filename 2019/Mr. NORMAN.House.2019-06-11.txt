 Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize one of the  most accomplished constituents in the Fifth District of South Carolina.   Janie L. Mines, who lives in Fort Mill, encompasses what it means to  serve and honor one's country. In 1975, after the United States  Congress authorized the entrance of women into our first-rate military  service academies, Janie soon applied to enter the United States Naval  Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.   Out of 81 women who entered the academy in 1976, Ms. Mines was the  first and only Black woman to graduate from her class and the first  ever Black woman to graduate from the United States Naval Academy as a  whole.   After her departure from the academy with the rank of ensign and a  bachelor of science in engineering, Ms. Mines was trained as a supply  officer and became a supervisor at the former Naval Training Center in  Orlando, Florida. She proceeded to serve in the former Naval Annex at  the Pentagon, aboard the USS Emory S. Land, and as a senior adviser to  the Secretary of the Navy. In fact, she has continued her work in the  Armed Forces on the Defense Advisory Committee on Women.   Her exceptional accomplishments include being granted the position of  torchbearer for the 2002 Olympic Games, starting a foundation that  tends to the needs of socioeconomically disadvantaged boys, and being  honored by the United States Navy with a business achievement award in  2010.   In 2018, Ms. Mines wrote and published the book ``No Coincidences:  Reflections of the First Black Female Graduate of the United States  Naval Academy.'' In it, she shows us the true meaning of faith,  patriotism, and persistence. We can all learn from her story and her  deep love of this country.   I will end with a quote from her book: ``God has a plan for us all.  If we submit to His will, we need not fear. We are prepared and  protected.''   We thank Ms. Mines for her continued service to this great country.                      Honoring Southside Fire Department     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in honor of the 50th  anniversary of the Southside Fire Department on March 19.   The fully volunteer fire department has protected the people and  property of Union County since 1974 when the first call rang. The  station has grown from as little as five calls a year to 98 calls in  2018 alone.   The foundation of Southside Fire Department was a community effort.  The seed was planted in 1969 when a meeting was held at Roper Chevrolet  to hear the public's opinion on the organization of a fire district for  the local area in Union County.   However, it was not until 1972 that Southside received its first  truck and could finally open its station. Supported by the local  community's generosity, the fire department established itself and  eventually joined South Carolina's Firefighters Association.   For almost 50 years now, Southside Volunteer Fire Department has  fought fires to protect the great folks in the district. The station  currently has an ISO Class 3/9 rating and serves over 3,500 residents.   As a Nation, we ask much of our citizens. Yet, even on top of the  burdens and the toil of everyday life, some  [[Page H4395]]  choose to volunteer to save the lives and property of their neighbors.  With nothing to gain and everything to lose, they head straight toward  danger.   I congratulate the fire chief, Michael Lancaster, and the rest of the  crew at Southside Fire Department on this incredible milestone. We  thank them for their tireless, continued service to our community and  our great Nation.                            ____________________
