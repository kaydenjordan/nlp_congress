 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H. Con. Res. 90. The  discrimination and violence imposed on the Rohingya ethnic minority in  Burma is brutal, horrific, and preventable.   I do welcome, like the rest of my colleagues, the administration's  determination that the attacks against Rohingya are ethnic cleansing,  because it certainly is, but I would respectfully submit it certainly  rises to the level of genocide.   The Genocide Convention couldn't be clearer: If you look to destroy  an ethnic group--there are other categories as well, but it is all  about the group--in whole or in part, and even the thought, the  contemplation of doing so can rise to genocide.   Here it is actually happening, and it is happening because of who  they are as a group.   I think there needs to be a further refinement of that determination  to the point of being genocide.   The responsibility for this humanitarian crisis falls squarely on the  Burmese military and, to some extent, on the endemic and widespread  intolerance expressed in Burmese society for the Rohingya.   After the State Department's determination of ethnic cleansing, it  should not hesitate to impose sanctions against the Burmese military  leaders and all others who are responsible for this bloodbath.   Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I am deeply  concerned that this crisis may destabilize the National League for  Democracy's ruling coalition and set back Burma's democratic  transition.   I am concerned about China's interests in Burma, because a robust  democracy on China's border does not fit the goals of the Chinese  leadership, including Xi Jinping.   I am concerned that outside jihadi groups will exploit this situation  to open yet another front.   I am concerned, like my colleagues, about the stability of  Bangladesh, whose fragile economy must now host well over 500,000 new  refugees.   Of course, we are all most concerned about the Rohingya women,  children, and men who suffer horribly during this crisis.   The roots of this humanitarian crisis are long. A durable solution  for the Rohingya in Burma will be a difficult task, but we must make  the effort. As we all know, there are other ethnic minority groups in  Burma, including the Karen, the Karenni, and others, who have also  faced atrocities over the years at the hands of the Burmese military.   A democratic and multiethnic future should be Burma's best hope for  prosperity and stability. The Burmese military remains the obstacle to  that future.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce  and Ranking Member Eliot Engel for, again, working so well together to  bring this legislation to the floor; and Lee Zeldin, one of the  principal cosponsors of the bill; and Doug Lamborn, of course, the  prime author of this legislation.   I, too, am proud to be a cosponsor. This is a very important bill  that will serve as a measure of justice for the memory of U.S. Army  Officer Taylor Force and many others who have been victimized over the  years by Palestinian terrorism subsidized by the Palestinian Authority.  It is well past time for us to apply real pressure to the Palestinian  Authority for continuing incitement for anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, and  anti-American violence. This bill takes aim at the PA's ongoing  financial incentivizing of murder.   Mr. Speaker, when you pay someone to kill somebody else and pay their  family to kill somebody else, that is a crime. So this just ought to be  seen as a step in trying to say we mean business. Those who authorize  those payments ought to be held liable for these crimes.   Although 2 years ago Congress deducted the PA's compensatory payments  to terrorists and their families from U.S. assistance, there has been  no change in the PA's twisted and perverted policy. By conditioning  most U.S. assistance to the PA on its commitment to cease payments to  terrorists, the Taylor Force Act takes the necessary next and important  step to guarantee that American taxpayer dollars are not being used to  reward terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, the PA cannot be a partner for peace until it stops  subsidizing terrorism. Amidst increasing talk of a new peace initiative  in the region, we must be absolutely clear that there could be no true  peace until Palestinian public policy stops inculcating a culture of  death in the minds of the people.   Years of diplomacy, Mr. Speaker, and public pressure aimed at  stemming Palestinian incitement have not succeeded. Congress must act  now with the power of the purse.    Mr. Speaker, we have before us two pieces of  legislation regarding the ongoing humanitarian and political crisis  that is occurring in the country of Venezuela, which has been reduced  to poverty and near starvation due to the repressive regime of Nicolas  Maduro and that of his dictatorial predecessor Hugo Chavez.   I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. DeSantis, for introducing H.  Res. 259, of which I am an original cosponsor, and to applaud Mr. Engel  for highlighting the public corruption and threat to democracy in  Venezuela via his H.R. 2658, the Venezuela Humanitarian Assistance and  Defense of Democratic Governance Act.   I also would like to single out the lead Republican cosponsor of that  legislation, the gentlewoman from Florida and my friend and colleague,  Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her work over the years in calling attention  to the deplorable human rights situation not only in Venezuela, but  also in Cuba, Nicaragua, China and so many countries the world over.   As Ileana understands so well, it is the ideology of the Left--be it  hard core Communism, or the Socialism of Hugo Chavez and  [[Page H9663]]  now that of his understudy in oppression, Nicolas Maduro--which has  brought suffering to so many people.   The people of Venezuela deserve far better.
