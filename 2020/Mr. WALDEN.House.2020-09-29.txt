 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 362, Energy Emergency  Leadership Act.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation, sponsored by Representatives Rush and  Walberg, strengthens the Department of Energy's important energy  emergency mission. It does so by requiring the well-established energy  emergency and cybersecurity functions at DOE to be organized under the  leadership of an assistant secretary confirmed by the United States  Senate.   Just over 2\1/2\ years ago, then-Secretary of the Department of  Energy Rick Perry recognized the importance of elevating this mission  within the Department, and he established an Assistant Secretary-led  office, the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency  Response. This office has proven its worth in various situations over  the past 2 years, Mr. Speaker, including assistance relating to  hurricanes and wildfires.   This bill would amend the Department of Energy Organization Act to  establish in law and, therefore, maintain that a Senate-confirmed  assistant secretary would lead the Department of Energy's emergency  response and cybersecurity functions.   This legislation will ensure the Department has the focused and  accountable leadership to more fully protect the public from fuel and  electricity supply disruptions against all the hazards, natural or man- made, including emerging threats from our foreign adversaries to the  Nation's electric grid.   The bill has been drafted to ensure the Department carries out its  responsibilities in coordination with other agencies by improving  coordination across the Department, ensuring more effective interagency  collaborations, and increasing accountability to the Congress.   A vote for H.R. 362 is a vote for ensuring high-level leadership over  energy emergencies at the Department of Energy for the benefit of  public safety and welfare, and for stronger cybersecurity protections  in the electricity systems.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.  [[Page H4967]]         Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and the  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in supporting passage of  this legislation and our efforts to ensure that our electric grid and  our power supply sources are safe and secure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 360, the Cyber Sense Act, was authored and  introduced by my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues, Mr. Latta  and Mr. McNerney.   The bill was reported unanimously from the Energy and Commerce  Committee to improve the cybersecurity of the supply chains for the  components of our Nation's electricity infrastructure.   To ensure the security of our Nation's electricity grid means we must  ensure bulk-power system components and technologies are not vulnerable  to cyber threats and attacks.   This is especially important, given the threats our nation-state  adversaries pose to the bulk-power and electric systems, as indicated  by the President's May 1, 2020, executive order giving the Department  of Energy authority to take action to protect the bulk-power system.  This bill would help that effort.   H.R. 360 would establish a voluntary Department of Energy program  that identifies and promotes cyber-secure products intended for use in  the bulk-power system, including products related to industrial control  systems.   The bill would authorize the Department of Energy to provide  technical assistance to electric utilities, product manufacturers, and  other electricity sector stakeholders to help mitigate identified  cybersecurity vulnerabilities.   The bill also was amended to make clear these efforts of the  Department of Energy would include, as appropriate, other relevant  Federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security.   Mr. Speaker, a vote for H.R. 360 is a vote for providing an important  new tool to electric utility supply chains from cybersecurity threats.  I urge support of the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), the coauthor of this bill.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on this side. I  would just encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of  H.R. 360.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 359, the Enhancing Grid Security Through Public- Private Partnerships Act, was authored by my Energy and Commerce  Committee colleagues Mr. McNerney and Mr. Latta.   The bill was reported unanimously from the Energy and Commerce  Committee as an important measure for strengthening the cybersecurity  and resilience in the energy systems used to deliver power to our homes  and businesses.   Mr. Speaker, protecting our Nation's critical electric infrastructure  is a shared responsibility. It requires robust partnerships between  industry and the government to leverage strength and ensure the  responsive and resilient system that the public needs and relies upon.   H.R. 359 focuses on these very partnerships. The bill would establish  a program to facilitate and encourage public-private partnerships to  promote and enhance physical and cybersecurity of electric utilities.   The bill would require the Secretary of Energy to deploy the  Department of  [[Page H4971]]  Energy's world-class technical know-how to assist utilities with  cybersecurity practices and procedures, especially those utilities that  have fewer resources due to their size or the region in which they are  located.   It would foster development of maturity models, self-assessments, and  auditing methods.   It would provide training and technical assistance to electric  utilities to address and mitigate cybersecurity supply chain management  risks.   And H.R. 359 would increase opportunities for sharing best practices  and data collection within the electric sector.   The amended version of the bill also makes clear the Department of  Energy will work as appropriate with other Federal agencies to  safeguard the electric system.   A vote for H.R. 359 is a vote for providing an important new tool to  protect our Nation yet once again from these very serious cybersecurity  threats.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the prior speaker for his comments  and great work on these pieces of legislation.   Together, we are doing what we can to protect America's energy sector  from attack, and I thank Mr. McNerney and others on the committee for  their work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1289, the PHONE Act. Now, this legislation  will ensure that Americans who lose their homes during a wildfire or  other natural disaster do not also have to worry about losing their  home phone numbers.   As we have seen recently from the tragic wildfires that have ravaged  communities in California and my home State of Oregon, these disasters  can destroy everything in their path, often with little notice. No  matter how resilient a home or communications tower might be, you  cannot regulate your way out of a fire's burning path.   When a natural disaster occurs, the Federal Emergency Management  Agency, FEMA, is activated to provide emergency housing assistance and  other resources. If your house burns to the ground, the last thing you  should have to worry about is whether or not your landline phone number  will be available to you when you do return. Yet, that is what happens.   Many people, especially seniors, rely on their landline to stay  connected to their family, their doctor, or others. Thankfully, the  Federal Communications Commission already has a process to prevent  victims of natural disasters from losing their landline numbers.   The FCC uses its authority, and did this as recently as last week for  northern California and Oregon, to waive rules and regulations that  require landline phone numbers to return to the pool of available  numbers when a home is completely destroyed by a natural disaster. So  what this bill does is codify the process and seeks to make several  improvements.   During the committee process, Republicans sought changes to this bill  to ensure it does not upend the current procedure, so no consumers will  be left in the lurch.   This type of relief should only apply to areas where significant  physical damage has occurred to render a home inhabitable, as is the  objective of the bill.   We worked for the inclusion of FEMA in the notification process and  have stated our concerns that FEMA should still play a large role in  determining which households have sustained damage in an affected  county.   Now, this did receive some pushback from the majority, and we should  defer to the assessment of FEMA, the experts on the ground, before  these proceedings go into effect.   Ultimately, the majority on the committee accepted many of our  changes  [[Page H4973]]  to make sure this legislation is beneficial to consumers, and the bill  was passed unanimously by the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I support this measure moving forward, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this matter. I  would encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the  PHONE Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1754, the Horseracing Integrity and  Safety Act of 2020.   From the Pacific Northwest to the renowned racetracks in Kentucky,  New York, and New Jersey, horseracing holds a very special place in our  culture and in our local community life. In my district alone,  thousands of people a year travel to Pendleton, Oregon--well, most  years, other than with COVID; in 2020, we didn't have the Pendleton  Round-Up, but they do almost every other year--to participate in the  world-famous Pendleton Round-Up. So, I am no stranger to the important  role of horses and horseracing and what a role that plays in our lives.   Currently, horseracing is regulated on a State-by-State basis, as you  heard, and despite the industry's best efforts, some inconsistencies  still exist in the regulation of horses. This bill is designed to  provide national uniformity on antidoping and medication programs, as  well as racetrack safety standards.                                time  1300    H.R. 1754 would establish the horse racing integrity and safety  authority. This would be a private, independent, self-regulatory,  nonprofit corporation that would develop and implement a  [[Page H4981]]  horseracing antidoping and medication control program as well as a  racetrack safety program.   I am pleased to see updates to the original Horse Racing Integrity  Act that my friend Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as  my colleagues Mr. Tonko and Mr. Barr, worked with industry to include.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this improved version,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the leaders of the Energy and  Commerce Committee on both sides of the aisle for moving forward with  H.R. 8134, the Consumer Product Safety Inspection Enhancement Act.   I especially want to thank Chairwoman Schakowsky, who has worked so  hard on this, and Representative Jeff Duncan, who has also led on this  bill. This bill will improve coordination with U.S. Customs and Border  Protection, the CBP, to target and prevent consumer products that  violate American laws from entering the United States. Importantly,  this effort prioritizes shipments from China, where we know the  overwhelming majority of counterfeit goods originate.   By prioritizing inspection of shipments from China, H.R. 8134 will  help the CPSC and the CBP identify trends and better position us to  prevent goods that violate our laws and, by the way, hurt our small  businesses from entering our country.   The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of addressing supply  chain threats. This bill is an important step in making that happen.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8128, the  Consumer Safety Technology Act. I want to thank Mr. McNerney, Mr.  Burgess, Mr. Soto, and Mr. Guthrie for their leadership on this effort.   This bipartisan bill directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission  to conduct a pilot program to determine how artificial intelligence may  be used to advance the agency's mission. Given the agency's broad  jurisdiction over so many different consumer products, being able to  efficiently and accurately analyze data is critical.   This bill also includes an important study on how blockchain  technology may be used to address fraud and other unfair and deceptive  acts and practices. This is complimentary to the American COMPETE Act  that also prioritizes this emerging technology.   Blockchain technology would help bolster our supply chains, improve  privacy--especially relating to contact tracing during the COVID-19  pandemic, and combat the spread of misinformation and fraud. I am glad  to see this provision included in the legislation.   Relatedly, H.R. 8128 also focuses on digital tokens and targets ways  in which we can protect consumers from fraud in the digital token  marketplace.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I especially  thank Ms. Schakowsky, whom I have had the great privilege to serve with  for many years. There is no more fierce warrior for consumers and  consumer protection than the gentlewoman from Illinois. It has been a  delight to serve with the gentlewoman and work with the gentlewoman  from Illinois on many causes.   And while we haven't always agreed, we have always tried to be  agreeable with each other. I think that, Madam Speaker, is what is  often missed outside of this institution is that we come here  representing different people, different philosophies, and then we also  come here with a common goal: to solve problems. We have different  approaches to that from time to time, but we generally come together  and move a lot of good legislation, especially in the Energy and  Commerce Committee.   I think I can brag on that committee, having been a member of it for  20 years, rose to not only chair a subcommittee, but chair the full  committee; and now, as I kiddingly say, I am chairman in exile, in  permanent exile. But it has been a great run, and I am not one of those  Members who is cranky or grumpy about leaving either. It is a fine  institution.   Democracy was built to be messy and loud, and some days it is a  little louder and messier than any of us would like, but we do come  together, as we are on this legislation and on other things. I thank  the gentlewoman for her very kind comments.   I rise today in support of this legislation, H.R. 8132, the COMPETE  Act. I thank Ms. Schakowsky and Mrs. Rodgers for their hard work. The  gentlewomen have worked really well together on these and many other  issues.   I asked committee members earlier in the year to prioritize our  leadership on emerging technologies, and the importance of that was  emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot let other countries,  especially China or any other adversary, advance past us on emerging  technologies while our economy recovers.   I applaud the leadership on artificial intelligence and our  committee's commitment to ensuring America leads the world in emerging  technologies.   For America to lead, we need to be laser-focused on critical  technologies that will define our future, and that is what this bill  does. The American COMPETE Act will help us unleash American innovation  and free-market ingenuity in artificial intelligence, quantum  computing, autonomous tech, and other emerging technologies.  [[Page H4996]]    The American COMPETE Act also aims to help us secure our supply  chains and develop national strategies to advance our private-sector  industries.   By the way, that means good American, high-paying jobs.   These technologies will drive information breakthroughs, save lives,  spur economic growth, and will do so for generations to come. I am  proud to see the Energy and Commerce Committee so focused on these  issues.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of  this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today, also, in support of H.R. 4764, the  Timely Reauthorization of Necessary Stem-Cell Programs Lends Access to  Needed Therapies Act, or the TRANSPLANT Act.   This critical bill, led by Representatives Matsui, Bilirakis, and  Pingree, reauthorizes the C.W. Bill Young Transplantation Program,  which provides lifesaving bone marrow and umbilical blood transplants  to patients suffering from over 70 diseases that can be treated with  blood or immune system reconstruction using bone marrow, peripheral  blood, or cord blood. These diseases include leukemia, lymphoma, sickle  cell anemia, and certain other immune system disorders.   I thank our colleagues, Representatives Matsui, Bilirakis, and  Pingree, for being tireless advocates for this program. They truly have  just never stopped working to get this done.   I also express my appreciation to Representative Chris Smith from New  Jersey, who played a critical role in the creation of this program,  spearheaded previous reauthorizations, and has been a longtime champion  for patients whose only chance at life is a transplant through this  program. Representative Smith wanted to be here today to express his  strong support for this bipartisan initiative, but, unfortunately, he  could not be present because of a death in his own family.   All of this is to say that I am incredibly grateful for all of the  bipartisan efforts from multiple Members of Congress who have  prioritized this program and worked together to get this bill across  the finish line.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have a statement from Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey that I  will include in the Record in support of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), who is one of the real advocates of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 5373, as did the chairman,  the United States Anti-Doping Agency Reauthorization Act, sponsored by  Representatives   Mike Thompson, Bill Johnson, and Diana DeGette.   This bill reauthorizes the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which is the  national entity charged with administering antidoping programs for the  United States for Olympic, Paralympic, Pan American, and Parapan  American sports.   The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency handles in-competition and out-of- competition testing, results management processes, drug reference  resources, and athlete education for all of our United States Olympic  and Paralympic Committee-recognized sports' national governing bodies,  their athletes, and their events. USADA is also the administrator for  the Ultimate Fighting Championship Anti-Doping Program.   Reauthorizing this important agency furthers the advancement of clean  sports, fair games, and positive sportsmanship, so I urge support of  the legislation.   I don't believe I have any speakers on my side of the aisle, Madam  Speaker, so I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, Young Women's Breast  Health Education and Awareness Act, the EARLY Act Reauthorization,  which was introduced by Representatives Wasserman Schultz and Brooks.  This bill reauthorizes the EARLY Act of 2009, which established a  national public health education campaign to promote awareness and  early detection of breast cancer among young women.   Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in women under  the age of 40, and each year almost 24,000 new cases are diagnosed. It  is critical that both young women and healthcare professionals are  equipped with the knowledge and healthcare services needed for early  detection and treatment of breast cancer.   Madam Speaker, by reauthorizing the EARLY Act, H.R. 4078 would  enhance early detection of breast cancer, increase public awareness of  risk factors and risk reduction strategies, and support the provision  of psychosocial and medical services for young women diagnosed with  breast cancer.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mrs. Brooks for all of her work on the Energy  and Commerce Committee. From day one on our committee, we all knew she  was going to be prepared and ready to go to work. Congresswoman Brooks  [[Page H5000]]  has the experience. She was a U.S. Attorney and has been an invaluable  member of our committee, and she will be retiring and leaving Congress  at the end of this term. Her grace, her skill, her knowledge, her  friendship, her incredible work ethic will all be missed as this  Congress and the next one continues to navigate complex issues that  come across our desks.   So, Madam Speaker, to Congresswoman Brooks, I thank her for her  service. The committee will miss her, but she has left an indelible  mark in an important chapter in American history.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would just conclude by thanking the  gentlewoman from Florida for sharing her story. I know it has been a  rugged journey that she has endured on, but this legislation will save  lives. It is so important that we do this work today.   I had a dear friend who was diagnosed at an early age, and they had  it pretty much under control. Then, after the birth of their second  child, it came back with a vengeance and claimed her young life.   This is a vicious, vicious attack on the body. I know we have all  joined together to invest in research, and someday, we hope we will  overcome this and save all lives.   But in the meantime, reauthorizing this important body of work that  the gentlewoman has led on is critical. So, I would encourage our  colleagues to join us in passing this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4996. This is the  Helping Medicaid Offer Maternity Services, or MOMS, Act of 2019. It was  introduced by Representative Kelly from Illinois and Dr. Burgess from  Texas.   As you have heard, this legislation gives States the option to extend  the length of continuous postpartum eligibility for Medicaid to 12  months. Now, this is a critically important bill. Despite everything  that is going on in the country, it is an example of, once again,  Congress coming together to do the right thing for the right reason.   This bipartisan legislation furthers the Committee on Energy and  Commerce's mission to address maternal mortality, which we all agree  needs further attention, and to improve the health outcomes in  expectant or new moms.   Last Congress, Madam Speaker, President Trump signed bipartisan  legislation from our committee into law to advance maternal health. We  are now building on that progress today.   Medicaid is the largest single-payer of maternity care in the United  States. Medicaid covered 43 percent of all births in 2017, the latest  data we have. Now, in some of our States, the share of healthcare costs  of births financed by Medicaid is even higher. As such, this program  plays a significant role in improving maternal health and helping to  eliminate preventable maternal mortality.   I want to thank Ms. Kelly and Dr. Burgess for leading this effort,  and I want to thank Chairman Pallone and his staff for working together  to find a path forward with this important legislation.   Getting this measure signed into law will have a meaningful impact on  the maternal mortality crisis. We will make a difference with this  legislation. We will save more moms' lives.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers on this measure.  I would encourage its passage.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about H.R. 3131, the South Asian  Heart Health Awareness and Research Act of 2020 sponsored by my friend  and colleague from the Northwest, Representative Jayapal. This bill  authorizes initiatives that will help improve our understanding of  cardiovascular disease in South Asians living in the United States, a  laudable goal.                                time  1445    The intent of this bill is laudable, as South Asians are a population  disproportionately impacted by diabetes and heart disease. In fact,  according to the American College of Cardiology, South Asians represent  approximately 25 percent of the world's population, yet they account  for 60 percent of the world's heart disease patients.   While I support initiatives to improve health in ethnic and minority  communities, I do have some concerns with the bill itself.   In providing technical feedback on the legislation, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, expressed concerns that the grants  authorized under the legislation would be duplicative of their current  efforts to address cardiovascular disease in disproportionately  impacted communities. These efforts include the CDC's Division of  Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity, in addition to the health  promotion grants to States and the WISEWOMAN Program, which stands for  Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for WOMen Across the Nation.   In addition, the CDC expressed concerns that it would not be able to  provide the data that the bill is mandating the agency report on.   Broadly, the agency does have data on minority and disproportionately  impacted groups with regard to cardiovascular disease; that is true.  However, they do not have enough data on the specific subgroup of the  South Asian population in order to put together a complete and  meaningful report that would be useful for Congress in making future  policy decisions. While unfortunate, it is because CDC does not yet  have the data collection technology nor the capabilities to obtain that  kind of granular data.   Therefore, before mandating such a report, Congress should instead  pass H.R. 5321, the Public Health Infrastructure Modernization Act, led  by Representatives Carter and McBath, bipartisan legislation which  would modernize CDC's data infrastructure and  [[Page H5004]]  improve the collection of more granular information on communities  disproportionately impacted by cardiovascular disease, such as South  Asian communities. It would be nice if we had that bill moving through,  because that, I think, would provide the ability for CDC to get the  data that this bill before us today requires.   So I appreciate the gentlewoman from Washington for bringing needed  attention to this issue. I would like to thank the majority for working  with us to get this bill to a better place. While we agree with the  administration's concerns, we also think the bill is a good first step  in raising awareness about this important public health issue.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers on my side  of the aisle, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2468, the School-Based  Allergies and Asthma Management Program Act, introduced by  Representatives Roe and Hoyer.   This important legislation would direct the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, in making asthma-related grants, to give preference to  States that require schools to implement policies that improve the care  of children with allergies and asthma. These policies include having  plans in place for managing students with allergies and asthma and  having at least one person trained to administer rescue medication on  the premises during operating hours.   By incentivizing States to have comprehensive school-based asthma and  allergy management programs in place, this bill will help ensure that  school nurses, staff, and administrators are prepared to help students  with allergies and asthma excel at school in a safe environment.   I want to thank Dr. Roe and Leader Hoyer, who have championed the  cause of ensuring children at school have access to needed medicines  for many, many years.   I also want to thank Dr. Roe for his years of service to this  institution. Like some of the rest of us, he, too, will be retiring at  the end of this year. As a veteran, as a doctor, and as a leader--and,  by the way, as a great musician, not that he will be able to perform  that here on the House floor--he has done so much for veterans, for  improving healthcare, and for the people of the district he represents.  He has left his mark, and he doesn't have to worry about whether he  made a difference, because he has.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for his  comments in support and authorship of this  [[Page H5006]]  legislation. Our son battled childhood asthma. It is a really scary  thing as a parent to watch a child deal with an asthma attack.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. David P. Roe), the champion of this legislation,  the great champion for a positive public health outcome for all of us,  especially for our veterans.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5572, the Family Support  Services for Addiction Act, which was introduced by Representatives  Trone and Meuser.   This legislation would establish grant programs for family community  organizations to provide evidence-informed and family-based approaches  to substance use and addiction management. Family-based approaches have  demonstrated stronger outcomes in substance use disorder recovery when  compared with individual approaches, as they address several  psychosocial dimensions of addiction and strengthen support networks  for affected individuals.   Madam Speaker, the legislation before us today supports family  community organizations that are committed to pursuing evidence-based  interventions for substance use disorder, reduce the stigma of  addiction, and strengthen both families and communities through  recovery.  [[Page H5008]]    Madam Speaker, I thank our two colleagues that sponsored this  important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser), one of the coauthors of this  very, very important and meaningful legislation, who serves  Pennsylvania's Ninth Congressional District in the U.S. House.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2075. This is the  School-Based Health Centers Reauthorization Act of 2020. It was  introduced by Representative Sarbanes, whom I know we are going to hear  from in a moment; Congressman Upton, former chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee; and Representatives Stefanik and Tonko.   This bill reauthorizes the School-Based Health Centers program, which  supports the provision of primary care, behavioral healthcare, dental  health, counseling, nutritional education, and so many other really  critical health services in our schools.   Madam Speaker, I remember back in my days in the State legislature  supporting community-based, school-based healthcare because,  oftentimes, this was the only place many of our children could get  basic healthcare services. It is so essential.   I know, during the pandemic, we are getting reports from our doctors  and others that say this loss of access to these kinds of services is  taking its toll, especially in mental health services.   These health centers usually operate as a partnership between the  school and a community health organization so that the services  provided by the health center best meet the needs of the community and  the local school district.   As I said, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for basic  healthcare has not gone away just because students are learning from  home. School-based health centers will continue to help in keeping  students healthy and ready to learn, and we should reauthorize them, as  we do in this act.   So I urge support of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this  important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 7948, the  Tribal Health Data Improvement Act, introduced by my Energy and  Commerce Committee colleagues, Representatives Gianforte, Ruiz,  Rodgers, O'Halleran, and Lujan.   This is really important public health legislation. It addresses some  chronic challenges that are faced by Tribal Nations and Tribal  Epidemiology Centers as they try to gain access to critical Federal  healthcare and public health surveillance data.   Obtaining this data is critical for engaging in preventive public  health work and combating current health crises in American Indian and  Alaska Native communities. However, structural barriers to accessing  data have been especially problematic during the COVID-19 pandemic,  which, tragically, has disproportionately impacted these very  communities.   In order to ensure Tribal Nations and Tribal Epidemiology Centers  have access to the data necessary to accomplish public health  priorities, this legislation requires the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to create a data-sharing strategy that takes into  consideration the recommendations of the Secretary's Tribal Advisory  Committee.   In addition, in reauthorizing the CDC's National Center for Health  Statistics, the bill requires the Secretary to make public health  surveillance data available to the Indian Health Service, Indian  Tribes, Tribal organizations, and Tribal Epidemiology Centers, so long  as the data requested for use is consistent with Federal law and, of  course, obligations.   The Secretary must also consult with Indian Tribes, Tribal  organizations, urban Indian organizations, and the Tribal Health  Advisory Group of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to  develop guidelines for State and local health agencies to improve the  quality and accuracy of birth and death records of American Indians and  Alaska Natives.   By improving the sharing of data between the Federal Government and  the Tribes, this important bill would help address the health  disparities in American Indian and Alaska Native communities.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, especially  my friend from New Mexico for his leadership on this legislation. I  would just say that they have all worked very hard on this. It is  extraordinarily important to pass this.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5469. This is the  Pursuing Equity in Mental Health Act, and it is sponsored by  Representative Watson Coleman. It helps address suicide and mental  illness in youth for minority and underserved communities.   Despite improvements in health equity, disparities in mental health  care persist. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has  reported that racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States  are less likely to have access to mental health services and less  likely to use community mental health services, but more likely to use  emergency departments and more likely to receive lower quality care.   Poor mental health care access and quality ultimately contribute to  poorer outcomes, including suicide among these populations. These  issues are especially acute in minority youth populations.   H.R. 5469 would help address these disparities. It authorizes grants  targeted at high-poverty communities for culturally and linguistically  appropriate mental health services. It supports mental health  disparities research, requires the studying of the impact of  smartphones and social media on adolescents, and authorizes the  Minority Fellowship Program to support more students of color entering  the mental health workforce.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the majority for taking the time  to work with us to get this bill in a really good place. It is an  important initiative, and I am pleased to see it getting a vote on the  House floor today, Madam Speaker.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join both the chairman of the  committee and myself in supporting this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support today of H.R. 1109.   This is the Mental Health Services for Students Act, and it is  sponsored by Representatives Napolitano and Katko. This bill authorizes  the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Project  AWARE grants.   Madam Speaker, these grants support State educational agencies, in  partnership with State mental health agencies, in increasing awareness  of mental health issues among school-aged youth, providing training for  school personnel to detect and respond to mental health issues, and  connecting students with behavioral health issues and their families to  needed services.   By supporting partnerships between the State and local systems to  promote the healthy development of students, these grants increase  access to mental health services for school-aged youth, ultimately  reducing youth violence, substance use disorder, and suicide.   I am glad we are addressing mental health services for children.  Their schooling and whole worlds have changed so much over this year.  It is important that they can easily access mental health services.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   I don't believe we have any other speakers, Madam Speaker, so I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 2519. This is the Improving Mental Health  Access from the Emergency Department Act of 2020 sponsored by our  colleague from California, Dr. Ruiz.   The bill authorizes Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration award grants to emergency departments for the purpose of  supporting follow-up services to patients who present in the emergency  department experiencing a mental health crisis.   Now, according to SAMHSA's National Guidelines for Behavioral Health  Crisis Care, there is a disconnect in the provision of follow-up  services regarding what comes next for a patient experiencing a mental  health crisis in an emergency department. If a patient comes in with  appendicitis, the emergency physician can call a surgeon. If the  patient has a rash, the emergency department has a roster of  dermatologists and clinics, and, in many cases, the physician can even  make an appointment for that patient.  [[Page H5017]]    Sadly, tragically, these same partnerships don't always exist if the  patient has mental health issues. By authorizing grants to support  programs that help those treated at the emergency department  expeditiously transition to follow-up care, this bill would remove  those barriers to care for those who experience an acute mental health  crisis. And we think it will reduce the stigma, and, ultimately, it  will save lives.   I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I don't believe we have any other speakers on this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4861. This is  the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency  Department Act that was introduced by Representative Bilirakis, whom we  will hear from in a minute, and our friend Congressman Engel.   Before I talk about the legislation, I would say what a joy and  privilege it has been to serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee  with Mr. Engel. He is an incredible individual, cares deeply about his  constituents, and works hard on their behalf.   Moreover, Congressman Engel has been one of those people who is  always kind and thoughtful to all of us on both sides of the aisle and  works to put the interests of Americans first, both on the Energy and  Commerce Committee and in his incredibly important and powerful role as  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Congressman Engel has served America and New York well, and while we  haven't always agreed on every issue, we have never been disagreeable,  and I wish him and his wife Godspeed in whatever is next in his career.   This legislation would authorize a grant program to improve the  identification, screening, assessment, and treatment of patients in  emergency departments who are at risk for suicide.   Consideration of this bill could not come at a more pressing and  important time. As we have said before on these matters, the COVID-19  pandemic and the resulting economic downturn have impacted the mental  health and well-being of all Americans. In fact, a recently released  report by the Well Being Trust and the American Academy of Family  Physicians predicts that, because of the pandemic, an additional  150,000 Americans could die of ``deaths from despair,'' meaning deaths  from suicide or drug or alcohol misuse.   Emergency departments are key locations to intervene and assist those  who may be contemplating taking their own lives. As past research  identified, one in every eight emergency department visits in the U.S.  was related to a mental health or substance use disorder.   By creating grants for emergency departments to develop policies for  screening those at risk of suicide and enhancing their post-discharge  care coordination, this bill would improve our frontline healthcare  providers' ability to intervene when someone is in crisis, ultimately  reducing deaths from despair, especially during this difficult time.   I would urge my colleagues to join the chairman of the committee and  myself and our colleagues who put so much time and effort and work into  crafting this legislation to support it, pass it, and let's get it into  law.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a real leader in the area of  healthcare and especially mental health services improvement.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on our side of the  aisle, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7293, the Suicide  Training and Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention,  or STANDUP, Act of 2020. It was introduced by our Energy and Commerce  Committee colleagues, Representative Peters, who I know we are going to  hear from soon, and Representative Bilirakis, who we are also going to  hear from.   This legislation addresses a key measure in promoting suicide  awareness and prevention training among students and young Americans.   Sadly, for the last decade, suicide has been the second leading cause  of death for Americans ages 10 to 24 and the 10th leading cause of  overall deaths in the United States.   Tragically, this epidemic has only worsened during the COVID-19  epidemic.   Suicide is preventable, and initiatives that empower students with  knowledge of the warning signs and resources for prevention are  critical in addressing these trends.   We believe, through this legislation, Project AWARE grantees would be  empowered to establish school-based suicide awareness and prevention  training programs, which will improve student awareness of mental  health issues while connecting at-risk individuals to needed health  services.   So as we approach the end of September, our nationally recognized  Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, it is critical that we continue  addressing our Nation's challenges in preventing youth suicide and  promoting the mental health and wellness of all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on my side of the  aisle on this legislation. I urge its passage, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3539, the  Behavioral Intervention Guidelines Act, introduced by Representatives  Ferguson, Burgess, Kennedy, and Panetta.   This important bill authorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration to develop best practices for establishing and  using behavioral intervention teams in elementary schools, secondary  schools, and institutions of higher education.   Behavioral intervention teams are multidisciplinary teams that  support students' mental health and wellness by identifying students  experiencing stress, anxiety, or other behavioral disturbances, and  conducting intervention and outreach to these students to help manage  risk. These teams are already active in some educational institutions  such as Texas Tech University and the University of California, Los  Angeles.   By acting in a proactive manner to assist students and to connect  them with needed resources, behavioral intervention teams help schools  create a safe environment for their students and improve mental health  outcomes in young people.   I urge support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), the deputy whip of the House on the  Republican side of the aisle, one of the authors of this important  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    I thank my colleague for his work on this important legislation.   I want to turn now and use the remainder of the time to recognize the  fact that we all work hard on our legislation, but it doesn't get all  the way here and all the way through without terrific staff. We are  blessed on the Energy and Commerce Committee by having really terrific  staff, from top to bottom.   But today, I especially want to recognize and thank Mike Bloomquist,  my staff director at the Energy and Commerce Committee. He has served  as staff director of the Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans both  during the 115th Congress and the 116th Congress.   He previously served as committee deputy staff director, general  counsel, deputy general counsel, and then as general counsel to the  2011 Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. He has spent time in  private law practice, at the Committee on Science, and in the Office of  the Solicitor at the U.S. Department of the Interior.   He has been an invaluable leader of the Energy and Commerce Committee  staff. He is a trusted counselor. He is a sought-after mentor and a go- to resource for staff and Members alike, both on and off the committee.   He will be leaving us at the end of this month to pursue private- sector endeavors. But I just want to say, he has been a real friend to  me, a real counselor to me, and an incredibly solid leader for our  team. He has helped us shepherd major legislation through the House,  which has undoubtedly improved the lives of Americans, through his time  as a public servant.   I think we all wish him the very best in his new endeavor and are  thankful to his wife, Christie, and their three daughters for lending  us their dad so often on nights and weekends and for phone calls, text  messages, and more phone calls from me, day and night.   He has just been terrific to work with. We wish him Godspeed in his  next endeavor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would just conclude my remarks by, again, speaking in favor of the  underlying legislation, but also thanking Mike and his team for doing  such a great job throughout this Congress and the preceding one to help  all of us come together and solve the Nation's problems to the best of  our ability. They really are a talented team, and we have been  fortunate to have Mike at the helm.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4439, the Creating Hope  Reauthorization Act, introduced by our colleagues, Representative  Butterfield and Representative McCaul. This bill extends the pediatric  priority review voucher program for an additional 4 years.   This program, which has had bipartisan support since it was first  created in 2012 with the passage of the Food and Drug Administration  Safety and Innovation Act, aims to incentivize the development of  therapies to treat rare pediatric diseases.   The pediatric PRV program has already proven successful in  encouraging innovation. In fact, 22 therapies have been approved for  the treatment of 18 rare pediatric diseases since its inception.  However, we still have a long way to go. Nearly 95 percent of all rare  diseases do not have an FDA-approved treatment, leaving many patients  with no options.   This long-term reauthorization of the program will provide certainty  to those currently developing or considering investment in innovative  therapies to treat rare pediatric diseases.   Bipartisan bills that encourage biomedical innovation like the one we  are considering today mean continued hope for children and their  families that, one day, there will be a treatment and that there will  be a cure.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), who is a serious leader on this  issue and has been for a long time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Texas for  his great leadership on this issue. I encourage our colleagues to vote  for this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Davis for yielding.   To Karen Shimkus and the family, thank you for sharing John with all  of us for so many years. Thank you for your warmth and friendship as  well.   I am told that John is a big fan of the movie ``Tombstone.'' As the  former chairman of the committee, now ranking member of the committee,  there are a couple of great quotes out of ``Tombstone'' that I think  sum up for many of us who have the pleasure to serve with him and see  his passion for his district, see his passion for his community, see  his passion for good policy. One of them would be when Kurt Russell  said: ``Tell him the law is coming. You tell 'em I'm coming and hell's  coming with me.''    When you want somebody at your side fighting for a cause, that sums  up   John Shimkus.   Russell also said: ``You called down thunder. Well, now you've got  it.''   As we have tackled these issues and we have watched John stand up for  the people that sent him here, we know that he is by their side. And he  not only brings the passion, but he brings the intellect and he brings  deep principle to every fight.   So, John, we wish you and Karen and the family well.   God speed in your next endeavor, my friend.
