 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and the chairman  for their work on this proposed resolution. But I want to remind my  colleagues that one of the problems that we face in Turkey and Syria  today is the failure of congressional leadership to address this issue.   When I stood on this very floor during the Obama administration and  the question of Syria came up, I remember many of my colleagues  agreeing with me that we should not be in Syria with boots on the  ground, risking our most precious assets of our young men and women,  without a clear Authorization for Use of Military Force and  congressional approval of a resolution to do so.   We failed in the leadership here in this body. That is why, as we go  through this resolution, I understand the Turkish sanctions. I  understand. But make no mistake about it, by voting ``yes'' on this  resolution, you are authorizing the use of military force of our men  and women on Syrian soil.   If force needs to be redeployed to this area, I do not want to hear  from any Member of this Chamber, nor the Senate, that we have not  authorized our men and women to be there.   It is time for us to set aside political cowardice because we cannot  make the hard choices of approving a military force resolution. We  should join and unite--the House, the Senate, and the White House--in  one congressional declaration that we, if we put our men and women in  harm's way, stand by it and stand by the Commander in Chief in regard  to that request.                                time  1330
