 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, at the end of May, Facebook announced that  it would no longer censor claims that the coronavirus was man-made. The  mainstream media, which had savaged the story during the previous  administration, suddenly started backpedaling, and the Biden White  House, which had reportedly canceled the previous administration's  investigation into whether the novel coronavirus originated in a Wuhan  lab, announced a 90-day inquiry into the virus's origins.   The occasion for all this backpedaling was apparently a report in the  Wall Street Journal that three researchers who worked at Wuhan  Institute of Virology ``sought hospital care'' in late 2019 for  symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. In the wake of that report,  it became impossible for the President or the mainstream media or  Facebook to deny what had always been a plausible theory: that the  virus came from the virology lab in Wuhan.   Journalists moved to explain their previous rejection of this theory,  and some of them openly admitted what had been obvious: that they  rejected the theory not because of flaws in the theory itself but  because of those who had advanced this hypothesis.   We don't know what these revived investigations will ultimately show,  but the Wuhan reversal illustrates multiple issues. One, of course, is  the need to remember that our social media experience is heavily  curated. The posts and ads we see are selected for us by complex  algorithms that analyze the data social media companies have collected  on each of us and curate our experience accordingly.   On top of that, as the past year or two has illustrated, social media  companies actively censor certain material, meaning that there are  posts we will never see.   As chairman and now ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee's  Communications and Tech Subcommittee, I have pushed for transparency  requirements for social media companies, and I have introduced two  bipartisan bills that would increase internet transparency while  preserving the light-touch approach to regulation that has allowed the  internet to flourish.   My Filter Bubble Transparency Act would allow social media users to  opt out of the filter bubble--in other words, to opt out of the  filtered experience tailored for them by opaque algorithms--and instead  see an unfiltered social media feed or search results.   The Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, which I introduced  with Senator Schatz, would increase transparency and accountability  around content moderation. Sites would be required to provide an easily  digestible disclosure of their content moderation practices for users,  and, importantly, they would be required to explain their decisions to  remove material to consumers.   Under the PACT Act, if a site chose to remove your post, it would  have to tell you why it decided to remove your post. The PACT Act would  also require sites to have an appeals process. So if Facebook, for  example, removed one of your posts, it would not only have to tell you  why, but it would have to provide a way for you to appeal that  decision.   Let me be clear. Private entities are free to have their own opinions  and viewpoints and should not be compelled by the government to publish  alternative views, but that is not what we are talking about with these  large social media platforms. Most strongly deny that they are  publishers and instead hold themselves forth as neutral platforms for  the free exchange of ideas from all corners. That is the promise they  make to consumers.   The Wuhan reversal is more than a reminder that our social media  experience is actually a heavily curated one. It also raises serious  questions about censorship and the maintenance of the marketplace of  ideas that is a hallmark of a free society. There is no free society  without the free exchange of ideas. Freedom of speech, freedom of the  press, freedom of religion, freedom to speak in the public square--all  of these are essential elements of a free society. The more a  government or other entities crack down on freedom of speech and the  free exchange of ideas, the more we move away from a free society and  toward tyranny.   I say ``or other entities'' because the responsibility for protecting  the free exchange of ideas extends beyond the government. Government,  of course, has an absolute obligation to defend our fundamental  freedoms, but other institutions in society also have a role. You can't  have a free society without free institutions. I am thinking here  particularly of the press, universities, and in this day and age,  social media companies.   If the press or social media companies only sanction one narrative-- the narrative preferred by the government or by social elites or by any  other group--the marketplace of ideas shrinks substantially. If  multiple groups that should be fostering the free exchange of ideas  combine to limit or advance a particular narrative, they start to  control public opinion instead of allowing individuals to form their  own opinions based on a free flow of information.   Unfortunately, as the Wuhan story illustrates, today we are seeing a  real movement to restrict the free flow of ideas. Whether we are  talking about speech codes or social media censorship, more and more,  we are seeing a preferred narrative being advanced and opinions outside  of that preferred narrative being censored or marginalized.   We see it in government with bills like S. 1, which would, among  other things, allow the IRS to consider an organization's views before  deciding whether or not to grant it tax-exempt status, or the Equality  Act, which would crack down on freedom of speech and freedom of  religion in unprecedented ways. We see it outside government when media  outlets engage in selective reporting to highlight an accepted  narrative instead of reporting the news and the facts, whatever they  are, or when social media censors legitimate theories or stories or  when universities crack down on free speech.   In the wake of the Wuhan lab story, we saw widespread censorship  across government, social media, and the press for political reasons.  President Biden seemingly shut down the former President's  investigation into the virus's origin because it was the former  President's investigation. Democrats in Congress pressured social media  companies to censor information that contradicted the narrative that  they  [[Page S4604]]  were embracing. The mainstream media savaged the lab origin story.  Social media sites censored it. And all of this happened because of the  political affiliation of the people advancing this reasonable  hypothesis.   You can only have a marketplace of ideas if ideas actually get out  there, which is why censorship, as I have said, is antithetical to a  free society. It is also important to note--and this is a critical,  critical point--that having a free marketplace of ideas means allowing  some ideas that might be wrong, that might seem offensive, that might  seem silly. We are not talking about content that, for example,  promotes violence but ideas that are provocative, debatable, or out of  the mainstream. The alternative is allowing the government or some  other entity to decide what information we see and what we believe.   It is important to remember that sometimes ideas that seem silly or  wrong initially turn out to be right. More than one widely accepted  scientific theory started out as a fringe position. A prevailing  opinion may turn out to be wrong, and political or social power doesn't  necessarily equal truth.   I hope that their abrupt reversal on COVID's possible origins makes  media organizations and social media platforms think twice the next  time they consider censoring a story. I hope it reminds them of the  dangers of restricting the free flow of ideas and of their obligation  to separate their politics from their jobs   In a speech he delivered in 1967, Ronald Reagan, marveling at our  government by the people, said this:         Perhaps you and I have lived too long with this miracle to       properly be appreciative. Freedom is a fragile thing, and       it's never more than one generation away from extinction. It       is not ours by way of inheritance; it must be fought for and       defended constantly by each generation, for it comes only       once to a people.    I fear that long acquaintance with the blessings of liberty--with the  blessings of a free press and freedom of speech and freedom of  religion--has sometimes made us careless about the preservation of  these freedoms. We are used to them, and we assume that they will  always be with us. But, as Ronald Reagan pointed out, freedom has to be  actively safeguarded, or it will be lost.   I have seen too many instances lately where our cherished First  Amendment freedoms are subordinated to a political and social agenda,  and I hope, I hope that the Wuhan story reminds us of the  responsibility that each one of us has to safeguard these freedoms,  lest they slip away from us.
