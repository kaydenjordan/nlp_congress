 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later today the Senate Republicans will  release their version of the tax bill. The bill will not include a  single idea of Democrats in the Senate. Not a single Democrat has had  any input into this bill. It was constructed entirely behind closed  doors by the majority party, who have no intention of negotiating with  Democrats because they locked themselves into a partisan process that  only requires a majority vote.   They are trying to rush it through this Chamber with reckless speed.  Why? Because my friends on the other side know that the longer their  bill is out there for the public to see, the less the public likes it.  Their only hopes of passing it are to rush it through before anyone can  grapple with the stunning hypocrisy at the center of their plan.   The Republican majority has repeatedly promised a middle-class tax  bill, but instead, they have concocted a bill grounded in tax cuts for  big corporations and the very rich. They actually hurt middle-class  people because they need to give those big breaks for the wealthiest.   While promising that their plan gives ``everyone a tax cut''--that is  what Speaker Ryan said again today--multiple independent analyses  conclude that the House Republican tax plan would increase taxes on  millions of middle-class families, contrary to what Republicans  promised and what Donald Trump has promised. They said: No middle-class  people will get an increase. This is aimed at helping the middle class.   But the vast majority of the help goes to the wealthiest and biggest  corporations. A New York Times analysis found that next year the House  Republican plan would cause taxes to go up on one-third of all middle- class families. By 2026 taxes will go up on nearly half of all middle- class families.   So even if you come from a State with a lower tax rate--a red State-- it is probably a good bet that a quarter of the middle-class families  will get a tax increase. I think the lowest I saw was 17 percent for  West Virginia.   So this hurts middle-class people, and it hurts certain middle-class  people much more than others--people who have student loans, people who  have high medical expenses, people who come from States where there are  large property taxes, people who have big mortgages. These are middle- class people. They should not get a tax increase.   Mark Mazer, director of the independent Tax Policy Center, said:         You could create a plan that just cuts taxes for middle-      class people. That's not what this is.    That is him, not me. It is what Republicans promised people.   Now, we will see what the Senate comes up with today. But several  Republican Senators have already confirmed that the Senate bill has the  same structure as the House bill, and, in at least one way, we know it  is worse for middle-class families than the House bill because the  House bill will reduce the value of State and local deductions by 70  percent, while the Senate bill eliminates it entirely. My friend from  Ohio, Senator Portman, confirmed that a few days ago on FOX Business.   This should be a three-alarm fire for every House Republican in  California, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Washington, Illinois,  Colorado, and Minnesota. Senate Republicans are telling House  Republicans there will be no compromise on State and local  deductibility. It is full repeal or bust because Senate Republicans  need the revenue raised by ending this popular middle-class deduction.   There are several deficit hawks in the Senate. We have stricter  budget rules for reconciliation. If the Senate tax plan includes cuts  to the corporate rate, the pass-through rate, and on upper tax  brackets--which dramatically increase the deficit--they will need the  revenue from the full repeal of State and local to make the numbers  work.   So I say to every one of my Republican colleagues in the House who  comes from a suburban district: This bill could be your political doom.  Don't let the special interests, don't let the party leadership push  you into doing something that is bad for so many of your constituents.  You will pay a price.   House Republicans should kill the bill now if they want to have any  hope of stopping the full repeal of the State and local deduction. They  can't hide behind the so-called compromise in the House bill. It is  nothing more than a temporary fig leaf for full and permanent repeal.   As I said, if House Republicans don't kill it now, it will come back  to haunt them. The overwhelming Democratic turnout in suburban  districts in Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania should send shivers  down the spine of House Republicans who represent those districts.  Voting to repeal the State and local deduction--walloping the middle- class and upper middle-class suburbs--would be political suicide, all  this to bow down to the special big interests of large corporations.   Even with the compromise, the House numbers are devastating.  Representative MacArthur said he was shown information that shows the  compromise is good for his district, and he went from a no to a  ``leans'' yes, according to POLITICO.   Representative MacArthur, go look at the real numbers.  [[Page S7127]]    Forty-three percent of taxpayers in Representative MacArthur's  district take the State and local deduction, for an average of $11,987  per deduction. Over half of the value of these deductions is not the  property tax at all. It is State and local income taxes, which will be  taken away under the plan.   Then, according to IRS data, there are a good number for whom the  property taxes are over $10,000, meaning the compromise still wouldn't  help them. So I would not, if I were Representative MacArthur, listen  to the numbers the Republican leadership is giving him. I would do my  own independent analysis because I believe he would find them to be a  lot worse than what the leadership is telling him.   I say to my other Republican colleagues: Don't fall for those quick  numbers. Go do your own looking at this. It is a lot worse than your  leadership is telling you.   One final point here on taxes, for some reason the conventional  wisdom on the Republican side is that because of the stunning depth of  their losses in the recent elections, there is even a greater need to  pass the tax plan. We have to do this or we will fall apart, they said.  It makes no sense. They are misreading the public.   Ed Gillespie, for all of his divisive ads, also ran a traditional  establishment campaign. The linchpin of his campaign was the $1,000 tax  cut for everybody. It got him nowhere. Exit polls from the Virginia  election showed that the No. 1 issue on voters' minds was healthcare,  and they voted overwhelmingly Democratic. Yet, amazingly, Republicans  may repeal the individual mandate as part of their tax bill. How do  they think that is going to fly?   Despite the spin from Republican leaders, passing this plan will not  help Republicans climb out of the hole they are in. It will bury them  deeper. Maybe if they pass the bill, they will not say they are in  disarray for the moment, but already this bill has had a miserable  rollout. You know that when a party rolls out their No. 1 legislative  plan, there should be trumpets and bands, but the public knows already  that the bill favors the wealthy. The public knows that middle-class  people get a tax increase.   So at best, the rollout of this bill has been mixed. I would say it  has been negative, and the American people agree because many more  people are against this bill than are for it, according to all of the  polls. Passing a partisan tax plan that favors the wealthy and raises  taxes on millions of middle-class and upper middle-class families in  the suburbs is no political cure. It is political poison.   The real way to win back the esteem of the American people would be  to put partisanship aside, put a giant tax cut for the wealthy on the  shelf, and come work with Democrats on real bipartisan reform.   Mr. President, I would also like to just announce my strong  opposition to Mr. Wehrum to the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation.   While working in senior roles at the Office during the Bush  administration, Mr. Wehrum led the efforts to weaken clean air  protections. During his tenure, courts ruled that the Agency violated  the Clean Air Act 30 times. Mr. Wehrum represented industry clients  against the EPA 31 times since 2008.   He does not deserve to be in this position. Anyone who cares about  the lungs of their children should not want Mr. Wehrum in that  position. I hope we will get some bipartisan support to reject this  really awful nomination.   I yield the floor.
