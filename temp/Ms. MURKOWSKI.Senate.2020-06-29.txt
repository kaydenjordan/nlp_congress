 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am awaiting my colleague, the  ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to come.  We are going to engage in a short colloquy about our energy bill.   But before we do that and before he arrives, I would like to comment  on a matter that my friend and also fellow traveler on the Energy and  Natural Resources Committee, Senator Cantwell, raised on the floor just  about an hour ago, and this is with regards to a provision within the  National Defense Authorization Act. This is section 3111, related to  the review of the adequacy of the nuclear weapons budget at DOE.   She has raised the concerns and articulated them extraordinarily  well. Know that, as the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee, I joined with my friend and colleague, the ranking member,  in sending a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, as  well as the ranking member, outlining the concerns that we had with  this provision and really very, very clearly alarmed about the lack of  the Energy Committee's involvement in drafting this section 3111.   But as Senator Cantwell had outlined, what this provision would do is  effectively empower sub-Cabinet level officials, primarily from DOD, to  make potentially sweeping decisions about DOE's budget, going against  what we think is good governance, in contravention of the Department of  Energy Organization Act, and, as she outlined, it could put you in a  situation where the priorities from the Department of Energy through  the Secretary of Energy, whether it is cleanup of legacy defense waste,  cyber security, funding for energy innovation, all of these priorities  could basically be put at the wayside. We have significant, significant  concerns about this.   I ask unanimous consent that the copy of the letter that Senator  Manchin and I sent to Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed,  outlining the concerns that we have, be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, June 26, 2020.      Hon. Jim Inhofe,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jack Reed,      Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed: As the Senate       begins consideration of the National Defense Authorization       Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2021, we write to express our       opposition to Section 3111, related to the review of the       adequacy of the nuclear weapons budget at the Department of       Energy (DOE), and several related sections. As written, these       provisions would undermine and subordinate the Secretary of       Energy's statutory authority, including his or her       responsibility to prepare a budget for congressional review,       and would likely result in collateral damage for DOE's non-      weapons priorities.        Section 3111 directs the Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC),       which is comprised of five officials from the Department of       Defense (DOD) and the Administrator of the National Nuclear       Security Administration (NNSA), to determine whether DOE's       proposed budget request is adequate, ``in whole or in part,       to implement the objectives of the Department of Defense with       respect to nuclear weapons for that fiscal year.'' If the NWC       determines the budget request is inadequate for that purpose,       it is required to provide recommendations, including for       funding levels and initiatives, to the Secretary of Energy.       The Secretary of Energy is then required to accept those       recommendations verbatim and wholesale, with no ability to       improve or depart from them.        We support the objectives of increased stewardship of       taxpayer dollars, transparency, and oversight of the DOE and       NNSA budget as our nation embarks on the modernization of the       nuclear weapons stockpile. Those objectives will help ensure       continued stockpile safety, security, and reliability.       However, as the leaders of the Senate Energy and Natural       Resources Committee with jurisdiction over DOE and its       National Laboratories, we are alarmed by the lack of our       Committee's involvement in the drafting of Section 3111 and       related provisions.        Most immediately, Section 3111 would empower subcabinet       level officials, primarily from DOD, to make potentially       sweeping decisions about DOE's budget. We believe this goes       against good governance and is in contravention of the       Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977. The NWC has a       narrower focus than the Secretary of Energy, and its       recommendations would likely prioritize nuclear weapons at       the expense of other critical missions undertaken by DOE,       ranging from the cleanup of legacy defense waste sites to the       cybersecurity of our electric grid and funding for energy       innovation.        We are also concerned that Section 3111 and its related       sections would complicate the current statutory process by       adding unnecessary steps before the DOE and NNSA budget       request is finalized and thereby serve to delay DOE's ability       to submit its annual proposal to Congress.        The Secretary of Energy must maintain clear control over,       and accountability for, the Department's budget. The       Secretary's statutory responsibility to certify the       reliability of the nuclear stockpile must also be preserved.       Alignment of the DOD and DOE nuclear weapon responsibilities       cannot come at a cost to other critical DOE programs.        We appreciate your leadership on the NDAA bill but hope you       will work with our Committee on provisions that impact DOE,       the Secretary of Energy, and the NNSA. We filed several       amendments to NDAA to strike Section 3111 and its related       provisions, and we ask that you accept those while we work       towards a compromise that avoids the impacts outlined here.            Sincerely,      Senator Lisa Murkowski,        Chairman      Senator Joe Manchin III,        Ranking Member.                        American Energy Innovation Act     Madam President, I have come to the floor this  afternoon to be with my good friend, the Senator from West Virginia, to  talk about our American Energy Innovation Act. I talked on the floor  and we talked on the floor for a long while now, talking about the  process that we used. We spent more than a year working with members of  our Energy Committee and many other Members of this Chamber to put  together an overwhelming bipartisan package.   We focused on a range of promising technologies, including energy  storage, renewable energy, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, cleaner  vehicles, and energy efficiency. We worked to improve cyber security.  It would help modernize the electric grid. It addresses known  weaknesses in our mineral security and our supply chains. It focuses on  boosting the workforce development and job creation. It renews a range  of popular programs, from ARPA-E to Weatherization Assistance.   It is a significant bill, and as you may recall, we were on this bill  earlier in the year in February, and an unrelated matter stalled that  measure out. It is stalled, but it is not dead, and I tell you that I  remain 100 percent committed to advancing our bill into law before the  end of the year. I know that this is something that Senator Manchin and  I agree on very, very strongly, that we continue our work to advance  the energy bill into law.    Well, Senator Manchin, I think we both would agree  that we were more than ready to pass the bipartisan bill before the  pandemic hit, and, as you point out, I think it is even more important,  and I am certainly more ready than ever to pass that.   As you mentioned, the U.S. economy, our quality of life, and our  health all depend on stable, secure, and an innovative energy industry.  What we do within this bill--and, again, it is a very, very bipartisan  bill--is we ensure that we remain a global energy leader while  strengthening our security, making timely investments in clean  technologies, and rebuilding our supply chains. And we have been  talking a lot about the imperative to focus on the vulnerability of our  supply chains.   But it also helps us capture the industries of the future and all the  jobs and the benefits that are associated with them. So, as I mentioned  before, it will help to improve our cyber security and foster  innovation. When you think about the economic growth that we have seen  in this country since World War II, it is that innovation that helps  spur that economic recovery.   So, again, I feel pretty strongly that this bill was important before  the pandemic, and it is even more important now as we try to focus on  our Nation's recovery. I think that is where we can also help. Wouldn't  you agree, Senator Manchin?    It is absolutely the best path forward. When you take  the good committee work that we have engaged in and you then bring that  to the floor, as we have, we had substantive process. We are so close  to getting this measure actually through the Senate, but I think we  recognize that, as we do that, that ideal package is not before us  right yet.   As the chairman and the ranking member on the committee, we have  received requests from Members who have items in our energy bill who  are seeking to include them as potential amendments on the NDAA, which  is currently on the floor. I have actually filed two amendments to  NDAA. One is the text of our Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, and the  other is our American Mineral Security Act. Effectively, this provides  a second pathway in case we remain blocked on our energy bill. I want  to say that this is not the preferred path at all. That is not where we  want to go with this bill.   My clear, clear, clear, and undeniable preference is that we enact  all of these measures as part of the energy package. So to my  colleagues who might think, ``Well, wait, I see a few energy-related  provisions; what is going on?'' we are not taking our foot off the gas  of our American Energy Innovation Act.   I know, Senator Manchin, you have been working with us on some of  these amendments that we are dealing with within NDAA, but I know you  also greatly prefer to pass them as part of our broader energy bill.    Senator Manchin, the thought of having to start over-- as you say, to start from scratch--is absolutely the wrong way to  address our energy policies and the reforms that are needed. I  completely and fully agree with you. It would be a mistake. It would be  a significant mistake for Congress to simply give up on energy policy  for yet another year.   As you have indicated, Congress last enacted a major energy bill in  2007. That is more than 12\1/2\ years ago. That is unacceptable.   That is the thing that is holding us back then, but even despite the  fact that we have not been able to update our energy laws, we have even  an oil-and-gas renaissance. The cost of renewables has declined  sharply. New technologies have begun to emerge. We have new challenges  and opportunities to address, but what is missing here is the U.S.  Congress coming together to modernize our Nation's energy policy.   I think it would be a mistake to decide that this is just too hard;  that there is not enough time left. We have been down that road before.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are so far along in this process that we just  need to keep pushing and keep moving. We are so far along, but that  thinking would push us back to a reset or a restart. It is just not  where we want to be.  [[Page S3638]]    Senator Manchin, I will just ask one final question; that is, whether  you agree that there will be no giving up at any point from either one  of us on this very important American Energy Innovation Act.    Thank you.   With that, I yield the floor.
