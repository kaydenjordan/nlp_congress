 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleague, our Leader  Pelosi, to congratulate the 2018 NBA champions, my home team, the  Golden State Warriors.   Now, on Friday, the world watched as the Warriors swept the Cleveland  Cavaliers and claimed their third NBA title in 4 years. Led by two-time  MVP Steph Curry and two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant, the Warriors  have cemented their dynasty in NBA history.   The team is an example for young people, showing that if you can work  together, you can accomplish anything.   These finals against the talented Cleveland Cavaliers were a thrill  to watch. We saw basketball at its best, incredible talent, and a real  passion from both sides.   Thank you to the Warriors for making our dreams of another  championship a reality. This remarkable team has made history as one of  the best ever.   I want to extend my thanks to Coach Steve Kerr for his tremendous  leadership, as well as the entire Warriors organization.   Today, the bay area is celebrating our remarkable team in my  beautiful City of Oakland, as in Oaktown, and I know that my late  mother, Mildred Massey, who was a loyal Warriors fan, is smiling down  on us.   Go Warriors. Go Oakland. Go Dub Nation.                            ____________________
