 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and the  legacy of Joe Vandever, Sr., who passed away recently at the age of 96.   Joe was a Navajo native code talker, a member of an elite group that  used their native tongue to create unbreakable codes and transmit top- secret messages during World War II.   Joe bravely enlisted with the U.S. Marine Corps at the age of 20 and  served in nine different locations until he was honorably discharged as  a corporal in 1946.   Here is a great part of his story, besides all the work he did for  our military. Joe is survived by his sister, his six children, 36  grandchildren, 55 great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild.   We must never forget the immense bravery and sacrifices made by the  Navajo code talkers. They saved countless lives and helped turn the  tide of World War II.   Pat and I are keeping Joe's family and friends and the entire Navajo  Nation community in our prayers as we mourn his passing.   There are very few code talkers left in our country today. I have  gotten to know most of them, and it has been a great honor.                            ____________________
