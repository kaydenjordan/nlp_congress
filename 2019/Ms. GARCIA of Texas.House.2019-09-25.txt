 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2203, a bill introduced by my dear friend  from Texas, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar.   There is a humanitarian crisis at the southern border and within the  American immigration system. The Homeland Security Improvement Act is a  critical bill, not a do-nothing bill. It is a critical bill that  addresses our Nation's immigration challenges at the border in a  responsible and humane manner by ensuring accountability and oversight  through the creation of an ombudsman.  [[Page H7932]]    Our American values, moral conscience, and Constitution require that  we treat all individuals on American soil humanely and respectfully.  This bill helps ensure that that happens.   Congress must continue working to finally end the humanitarian crisis  at the southern border. This is a step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 2203.
