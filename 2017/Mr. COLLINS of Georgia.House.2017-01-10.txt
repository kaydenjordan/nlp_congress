 Mr. Speaker, last night, as we all watched  football, no matter who you rooted for, team sports also still comes  down to individuals. Last night, a young man named Deshaun Watson--the  favorite son of Gainesville, Georgia, my hometown--showed the character  that I have witnessed since he was a young boy, playing with my son in  the 7- and 8-year-old little flag football league.   His athletic ability has never been questioned, and last night it was  on full display for the world to see. I believe that he is the best  college football player in the country. Beyond football playing, he is  a better man. He is looking forward to the leadership of his team, to  the leadership of his classmates, and the leadership he has shown in  his community back in Gainesville is exemplary and will not be  forgotten.   Gainesville is proud of its favorite son, Deshaun Watson, and of the  national championship that he won last night with his team, Clemson,  during the football game. But, as with everything in life, as the game  ended, it reminded us that the games are played by men of character.  Deshaun Watson is a man of character, and I look forward to watching  his career as he goes forward.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House  Republican Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and  ask for its immediate consideration.
