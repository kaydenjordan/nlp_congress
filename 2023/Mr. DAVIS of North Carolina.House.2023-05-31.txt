 Mr. Speaker, I too rise to honor a true  North Carolinian, Conen Morgan. Conen was taken from us at the age of  42 in a recent boating accident.   Mr. Speaker, he dearly loved North Carolina. Conen used his God-given  talents to make our State and Nation better.   He led the Longleaf Agency. Conen was wise beyond his years and known  for his knack and insights into our State and Nation.   Conen's hard work, determination, and dedication did not go  unnoticed. He made a positive impact on the lives of people across  North Carolina.   We will miss his warmth whenever he walked into a room and his  infectious smile.   Mr. Speaker, I join those in eastern North Carolina and across our  State in sending our deepest sympathy to his wife, Reyna; his family;  and friends.                            ____________________
