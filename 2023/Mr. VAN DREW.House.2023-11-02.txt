 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on this very important  issue.   Mr. Chairman, it would be hard to find a district that has been more  of a petri dish for the experiments of the Office of Renewable Energy  Programs at BOEM than mine. I live it every single day.   Before I go on and talk about this, just from the heart, the projects  that are coming up--fortunately, one of them, Orsted, some of you may  have heard of it, has now left--have received billions of dollars of  funding from the State and Federal Government. They, themselves, admit  it would reduce our tourism industry, but they minimized it. The  company itself said it would reduce it by approximately $1.1 billion  only. It would kill our fishing industry.                                time  1230    It would really create very serious situations in our national  defense and our national security. It would increase utility rates,  again, according to the company itself, so it is probably much worse  than the amount I previously stated; two to three to four times as much  as we currently pay. It is a plan that would rely upon foreign  countries to supply our energy. How stupid is that.   It has been a painful process. Thank God we won the first step when  this huge, multinational, Danish company decided they couldn't take it  anymore. We had a movement in south Jersey at our shore. Our shore  counts. We have a beautiful, clean, pristine environment. It was an  organic movement. It was the people. We had rallies. I myself produced  5,000 signs saying: Stop wind turbines. Renew and keep our beautiful  shore.   This is from the heart. This was a bad plan that would industrialize  the areas that they are focused upon and would cost a great deal of  money.   Mr. Chair, it would be hard to find a district that has been more of  a petri dish for the experiments of the Office of Renewable Energy at  BOEM than mine.   In South Jersey, the industrialization of our shorelines at the hands  of foreign offshore wind companies has been a top priority for BOEM and  the Biden Administration.   Lies, lack of accurate information, and poor community engagement  were rampant as offshore wind companies and their friends in the  federal government tried to force these projects forward.   Well, I am happy to say that as of this week, much of the South  Jersey coastline has been liberated from this threat.   But the Office of Renewable Energy's goals are clear: they want to  force this President's Green New Deal agenda forward by any means  necessary.   So, in a time of exceedingly high fuel prices and inflation, it is  unconscionable to continue to send tens of millions of taxpayer dollars  to an office whose priorities will only exacerbate these problems.  [[Page H5277]]    We must direct our resources towards tangible priorities, not  partisan ideologies.   I hope all of my colleagues will join us in voting for this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for  yielding.   Peace through strength. This is the principle that is called upon us  today. If we are truly the beacon of democracy for all the world, we  must help our greatest ally, Israel. We must help them from the threats  to its very existence.   It is a message to the world that we stand with our allies; that we  will help shield Israel from the rockets of Hamas; that we will help  shield Israel from the death, the torture, the rape of babies and  children and mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers.   We have seen the face of evil. We will take a resolute stand against  terrorism wherever it is and whenever it is. It is an unwavering  commitment to Israel's absolute right to defend itself, its absolute  right to do whatever is necessary.   I implore all my colleagues, let us stand with Israel. This is a  simple yes-or-no vote. Vote ``yes'' to stand with Israel. It is right.  It is necessary.
