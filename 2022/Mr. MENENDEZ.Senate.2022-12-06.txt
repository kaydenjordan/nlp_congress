M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank: The M1A1 Abrams is a       first-generation American main battle tank, produced by       General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) and named for General       Creighton Abrams. M1A1 Abrams tank components are as follows:        a. Fire Enhancement Program (FEP): The FEP is the USMC M1A1       tank equivalent to the US Army domestic 2nd GEN FLIR. The       main difference between the two is in the switch-ology, with       the FEP having four (4) Search/Stare options as opposed to       the six (6) available on the 2nd GEN FLIR. The FEP provides       lethality upgrades to increase the M1A1 tank crew's ability       to detect, recognize, and identify targets. It hosts a       second-generation thermal sight (Abrams Integrated Display       and Targeting System-AIDATS), a North Finding Module/Far       Target Location capability displayed in sight (providing up       to 50x digital magnification), and Embedded diagnostics to       help troubleshoot the system. The FEP increases all-weather       engagement ranges, crew situational awareness and target       location accuracy.        b. Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) 9181E: The IRU is an       inertial navigation system that provides accurate vehicle       heading, attitude, position, elevation and navigation       information to the host vehicle prime system and operators,       both stationary and when moving under all operating       conditions.        The Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) can be configured as a       navigator (NavPAC) or as a pointing device (North Finding       Module, NFM). In either configuration, the IRU contains a GPS       receiver that provides vehicle location and velocities as       well as satellite tracking status. These GPS observations are       used by the IRU's Kalman filter to improve and enhance its       performance. The GPS unit is a Ground-Based GPS Receiver       Application Module (GB-GRAM) provided by Rockwell-Collins.       The Miniature PLGR Engine-SAASM (MPE-S), when keyed, provides       the Precise Positioning System (PPS) GPS data inputs to the       system. The system is a Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing       Module (SAASM) based PPS GPS. The SAASM encapsulates all       classified data and signal processing into one tamper-proof       module. The SAASM provides jamming and spoofing protection       for US and allied forces operating in hostile environments.        c. 120mm Main Gun (Cannon) & M256 Gun Barrel: The Abrams       120mm main gun system is composed of a 120 millimeter (mm)       smoothbore gun (cannon) also referred to as the M256 gun       barrel; armor-piercing, fin stabilized, discarded sabot       (APFSDS) and other warheads; and combustible cartridge case       ammunition.        d. AGT-1500 Gas Turbine Propulsion System: The use of AGT-      1500 gas turbine propulsion system in the M1A1 is a unique       application of armored vehicle power pack technology.        e. Stabilized Commander's Weapon Station--(SCWS): The SCWS       provides day/night remote operation of the stabilized       Commander's machine gun in closed hatch mode while enhancing       Situational Awareness (provides CITV-like capability to the       Tank Commander Lethality). The SCWS uses a Remote Thermal       Sight (RTS) and the Abrams Integrated Display and Targeting       System (AIDATS) color display to generate motorized azimuth       and elevation variables.        Abrams Integrated Display and Targeting System (AIDATS)       operates in conjunction with the Tank Commander Single Handle       and slew-to-cue capabilities to maximize accuracy, range, and       lethality on the battlefield while decreasing enemy       engagement time by half. The AIDATS provides an upgraded       thermal and day sight on the SCWS via a high-definition       camera and permanently mounted color display.  [[Page S6992]]         f. Driver Vision Enhancer--Abrams (DVE-A) AN/VAS-5 and Rear       View Sensor System (RVSS): The AN/VAS-5 Driver Vision       Enhancer--Abrams (DVE-A) and Rear View Sensor System (RVSS)       are thermal imaging systems developed for use while driving       combat vehicles and tactical wheeled vehicles. The DVE-A       provides night vision capability for the Abrams tank driver.       RVSS provides a rear-view camera for the Abrams tank.

Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV): The Joint Light       Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program is a light tactical vehicle       designed to replace the U.S. Military's aging High Mobility       Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle fleet. It was designed to close       the existing gap in payload, performance, and protection to       our adversaries during multi-domain operations. It has been       an operationally optimal choice for the light tactical       vehicle mission spectrum anywhere in the world. All JLTV       mission variants include a strong balance of protection,       maneuverability, speed, reliability, and combat support/      combat service support capability that far surpasses any       similar vehicle developed in its weight class today.        a. The JLTV is designed to be a system of system. System of       systems is a ``set or arrangement of systems that results       when independent and useful systems are integrated into a       larger system that delivers unique capabilities. The Joint       Light Tactical Vehicle allows material and equipment from       authorized contractors or industrial facilities used by U.S.       forces in tactical operations and managed by other Program       Offices that may have considered a type of classification.       Other than its classified armor and ballistic protection, the       JLTV is considered an unclassified tactical system. When       adding integration C4ISR systems (installed or mounted),       electronic countermeasures jamming devices, navigation       systems or battle management systems to the JLTV, these       integrated or installed system will increase the over       security classification to the vehicle.        b. The JLTV's A/B Armor protection technical and test data       of armor coupon, ballistic hull exploitation, Behind Armor       Debris (BAD) and Full Up System Level (FUSL) Live Fire test       data and protection levels to include Under Body (UB) blast,       Under Wheel (UW) blast, Under Body (UB) IED, side attack (SA)       IED, direct fire, and artillery enhancements are all       classified technical information. The JLTV has inherent armor       built into the base vehicle. It is what the US Government       (USG) calls A-Kit armor. This A-Kit Inherent armor provides       both opaque and transparent armor solutions to provide a 360-      degree azimuthal (i.e., all around) to include an elevated       fire level of protection from a spectrum of kinetic energy/      small arms fire threats with survivability enhancements to       include Automatic Fire Extinguishing Protection (AFES) and       structural rollover protection of 150% of the vehicle Ground       Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). The B-kit includes: 1) a       combined underbody deflector plate and Energy Absorbent (EA)       seat mechanisms to mitigate occupant incapacity (per Annex Q)       for both anti-tank land mine blast and Improvised Explosive       Device (IED) blast and fragmentation kill mechanisms, 2) a       design that provides a higher level protection against       significantly larger Under Wheel (UW) blast threats that also       leverages vehicle frontal and rear tear-away structural       design lessons learned from OEF and OIF, 3) a direct fire B-      kit that adds on to the Inherent armor/A-Kit to defeat a       higher level all-around direct fire threat, side attack IED       attack blast and fragmentation kill mechanisms, with       additional roof armor for top attack threats that include       direct fire and artillery enhancements.        c. C4ISR systems (installed or mounted), electronic       countermeasures jamming devices, navigation systems or battle       management systems that are integrated or installed system in       the JLTV will follow the same security guidelines based on       their program security classification guide.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Poland will provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Republic of Poland.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
