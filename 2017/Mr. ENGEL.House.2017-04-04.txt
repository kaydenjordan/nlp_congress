 Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member on the House Foreign  Affairs Committee, I join with my colleagues. I want to thank the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro), who is a valued member of our  committee, for his leadership on this critical issue, and also the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires). I agree with everything that  they have said heretofore about these draconian cuts.   I am here because I am rising to strongly reject the Trump  Administration's draconian cuts to the International Affairs Budget.  Now 2\1/2\ months into the Trump Administration, I find myself deeply  troubled by the direction American foreign policy is heading on many  fronts. I was particularly shocked when the White House released its  fiscal year 2018 budget calling for a 31 percent cut to American  diplomacy and development efforts.   In my view, cutting the International Affairs Budget by even a  fraction of that amount would be devastating. We haven't seen many  details, but a cut that drastic would surely mean that too many efforts  and initiatives that do so much good would wind up on the chopping  block.   Here is the bottom line: Slashing diplomacy and development puts  American lives at risk. If we no longer have diplomacy and development  tools to meet international challenges, what does that leave? It leaves  the military.   Now, don't get me wrong. I have always supported a strong national  defense, and I do support our military, and I do support giving them  more money. But I also support using military force only as a measure  of last resort. We should not send American servicemembers into harm's  way unless we have exhausted every other option. If we are not  investing in diplomacy and development, we aren't even giving these  other options a chance.    We rely on diplomacy to resolve conflicts across negotiating tables  at multilateral gatherings and in quiet corners so that we don't need  to resolve them down the line on the battlefield. Our diplomats work to  strengthen old alliances and build new bridges of friendship and shared  understanding.   Just last week, the Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the  [[Page H2688]]  Trump Administration's efforts to decimate our International Affairs  Budget. In his testimony at the hearing, former Under Secretary of  State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said that morale at the  State Department is ``at its lowest point in my memory.''   It is deeply disturbing to hear that our diplomats, many of whom  serve in dangerous places at high risk to themselves and their  families, are so disheartened.   Of course it is not just former diplomats who reject these cuts. A  recent letter signed by more than 120 retired generals and admirals to  House and Senate leadership said: ``We urge you to ensure that  resources for the International Affairs Budget keep pace with the  growing global threats and opportunities we face. Now is not the time  to retreat.''   Mr. Speaker, I include their letter in the Record in its entirety.                                                  February 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader       McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: As you and your       colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018.       we write as retired three and four star flag and general       officers from all branches of the armed services to share our       strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy       and development alongside defense are critical to keeping       America safe.        We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises       our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from       confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle       East and North Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola and       stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater       instability. There are 65 million displaced people today. the       most since World War II, with consequences including refugee       flows that are threatening America's strategic allies in       Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and Europe.        The State Department. USAID, Millennium Challenge       Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are       critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put       our men and women in uniform in harm's way. As Secretary       James Mattis said while Commander of U.S. Central Command,       ``If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need       to buy more ammunition.'' The military will lead the fight       against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong       civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of       extremism--lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and       hopelessness.        We recognize that America's strategic investments in       diplomacy and development--like all of U.S. investments--must       be effective and accountable. Significant reforms have been       undertaken since 9/11, many of which have been embodied in       recent legislation in Congress with strong bipartisan       support--on human trafficking, the rights of women and girls.       trade and energy in Africa, wildlife trafficking. water. food       security. and transparency and accountability.        We urge you to ensure that resources for the International       Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and       opportunities we face. Now is not the time to retreat.            Sincerely,        1. General Keith B. Alexander, USA (Ret.), Director.       National Security Agency ('05-'14), Commander, U.S. Cyber       Command ('10-'14)        2. General John R.

General Anthony C. Zinni, USMC (Ret.), Commander in       Chief, U.S. Central Command ('97-'00)     Mr. Speaker, in 2013, Secretary of Defense Mattis  similarly said: ``If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I  need to buy more ammunition ultimately. So I think it's a cost benefit  ratio. The more that we put into the State Department's diplomacy,  hopefully the less we have to put into a military budget as we deal  with the outcome of an apparent American withdrawal from the  international scene.''   That is from Secretary of Defense Mattis. I couldn't agree with him  more.   Now, I believe that development helps to lift countries and  communities up today so they can become strong partners on the global  stage tomorrow. A lot of us think we have a moral obligation to help  cure disease, improve access to education, and advance human rights.  But even if it were not the right thing to do, it would be the smart  thing to do because those efforts lead to greater stability, more  responsive governments, and stronger rule of law--populations that  share our values and priorities. Poverty and lack of opportunity, on  the other hand, provide fertile ground for those who mean us harm.   All these efforts, by the way, cost cents on the dollar compared to  military engagement. People think international affairs and foreign aid  are a massive chunk of the Federal budget, but the chart right over  here next to me shows how it actually stacks up: 1.4 percent. And we  make that sliver of the pie even smaller. It will come back on us in  spades. 1.4 percent of our Federal budget goes to all these programs.   The diseases we don't combat will reach our shores; the communities  on which we turn or backs may be the next generation of people who mean  us  [[Page H2690]]  harm; and the conflicts we fail to defuse may well grow into the wars  we need to fight later at a much higher cost in terms of American blood  and treasure. Just imagine having to tell the parents of a young  American soldier that their son or daughter was killed in battle  because we weren't willing to spend the tiny sums needed to prevent the  conflict.   Finally, let me say that the American people don't want to see us  slash diplomacy and development. In fact, recent data shows that 72  percent of Americans believe the country should play a leading global  role. Nearly 6 in 10 believe funding levels at the State Department  should stay the same or increase.   Fortunately, the Congress is a coequal branch of government. I want  to the remind the executive branch of that. We in Congress decide how  much to invest in our international affairs, not the White House.   For example, regardless of how this administration is playing footsie  with Vladimir Putin, Congress will devote resources to push back  against the Kremlin's efforts to spread disinformation and destabilize  our allies, just like they did to the United States during last year's  election campaign.   I am hopeful that, as we move forward with next year's spending  bills, we continue to provide our diplomatic and development efforts  the support they need and the support they have received under  Republican and Democratic Presidents alike.   With the President's proposed cuts, I fear what message we are  sending to the world. The United States is the global standard bearer  for freedom, justice, and democracy. If we cede our role as a global  leader, make no mistake, someone will step into the void. It could very  well be another power that doesn't share our values or our interests.  Think Russia or some country like that.   We cannot allow that to happen. I am committed to ensuring it  doesn't, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to firmly reject President Trump's cuts.    You are doing a fine job.    You are doing a fine job.    You are doing a fine job.    Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree with him more. And, you  know, it is especially interesting since, during the campaign,  President Trump attacked the previous administration for not being  strong enough, for not showing American presence. And now with this  cut, with this proposed 31 percent cut, I couldn't think of anything  that would make us weaker or make us unable to do what we need to do.                                time  1845    So I hope the President remembers what he said during the campaign  and acts accordingly so that these massive cuts can be taken away.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    I would add that we give foreign aid, and it is good for  those countries, but it is also good for us. It also helps us. If there  is a drug problem in Central America, it inevitably comes up to our  border.   If there is some problem with some developing country, say, we have a  disease that could--Ebola or something like that, and we give money to  help eradicate it, well, that will prevent Ebola from coming into the  United States. So it is really a win-win situation.   Again, if we are going to be the leaders of the world, certainly of  the free world, and we want other countries to follow our lead, well,  if you are a leader, you have to lead. What we are doing is in our own  best interests, not only just in the other countries' best interests.   I think it is important to say that. And it is important to, again,  say, 1 percent--1.4 percent of our total budget is all the foreign aid  and all the money that we give in terms of eradicating diseases, in  terms of crime, in terms of everything that is actually very important  to us as well. The American people think it is much higher, but it is  not.   So if you take the President's slashing of it, it would virtually  make all of this impossible to do. So it is a program that is a win-win  situation.    Absolutely. Again, I want to reiterate that we are not the  leaders of the world because we anointed ourselves. We are the leaders  of the world because we provided leadership for all of these years,  particularly after World War II, and it is important to engage with the  world.   One of the gentlemen mentioned some of the things that the President  said. You know, one of the things he did was he called NATO obsolete.  That kind of talk worries me because it is our alliances that are the  pillar of our foreign policy and the strength of the United States and  our alliances which have worked so well since World War II.   So if we denigrate our alliances, and then we cut funding for all  these programs that help various countries so we can be a leader by  about a third, that doesn't say much for a robust foreign policy. You  get to be a leader by acting like a leader, not by pulling away from  the world.
