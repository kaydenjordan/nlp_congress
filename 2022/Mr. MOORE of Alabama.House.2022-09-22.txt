 Mr. Speaker, I am a freshman, and the whole  time I have been here I have been talking about crime and the rise in  crime and how the Republican Party has supported the police.   Down South, we use a lot of common sense sometimes to solve issues,  and the biggest issue we have right now in the country is the border.  So what happens is that the drugs and the human trafficking follow  through and goes to these cities. That is why we are seeing a rise in  fentanyl.   One of the things I have observed is they use backpacks for the  heroin and cocaine and fentanyl to pay their passage to the drug  cartel.   So now the Democrats are panicked because we have an open border. We  also have a rise in crime. It is just curious to me that now, all of  sudden, we want to address these issues.   If you just look at the record across the country, Republican cities  seem to manage crime so much better. So I don't think that more money  is always a solution. Very often it is more management and local  control.   I encourage a ``no'' on this, and I am honored to speak on this.
