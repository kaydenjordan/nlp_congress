 Madam Speaker, currently military families who send  all-important care packages to their loved ones overseas have to pay  some postage. These families are already paying a lot just by enduring  the absence of their loved one. That is why I am reintroducing the  Military Care Package Program Act which would waive these postal fees  for family-sent care packages.   In this spirit, I would like to take a moment to recognize an  organization in my district called San Pedro's Packages for Patriots.  Packages for Patriots have been sending care packages, letters, and  comfort items to our Armed Forces members overseas since 2008.   These packages symbolize love and hope. For some soldiers, it truly  means the world. This amazing organization was started by San Pedro  residents  [[Page H8707]]  Mike Walker and his wife, Shirley Vojkovich. Together, along with their  group of dedicated volunteers, Packages for Patriots has shipped over  16,000 care packages with over 200,000 pounds of supplies to American  servicemembers deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.   I am sure every Member of this body would like to join me in  applauding their efforts in support of our servicemembers overseas.                            ____________________
