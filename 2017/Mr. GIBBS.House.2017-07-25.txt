Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Ohio?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a good friend who  passed away last week: the former Congressman from Ohio, Ralph Regula.   Ralph Regula served in this body for 36 years, from 1973 to 2009. He  ran in 1972 to replace former Congressman Frank Bow. He got on the  Appropriations Committee in 1975, and I remember him telling the story  of how that happened. When Gerald Ford was in the leadership here in  the House, he praised former President Gerald Ford for getting him on  the Appropriations Committee, in which he became a cardinal, in all the  many years he was on the Appropriations Committee.   Some major things that he helped do in his time here in Congress  were: he found funding for the Cuyahoga Valley National Park; he formed  the Ohio and Erie Canal National Heritage Corridor; and he worked with  his wife to create the National First Ladies' Library in Canton.   Having had many conversations with him over the years, I know all the  work he did to support the National Institutes of Health, medical  research, and also National Parks around the country that he so  treasured.   Last week, when Congressman Regula passed away, he left his wife,  Mary, and three grown children: Martha, Richard, and David.   Congressman Regula was born December 3, 1924, in Beach City, Ohio.   From 1944 to 1946, he served in the United States Navy. He earned his  undergraduate degree from the University of Mount Union in 1948, where  The Ralph and Mary Regula Center of Public Service and Civic Engagement  is housed.   He earned his law degree in 1952, and went to law school at night  while working as a teacher.                                time  1930    He also served on the Ohio State Board of Education from 1960 to  1964. He served in the Ohio senate. He was elected in 1966, and he  served in the Ohio house one term when he was elected in 1964.   During his time in the State house, he created the Northeast Ohio  Medical University complex and Stark State College, which is paying  many dividends to the residents of northeast Ohio.   Ralph was a good friend, and he always made sure that the staff knew  that constituents came first. He even had a lapel pin button made up to  remind his staff. He truly did. So my little memento that I remember  was when I came here in the early 1980s, representing as a farmer in  the Ohio Farm Bureau, we had an appointment at that time, and Ralph was  my Congressman. Ralph was a farmer, too, and loved his beef cattle. He  was an early riser. We had an early meeting well before 8 a.m. Another  county Farm Bureau president from Wayne County and I got there in his  office, Steve Grimes, and Ralph Regula said to us: Did you guys eat  breakfast yet?   We said: No.   He said: Come with me.   I guess he took us down to the Members' dining room. I remember this  because I brought this picture. How I got this picture was one of the  agricultural media reporters tagged along and took this picture. It was  in one of the local agricultural papers back in Ohio. My parents were  so proud of the fact that our Congressman--my Congressman--would meet  with us and take us to breakfast in the Capitol that they called the  paper and got the print, and they framed it.   A few years ago, I had the privilege to speak at the McKinley Day  Dinner in Stark County when I was redistricted in that area. Ralph and  Mary were there. I brought this picture and passed it around to show  them. Of course, this picture is 33 years old. What is really neat  about it is we both had brown hair. I remember Ralph and Mary got a big  kick out of that.   Another time that I remember that was really a treasure is he had  Senator Thad Cochran come to his house one weekend, and he invited all  the agricultural leaders from the district to have breakfast there one  Saturday morning. I remember that quite well as a great experience.   A lot people said that Ralph Regula cared. He really did care. He  really cared about the constituents he represented. He was a true  public servant.   Another issue is he had a relationship at the time with President  Reagan. They hit it off really good because they got talking about  their farms. Of course, Ralph Regula had a beef cattle farm outside of  Navarre, Ohio, in Stark County. They were talking about how to build  fence. Ralph used to tell that story, and you can tell that he held  that dear to him.   I first met Congressman Regula in 1974. He was the commencement  speaker at the first graduating class which I was in at the Ohio State  University Agricultural Technical Institute in Wooster, and Ralph was a  fairly new Congressman at the time. But he came and spoke. I remember  that. That was my first chance to get to know Congressman Regula at the  time.   I do have here some notes from his former staff. I just want to read  them because I think words say a lot. Ralph left an impression not just  on his constituents but also on his staff.   Susan Ross, who worked for Congressman Regula, offered some insight  and stories about Ralph.   Ralph's motto was ``Constituents First,'' according to Susan. One  day, Ralph got a frantic call from a woman whose daughter was gravely  ill in Mexico. She needed help immediately, as she didn't have a  passport and couldn't find her birth certificate. By the next day, she  was on her way to Mexico to help her daughter return to the U.S. Ralph  made sure that his constituent could get a copy of her birth  certificate and called the State Department to get her a passport  within just a few hours. Considering the bureaucracy of government,  this is a minor miracle. That is how committed he was to the people of  Ohio.   Ralph would go out of his way to help people. Ralph had a red pickup  truck, and after the September 11 attack in 2001, he drove it home with  the luggage of several constituents who were stranded here because of  the attacks and no way to rent a car and obviously the planes were not  flying.   A former schoolteacher himself, he would say to the teachers: The  lower the grade, the more you should be paid; and when you look out at  your class, you have 30 little mirrors looking back at you.   Susan wrote: We are so grateful for the chance to work alongside and  learn from this giant of a man. His accomplishments are legendary, and  his legacy can be seen across all of Ohio. It was an honor and  privilege to call him our boss.   When former staff members say those kinds of things about their  former boss, that says a lot.   I had the privilege to know Ralph for three decades. Two of those  decades he was my Congressman, and then the last decade he wasn't  because of redistricting. I had a different Congressman and a different  congressional district. Then 4 or 5 years ago now, redistricting, they  moved me into the Stark County, Ohio, area, and Ralph became a  constituent of mine. There were a few times here a few years ago that  Ralph came in and visited me in the office, and we had some great  conversations.   It seemed a little strange because I can remember, in the 1980s and  the 1990s, I would be visiting Ralph here in the Rayburn Building for  pork producers in the Farm Bureau talking about agricultural policy and  talking to another farmer who is also a Congressman, too. Those are  fond memories that I will treasure for the rest of my life.   I think that we are so glad that so many are standing out here  tonight to pay tribute to Congressman Ralph Regula because he was a  true public servant and loved his constituents, loved Stark County,  Ohio, and loved his farm. So it is a privilege to make a few remarks  tonight to pay tribute to him for his 36 years of service in this  Chamber and this body and all the service he did throughout his life to  help the people of Stark County, Ohio, the 16th Congressional District  in the State of Ohio, and the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) who is  from the  [[Page H6294]]  Columbia area and who served some of the time here when Congressman  Regula was here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Stivers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Stivers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Stivers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Stivers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Stivers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Latta) who is from Bowling Green, Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I am sure the gentleman shares a lot of  childhood memories running around here with his dad being a Congressman  and Congressman Regula for all those years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) who is  from the Cincinnati area.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Toledo (Ms.  Kaptur), who serves on the Appropriations Committee and who, I am sure,  has some interesting tales to tell about Congressman Regula.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, we heard tonight that we will  miss Ralph Regula. He was a dedicated public servant. He didn't  grandstand. He worked hard, and he got the job done for the people of  Ohio and the people of this country. We will sorely miss him.   Best regards to his beloved wife, Mary, and three children and the  rest of the Regula family. It was an honor and privilege to know Ralph  Regula.
