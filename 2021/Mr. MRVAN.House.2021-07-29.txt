 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Chuck Hughes,  executive director of the Gary Chamber of Commerce; and Dr. Gordon  Bradshaw, chairman of the public policy committee, for establishing the  World Civility Day which was celebrated earlier this month on July 8.   In 2015, Mr. Hughes and Dr. Bradshaw created the Community Civility  Counts initiative with the Gary Chamber of Commerce and established the  World Civility Day in order to encourage all individuals to be more  mindful of our actions and to bring more understanding, more tolerance,  and more listening and empathy into our society.   I became a public servant in order to bring people together and solve  problems, and that only happens when we treat each other with respect  and civility.   I commend Mr. Hughes, Dr. Bradshaw, and all of the individuals and  organizations engaged in this initiative for their leadership to  recognize the timely and worthy goals of World Civility Day.                            ____________________
