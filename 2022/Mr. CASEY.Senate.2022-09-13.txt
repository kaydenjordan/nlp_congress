 Mr. President, I would ask consent to speak for up to 5  minutes before the vote.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pending  nominee, Arianna J. Freeman, who has been nominated to serve on the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. For those who may not know  all the geography, that includes, under the jurisdiction of that court,  Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and the Virgin Islands.   Arianna Freeman has dedicated her legal career to service, especially  in the Philadelphia community. After graduating from Swarthmore College  and Yale Law School, Ms. Freeman returned to Philadelphia to start her  legal career. After clerking for three Federal judges in the Eastern  District of Pennsylvania, she joined the Federal Community Defender  Office in Philadelphia. Through her experience in the defender's  office, she has briefed over 15 appeals in the Third Circuit and  presented oral argument on seven occasions, including before the Third  Circuit en banc, meaning the entire court. She has submitted four  briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court as well.   Her legal reputation, her intellect, her ability, and her integrity  are unquestioned. I will just give you three or  [[Page S4551]]  four examples of what others have said about her work.   Former U.S. District Court Judge Giles wrote:         Ms. Freeman has the character and intellectual attributes       that will lead her to be a wonderful appeals court judge. She       is discerning, open-minded, logical and is both a listener       and contributor to debate and conversation.    A group of appellate practitioners from the Third Circuit wrote as  follows:         Arianna Freeman has the strong intellect, tenacious work       ethic, and even temperament necessary to become an       outstanding federal judge. Her integrity and experience will       ensure that she will be ready to serve from the first day.    Third example: Given Arianna's background as a Federal public  defender, perhaps most important is the praise that she has received  from over 20 former Federal prosecutors. One group wrote:         We are impressed by Arianna's diligence, intelligence,       dedication, and integrity. It is because of her ethics and       compassion, grounded in sensibility, that we are confident       she will provide sound and measured opinions, while       approaching each case without bias and with respect for the       rule of law.    So said 20 former Federal prosecutors.   Arianna is so well respected that her nomination has garnered strong  support even beyond the State of Pennsylvania, as evidenced by a letter  submitted by over 30 law school professors from across the Nation who  described Arianna Freeman as a ``brilliant, careful, and talented  lawyer with impressive professional credentials and a strong commitment  to fairness, equal justice, and the rule of law.''   There is no doubt that Arianna Freeman's extensive legal experience,  keen intellect, and dedication to the principles of fairness and equal  justice will serve the Third Circuit well. Furthermore, if confirmed,  she will not only provide a critically important professional  perspective to the Third Circuit as a career public defender; she will  also become the first woman of color to serve on the Third Circuit and  just the third active woman on that bench.   This is an important and historic nomination not only for  Pennsylvania but, of course, for the entire Third Circuit Court of  Appeals.   I would like to share a final passage from a letter written to the  Senate Judiciary Committee by a group of law school deans from  Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, led by Professor Danielle  Conway from the Penn State Dickinson School of Law. They wrote:         The nomination of Arianna J. Freeman to serve as a judge on       the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is       inspired and her ultimate confirmation will be inspiring. As       legislative leaders in this great society, the Committee and       the full Senate will be favorably rewarded with history's       account of how you worked to elevate this brilliant lawyer to       the bench.    It couldn't be said any better than that. I urge her confirmation and  urge my colleagues to vote yes.   I yield the floor.
