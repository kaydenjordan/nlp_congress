 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to discuss my opposition  to the nomination of Michael Regan for Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency.   Now, before I begin, let me be very clear. I really liked meeting and  getting to know Michael Regan. He is a dedicated public servant and an  honest man. He had a beautiful family with him, and he answered the  questions as straightforwardly as I think he thought he could. I have  enjoyed getting to know him through my role as the ranking member on  the Environment and Public Works Committee, and I appreciated the  willingness he expressed to visit my home State of West Virginia. But  this vote is not based on what Mr. Regan might do if he had his say;  this vote is about confirming someone to execute President Biden's  agenda, which Mr. Regan said he would faithfully do, and I cannot  support that agenda. I cannot support that agenda that Secretary--if  confirmed--Regan would be tasked with implementing.   Throughout his confirmation process, Secretary Regan did not commit  to a different policy agenda than that of the Obama administration--an  agenda that absolutely devastated my State and other energy-producing  States.   In his nomination hearing, Secretary Regan, because he is secretary  of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality, would not  comment as to whether the so-called Clean Power Plan or something worse  would be reinstituted. He did not rule out a return to the WOTUS rule.  He could not say whether the EPA would again claim overarching  authority to force States to shift their electricity generation  sources. He could not commit to real changes, and that is because the  agenda is already set. Climate czar Gina McCarthy and others have  already set the table.   InsideEPA recently reported:         Administration observers are questioning whether Michael       Regan . . . could face a diminished role if he wins Senate       confirmation due to the large number of Obama-era officials       who have returned to the agency and the White House to work       on implementing Biden's environmental agenda.    The article went on to say:         [T]hese sources also say that because there are so many       officials now working on climate change policies across the       Biden administration, this could lead to ``turf wars''       between EPA and the White House on this issue.    Well, I share those concerns.   For almost 2 months now, unaccountable czar Gina McCarthy has been  working both behind the scenes and in front of the press to lay the  groundwork for the Biden administration's agenda. She is wielding her  power publicly to make it clear who is calling the shots and directing  the troops.   McCarthy herself said recently:         I've got a small stronghold office, but I am an orchestra       leader for a very large band.    She is operating this ``stronghold'' office with no transparency  outside of the Senate confirmation process. It would be bad enough with  just a turf war between an equally matched White House and EPA, but we  know that McCarthy is poised to have influence within the EPA too.   In addition to the Obama EPA alums already in place, the nomination  of Janet McCabe to serve as EPA Deputy Administrator has only increased  my concern and made it worse.   In 2019, McCabe, McCarthy, and another alum of the Obama EPA wrote an  op-ed fully backing the overreaching Clean Power Plan. They admitted  that their Clean Power Plan was a War on Coal. They stated:         The best way to cut emissions is to shift electricity       generation from the dirtiest plants, which happen to use       coal.    So they were willing to say it outright once they were out of public  office. They are willing to admit to their War on Coal. It upsets me  because they wouldn't say it to the people of my State when they were  in the office. They didn't have the courage to look the people in West  Virginia--they didn't even come to our State to talk about it--to look  them in the eye and admit they wanted to wipe coal off the map. Had  they come, they would have had to hear in person, eye to eye, the harm,  the devastation that workers in our coal industry and many other  associated industries in West Virginia were facing.   WVU economist John Deskins put that harm into perspective in  testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at a  hearing in 2015. He observed:         In Central Appalachia, coal production has fallen by 51       percent since 2010, compared to a decline of 10 percent from       the nation's other coal-producing regions. . . . [N]early all       of the coal job losses that have occurred in West Virginia       have come from our state's southern coalfields. The       concentration of these job losses has created a Great       Depression--    Great Depression--       in six southern counties--Boone, Clay, Logan, McDowell,       Mingo, and Wyoming [Counties]. Job losses over the past four       years range between--    Remember, this is in 2015--       25 and 33 percent in each of these counties.    That is how many jobs were lost.   John Kerry stood alongside Gina McCarthy in the Oval Office in  January and talked about how workers in the fossil fuel industry can  just become wind turbine technicians or solar panel technicians. John  Kerry doesn't really know what it actually means to be any type of  these workers.   Brad Markell, a representative from the AFL-CIO Industrial Union  Council, explained some of the differences to the Washington Post. He  said:         You get guys that are coming off of fossil jobs in the       Dakotas or the wind belt, and are making, you know, eighty,       ninety, a hundred thousand a year. [To put wind turbines up],       they're looking at thirty to thirty-five thousand, with       either no or substandard benefits.    In President Biden's White House, we have unaccountable--and either  misguided at best or uninformed at worst--czars trying to do what they  think is best for this country.   So let's go back to Secretary Regan. In his hearing, he talked in  depth about his work with Republicans in North Carolina and his  commitment to transparency, and both of the Republican Senators from  his home State came and introduced him to our committee and spoke very  well of his ability to work across the aisle.   I appreciate that greatly, and I welcome that, but the fact remains  that I can't support Secretary Regan when Gina McCarthy is the self- described orchestra leader for the Biden administration and Kerry is  basing so-called ``transition'' policies on a fantasy world that does  not exist.   I am very skeptical that the next 4 years will be any better than the  8 years of economic devastation brought on by President Obama's EPA.  So, without commitments to different policies than what were pursued in  the Obama EPA, I cannot support Secretary Regan today. But, you know  what? I hope he proves me wrong. I hope he makes good on his promise to  work with Republicans to help address climate issues.   As ranking member of the EPA Committee, I stand ready to just do  that. We have so much common ground on climate issues. I hope Secretary  Regan can cut Gina McCarthy out of power and let her know who is  calling the shots for environmental policy in the Biden administration.  I hope Secretary Regan embraces President Biden's mandate of unity and  works with both red and blue States to take care of our planet. Until  then, I will continue to look out for my State and practice aggressive  oversight on what I think may be coming.   I yield the floor.
