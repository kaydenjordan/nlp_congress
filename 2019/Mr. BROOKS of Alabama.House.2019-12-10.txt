 Mr. Speaker, renowned Alabama educator,  artist, and botanist George Washington Carver, like many Americans,  overcame numerous obstacles to achieve greatness. Carver's  contributions to science and agriculture made a huge impact that is  still felt across the globe today.   On January 5, 2020, Alabama will unveil a historic marker honoring  Dr. Carver at Decatur's Horizon School.   Carter visited Decatur in 1935. Carver Elementary was named in his  honor. During his visit, Carver spoke to an audience of more than 1,000  Decatur residents. In a letter to then-superintendent W.W. Henson after  his visit, George Washington Carver wrote: ``The Carver School far  exceeds my expectations. It is a most beautiful building, and I hope  that it will be able in every way to integrate itself into the up- building and the development of the splendid possibilities which lie  all around you.''   Carver was deeply devoted to education. During the Civil War, George  Washington Carver was born in Diamond Grove, Missouri. Shamefully,  Carver was not allowed to attend public schools near his home because  he was an African American. But that did not stop George Washington  Carver. He was determined to get an education, so he enrolled at a  school 10 miles away in Neosho, Missouri.    In Neosho, Carver was befriended by Mariah Watkins, from whom he  rented a room. Mariah Watkins' advice to Carver was simple: ``You must  learn all you can, then go back into the world and give your learning  back to the people.'' Carver did just that.   Disappointed in the quality of Neosho's school, Carver moved to  Kansas and supported himself through a variety of occupations while he  furthered his education as he could. After earning his high school  diploma, he discovered opportunities for college for Black men in  Kansas were nonexistent. So George Washington Carver majored in art at  Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, as their only Black student.   Encouraged by his Simpson professors to focus on botany, Carver  transferred to Iowa State, where he earned his bachelor's and master's  degrees in science. Thereafter, in April 1896, Booker T. Washington  recruited Carver to Tuskegee Institute's agricultural school in  Alabama, where Carver taught and mentored generations of students for  the next 47 years.   At Tuskegee, Carver developed revolutionary techniques to improve  soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton. Together with other  agricultural experts, he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their  soils by practicing systematic crop rotation, alternating cotton crops  with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes, such as peanuts, soybeans,  and cowpeas.   Once at Tuskegee, Carver trained farmers to rotate and cultivate the  new crops successfully. Carver developed and established an  agricultural extension program for all of Alabama. Carver founded an  industrial research laboratory, where he and assistants worked to  popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for  them.   In 1916, Carver was made a member of the Royal Society of Arts in  England, one of only a handful of Americans at that time to receive  this honor. The United Peanut Associations of America invited Carver to  speak at their 1920 convention. He discussed ``The Possibilities of the  Peanut'' and exhibited 145 peanut products.   Carver received the 1923 NAACP Spingarn Medal for outstanding  achievement by an African American.   Before his death in 1943, Carver donated his life savings to  establish the Carver Research Foundation at Tuskegee.   Carver was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of  Fame.   The George Washington Carver National Monument was the first national  monument dedicated to a Black American and the first to a non- President.   George Washington Carver left a lasting legacy on Alabama's schools,  and Alabama is proud to have been the home of this renowned scientific  leader.                            ____________________
