 I thank my colleague for sharing his insights  and his experience with us. We have a lot of work to do, and we are  ready to do it.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to those that my colleague has mentioned, I  would like to bring attention to some of the other nominees that we  should be considering here.                                time  1930    We haven't mentioned the Department of Energy and the nominee,  Governor Rick Perry, who disregarded this agency so much that he  couldn't even remember that he wanted to eliminate it when he was  running for President, or even Linda McMahon, who is the wife of a  billionaire. It seems to me that this litany of nominees belongs to the  millionaire-billionaire club. They know each other well, and the one  thing that they are committed to is ensuring that their interests and  the interests of this President-elect, in his private life, are  advanced. I think that the people in this country need to understand  how troublesome this is.   I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke), the co-chair  of the Caucus on Black Women and Girls and a fighter for the rights of  all working families and all vulnerable families.   Ms. CLARKE of New York. I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman).   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Betsy DeVos as  Secretary of Education.   I know that my colleagues have been talking about their concerns with  regard to the troubling nominations of Donald Trump, and I want to add  my voice with respect to the Secretary of Education.   About 90 percent of Americans--Republicans and Democrats alike--send  their children to public schools; and as a proud graduate of the New  York City public school system, I, myself, know firsthand of the  importance of both primary and secondary education as part of early  childhood and young adulthood. Most public schools in the United States  are operated by the city, town, or county for the benefit of the  public, and all of the resources that are allocated to public schools  are used to support the development of students and to prepare them for  success in the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I believe Betsy DeVos has a very different approach to  education, and that is extremely clear. She and her family, over the  years, have devoted millions of dollars to replacing public schools in  Michigan with charter schools, most of which have recorded test scores  in reading and math that are well below the State average. Let me  repeat that--most of which have recorded test scores in reading and  math that are well below the State average.   Recently, the Detroit Free Press released an article that explained,  while families in Detroit have the choice of many different charter  schools, few of these choices actually offer a quality education.   Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that Betsy DeVos has used donations to  provide to Republicans in the Michigan  [[Page H464]]  State Legislature to prevent State agencies from investigating as to  whether charter schools are providing students with a comprehensive  education that will prepare them for the future. I am alarmed that the  system that was developed by Betsy DeVos, which allows for-profit  corporations to operate charter schools, realigns those resources  intended for schoolchildren into the pockets of shareholders--making a  profit off the backs of children.   Since 1959, the DeVos family has operated Amway, which is a business  that has been labeled as a pyramid scheme--paying out millions of  dollars in fines and cheating working families. We cannot allow Betsy  DeVos the chance to extend those same basic principles used during her  time at Amway to affect our education system--enriching wealthy  investors at the expense of our children's education. It is not a  solution. It is a problem.   I thank my colleague for giving me the time. I hope that the American  people are watching very closely as to what is taking place here  because, indeed, it is a travesty.    I thank my friend and my colleague.   Mr. Speaker, defending the sanctity of American democracy is more  important than any partisan consideration. We are at a juncture at  which we will experience a President-elect who has displayed  breathtaking ignorance about the powers and the basic functions of  government and who has identified the nominees for these cabinet  positions who, if confirmed, will dismantle equality, equity, and  opportunity at every turn, capped off by a Republican-controlled  Congress that would rather make good on divisive rhetoric instead of  working in the best interests of Americans.   There is just so much at stake as we go forth in the next couple of  weeks and as the President-elect identifies and puts forth his  nominees. Whether it is in the Department of State or in the Department  of Education or in Energy or in HUD or in Health and Human Services or  in Justice or in the Environmental Protection Agency--where a nominee,  as Attorney General, spends his time dismantling and litigating against  the Environmental Protection Agency--or whether it is Labor, where the  Labor Secretary doesn't seem to care about working individuals and  protecting workers' rights, or whether it is an SBA administrator who  doesn't have any idea what it is to be a part of a working class or a  middle class, or whether it is even the Treasurer of the country, who  comes from massive wealth and Big Business, each of these  illustrations, in combination with there being the decisions already to  dismantle--to take health care away from millions of families, to  create the loss of jobs as a result of dismantling the Affordable Care  Act without placing anything in its place--represent the dismantling of  the democracy that we have fought so hard to sustain.   If we are going to watch these serious attacks on the equality and  opportunity for all people, then we must make sure that the people in  this country see these things. I have a question for all of us to  answer. As we look toward all of these issues, either individually or  collectively, at what point do we conclude with the question: Is what  is happening in America un-American?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Higgins of Louisiana). Members are  reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the  President-elect or a sitting Senator.
