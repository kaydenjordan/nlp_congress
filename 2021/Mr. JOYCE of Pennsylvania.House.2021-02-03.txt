 Madam Speaker, every precious life is made  in the image of our Creator. As image bearers, each person is deserving  of fundamental rights, including the right to life.   As a doctor, I took an oath to protect all human life. That  unequivocal truth was the foundation for my medical career, and it has  continued through my work here in the United States Congress.   From forcing American taxpayers to pay for abortions against their  conscience to rolling back our recent pro-life achievements, President  Biden has cemented his anti-life agenda in the first few days of his  administration. To paraphrase President George Washington, it is deeds,  not words, that define a leader.   Right now, pro-life Americans are facing a daunting path ahead. But  we are not without hope. Together, with the help of our Creator, we  will persevere in our pursuit to defend the most vulnerable among us.   Our enduring commitment to life will always prevail.
