 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1492) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to direct the  Attorney General to register practitioners to transport controlled  substances to States in which the practitioner is not registered under  the Act for the purpose of administering the substances (under  applicable State law) at locations other than principal places of  business or professional practice.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1492         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Controlled       Substances Transportation Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REGISTRATION FOR TRANSPORT OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES                     TO STATES IN WHICH THE PRACTITIONER IS NOT                     REGISTERED UNDER THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT                     FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADMINISTERING THE SUBSTANCES                     AT LOCATIONS OTHER THAN PRINCIPAL PLACES OF                     BUSINESS OR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE.         Section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.       823) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(k) Registration for Transport of Controlled Substances       to States in Which the Practitioner Is Not Registered for the       Purpose of Administering the Substances at Locations Other       Than Principal Places of Business or Professional Practice.--        ``(1) In general.--Upon application by a practitioner       (other than a pharmacy) who is registered under subsection       (f), the Attorney General shall issue a separate registration       to the practitioner authorizing the practitioner--        ``(A) to transport one or more controlled substances in       schedule II, III, IV, or V from the practitioner's registered       location in a State to one or more States in which the       practitioner is not registered under subsection (f) for the       purpose of the practitioner administering the substances at       locations other than a principal place of business or       professional practice; and        ``(B) to so administer the substances.        ``(2) Requirements.--For a practitioner to be authorized to       transport and administer controlled substances pursuant to a       registration issued under paragraph (1), all of the following       conditions must be satisfied:        ``(A) The practitioner must be licensed, registered, or       otherwise permitted by the State in which the controlled       substances are administered to carry out such activity at the       location where it occurs.        ``(B) The practitioner must--        ``(i) limit the time of transport and administering of any       controlled substance pursuant to such registration to not       more than 72 consecutive hours; and        ``(ii) by the conclusion of such 72 hours, return any such       controlled substance so transported but not administered to       the registered location from which such substance was       obtained.        ``(C)(i) The practitioner must maintain records of the       transporting and administering of any controlled substance       pursuant to this subsection.        ``(ii) Such records shall be maintained, in accordance with       the requirements of section 307(b), at the practitioner's       registered location from which the controlled substances were       obtained and shall include--        ``(I) the location where the controlled substance was       administered; and        ``(II) such other information as may be required by       regulation of the Attorney General with respect to records       for dispensers of controlled substances.        ``(iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii), the exception in       subsection 307(c)(1)(B) shall not apply to records required       by this subparagraph.        ``(3) Grounds for denial or revocation.--The Attorney       General may deny an application for registration under this       subsection, or a renewal thereof, or revoke such       registration, based on the criteria listed in section 304(a),       except that the applicant shall not be required, as a       condition of initially obtaining such registration, to       present proof of State authorization to administer controlled       substances.        ``(4) Automatic termination.--A registration issued under       this subsection shall automatically terminate if the       practitioner no longer has an active registration under       subsection (f) due to revocation, suspension, surrender, or       other termination.        ``(5) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `registered       location' means, with respect to each registration issued to       a practitioner under subsection (f), the address that appears       on the certificate of registration.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), who is the  chairman of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1492, the Medical  Controlled Substances Transportation Act of 2017, authored by my good  friend from Texas, the chairman of the Rules Committee, Representative  Pete Sessions.   Whether it is emergency medical service providers traveling to a  disaster area to provide care or a team physician at an away game,  certain medical practitioners often need to travel with and administer  antiseizure or pain medications.   Although many of these are regulated under the Controlled Substances  Act, current law does not specifically authorize the transportation or  administration of such substances away from their registered location.  Currently, the Controlled Substances Act does not specifically  authorize the transportation and the administration of controlled  substances away from the location registered with the Drug Enforcement  Administration.   In order to ensure appropriate oversight of this practice, H.R. 1492  would establish a separate registration process for mobile  practitioners who are already registered with the DEA and in good  standing.   For a practitioner to transport and administer controlled substances  pursuant to this new registration, he or she must be licensed,  registered, or otherwise permitted by the State in which the substances  are administered to carry out such activity at the location where it  occurs.   In addition, the practitioner must limit the time of transport to not  more than 72 consecutive hours and return any such substances not  administered to their registered location from which they were  obtained.   Further, the practitioner must maintain records of the transporting  and administering, and DEA would maintain the authority to deny or  revoke a registration.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                      U.S. House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 24, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: I write with respect to H.R. 1492,       the ``Medical Controlled Substances Transportation Act.'' As       a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       within H.R. 1492 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of       the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1492 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 1492 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 1492.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, June 24, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter       concerning H.R. 1492, Medical Controlled Substances       Transportation Act of 2017. I appreciate your willingness to       forego any further consideration of this bill so that it may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        I agree that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1492 at       this time, the Judiciary Committee does not waive any       jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation and that your Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that the Committee may address any remaining       issues in its jurisdiction. I understand the Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation and will support any such       request.        I will include a copy of our exchange of letters on this       matter in the Congressional Record during the Floor       consideration of H.R. 1492.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to commend Chairman Sessions for working on this important  legislation with the Energy and Commerce Committee, the House Judiciary  Committee, and the Drug Enforcement Administration to ensure that we  got it right. This is a good bill with appropriate safeguards.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
