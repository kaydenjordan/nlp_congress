 Madam Speaker, the last time I stood in this Chamber was  the first day that my district reported a COVID-19 fatality. At that  time, on March 27, my district had just 27 confirmed cases. As of  today, the 12th District has 50 deaths and 862 confirmed cases.   COVID-19 has rattled our communities across this country, and our top  priority should be and should always be keeping people safe.   But the virus has also forced our economy to a grinding halt. Our  small businesses are desperate for a lifeline. And for many, that  lifeline is the PPP.   In Illinois, almost 70,000 loans were approved before funding ran  out. But funding should have never been allowed to run out. We should  have done our job. We should have come back, and politics should not  have been played.   The COVID-19 virus is not Republican; it is not Democrat. This  hurting economy is not Republican; it is not Democrat. But yet we held  it up, and we will never know how many small businesses failed because  politics was played rather than getting our job done.
