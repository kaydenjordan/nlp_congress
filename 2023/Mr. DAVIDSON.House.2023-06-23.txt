 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 3564.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 3564, the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act, will undo a bad  policy implemented at the worst time. Americans are struggling to  afford housing. I am talking about the loan level price adjustments  that the Federal Housing Finance Agency, FHFA, put into effect on May 1  of this year. This policy essentially implemented a cross-subsidy to  individuals with lower down payments and lower credit scores.   Loan level pricing adjustments are up-front fees which adjust the  final interest rate charged on mortgage loans based on different risk  characteristics associated with individual loans. The most notable  characteristics would be the mortgage's underlying loan-to-value ratio  and the buyer's credit score.   While such fees may be necessary for Fannie and Freddie Mac,  collectively known as the GSEs, to raise capital and adequately hedge  against credit risk, the adjustments announced by FHFA would  disproportionately hurt individuals with credit scores of 680 or  greater.   To put that into perspective, the average credit score is around 710,  and nearly 19 out of 20 Americans have credit scores above 680. The  other thing is credit scores alone aren't a proxy for wealth or income.  Therefore, most Americans would likely be hurt by these fees.   However, those with a credit score below 680 will benefit from lower  rates than the prior LLPA assessments. This fee change violates the  fundamental principle of risk-based pricing: Lower-risk borrowers  should pay lower prices than higher-risk borrowers for access to the  same credit.    Despite the FHFA's opaque approach to assessing LLPAs, the result of  their new policies speak for themselves. The Middle Class Borrower  Protection Act would reinstate the old LLPA prices that were in effect  prior to May 1, while also directing the Government Accounting Office  to complete an independent study of the processes and data used by FHFA  to change the prices, including the impact of those changes on the  safety and soundness of the GSEs, which, I will add, have been in  conservatorship under the Federal Government for 15 years. Then GAO  would report to Congress within 1 year of the study.   FHFA would be prohibited from changing the LLPAs until 90 days after  the report, after which it would be required to: one, follow the basic  agency notice-and-comment procedure for making any new changes to the  LLPA fee; and two, ensure that future fee adjustments be made based on  the actual risk posed by the mortgage.   FHFA would also be prohibited from imposing any new fee on borrowers  based on their debt-to-income ratio, which was an idea they considered  implementing effective August 1.   Finally, I will acknowledge that over the past weekend, the  Congressional Budget Office scored this bill, and they assessed a cost  of $1.8 billion for implementing this bill. I believe the fact that CBO  says this bill costs a single penny is absurd and exposes a glaring  flaw within our legislative process.   Perhaps CBO has a rebuttal, but that would require them to show their  work, which they have not. This is why I have long advocated for  another bill of mine, the CBO Show Your Work Act.   This past week exemplified just why we need transparent processes  when legislating. The reality is these fees aren't even going directly  to the Treasury. While the GSEs are in conservatorship, the money is  supposed to go to the balance sheet of Freddie and Fannie so that they  can accumulate capital.   As this rule is announced, the explicit purpose was to grow capital  on the balance sheets of Fannie and Freddie. These were taken over by  the Federal Government in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. They  have remained in the conservatorship of the Federal Government. The  revenue isn't coming in directly to the Treasury, it is meant to  actually free the GSEs from control of the Federal Government.   These revenues were not imposed by Congress, so there really isn't a  need  [[Page H3116]]  for us to replace the revenue that the administration imposed with a  really misguided rule. There was no revenue coming in on April 30. On  May 1, they implement this policy change, and somehow, we are supposed  to come up with the revenue to offset it.   Now, I argued against doing that. I asked the Rules Committee to  ignore the misguided advice of the Congressional Budget Office and to  not implement a pay-for because it is not our--we didn't cause this  expense to occur. Frankly, it is not even a real expense. It is  essentially a tax imposed by the administration.   Because of the rules, we offered a manager's amendment which was  ultimately incorporated into this bill. We add 1 year to a 10-basis  point fee that is assessed on every Fannie and Freddie loan, regardless  of your credit, just as a cover. That rule has been in place since the  bill passed in 1992. It was set to expire in 2032. Now it will expire  in 2033.   I hope between now and then we can change that, and we can also  liberate Fannie and Freddie from their ongoing conservatorship which, I  will note, has lasted longer than Britney Spears' conservatorship. The  only way that it would cost the Federal Government money is if the  conservator is actually raking money out of it and funding their own  operation, which is not what is supposed to happen. It is supposed to  stay with Fannie and Freddie, so it shouldn't be costing the Federal  Government a dime to implement the Middle Class Borrower Protection  Act.   Nevertheless, Fannie and Freddie will benefit from one extra year of  money being collected under this manager's amendment that was adopted  and incorporated in the bill.   Let me return and focus on the bill at hand, the Middle Class  Borrowers Protection Act. Let's think about this: A Federal agency  acting under its own purview and not subject to the Administrative  Procedure Act implemented a politically motivated cross-subsidy through  a clear money grab on unsuspecting credit-worthy borrowers. This wasn't  a decision by Congress. This was simply the FHFA using its position as  conservator of the GSEs to increase the government's baseline.   Now Congress is trying to undo the changes and re-implement a policy  that was in place just 8 weeks ago.   However, Congress, as I said, had to pay for this fake shortfall.  Like we see time and again, only in Washington, D.C., would math like  this make sense.   It is imperative for this body to protect the cornerstone of the  American Dream by promoting housing affordability, and H.R. 3564 does  just that.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman points out things that just aren't so.  The idea that a loan that has less equity in it isn't riskier than a  loan with more equity in it is completely false.   Every business school in the country will teach it, but most people  don't need to go to business school to understand that a loan with a  lot of equity in it is at much less risk of default. It is rational to  price risk, and that is what the market should be doing. Plus, people  who have low income and have high credit scores are punished by this  foolish policy. This simply will undo it.   The last thing I will say is, right now, there is money that is being  taken away from consumers in the marketplace--$1.8 billion over the  next 2 years. Once this bill passes, that stops getting taken away. The  10-basis point pay-for that is in this bill is still in effect right  now.   In fact, it is scheduled to go out in 2032. In the near term, nothing  changes in this bill. It is in 2033 that the pay-for comes in, again,  only with the false accounting at the Congressional Budget Office would  that even be necessary.  [[Page H3117]]    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. McHenry), the chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Missouri is accurate.  This does cost money. It costs the 19 out of 20 Americans with 680  credit scores or better who choose to get a Fannie or Freddie mortgage,  it costs them money. It takes it out of their hard-earned dollars and  transfers it to the GSEs.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma  (Mrs. Bice).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for recognizing that low-income  people do have high credit scores. That is why it is unjust to  implement this rule and charge them a higher fee than maybe wealthy  people who have low credit scores.   This is an interesting observation. The ranking member on the  Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance, Mr. Cleaver, just pointed out  that it would be dangerous to require the FHFA to use the  Administrative Procedure Act, i.e., to give notice and get comment,  before they implement policies that impose costs on the American  public. In July 2020, Ms. Waters and the majority at the time sent a  letter to Director Calabria--at the time the Director of FHFA--saying:  ``Moreover, we urge you to use your powers under title 5 U.S.C. 551- 559, the Administrative Procedure Act, to engage meaningfully with all  stakeholders.''   It seems they are not opposed to FHFA using the Administrative  Procedure Act. In fact, they asked them to do it, so I wonder why it is  selectively.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs.  Lesko).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Chair, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the American people should be angry. They  should be upset because the Biden administration did impose a socialist  redistribution scheme. The most egregious and obvious part is that they  withdrew as we uncovered this and exposed what they were trying to do.   On August 1, their plan was to say that if you have a lot of income  and very little debt, then you should pay more, even more than this  scheme that took effect on May 1, and you should subsidize the people  that have little income and more debt. Now, to be sure, they still  would qualify for a mortgage, or they wouldn't get the loan, but that  is patently obvious redistribution of wealth.   The component that took effect on May 1 isn't really a redistribution  of wealth per se, but it does hit the average credit score of 710.  Everyone with a credit score of 680 or above, 19 out of 20 Americans is  being hit by a higher fee since May 1 for their mortgages.   It is a redistribution of credit scores, and that is even worse than  an idea of redistribution of wealth, in a sense. Because you have  responsible people who live within their means, might live just a  little bit above paycheck to paycheck, save, scrape together, build up  a downpayment, have a mortgage in place, and they are going to pay more  now since May 1.   We have to fix this injustice. That is what this bill does. It is  time to just move forward in a commonsense way.   First, you study the problem before you implement it. This bill  requires the GAO to complete the study, and then it requires FHFA to  look at the study, to take 90 days of notice before they implement  something else. The part that it bans after the study is over is the  real redistribution of wealth, the debt-to-income scheme.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this commonsense Middle Class Borrower Protection Act, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, though I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, while there has been broad discussion about  the fundamental unfairness associated with the Biden administration's  new tax on creditworthy borrowers, Congress' oversight role also  extends to the process and impact these changes will have on home  buyers and the housing market.   Members on both sides share policy concerns regarding this new tax,  and it is equally imperative that we promote transparency to the  American people on this flawed effort.   The GAO study does just that as the amendment Mrs. Boebert proposed  would simply make the GAO study public. Sunlight is the best  disinfectant, and in no area is this more relevant than the opaque  process with which the FHFA has enacted these and other changes.   This amendment would add to the GAO study included in H.R. 3564 which  will play a critical factor toward furthering both Congress' and the  public's understanding of this issue that impacts millions of home  buyers.   Americans deserve a thorough accounting of the process and deserve to  know the significant impact of FHFA'S actions. An agency that virtually  controls U.S. housing markets should not operate without appropriate  congressional oversight.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to restore  fairness, transparency, and accountability to this process and policy  that impacts millions of Americans. Amidst economic uncertainty and a  housing affordability crisis, the American people deserve nothing less.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge all of our colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, this is a commonsense amendment to the GAO  study, and I applaud the gentlewoman from Nevada for including this  comprehensive view on the impact of housing affordability.   It furthers the work of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee, and I  think it is an important addition.   Mr. Chair, I encourage all of our colleagues to support it, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge all of our colleagues to support the  amendment. I support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, and I am  opposed to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment introduced by Ms. Pettersen which would make it impossible to  repeal the Federal Housing Finance Agency's damaging price increases on  creditworthy home buyers. In fact, it will undo the entire point of the  bill.   The legislation before us, the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act,  would repeal these increases and would require the Government  Accountability Office to assess the FHFA's fee structure. That is the  point of the GAO's study.   It would also require that any future loan-level fees implemented by  the agency adopt a risk-based price framework.   Ms. Pettersen's amendment would set up a sham test so that FHFA would  have to keep those unfair fees in place even at the expense of the  majority of middle-class borrowers.   So while the gentlewoman's amendment is designed to sound fair, the  reality is that it would actually have the opposite effect of what it  advertises. Instead of lowering fees for middle-income families, it  would doom many of them to higher fees. In other words, a vote for Ms.  Pettersen's amendment is a vote against the Middle Class Borrower  Protection Act.   I also find it interesting that our friends on the other side of the  aisle would support an amendment that essentially says: Don't do this  if it makes fees go up, which is exactly what our bill does. It stops  the fees from going up or staying up, as the case is on part of the  plan that they implemented.   We should be united in saying that deliberately making mortgages more  expensive for creditworthy borrowers is a foolish policy. The sting of  inflation and higher interest rates are already hurting middle-income  families, and this adjustment by FHFA is not fair.   While I cannot support this amendment, I am glad to see the  recognition that we need to protect middle-income families looking to  purchase a home from unfair pricing. It makes it harder for some  borrowers to afford because they pay more just because they have high  credit scores.   Ms. Pettersen's amendment would, unfortunately, lock in that unfair  system.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3126]]         Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. I urge all of  our colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
