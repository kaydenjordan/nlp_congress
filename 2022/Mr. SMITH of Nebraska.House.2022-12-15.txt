 Madam Speaker, today, I join Representative   Mike Flood to honor the life and service of former Nebraska State  Senator Pat Engel, whom we served alongside during our time in the  Nebraska Legislature.   Born in South Sioux City, Nebraska, Pat was a man of faith who  applied his sharp mind to a life of service to his community and never  stopped serving.   After his early military career concluded with Active Duty as an Air  Force intelligence officer stationed in Germany, he chose to return  with his young family to South Sioux City. There, as a prolific  volunteer, he earned a reputation for his good nature and compassion  for others as he served on two local school boards, numerous volunteer  organizations, and as Dakota County commissioner.   In his 16 years in the legislature, Pat defined what it is to be a  public servant. He was well liked. He had a special gift to work and  connect with anyone, and I will always remember his cheerful way, even  when issues were difficult. He was known for bringing people together.    Pat and his wife, Dee, were married for almost 68 years and had five  children. Family, community, and love for his home State meant the  world to Pat. He will be missed.                            ____________________
