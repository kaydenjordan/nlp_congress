 Madam Chair, I rise today to reaffirm my commitment and  that of my Democratic colleagues to reducing energy costs for the  American people.   Last Congress, we delivered a historic bill, the Inflation Reduction  Act, that will save Americans money and make transformative investments  to fight climate change.  [[Page H1550]]    The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program, in particular,  gives Americans up to $14,000 to electrify their homes and improve  energy efficiency. It covers up to 100 percent of electrification  project costs for low-income households, who often bear the brunt of  both high-energy costs and extreme weather.   I know this program will save lives and money because the Sacramento  Municipal Utility District, or as we call it SMUD, is doing this in my  district. Last November, I visited a constituent, a retired nurse whose  home had been fully electrified and weatherized by SMUD. This includes  a heat pump, water heater, induction stove, ceiling fans, energy- efficient refrigerator, and insulation.   The Inflation Reduction Act would allow SMUD to significantly expand  this program, which would positively impact my constituents.   H.R. 1 would repeal the home rebate program. This legislation would  repeal a program that could save Americans up to $14,000. This is  nothing more than a shameless giveaway to Big Oil when we need to be  accelerating the clean energy transition.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
