 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the  people of Iran protesting the ayatollah's regime after a 22-year-old  young woman, Mahsa Amini, died after being detained by Iran's morality  police for allegedly incorrectly wearing a hijab.   Iranians are standing up to the ayatollah's regime's oppression of  women by cutting their hair, burning their hijabs, and demanding  freedom.   The Iranian Government began a violent crackdown on the protests that  have resulted in dozens of protesters being killed, including women and  teenagers.   I want Iranian women to know that the United States stands with you  in your fight against the ayatollah's oppression and that the Iranian  people have our support in your fight for freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in amplifying our voices  for the people of Iran and holding the regime accountable.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Luetkemeyer for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the SBIR and STTR Extension  Act of 2022. This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the Small  Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer  Programs for 3 years and implements several reforms to strengthen the  programs for years to come.    This bill safeguards taxpayer dollars by ensuring that we increase  the rate of successful commercialization, prohibits our adversaries  from reaping the benefits of our SBIR and STTR investments, and  encourages the rapid development of emerging technologies that are  vital for our national security.   In addition, this legislation would allow the Department of Defense  to adopt the successful open topic solicitation process pioneered by  the Air Force. The open topic solicitation will attract new small  businesses into the SBIR program, accelerate the development of  emerging technologies, broaden program access to young startups, and  increase the potential for commercial impact.   The SBIR and STTR programs are important tools for small businesses  to research, develop, and commercialize innovative technologies and  help create good-paying jobs.   As we all know, the CCP is taking concerted steps to bridge the  innovation gap with the United States and knock us down as the world  leader in innovation. We must never relent our country's position as  the leading innovator and creator of emerging technologies.   I thank Ranking Members Luetkemeyer and Lucas and Chairwomen  Velazquez and Johnson for their leadership in bringing a successful,  bicameral negotiation to reauthorize SBIR and STTR programs.   I urge my colleagues to support this underlying legislation and  continue our country's support for our small businesses and innovation.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the John Lewis Civil Rights  Fellowship Act. John Lewis was a powerful, tireless advocate for  equality and justice all his life.   Along with his mentor and friend, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he put  his life and personal safety on the line as a leader in the nonviolent  civil rights movement that profoundly changed our Nation for the  better.   His boldness in pursuit of justice was powerfully rooted in faith and  love. As he himself described it: ``At a very early stage of the  movement, I accepted the teaching of Jesus, the way of love, the way of  nonviolence, the spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation. The idea of  hate is too heavy a burden to bear. It is better to love.''   To help pass these values on to future generations, this bill  establishes the John Lewis Civil Rights Fellowship within the Fulbright  Program at the Department of State.   The Fulbright educational exchange program has enjoyed bipartisan  support for over 75 years. As part of Fulbright, the stated purpose of  the John Lewis Fellowship is ``to advance foreign policy priorities of  the United States by promoting studies, research, and international  exchange in the subject of nonviolent movements that established and  protected civil rights around the world.''   This bill is a worthy way of honoring a great man who sacrificed so  much to make America and the world a better place. I support the bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, John Lewis lived a life profoundly dedicated to  pursuing equality and justice for all, rooted in love and nonviolence.  The part he played in the brave struggle against racial injustice  changed the course of American history and inspired many around the  world.   This bill to create a Fulbright fellowship program in his name is a  fitting tribute to his legacy. I support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  2120     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume, and I rise in support of this bill.   Madam Speaker, today, 50 million people in 45 countries are living on  the brink of famine, and more than 350 million people around the world  are facing emergency food insecurity. This is a staggering increase  from record-breaking levels of hunger last year.   Russia's unprovoked and full-scale invasion of Ukraine, previously  known as the breadbasket of Europe, has worsened an already  overwhelming global food crisis and is destabilizing fragile states.   Global food prices are expected to increase by 20 percent and could  be even higher in developing countries that are highly dependent on  imported commodities from Ukraine and Russia.   These shocks are creating shortages and instability that affect the  entire world, including our constituents.   First enacted in 2016, and amended in 2018, the Global Food Security  Act provides critical authorities to respond to immediate global food  needs and to advance longer term agricultural-led economic growth.   I am a cosponsor of today's bipartisan legislation to refine and  extend those authorities for another 5 years, through 2028. Madam  Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Congresswoman McCollum, Congressman  Chris Smith, Chairman Meeks, and Ranking Member McCaul, for their  leadership in this effort.   In order to prevent the next food crisis, we must increase the  resiliency of communities around the world to shocks like natural  disasters, supply chain disruptions, and fertilizer shortages. This is  why the U.S. is working with partner countries to advance targeted  efforts to increase agricultural productivity, invest in food systems  and market-based approaches to agricultural-led economic growth, and,  ultimately, support communities' abilities to provide for themselves.   These strategic agricultural development activities are a critical  investment in preventing future humanitarian emergencies and dependency  on foreign aid.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time to close.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this bipartisan bill to refine  and extend statutory authorities needed to respond to the global food  crisis and prevent future aid dependency. It updates the policy,  definitions, and the strategy requirements of the current law. It also  strengthens oversight and accountability and ensures continued focus on  core programs that have strong bipartisan support.   At its core, the bill embodies the saying, ``Give a man a fish, and  you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish, and you feed him for a  lifetime.''   These are effective, strategic investments in agriculture and  agricultural development to help ensure that communities and families  are able to provide for themselves.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I hope that our  Senate colleagues will take it up promptly.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2140     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  bill, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I was proud to introduce the Millennium Challenge  Corporation Eligibility Expansion Act along with my Democratic  colleague from Texas, Mr. Castro.    In the nearly 20 years since its founding under President Bush, the  Millennium Challenge Corporation has demonstrated a strong track record  of success in its mission of combating poverty through economic growth.   The agency has enjoyed broad bipartisan support, earned through  strict project selection criteria and the ability to hold partner  countries to a high standard of accountability. But the agency and its  partners are facing new challenges. The Chinese Communist Party is  increasing its malign influence in the developing world, often  disguised as development assistance. The world is facing a food  security crisis and other effects of Russia's unprovoked war in  Ukraine.   Many countries risk losing progress on development and poverty  reduction made over previous decades. This bill will ensure that the  world's 125 poorest countries are eligible for potential consideration  as candidate countries in the MCC's rigorous selection process. It adds  stability to MCC's partnerships, and it ensures its ability to focus on  the world's poorest populations, who are often the most vulnerable to  debt traps and other forms of outside manipulation.   This bill is an important step towards equipping MCC to operate in  today's environment so, that it can continue to use its proven,  evidence-based model to build sustainable economic growth,  transparency, and stability in partner countries around the world.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the Millennium Challenge  Corporation has done important work on behalf of the American people to  promote economic growth and transparency around the world. But we must  make sure that the agency is equipped to address the challenges and  threats of today, including those posed by our strategic rivals who are  attempting to increase their global influence.  [[Page H8200]]    Madam Speaker, I, again, thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro),  my colleague, our bipartisan cosponsors, and Chairman Meeks and Ranking  Member McCaul of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for moving this bill  forward.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  2150     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. The Chinese Communist  Party is at war with religious freedom. The CCP treats as threats those  organizations and allegiances that it does not control. Members of the  CCP and the PLA are required to be atheists and are prohibited from  practicing a religion. National law effectively prohibits young people  in China from receiving any religious education.   Xi Jinping is ramping up his so-called Sinicization of religion and  is expressly demanding that religious groups support the control and  ideology of the Chinese Communist Party. The consequences for those who  refuse to submit are brutal.   House-church Protestant Christians, underground Catholics, Tibetan  Buddhists, Uyghur Muslims, Falun Gong practitioners, and other people  who seek to worship freely are repressed.   The State Department's annual religious freedom reports note deaths  in police custody. They also state that the PRC ``tortured, physically  abused, arrested, disappeared, detained, sentenced to prison, subjected  to forced labor and . . . harassed adherents of both registered and  unregistered religious groups for activities related to their religious  beliefs and practices.''   Both the Trump and Biden administrations have correctly recognized  the PRC's brutal crackdown and forced encampment of Uyghur Muslims and  other minorities in Xinjiang as a genocide, involving crimes against  humanity.   According to credible reports, more than 800,000 Muslim children have  been separated from their families.   Just this week, 90-year-old Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen is on trial  in Hong Kong, one of several Catholic bishops imprisoned and actively  persecuted by the CCP. Numerous Protestant pastors remain in detention,  and the government continues to demolish church buildings and crosses.  [[Page H8202]]    Religious believers in China deserve our prayers, our respect, and  our support.   This bill before us today will help ensure that CCP officials  responsible for this persecution are identified, sanctioned, and denied  visas into the United States.   It also states that the People's Republic of China has continued to  earn designation as a ``country of particular concern'' under the  International Religious Freedom Act. It calls for efforts by the United  States, including diplomacy at the highest levels, to promote the  protection of Christians and other religious minorities inside China.  It expresses the sense of Congress that the U.N. Human Rights Council  should formally condemn the PRC for its ongoing genocide in Xinjiang as  well as its persecution of Christians and other religious groups. The  inability of that Council to condemn such massive human rights abuses  is an indictment of its effectiveness.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler)  for introducing this important bill of which I am a proud cosponsor. It  deserves our unanimous support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, the Chinese Communist Party persecutes religious  believers who will not submit their religious convictions to CCP  control. It reacts with brutality against any attempted religious  practice outside of the five religious patriotic associations allowed  and controlled by the regime.   This bill tells the truth about the dangers faced by Christians,  Uyghur Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and other religious minorities in  China and takes steps to sanction their CCP persecutors.   I am an enthusiastic cosponsor of this bill by my colleague from  Missouri, and I urge its unanimous passage.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
