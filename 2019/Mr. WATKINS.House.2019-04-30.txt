 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in honor of Liam Magathan  of Meriden, Kansas, whom I awarded last week the Silver Congressional  Award Medal.   Liam is a student at the University of Kansas. Through years of hard  work, dedication, and personal sacrifice, Liam has achieved this  prestigious honor.   I want to let Liam know how much I look up to him and how the world  would be a better place if more people were like him.   Keep up the good work, my friend. You are bringing pride upon  yourself, Kansas, and the United States of America.                            ____________________
