 Madam Speaker, I rise with a very simple question. On  January 6, thousands broke the law by taking siege of our Capitol here  with us inside.   Has any one of those individuals who brought violence on this Capitol  been brought here to answer whether they did that because of our  President?   It appears I will receive no answer.
