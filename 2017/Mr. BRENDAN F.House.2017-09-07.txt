 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, the U.S.  Institute of Peace gives people in conflict abroad the skills and  techniques to solve their conflicts without resorting to violence.   The Institute owes its creation to the many men and women who came  before us and worked hard in its creation during the Reagan  administration. One of the early founders and board members at the  start was Father Ted Hesburgh, who many in this body knew as the  president of the University of Notre Dame. Father Ted, as we all called  him, sadly, passed away in 2015.   Back in 2011, when the Institute was similarly threatened, he wrote  this: ``. . . That Congress would seek to eliminate funding for the  United States Institute of Peace is abhorrent and unthinkable.''   ``. . . As a man of faith and reason, I know that we need to balance  our budget. But I also know that you cannot balance a budget on the  backs of our men and women in uniform. Nor can we take the risk of  making our country less safe. We need the tools of diplomacy and  peacebuilding to stop international conflict before it starts and to  manage its aftermath.''   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record an op-ed Father Hesburgh wrote,  dated February 27, 2011.                 [From the Washington Post, Feb. 27, 2011]                   The U.S. Can't Turn Its Back on Peace                             (By Ted Hesburgh)         Some would say that by the time you have lived almost a       century, you have seen it all. But what I saw the House of       Representatives do with its continuing resolution is beyond       the pale. That Congress would seek to eliminate funding for       the United States Institute of Peace is abhorrent and       unthinkable.        Congress should know better: The last century marked the       most violent and destructive era in human history. Wars great       and small cut short the lives of more than 100 million       people. We learned a great deal from those wars and,       fortunately, we now have a vibrant and active field of       peacebuilding. As recent events have shown, there is hopeful       progress for peaceful management of conflict but more       violence is certain to come in a world where disputes are       fueled by religious intolerance, ethnic divisions, failing       states, terrorism, intractable territorial conflicts and the       uncontrolled proliferation of highly destructive weaponry.       The young field of international conflict management is just       beginning to bear fruit.        Now is not the time, in the face of global adversity, to       cut peace. The United States must be a leader in nonviolent       international management. This conflict-ridden world needs an       organization committed to peacemaking: one that can deploy       teams of specialists to conflict zones; create and implement       methods of resolving disputes before guns are drawn; and       train leaders who can mediate conflicts and make civil       societies work. That is why Congress created the U.S.       Institute of Peace in 1984. President Ronald Reagan's wise       investment continues to pay dividends in the training and       education of peacemakers, facilitators, trainers and other       experts.        As a man of faith and reason, I know that we need to       balance our budget. But I also know that you cannot balance a       budget on the backs of our men and women in uniform. Nor can       we take the risk of making our nation less safe. We need the       tools of diplomacy and peacebuilding to stop international       conflict before it starts and to manage its aftermath. We       have wonderful institutions in the State Department and the       Pentagon but they alone cannot deal with every foreign       affairs issue. There are times when you need nongovernmental       organizations, legislative agencies and the help of those who       have relationships on the ground in conflict zones to run       interference or to pave the way for officials. We must never       suffer from pride and hubris, thinking that only Washington       has the answers.        All the global conflicts raging around us may have seemed       of little consequence to earlier generations. In the new       century, however, even small conflicts risk growing to a       scale that can destroy lives and economies around the world.       In the U.S. Institute of Peace we have an organization that       understands the sources of violence as well as the tools to       prevent international conflict.        If the United States is serious about peacemaking, its       citizens and national leaders must defend the institutions       that are doing the hard work of transitioning societies from       war to peace. The U.S. Institute for Peace should have a       permanent home in the nation's capital from which to teach,       inspire and prepare current and future generations of       peacemakers--and to be a symbol of America's commitment to       reducing violent international conflict in the 21st century.        We must, as a nation, show courage, steadiness of purpose       and commitment to core principles. We cannot afford the       alternatives.     BOYLE of Pennsylvania:        H.R. 3693.
