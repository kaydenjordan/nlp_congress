 Mr. Speaker, we have had an interesting week. Not a lot  of critical votes have taken place. It was more of an organizational  week we have had here. At the same time, the country's election hangs  in the balance.   I think it is important to take a step back in history, though. It is  very interesting when you look back and see what things have happened  in the past that maybe affected our future.   Here is an article from Republican _ Michigander published by  RedState:         Don't let Soros and the ``Secretary of State Project'' take       over your State.        In 2010, the Secretary of State Project is so far targeting       Michigan, California, Iowa, South Dakota, Ohio, and       Minnesota. This post is Michigan specific, but look at the       list of donors to a State level Michigan downticket race.       Chances are this is happening in your state, too.    The article says:         You know comrades, says Stalin, that I think in regard to       this: I consider it completely unimportant who in the party       will vote, or how; but what is extraordinarily important is       this--who will count the votes, and how. That is from Boris       Bazhanov's, ``Memoirs of Stalin's Former Secretary.''        Boss Tweed says, As long as I count the votes, what are you       going to do about it?        Some of the most overlooked and ultra-important positions       in this state, talking about Michigan, are those who run the       elections. Those are the county clerk, township/city clerk,       and the secretary of state's office. It takes the work of       these offices and their staffs to run the elections and make       sure the process is above board--and, again, this is 10 years       ago, 2010--competent, and with integrity. Livingston County       does a great job with its Bureau of Elections. While these       positions shouldn't be politicized, at least when it comes to       elections, they are in a big way, and this politicization is       coming to Michigan.        Some people don't like it when their boys don't make the       rules of the game. First and foremost is the benefactor of       the Democrats, convicted insider trader George Soros, the man       who broke the Bank of England. Much like his counterparts at       Goldman Sachs, he makes a killing off of speculating, and       what better way of doing that than by controlling elections.       Other rich leftist democrats also wanted to get their people       elected in their attempt to control our lives.        Their project is called the Secretary of State Project. Its       goal is to get their type of democrats in charge, and then       look the other way when ACORN and PIRG to commit voter fraud,       rigging the election for the democrats.        They had some success in 2006. . . .    And people can go online and find back in 2006 a report that George  Soros and Democrats were going to be funding elections and selections  of people, who would be involved in counting the votes in important  places.   Most of us didn't pay much attention to that. I know in Texas I  thought, well, we are Texas. We elect Republican Governors, and they  appoint our Secretary of State, so we are safe from this effort by the  Soros Democrats.   What I didn't think about back in 2006 and 2010 was the fact that  county clerks are really responsible for the vote counting in their  county. In most of east Texas, west Texas, south, and the Panhandle, if  a county clerk and her or his staff did not do the counting of the  ballots, we might get upset and vote them out. But in our biggest  cities, biggest counties, like Dallas, Harris County where Houston is,  Austin area, San Antonio area, they hire firms that come in, some of  which we find out had Soros-type money that helped start these things.  Maybe it is his, maybe it wasn't, maybe it was through Open Source or  Tidewater, different groups that launder the money through different  organizations, so it is hard to tell where it really came from, but we  know it is people that wanted to control elections that got involved in  deciding who would be in charge of counting the votes. Just like  brother Stalin and brother Boss Tweed, they had figured out it doesn't  matter who votes. What matters is who counts the votes.                                time  1245    So this article goes on. This is 2010. FOX News reported: ``Since  2006 the Democracy Alliance, a left leaning influence group funded by  George Soros among others, has had remarkable success in targeting and  claiming Secretary of State's offices in 11 of 13 critical States they  targeted, including Ohio, Minnesota and Iowa.   ``Called the Secretary of State Project (SOSP) its aim is to target  and capture the obscure, often overlooked office and implement election  rules changes that give democrats a better chance of winning a  plurality. Among those changes that the Secretary of State Project  calls `election protection,' are a loosening of voter registration  requirements and a lessening of efforts to prevent fraudulent voting,  according to Matthew Vadum, a political analyst with the Capital  Research Center.   `` `The thing that is amazing is that they can get the office for as  little as $100,000 in campaign funding because no one pays attention to  it, and they get to control election opportunities in a State. It is  cheap,' Vadum said. He said SOSP is currently targeting three States in  the 2010 election: California, Michigan, and Minnesota. In total they  count for 82 electoral votes.   ``Vadum says that because of chaos and demoralization the Republican  Party has not formulated a response to the Secretary of State Project  or tried to match their efforts.''   That was 2010. We did not learn. And those campaigns, the project,  had a profound effect.   ``Brunner has been a disaster in Ohio, unless you are trying to rig  the game for the dems. There was tons of shadiness in Ohio for the 2008  election. The good news about Brunner is that she is running for U.S.  Senate where she can do less damage, even if she wins.   ``Brunner made news in October 2008 when she declined to hand over to  county election boards 200,000 names on voter registration forms where  the drivers license or Social Security number on the forms did not  match the name. The Secretary of State Project praised her actions.''   This is another report: ``Blackwell's office was one of the first and  most critical offices claimed by the Secretary of State Project. He was  succeeded in 2006 by Jennifer Brunner, who received $167,000 in  campaign contributions from the Secretary of State Project, and  immediately began a complete overhaul of Ohio's voting system. Among  the changes she made were allowing election day registration and the  failure to purge election rolls of ineligible and dead voters.''   As Lyndon Johnson famously told his campaign manager:   No, sir. This man has every bit as much right to vote as anybody else  in this cemetery.   Back to the article. ``Her most memorable moment was when a Federal  court judge ruled that she had violated Federal law for `not taking  adequate steps to validate the identity of newly registered voters.' At  the time she admitted that there were `discrepancies' in about 200,000  new registrations but refused to allow polling workers to take action  on the questionable ballots.''   Mr. Speaker, if someone begins to see a pattern--gee, this was 2010.  I didn't wake up until late in 2018. But this went on around the  country, getting people in positions that they would be responsible for  counting the votes and making rules, though that is supposed to be left  to the legislature of each State, according to the Constitution, making  rules as to what votes count and what votes don't.  [[Page H6011]]    Going back to the article. ``When Jennifer Brunner defeated incumbent  Kenneth Blackwell in Ohio in 2006, 12 of the 18 individuals who  contributed the maximum $10,000 to Brunner's campaign resided in States  other than Ohio. (One of these donors, incidentally, was Teresa Heinz  Kerry.) Said Brunner, `I received significant support from the  Secretary of State Project, which helped me toward the election.'   ``Brunner went on to make her influence felt in the 2008 election  cycle, when she ruled that Ohio residents should be permitted, during  the designated early-voting period extending from late September to  early October, to register and vote on the very same day. Citing the  potential for voting fraud under such an arrangement, Republicans  objected. But on September 29 of that year--the day before early voting  was scheduled to commence--the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Brunner's  decision.''   I thank the Ohio Supreme Court for their contribution to voter fraud;  and not to leave out our wonderful Chief Justice John Roberts, who  similarly ruled, in effect:   So what. There is fraud maybe, maybe not. I am not going to do  anything about it. Thank you very much.   ``In a separate matter, Brunner sought to effectively invalidate a  million absentee-ballot applications that Republican Presidential  candidate John McCain's campaign had issued. Each of those applications  had been inadvertently printed with an extra, unnecessary checkbox, and  Brunner maintained that if a registrant failed to check the box--even  if he or she signed the form--the application could be rejected. On  October 2, the Ohio Supreme Court overturned Brunner's directive on  grounds that it served `no vital purpose or public interest.' ''   I mean, after all, it was John McCain; he was going to be beat, so we  will let that one go.   ``Brunner's most noteworthy claim to fame took place in October 2008,  when she refused to provide county election boards approximately  200,000 voter-registration forms in which the name did not match the  driver's license or Social Security number.   ``Count the dems, and reject the GOP votes. Boss Tweed would be  proud. That is what the Secretary of State Project wanted, and what  they got.   ``Mark Ritchie was the Secretary of State who certified Al Franken's  win on a recount. He was a Secretary of State Project candidate and  here is the result.   ``(Mary) Kiffmeyer is `absolutely sure' that Ritchie's efforts to  eliminate voting regulations ensured Franken's victory.    `` `The first thing he did when he got into office was to dismantle  the ballot reconciliation program we started. Under that program  districts are required to check that the number of ballots issued by  matching them with the number of ballots cast,' she said, `that way we  know immediately that the vote count is accurate.'   `` `But that isn't what happened,' she said. `We now have 17,000 more  ballots cast than there are voters who voted and no way to determine  what went wrong. Why anyone would eliminate that basic check, I don't  know,' she said.''   Well, she doesn't know, but some of us know exactly why you eliminate  that check to make sure the vote counting is accurate, because that way  you can have 17,000 people who didn't vote cast votes. And, obviously,  there are people that have lost with a whole lot less than 17,000 votes  on the other side.   ``The Vadum guy quoted earlier was Matthew Vadum. He is one of the  main guys at Capital Research, a good organization that has tracked the  shadiness of these foundations and similar groups for years. He wrote a  good piece in The American Spectator about the Franken-Coleman race and  its Secretary of State.   ``Both Franken and Obama, by the way, were endorsed by ACORN Votes,  ACORN's federal political action committee.   ``Minnesota's secretary of state isn't a Democrat by happenstance.   ``Ritchie, who defeated two-term incumbent Republican Mary Kiffmeyer  in 2006, received an endorsement and financial assistance for his run  from a below-the-radar nonFederal `527' group called the Secretary of  State Project. The entity can accept unlimited financial contributions  and doesn't have to disclose them publicly until well after the  election.   ``The founders of the Secretary of State Project, which claims to  advance `election protection' but only backs Democrats, religiously  believe that right-leaning secretaries of state helped the GOP steal  the presidential elections in Florida in 2000 (Katherine Harris) and in  Ohio in 2004 (Ken Blackwell).   ``The secretary of state candidates the group endorses sing the same  familiar song about electoral integrity issues: Voter fraud is largely  a myth, vote suppression is used widely by Republicans, cleansing the  dead and fictional characters from the voter rolls should be avoided  until embarrassing media reports emerge, and anyone who demands that a  voter produce photo identification before pulling the lever is a  racist, democracy-hating Fascist.   ``Most media reports also leave out the fact that Ritchie has  extensive ties to the controversial in-your-face direct action group,  ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), whose  employees have been implicated in electoral fraud time and time  again.''   Which is another reason ACORN doesn't exist. They were driven out of  existence because of illegality and fraud, and it sounds like they just  melded into other groups that were trying to do the same things ACORN  did before being disbanded.   Going back to the article. ``In 2006, the Minnesota ACORN Political  Action Committee endorsed Ritchie and donated to his campaign.  According to the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure  Board, contributors to Ritchie's campaign included liberal  philanthropists George Soros, Drummond Pike, Deborah Rappaport, along  with veteran community organizer Heather Booth, a Saul Alinsky disciple  who cofounded the Midwest Academy, a radical ACORN clone. One article  on Ritchie's 2006 campaign website brags about the fine work ACORN did  in Florida to pass a constitutional amendment to raise that State's  minimum wage.   ``ACORN got their man in. Their man made sure Stuart Smalley became a  senator. The good news is that Mark Ritchie is running for reelection  in Minnesota. Hopefully, the good people there throw his sorry rear  out.   ``But closer to home, the Secretary of State Project wants their own  Mark Ritchie or Jennifer Brunner right here in Michigan. Her name is  Jocelyn Benson. What are Benson's credentials?   ``Benson is a native of Philly, well known for vote fraud.''   In 2010, this article is being written. Philly, well known for vote  fraud. Don't we know.   ``She went to Harvard Law. I have seen enough damage done by Harvard  Law politicians like Obama and Granholm to refuse to back anyone who  went there for political office. In 2004, for the democrats, she ran  the poll challenging/poll watching programs for the DNC. They want the  fox guarding the henhouse. She is also a protege of Jennifer Brunner.  Yes, that Brunner. She was recently endorsed (before dems convention)  by the SEIU, the most far left of the union leadership.   ``The Blog Prof has been on the case researching Benson with posts  here and here.   ``In order to ensure that elections are fair, conducted with  integrity, and legitimate, Jocelyn Benson and her friends at Secretary  of State Project MUST be defeated by any legal means necessary. We must  keep ACORN, PIRG-IM, Soros, MoveOn.org, and the rest of those groups  out of the Secretary of State office here.   ``We will be keeping a close eye on this race. . . .''                                time  1300    But nonetheless, that again, that was 2010, and then they go on to  list lots of liberal Democrats supporting the Secretary of State  Project, at least 250 of the 1,600.   But then here is another article from February of 2010, FOX News, Ed  Barnes: ``States' Secretaries of State Are Tipping the Balance of  Power.''   ``In 2000, it was Katherine Harris, the secretary of state of  Florida, who made critical decisions that helped swing the State  Republican.   ``In 2004, it was Kenneth Blackwell, Ohio's secretary of state, who  earned  [[Page H6012]]  democratic wrath for ensuring a close Republican win.   ``In 2008, it was the secretary of state of Minnesota, Mark Richie,  who handed that State's Senate seat to Al Franken and control of  Congress to the Democrats.   ``In every major election since 2000, secretaries of state have  emerged as key, often decisive, and partisan figures in the outcomes of  those ballot battles.   ``And just last week in Massachusetts, there was cause of concern  that the upset victory by Scott Brown could be compromised by that  State's secretary of state, who has to certify the results.   ``According to Professor Robert Pastor of the Center for Democracy  and Election Management at American University, the situation has  gotten so bad that the partisan roles of the secretaries of states in  the election process are undermining the faith of Americans in the  election process.   `` `After the 2000 election, partisanship in the office accelerated.  It has skewed enough elections since then that a sufficient number of  Americans should be concerned,' he said. `We are worse than many Third  World countries' in holding fair and nonpartisan elections.''   And, again, that is February 2010 that this was written.   ``And now there is a quiet, below-the-radar but major effort to  target secretary of state offices in order to influence the outcome of  upcoming elections.   ``Since 2006, the Democracy Alliance, a left-leaning influence group  funded by George Soros among others, has had remarkable success in  targeting and claiming secretary of state's offices in 11 of 13  critical States they targeted, including Ohio, Minnesota and Iowa.   ``Called the Secretary of State Project, SOSP, its aim is to target  and capture the obscure, often overlooked office and implement election  rules changes that give Democrats a better chance of winning a  plurality.''   So, on that goes, and it covers some of the same ground as the last  article.   But it is amazing, though, the brilliant strategy--you know, if you  don't mind fraud--the brilliant strategy of targeting secretaries of  state, and in States like Texas where the secretary of state is  appointed by a Republican Governor--has been for years--you go after  the county clerks and make sure you have got good, stout Democrats who  will hire firms funded, started by Democrat-leaning organizations so  that they can work the system.   Now, I mentioned earlier, I didn't wake up on how serious this  effort, this brilliant effort by people on the far left was until I saw  evidence of manipulating the results in Dallas County by the firm--and  if I recall correctly, that may have been one of the Canadian-started  firms. It has been a while, but they were hired to come in.   And think about it. If you wanted to manipulate the outcome of an  election, you get your person in to hire a firm where people could be  trained to manipulate the vote.   And say you had early voting, like Dallas, like every place in Texas  had, and each precinct turns in a flash drive with the votes on the  flash drive to the person heading up the Democrat firm--Democrat-funded  firm that then has from Friday night until Tuesday night to play with  those returns.   And there were clear indications that in 2018, in the primary, that  the early voting counts were manipulated.   They made some mistakes. But, you know, they were just getting this  thing down, trying to figure out how to do it without being caught, so  they made some silly blunders that made very evident the fact that they  had manipulated numbers in the primary.   By the general election of 2018 in Dallas County, they got better  about hiding it, but when you have got brilliant people who are looking  into it, it is easier. I mean, those manipulations can be found and  were found, and the information was offered to the Texas attorney  general, whom I personally urged multiple times over the past 2 years:  You have got to get on top of this, because the manipulations that we  saw in Dallas County need to be exposed. People need to be indicted,  and people need to go to jail for stealing elections or, at least,  manipulating elections, and that way we can ensure a fair vote  nationally in 2020.   Apparently, our attorney general was preoccupied by other things, so  he never got around to getting a warrant, which I believe it sure  looked like probable cause evidence sufficient to get a warrant to  seize the vote counting equipment used in 2018.   As I understand, that has all been destroyed by now. The opportunity  was missed by the Texas attorney general's office to seize those with a  warrant and show for the world exactly how manipulations were done. It  is a lost opportunity.   And, of course, since we have a Director of the FBI who has shown  more of an interest--he was put there to clean up the FBI of the  massive abuse at the top, not necessarily demonstrated around the  country. We have got a lot of great FBI agents around the country, but  right here in Washington, I have seen the corruption firsthand. I have  seen manipulation of the truth. I have seen FBI agents who lied about  what they found and what they did in order to prevent people from being  prosecuted that should have been.   I have seen deals made like with Cheryl Mills: Gee, you let us--we  have got plenty of evidence to get a warrant and seize your computer,  but if you will just let us look, we promise not to make copies of  anything. We promise that we will give it back, and we promise, under  this agreement, you can't be prosecuted for anything that we find--and  then giving the evidence back that could have been seized with a  warrant, allowing that individual to sit in on the questioning of a  potential target, though Mills could have been a target herself.    These are the kinds of things that have given people across America  the wrenching questions: Why has nobody gone to jail on that side of  the political aisle?   And that is a good question, and the answer is heartbreaking.   If we don't enforce the rule of law, especially in something as  critical as elections, then we have known for some time we were going  to be headed in the direction of a Third World government. And that is  apparently what we have got in this election.   It could still be saved. The good thing for those involved in fraud  in this last election is that you have a lot of Republicans who say:  Look, we just want people to get along. You know, it is unpleasant when  you talk about fraud in an election.   Well, yeah, it is because it will mean the end of this little  experiment in self-government. So, yeah, that is unpleasant to talk  about. But if we don't clean up the process in this election, then  there will be no free and fair future elections.   As a judge handling felonies, it was made clear in the short school  we went to upon becoming judges, and then it was made abundantly  clear--anybody who just kept researching the law, trying to follow the  law--that there are two critical types of deterrents that can ensure a  brighter future for a self-governing country.   One is general deterrence. There needs to be treatment of  lawbreakers, in this case, people who have been involved in the fraud,  to such an extent that the general public would not be tempted to  engage in the fraudulent conduct. But that would be a deterrent. It  would scare them out of participating.   That is what I had hoped if our Texas attorney general's office had  pursued the fraud that we knew of in Dallas County from the 2018  elections. There could have been general deterrents.   And then, also, there are specific deterrents for the person engaged  in the fraud, and that is you have a sentence strong enough that would  deter the individual criminal from engaging in such conduct in the  future that they would want to conform their conduct to the  requirements of the law so they did not end up with another sentence  like they got in that case.   The problem for both general and specific deterrents, when it comes  to voter fraud over recent years, is there has been no deterrence.  There were a number of indictments issued in specific places, including  the Gregg County commissioner, Democrats involved and others, but none  involving the big frauds that would change a national election.   So that has been really tragic to see the missed opportunities. But  those of us who never stop studying history know that this is one of  those lessons  [[Page H6013]]  that gets--that is failed to be learned over and over, that brings  about the end to republics.   Of course, in the first great republic, the Roman Republic, they had  tried to learn lessons from the democracy of Athens, and they did. But  soon things degenerated. The leadership was absent.   Caesar, as head of the military, did something that was illegal,  crossed the Rubicon, and that was the end of the republic. Though  senators still continued to be elected, by that point, it was a lost  cause.                                time  1315    So I am looking here at an affidavit by Mellissa Carone, and  something that many in the news media have not understood, and that is  that when you say an allegation is unfounded, it means there is no  evidence, a no evidence point, as appellate courts would call it. And  when there is somebody who has risked going to jail for perjury and  sworn to being a witness to fraud, then whether you like the evidence  or not, that is evidence. It is not unfounded. It is evidence.   There are hundreds of affidavits that have been produced--maybe  thousands. Some witnesses really don't have anything helpful,  speculative suggestions, and those are not real evidence because they  have no direct knowledge. It is kind of like the whistleblower--so- called whistleblower--who had no direct knowledge and no direct  evidence. Well, that is not evidence if it would not be admissible in  court. But if somebody has taken an oath and stated they witnessed  fraudulent conduct, that is evidence. In some cases, the testimony is  the creating of an environment in which fraud could occur and then  seeing indications that fraud had occurred.   As someone once said about circumstantial evidence--I know some  people say that you can't convict somebody on circumstantial evidence.  Oh, yes. It is done all the time. This particular law student gave an  example: If I am driving by Baylor Stadium, I can't see what is going  on inside the stadium. But I know it is the time that a game was  supposed to happen between Baylor and another team, and I can see the  scoreboard and both of those teams are listed on the scoreboard. There  is time that is clicking down, and there are scores, and there is the  roar of the crowd, and I see the score change. I don't have direct  evidence there is a football game going on, but when you look at all  the circumstances, then clearly that is circumstantial evidence that a  football game is going on.   So, Mr. Speaker, when you have evidence of all the circumstances and  then outcomes that show this could not have happened without some  misconduct or some gross negligence, then you have got significant  evidence.   This affidavit by this witness talks about the Dominion training, and  this witness was hired, contracted, by Dominion Voting Services to  perform IT work at the TCF Center in Detroit for the November 3, 2020,  election. This person is a resident of Michigan.   It says:         During both shifts that were worked, I witnessed extreme       irregularities in ballot counting, ballot fabrication/      completion and data security.    Now, that is a summary, and again, not necessarily direct evidence,  since we don't have any specifics.   But the affidavit goes on:         Improper counting protocol was prevalent during both       shifts. It appeared the majority of people who manned the       scanners or the counters were either untrained, poorly       trained. They kept jamming machines and rescanning certain       stacks of ballots. The proper procedure was to run a batch, a       stack of 50 ballots through the tabulator and each ballot       counted only once. When a jam happened, the computer would       issue an error message indicating what number of the ballot       stack had jammed the tabulator. At that point, the counter       had two options: manually discard the batch on the tabulator       and rescan it, or to continue scanning from the jammed ballot       through the end of the batch.        Countless times, as I floated on the floor to assist with       the jammed tabulators, I saw workers rescan entire batches of       ballots without first discarding that very same partially       scanned batch. I witnessed entire ballot batches rescanned       multiple times.        Many Dominion employees were hired like me to un-jam the       tabulator machines throughout the counting process. The jams       and rescans of batches of ballots without the deletion of the       scanned partial batches of ballots prior to each rescan was       quite disturbing.        At about midnight I was assisting one of the counters with       a paper jam. I noticed his machine had a count of more than       400 ballots scanned in that particular batch. This was       unusual, to say the least, because only one lot of a batch is       processed at a time. This means that either the jammed batch       had been counted at least 8 times or the counting machine was       defective.        I was so disturbed at this problem I brought it to the       attention of my Dominion manager, Nick--    Whatever his last name is, however you say that.         Nick stated we were there to assist with IT, but not to run       their election.        Besides extreme counting irregularities, the adjudication       process volunteers watching the counting is supposed to be       witnessed by one Republican and one Democrat. The       conversations I overheard between those watching were usually       derogatory comments about Republicans, thus I concluded that       often there were two Democrat election volunteer poll       watchers at many of the machines and no Republican poll       watcher at all.        I want to describe what occurred during shift change, which       commenced about 7 p.m. It was chaotic and stunningly       disorganized. It took about 2 hours for people to be assigned       an area. At one point perhaps 30 people came downstairs to       tabulation machines to be counters. At least four of them,       one of whom I have known for over 20 years, told me they       received absolutely no training for the counting area       whatsoever. Upon information and belief, none of these       workers transferred to the mail-in ballot counting section       knew how to fix a tabulation problem. I showed many of these       new counters how to cancel a partially scanned batch of       ballots before resubmitting that jammed batch of ballots to       be rescanned. Many of these new counters whom I helped with       jams admitted they had received no training.        Prior to my first shift, I received an email from Dominion       that I would be issued a badge when I arrived at the TCF       Center. When I appeared for my first shift, it was difficult       to enter the TCF Center because I did not receive a badge and       could not prove my Dominion credentials. A Dominion employee       nicknamed Danielle came over and explained who I was. Only       then was I permitted to enter the building.        When I asked my manager, Nick, for a badge, he replied that       I didn't need a badge. He stated we did not want our names to       be showing because the challengers would attempt to question       us while working. As a related aside, I recall a co-worker       taking off her Dominion badge when a challenger asked whether       or not the adjudication hardware was connected to the       internet. Finally, Samuel Challendes removed his Dominion       badge after a challenger took my picture and was escorted       from the TCF Center.        Samuel Challendes, a top Dominion employee from Denver,       left the TCF Center midafternoon on November 3, 2020, to       assist at the warehouse.        When Samuel returned about 3 hours later, I asked him where       the warehouse was and who owned it. I asked: Is it like an       Amazon warehouse?        He said, no, then explained that we call it the Chicago       warehouse. It is where I had my pre-election training, the       city of Detroit elections building.        During the nightshift everyone was free to come and go as       they pleased in and out of the counting room. Some people       left reportedly to smoke and returned later to the counting       room. I believe it is illegal to do this because boxes and       stacks of ballots were left unattended. Nobody was present to       verify that no ballots were removed or brought in, no one was       paying attention, no one logged people as they came and went.       When I returned to the TCF Center at 10 a.m. November 4, I       walked right into the building, nobody stopped me, security       was absent and nonexistent.        Sometimes city workers asked me for the location of the       blank ballots. There was a white table of blank ballots left       unattended. When a worker had a ballot or ballots that they       deemed defective in some way, they would go to the white       table of blank ballots and complete one or some. I believe       they were supposed to complete the ballot to match exactly       what the voter intended. I saw city workers actually sign       names as this if they were the person who completed the       original ballot reportedly being replicated. Nobody was       present to verify if these newly completed replacement       ballots were identical.        Dominion employee Samuel Challendes and a city worker who       looked to be in his mid-twenties were responsible for       submitting the final ballot numbers into the main computer.       They had absolutely no supervision or accuracy verification.       Dominion manager, Nick, was on the main floor assisting with       IT jams most of the time. There was no city of Detroit staff       present to witness the process.        During the evening, I overheard Samuel talking to Nick       about losing tons of data. Then Samuel, Nick, and the city       worker all moved to the side of the stage and made calls on       their cellphones. I asked Nick what was going on. He replied       it was all taken care of and not to worry. I did not see       anyone approach the computer Samuel and the city worker       utilized. Nick went back to helping un-jam the tabulator       machines. It is my understanding this critical error remains       undocumented and unaddressed.  [[Page H6014]]         Two vans pulled up to the garage of the counting room, one       on day shift and one on night shift. I do not know what these       vans contained, but I doubt it was food, because there was a       shockingly short supply of food for the workers and I never       saw food leave either of the vans. Coincidentally, the news       announced Michigan discovered 100,000 additional ballots less       than 2 hours after the last van left the building.    She goes on to talk about she was the only Republican working for  Dominion Voting Systems that she was aware of.        There are more allegations and more statements, under oath.        On November 5 I called the FBI to report the activity I       witnessed which I believed to be criminal activity. After my       initial report I was disconnected. When I called back and       explained the nature of my call, I was placed on hold for a       long time. Eventually I was able to explain my concerns,       provide my contact information. As of today, I have not been       contacted by the FBI over my concerns of massive voter fraud.        But anyway, that is an affidavit, and affidavits are indeed       evidence.        Here is an affidavit from another witness. It is sworn to.       He personally observed the absent voter counting boards in       Detroit at the TCF Center. He has attended the Wayne County       campus on an almost daily basis.                                time  1330         On November 17, there was a meeting of the board of       canvassers to determine whether to certify the results of       Wayne County. The meeting did not start until 5, supposed to       start at 3. We were told it was delayed so that       representatives of the Democrat board members could obtain       additional affidavits.        At 5 p.m., an open meeting and discussion began to discuss       the issue of whether to certify the vote. In my review of the       results, I determined that approximately 71 percent of       Detroit's 134 absent voter counting boards were left       unbalanced and many unexplained. I informed the board members       of the discrepancies, but soon thereafter, a motion to       certify was made by Vice Chairman Jonathan Kinloch. After       further discussion, I renewed my concerns that the reason       that the numbers did not balance for the majority of the       AVCBs in Detroit and, importantly, could not be explained. If       the vote totals did not match, there should have been a       documented reason explaining why.        The board considered the ultimate question of whether to       certify the vote, and the motion to certify failed 2-2.        This vote was followed by public derision from our two       Democrat colleagues. I, and Monica Palmer, who also voted       against certification, were berated and ridiculed by members       of the public and other board members. This conduct included       specious claims that I was racially motivated in my decision.       This public ostracism continued for hours, during which time,       we were not provided an opportunity to break for dinner and       were not advised that we could depart and resume the hearing       on another date.        I discussed a potential resolution with Vice Chair Kinloch       in confidence. Ms. Anderson-Davis told us that we must vote       to certify on that night. We were told that we could not       consider matters such as the unexplained reasons that most of       Detroit's AVCBs did not balance, and no one knew why.    They were told they couldn't consider that.         During the evening, Wayne County counsel, Ms. Janet       Anderson-Davis, and my colleagues on the board continued to       discuss irregularities. Ms. Anderson-Davis advised the board       that the discrepancies were not a reason to reject the       certification, and based on her explicit legal guidance, I       was under the belief that I could not exercise my independent       judgment in opposition to the certification. Therefore, I       voted to certify the results.        Late in the evening, I was enticed to agree to certify       based on the promise that a full and independent audit would       take place. I would not have agreed to the certification but       for the promise of an audit.    Then he goes on to explain the different promises he was made. But as  pointed out:         There are questions that need to be answered and can only       be answered if Wayne County's canvass is transparent and       provides information within its control. That information       includes:        The logs indicating when drop box ballots were collected       and delivered, the log of persons who made these deliveries       and who had access to drop-box keys and when that access was       obtained.        Similar concerns exist regarding the delivery of ballots to       the TCF Center during the night of November 3 and the morning       hours of November 4.        I am also concerned about the use of private moneys       directing local officials regarding the management of the       elections, how these funds were used.    He goes on:         Why do the poll books, qualified voter files, and final       tallies not match or balance?        Seventy-one percent of Detroit's did not balance. Why not?    Anyway, great questions that need to be answered if we are going to  ever get to a proper finding regarding the results in Wayne County.   I have an affidavit from Monica Palmer that was just mentioned. So  like I said, there are hundreds of affidavits and sworn testimony as to  improprieties.   It should be noted, a lot of people have heard about, this is the  title, ``Dominion Part of Council That Disputed Election Integrity  Concerns in DHS Statement.'' This is by Jeff Carlson with Epoch Times.   But we now know--it has been blasted all over the news--that the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency headed by Christopher  Krebs--he was fired. But before he was fired, his Agency issued a  statement on November 12 disputing the allegation, saying: ``The  November 3 election was the most secure in American history.''   What that Agency failed to disclose, however, is that Dominion Voting  Systems is a member of the cybersecurity agency CISA. They are a member  of CISA's Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council, one of  the two entities that authored the statement put out by CISA saying  there is no fraud.   The Agency didn't respond to requests for comment immediately, but  this article goes on to point out both Dominion and Smartmatic are  listed as members of CISA's Sector Coordinating Council and appear to  be actively involved, as they are named as organizing members. Among  the key objectives is to ``serve as primary liaison between the  election subsector and Federal, State, and local agencies, including  the Department of Homeland Security.''   Let's face it, Mr. Krebs worked for Microsoft at one time. They are  not big fans of President Trump, nor is Bill Gates. But this article  says: ``As CISA notes, they do not have direct oversight or  responsibility for the administration of our Nation's elections as that  responsibility lies with State and local governments.''   Yet, they had no problem issuing a statement promising everybody that  these elections were totally free of fraud. Dominion used CISA to deny  the allegations against Dominion.   There is more in that article, but time is short.   It is amazing. There was a judge, though. The judge didn't issue any  order that cleaned up the problem. The judge noted that the case  presented ``serious system security vulnerability and operational  issues that may place plaintiffs and other voters at risk of  deprivation of their fundamental right to cast an effective vote that  is accurately counted.''    That is kind of like John Roberts: Yep, the case is presented. Could  be a lot of fraud here, but I am going to let the fraud go forward. I  am not going to deal with it.   This could be the last election where there is any hope of having a  true two-party system for President. We saw what happened with the  abuse by the FBI, Department of Justice, State Department, a certain  individual or possibly individuals. Even the Department of Defense got  involved, trying to frame President Trump's campaign, justified,  according to some, originally, spying on the campaign. But we know a  lot more now.   But let me make clear to people that are a bit slow-witted, like  somebody at the Dallas Morning News: I have never advocated for  revolution. I have mentioned the American Revolution, but I have quoted  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., including in the speech where I was said  to have advocated for revolution. I said: We must follow his example,  and that is a peaceful demonstration, that we can rise up, but it must  be peaceful.   How much clearer does it need to be?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
