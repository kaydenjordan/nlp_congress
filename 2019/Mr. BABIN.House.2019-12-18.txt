 Madam Speaker, we are here today because House Democrats  have spent upwards of $30 million in 3 years trying to overturn the  2016 election of President Trump and come up with nothing.   Because of their radical leftwing, Democrats are willing to make all  future Presidential elections invalid until judged worthy by the  majority in the House of Representatives.   The President of the United States does not serve at the pleasure of  the House of Representatives.   Perhaps the greatest denial of reality regarding President Trump is  acknowledging that, under his policies, things are actually going much  better than they have in decades for working Americans.   We are a democratic constitutional Republic in which power flows from  we the people to our President and elected officials.   The Democrat majority thinks otherwise. They believe that they are  entitled to rule us even if they have to change the rules to invalidate  the will and the votes of the people of America. That is why the  absence of a case does not matter in this charade of impeachment.   I believe that the American people recognize and share my urgency  about what is at stake here.   Madam Speaker, you and your majority may decide today, but I have  faith that the American people will decide otherwise next November.
