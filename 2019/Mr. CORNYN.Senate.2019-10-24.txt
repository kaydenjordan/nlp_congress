 Madam President, we are rapidly approaching the 1-year  mark since President Trump and the Prime Minister of Canada and the  President of Mexico signed a new trade agreement to strengthen our  economies.   The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will replace NAFTA, the  North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and continue to guide  trade with our northern and southern neighbors in the future.   It is estimated by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that the number of  jobs in the United States that have been created directly as a result  of trade with Mexico ranges around the 5 million figure, with another 8  million from binational with Canada, so this is no small matter.   Since NAFTA was enacted in 1994, a lot has changed. The way we  communicate and the way we shop and even go about our daily lives rely  heavily on technology that didn't exist 25 years ago.   Make no mistake--NAFTA has been a huge benefit to our country, and  [[Page S6139]]  Texas has arguably benefited more than any other State. In 2018, Texas  exported nearly $110 billion in goods to Mexico, and we imported $107  billion worth of goods from Mexico.   When you consider actions being taken by China to counter our  interests all over the world, our reliance on North American partners  has become increasingly important. That only underscores the need to  ratify the USMCA and strengthen our trading relationship to ensure we  are not left behind as the global economy continues to evolve.   The USMCA is the most significant update to U.S. trade policy in a  generation and will propel our growing economy into the 21st century.  It takes into account businesses and practices that didn't exist when  NAFTA was created, such as 2-day shipping, online microretailers, and  digital products like eBooks and music. It also requires Canada and  Mexico to raise their de minimis shipment value levels, meaning  additional classes of shipments can enter all three countries with  expedited entry procedures. That is a big win for small and medium- sized businesses, which often lack the resources to pay customs duties  and taxes.   The USMCA prohibits restrictions on the cross-border movement of  data. It increases goods market access. It supports small businesses.  It boosts digital trade and safeguards intellectual property and  supports agriculture. It also keeps jobs here at home.   In short, this trade agreement is a big win for the American people.  Some even argue that the USMCA is more important than restoring our  normalized trading relationship with China.   Earlier this year, the International Trade Commission provided  insight into what we could expect to see once the USMCA is ratified.  Within 6 years, they say, we are looking at 176,000 new American jobs  and an increase in the gross domestic product by more than $68 billion.  That is a bigger impact than the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade  agreement.   The USMCA is expected to have a positive impact on every industry  sector in the U.S. economy. We can look forward to a more than $43  billion increase in exports and more than $31 billion in imports. That  is great news for North American workers, farmers, ranchers, and  business men and women who will reap the benefits of this agreement.   When I am meeting with my constituents back home or here in  Washington, one of the most common questions I get asked is, ``When is  the USMCA going to pass?''   Mexico has already ratified the agreement, and Canada is waiting for  us to move before acting. The agreement has broad support in the  Senate, and clearly the President is on board as well. So the only  holdup in the entire process is the House of Representatives.   Up until about a month ago, I told my constituents that I thought the  prospects for passage sometime this year were looking pretty good.  House Democrats did have some concerns, but Speaker Pelosi was  reportedly working in good faith with the administration to work  through them. There were indications of progress and productive  conversations with Mexico and Canada to address their concerns as well.   It looked as though we were moving along a path to a deal, but then  the House blew up all plans for a productive year in Congress. They  marched headlong into impeachment and tossed aside important  legislation. Forget working on a trade deal that will benefit every  sector of the economy; House Democrats are too busy conducting secret  hearings in an effort to force the President--someone they despise--out  of office.   Whether they intend to allow the USMCA to receive a vote in the House  is unknown, but I sincerely hope that House Democrats have enough good  sense to avoid blowing up a vital trade deal over political  disagreements with the President. As we all know, the closer you get to  an election, the more challenging legislating actually becomes, and the  clock is ticking away. It is a shame that the House continues to put  politics ahead of good policy that will benefit the entire American  people.   The USMCA is good for the economy, good for business, good for  workers, and it sure is good for Texas. It is time for the House to  quit playing games so we can ratify this trade agreement without  further delay.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
