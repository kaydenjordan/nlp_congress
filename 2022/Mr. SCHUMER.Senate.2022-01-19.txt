 Mr. President, in the fall of 1868, recently freed  African-American men participated in Federal elections for the first  time in American history. According to Ron Chernow's biography of  Ulysses S. Grant, the impacts of expanding the vote were immediate and  dramatic.         In a startling reversal for an area once dominated by       slavery, the elections spawned black sheriffs, school board       members, state legislators, and congressmen. That yesterday's       slave laborer was today's state legislator horrified many       white southerners who refused to accept this extraordinary       inversion of their bygone world.    Naturally, the opponents of voting rights had an answer. Chernow  continues:         [T]o circumvent the fifteenth amendment, white politicians       in Georgia [and other states] devised new methods of       stripping blacks of voting rights, including poll taxes,       onerous registration requirements--    Let me repeat that quote.         [O]nerous registration requirements, and similar       restrictions copied in other states.    Many attempts were made by this very body to stop these sinister  laws, but the result was ultimately a failure.   By 1877, ``the black community in the South steadily lost ground  until a rigid apartheid separated the races completely, a terrible  state of affairs that would not be fixed until the rise of the civil  rights movement after World War II.''   Today, the U.S. Senate meets in a different century, facing new and  different dangers but wrestling with the same fundamental question: How  will the Members of this body protect and expand the most basic right  of American citizens, the wellspring of our democracy, the thing that  distinguished America from all of the countries in Europe when it was  established in, first, 1776 and then 1789--the right to vote--the most  important wellspring of our democracy, the most important feature of  our democracy?   How will the Members of this body expand and protect the most basic  right--the right to vote--from forces, right now in the 21st century,  conspiring to take it away?   That is why, today, the U.S. Senate will debate legislation to  protect our  [[Page S278]]  democracy, and the eyes of history--the eyes of history--are upon us.   The question that is before us today is as old as the Republic  itself. The story of democracy has been a long march toward universal  suffrage, a holy struggle to take the vision of our Framers and make it  real in the present.   The march, unfortunately, has often not been linear. At the time of  our Constitution's ratification, you had to be, in many States, a  White, male, Protestant, landowner to vote. How many in this Chamber  would have been able to participate in those early elections?   Throughout our Nation's history, moments of significant progress have  often been followed by reactionary backlash. Unfortunately, it seems-- led by one party, compelled by the most dishonest President in our  history--we are in another of those dark periods.   That is why, for the first time--the first time--in this Congress,  the Senate is debating and will vote on legislation to confront these  threats: the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act.   For the information of all, debate on these bills will continue  throughout the day. And as soon as 6:30, if not a little bit later, we  will hold a cloture vote to conclude debate and proceed to final  passage on these measures.   I want to thank my colleagues who spoke yesterday in favor of these  bills. There were so many eloquent and strong speeches. At our caucus,  I have rarely seen such passion about the need to vote and the need to  change the rules to allow these vital bills--so fixed upon the  wellspring of our democracy, voting--to pass.    If the Republicans block cloture on the legislation before us, I will  put forward a proposal to change the Senate rules to allow for a  talking filibuster on this legislation, as recommended by a number of  our colleagues who have been working on this reform for a very long  time.   Make no mistake, win, lose, or draw, Members of this Chamber were  elected to debate and to vote, particularly on such an important issue  as this. And win, lose, or draw, we are going to vote--we are going to  vote--especially when the issue relates to the beating heart of our  democracy, as voting rights does.   For months, Senate Republicans have resisted virtually every attempt  at holding a bipartisan debate on voting rights legislation. Senate  Democrats have certainly tried to bring them onto the table.   Senate Democrats have certainly been willing to compromise to get  something done. My colleagues Senators Manchin and Kaine and Tester and  King and Durbin and Klobuchar and Leahy--and many more--have all met  with Republicans to initiate a dialogue, dating back to last August, if  not earlier. At virtually every turn, we have been met with resistance.   And amazingly enough, my colleagues--none of them are here to hear  it--our Republican colleagues don't even acknowledge that we have a  crisis. Leader McConnell even claimed that ``States are not engaged in  trying to suppress voters whatsoever.''   Let me read that quote again. This is from Leader McConnell's words:         States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters       whatsoever.    I would ask the Republican leader, if there is no effort to suppress  the vote, why have 19 States passed 33 new laws making it harder for  Americans to participate in our elections, in the aftermath of one of  the safest elections in American recent history, where there is  virtually no evidence of any material fraud--none.   If there is no effort to suppress the vote, why are States from Texas  to Montana restricting the number and hours of polling places? Why have  States like Florida and Texas made it harder to register--to register-- to vote? Is that not suppressing the vote?   Why are States like Iowa cutting down on the number of days you can  vote early? Is that not suppressing the vote?   And if there is no effort to suppress the vote, why have States like  Georgia made it a crime for volunteers to give food and water to voters  standing in line at the polls?   Leader McConnell, once again:         States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters       whatsoever.    Just as Donald Trump has his Big Lie, Leader McConnell now has his:         States are not engaging in trying to suppress voters       whatsoever.    The same types of lies that have motivated--the same type of Big Lie  that Donald Trump put forward has now motivated Leader McConnell and  many other Republicans to embrace that Big Lie and spout others that  come from the same poisonous tree.   And what is even more galling, knowing our history, that the laws  that I spoke of a minute ago don't target everyone. This is not an  effort aimed at everyone. They are aimed particularly at people of  color, at poor people, at young people, at disabled people, at elderly  people, at people who live in cities. Given the long history,  particularly against African Americans, Black Americans, of suppressing  the vote in every kind of way possible, this is particularly  disgraceful, particularly abhorrent, particularly obnoxious.   We all know the game here today, exemplified by every seat being  empty when we are having our first debate about voting rights, not  because Republicans agreed to go along but because we were able to use  a message from the House to go forward without their OK.   So we all know the game here. To date, I don't know if any of you  have, but I have not heard a single serious defense of these laws from  Senate Republicans. They don't come here to the floor to defend what is  going on in the States. What we have heard is sophistry, distractions,  and outright gaslighting.   For months, Senate Republicans have come up with excuses and  subterfuges to avoid doing the right thing, just like others have come  up with similar lame excuses and subterfuges in the past. But this is  the 21st century. We are supposed to have gone beyond that, but  unfortunately we have not. Facts are stubborn, and today's debate will  help us arrive at the facts of voter suppression before we vote to take  action. As we debate this issue so critical to the wellspring of our  democracy, will we all confront a critical question: Shall Members of  this Chamber do what is necessary to pass these bills and move them to  the President's desk?    It is my hope that courage awakens within the heart of our Republican  colleagues before the day is out. But if the Senate cannot protect the  right to vote, protect the cornerstone of our democracy under the  existing rules, then the Senate rules must be reformed.   Let me say this. We have diverse views about whether the filibuster  today in 21st century America is a good thing or a bad thing. And there  are some in our caucus who believe it helps bring--a few who believe it  helps bring--us together. I don't see evidence of that at all, and I  think the majority of my colleagues will agree with that. But even for  those who feel that the filibuster is a good thing and helps bring us  together, I would ask this question: Isn't the protection of voting  rights, the most fundamental wellspring of this democracy, more  important? Isn't protecting voting rights and preventing their  diminution more important than a rule in the Senate, which has not  always been in existence and was not envisioned by the Founders? That  is the question we should ask ourselves.   Our proposal for a talking filibuster on these pieces of legislation  would be the first step toward passing voting rights, restoring this  body, and breaking the gridlock that we now face on this vital issue.   In this body, proponents of our democratic rights, again and again,  have brought legislation to the floor only to be met by a filibuster.  Opponents of fair, open elections filibustered anti-poll tax  legislation in 1942, 1944, 1946. They filibustered the civil rights  bill of 1960. They filibustered legislation on literacy tests in 1962-- all this before real substantive progress was made.   Our struggle today is not new, but we must nevertheless meet it with  renewed conviction. Senate Democrats are under no illusion that we face  an uphill fight, especially when virtually every Republican has  remained staunchly against every attempt to pass voting rights  legislation. Again, I would remind the American people and every one of  my colleagues that this is a different Republican Party controlled  [[Page S279]]  by Donald Trump. Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush  all supported renewal of the Voting Rights Act--every one of them--and  it received large bipartisan majorities in the Senate.   It is a different Republican Party, not just on so many issues that  we debate but on this issue, the wellspring of our democracy. So we  know it is an uphill fight. But whenever this Chamber confronts a  question this important, one so vital to our country, you don't slide  it off the table and say, ``Never mind.'' You don't say, ``We are not  going to deal with this issue head-on.''   The Senators' job is to vote and to vote on the most important issues  facing us, and vote we will, and we are going to keep pushing. We are  going to keep working. We are going to keep fighting long after today  because the issue is so important to all of us.   I believe firmly in my bones, Mr. President, that if we follow Dr.  King's advice to just ``keep moving,'' history shows that doing the  right thing will eventually prevail. Justice will flow like the mighty  waters, as the Prophet Amos has said.   But the work of justice does not stir into action on its own. It is  up to us, Members of this body and Americans all across the country, to  do our part to make justice come alive today and assure that our  country does not backslide here in the 21st century.   So I urge my colleagues, for the sake of our beautiful, wonderful  democracy, for the sake of what the Founding Fathers called this  ``noble experiment,'' take a stand and do everything, everything,  everything you can to protect voting rights today--today--in this  Chamber.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is recognized.                                  H.R. 5746     Would my colleague yield just for a brief comment?    I just want to thank Senator Whitehouse. He has been a  leader on this issue. It doesn't get enough attention. It is very much  part of our bill, the Freedom to Vote Act. It is universally or  virtually universally supported, and it is one of the great scourges of  our politics.   If we don't move forward on these bills, we are not going to be able  to do this because we will not get the kind of bipartisan cooperation  we need on this horrible, horrible thing that I think all 50 of us  agree should be changed.   So I want to thank him for his efforts--not just his speech today but  his amazing efforts over the months and years.    Will my colleague stop for a brief interruption?                         Unanimous Consent Agreement    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the  motion to concur be at 8 p.m.    Thank you.   I appreciate the courtesy of my colleague. We had no choice but to do  it at 6:30.    Madam President, just for a minute, I want to first  salute the amazing speeches by our two Senators from Georgia--Georgia,  which has been the crucible in our fight for voting rights, where the  attempts to curtail voting rights seem most pernicious. To both of you,  your erudition, your eloquence, your passion were amazing.   And I want to salute our Republican colleagues who listened to the  speeches, and hope that those who weren't here will get a chance to  review those speeches as well.                         Unanimous Consent Agreement    Madam President, now, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call with respect to the pending cloture motion be waived.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.    I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be  permitted to complete their remarks prior to the scheduled vote:  Senator Blunt, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Schumer.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Missouri.    Madam Vice President, what kind of democracy shall  endure here in the United States long after our times in this Chamber  come to an end? Shall American democracy in the 21st century be called  a true heir to our Framers' vision--a nation where the people choose  their own leaders, forge their own destiny, and add to the great  legacies of those who expanded the franchise before us or shall we see  American democracy backslide in our time, grow feeble in the jaws of  its adversaries, and ultimately succumb to the cancer of voter  suppression?   The answer, in a large sense, could depend on how we move forward  this evening. As we have clearly laid out in over the past 2 days, the  laws passed in legislatures throughout the country do nothing less than  to discourage and prevent certain kinds of Americans--Black and Brown  Americans, young Americans, elderly Americans, low-income Americans-- from participating in the democratic process.   My colleagues, my colleagues, we can begin to put a stop to these  attacks tonight by voting to proceed to the final passage of the  Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  These are good bills; these are effective bills; and they should be  passed by this Chamber as soon as possible.   And if cloture is not invoked, we must change the rules of the Senate  so we can pass these bills into law. As we cast our votes, I urge every  one of us, Democrat and Republican, not to discount our place in  history. The story of American democracy is full of contradictions and  halting progress.   At the time of our Constitution's ratification, you had to be in many  States a White, male, Protestant landowner to vote. But ever since the  early days of this grand Republic, Americans launched mighty movements,  fought a bloody civil war, and, yes, passed Federal election laws to  expand the franchise until there were no more boundaries.   Today's vote is the next step in that long march. Are we going to let  our democracy backslide in the 21st century? Are we going to be dragged  back into the abyss of voter suppression?   I urge every one of my colleagues, left, right, and middle, for the  sake of our democracy, unite, take a stand today.   To every Member of this body who treasures our precious experiment in  self-rule, to every Member horrified by the muck of voter suppression,  and to everyone who believes this Chamber is still capable of defending  democracy in its hour of great need, I urge a ``yes'' vote.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion    The VICE PRESIDENT. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the  Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.   The legislative clerk read as follows:                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to       concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.       5746, a bill to amend title 51, United States Code, to extend       the authority of the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration to enter into leases of non-excess property of       the Administration.          Charles E. Schumer, Jacky Rosen, Cory A. Booker, Richard             J.

Cardin, Elizabeth Warren, Christopher             Murphy, Ben Ray Lujan.    The VICE PRESIDENT. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call  has been waived.   The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the  motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.  5746, a bill to amend title 51, United States Code, to extend the  authority of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to enter  into leases of non-excess property of the Administration, shall be  brought to a close?   The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.  [[Page S340]]    The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.

The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, the yeas are 49, the nays are 51.   Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted  in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.   The majority leader.                             Motion to Reconsider     Madam Vice President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  failed cloture vote.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion is entered.   The Senator from Connecticut.   (Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.)    Mr. President, ``a denial of this sacred right [to vote]  is a tragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our democratic  tradition''--``a tragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our  democratic tradition.''   Those were the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in his speech  where he implored the Federal Government--and especially Congress--to  take action on a simple request: ``Give us the ballot.''   Today, the American people are saying the same thing: Give us the  ballot. Let us not sink into the abyss of voter suppression. Give us  the ballot.   A few hours ago, this Chamber, with the eyes of the Nation upon it  and with the evidence of voter suppression laid bare before it, with  very little refutation from the other side--they don't discuss the  issues going on in the States--took a vote to move to final passage on  the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement  Act. It received 50 votes, and with the Vice President, we would have  had the majority. Unfortunately, under the current rules of the Senate,  the door is closed to moving forward on these laws--so much part of the  core values of our country.   But make no mistake, on voting rights, inaction is not an option.  Inaction is not an option. And now, the Senate must rise to the  occasion. The only way to achieve our goal of passing voting rights,  ending dark money, and ending partisan gerrymandering is by changing  the rules because our colleagues from the other side of the aisle don't  want to join us in these noble endeavors. This evening, we have  proposed a modest, one-time change of Senate rules to establish a  talking filibuster for this voting rights legislation. It fundamentally  says: If you want to block something as sacred as voting rights, you  must do it out in the open. You must debate it and show the American  people where you stand. You can't sit in your office and block  everything.    In short, every Senator will be allowed to speak twice on final  passage of voting rights legislation. They can speak as long as they  want--days, if they can muster it--but all other dilatory tactics, any  dilatory amendments, motions, and points of order, shall be deemed out  of order, and any appeal shall be determined without debate. After each  Member has had their say, it will be time to vote, and only 50 votes  will be required for passage.   Mr. President, this is a very simple, limited proposal, and it only  applies to the voting rights bill before us today.   Now, look, there is no denying that Members of this body have  divergent views about whether the filibuster in the 21st century is a  good thing or a bad thing. Some have argued that it actually helps  bring us together--something I don't agree with and which I have not  seen evidence of, as the eloquent statement by the Senator of Oregon  has--we have just seen. But even for those who feel that the filibuster  is a good thing and helps bring us together, I would ask this question:  Isn't protecting voting rights, the most fundamental wellspring of this  democracy, more important than a rule in this Chamber?   Let me say that again. Even if you think the filibuster is a good  thing, isn't protecting voting rights and preventing their diminution  more important, particularly when this rule was not always in existence  and was not envisioned by the Founders? That is the key question we  should each ask ourselves.   To be clear, minority rights are a vital feature of this Chamber, but  the Senate was never envisioned to allow an absolute minority party  veto--never. In fact, the Founders expressly rejected the inclusion of  a supermajority requirement for the Senate. Hamilton called the idea  ``poison.''   If there is anything undermining the spirit of the Senate today, it  is, frankly, the way things work right now. It is time for the Senate  to adapt, to meet the challenge of the modern age. Robert Byrd himself  recognized this truth,  [[Page S347]]  that Senate rules must sometimes change. And our proposal today is a  limited, carefully tailored step we can take to make the rules of the  Senate achieve this body's original purpose.   Finally, there are some who fear the consequences of passing this  bill with no support from the other party. I would certainly prefer  that Republicans work with us on this issue, and voting rights has  always been a bipartisan issue in the past. But we must be honest. We  have made many earnest efforts to draft and debate bipartisan  legislation that deals with voter suppression, dark money, and partisan  gerrymandering, but those efforts by many Members of our caucus have  come up with no takers.   The old GOP worked with Democrats on voting rights for decades, but,  unfortunately, that is not the case today. In the words of the late  Senator Wagner, whose seat I hold, delivered on this floor nearly 80  years ago:         Unity in a democracy is not achieved by side-stepping and       ignoring issues. That is false unity. That is only the       illusion of unity.        Unity in a democracy is the unity which is achieved by       facing issues, by threshing out our differences, and by       standing upon the decision of the majority.    Again:         Unity in a democracy is not achieved by side-stepping . . .       issues.    Fittingly, he spoke those words in the face of a filibuster on the  anti-poll tax legislation.   Tonight, let us sidestep voting rights no more.   The question before the Senate is, How will we find a path forward on  protecting our freedoms in this turbulent 21st century? The only choice  to move forward on these vital issues is to change the rules in the  modest way we have proposed.   My colleagues--my colleagues--history is watching us. Let us choose  in favor of our democracy. Let us stand up and defend the precious  right to vote.                  Motion to Proceed to Motion to Reconsider    Mr. President, I move to proceed to the motion to reconsider the vote  by which cloture was not invoked on the motion to concur in the House  amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote:  John R. Lewis Act.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the motion  to proceed to the motion to reconsider.                                Point of Order     Mr. President, I make a point of order that for this  message from the House, with respect to H.R. 5746, the only debate in  order during consideration of the message be on the question of  adoption of the motion to concur in the amendment of the House;  further, that no further amendments, motions, or points of order be in  order and that any appeals be determined without debate.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Following the rules of the Senate, the  point of order is not sustained as it is a compound motion that would  require consent.                      Appealing the Ruling of the Chair     Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is, Shall the ruling of the  Chair stand as the decision of the Senate?    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 10 Leg.]                                  YEAS--52       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Manchin      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sinema      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--48       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. On this vote, the yeas are 52, the nays  are 48.   The decision of the Chair stands as the judgment of the Senate.   The majority leader.                               Motion Withdrawn     Mr. President, I withdraw the motion to proceed to the  motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion is withdrawn.    Now, for the information of the Senate, there will be no  further rollcall votes tonight. Senators should expect a rollcall vote  at noon tomorrow on the confirmation of Holly Thomas to be the U.S.  circuit judge for the Ninth Circuit.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I close the Senate and do that  kind of paperwork, I want to just make a few remarks about tonight's  vote.   So while tonight's vote was disappointing, it will not deter Senate  Democrats from continuing our fight against voter suppression, dark  money, and partisan gerrymandering.   With no support from Senate Republicans, many of whom deny the very  existence of voter suppression, we faced an uphill battle, but because  of this fight, and the fact that each Senator had to show where they  stand, we are closer to achieving our goal of passing vital voter  protection legislation.   We take inspiration from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He kept fighting  for voting rights through every obstacle, and we will do the same. We  will not quit.   Now that every Senator has gone on record, the American people have  seen who is on the side of protecting voting rights, and it will only  strengthen our resolve as we work to ensure that our democracy does not  backslide.   This vote is another step forward in the long march for universal  voting rights. The Democratic caucus pledges to keep working until  voting rights are protected for every American.                    Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 5746     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the House  message to accompany H.R. 5746 no longer be the pending business.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, as if in  executive session that the nomination of Arun Venkataraman, of the  District of Columbia, to be Assistant Secretary of Commerce and  Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service  received in the Senate on January 4, 2022, be jointly referred to the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m. on  Thursday, January 20; that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and the Senate be in a period of morning business with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, for the information of Senators, we  expect a rollcall vote on confirmation of the Thomas nomination at 12  noon.  [[Page S355]]                                ____________________     Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:51 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, January 20, 2022, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
