 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of  June as National Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness Month.   Millions of our Nation's heroes experience post-traumatic stress upon  returning home from their service. Invisible wounds like PTS are just  as important and worthy of treatment as physical injuries. Seeking help  for PTS is not a sign of weakness or defeat, but a show of strength and  commitment to a full and healthy life.   Treating PTS is not a one-size-fits-all process either. Our veterans  need options to find the treatments that work best for their unique  needs. That is why I am proud my legislation, the COVER Act, has been  signed into law and will help increase access to evidence-based  alternative therapies at the VA.   For National PTS Awareness Month, I stand committed to serving our  Nation's heroes and improving their treatment options.                            ____________________
