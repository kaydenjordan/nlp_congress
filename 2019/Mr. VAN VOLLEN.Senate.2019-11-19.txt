 Madam President, last week, I voted against Steven  Menashi's nomination to serve on the Second Circuit, to the same seat  once held by Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Throughout his  legal career, Menashi has shown himself to be hostile to women's  rights, communities of color, and LGBT Americans.   I am disappointed that my colleagues have avoided passing important  legislation and have solely focused on confirming many extremist  judges. The Senate Republican leader has refused to allow votes on a  host of important legislation, including bills to secure our elections  from foreign interference, to strengthen background checks, and to  reduce the rate of gun violence in our communities, and to provide a  path to citizenship for DACA and TPS recipients. All of these bills  deserve a vote, but they are all languishing in the Senate legislative  graveyard.   Menashi has a record of bias and while at the Department of  Education, has repeatedly supported policies that hurt students and  borrowers. Alongside Secretary DeVos, Menashi, created an illegal  scheme to deny debt relief to defrauded students, including  Marylanders. Additionally, Menashi has worked hand-in-hand with Trump  senior advisor Steven Miller to advance cruel policies that undermine  American values.   The American people deserve better from the U.S. Senate. We should  not have voted on and confirmed this nominee and instead should be  working on legislation to improve the lives and ensure the safety of  our constituents.                            ____________________
