 Madam Speaker, John R. Lewis honored us with his  presence on this floor for over 3 decades. That a man of such courage  and such accomplishment would dedicate so much of his life to this  House confirmed the decision of all of us to give up our private lives  and private measures and to spend our time here in the people's House.   Five years ago, I was honored to go to Terri Sewell's hometown of  Selma and on the 50th anniversary to walk with John Lewis across the  Edmund Pettus Bridge where, 50 years prior to that time, John Lewis had  been beaten down and his skull fractured. We walked forward across that  bridge with John Lewis, and with the President of the United States,  President Barack Obama, to prove that America walks forward, and that  the progress that we have made cannot be turned back.   Years later, many of us joined John on this floor to make some good  trouble when we took over the floor of this House to demand a vote on  commonsense gun control.   President Barack Obama, when he awarded John the Presidential Medal  of Freedom, said: ``Generations from now, when parents teach their  children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to  mind; an American who knew that change will not wait for some other  person or some other time, whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency  of now.''   And that is why I say now is the time to pass what should be called  the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. John Lewis was too great a man for  us to fail to provide a substantive memorial.
