 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding and for his leadership, and I thank the gentlewoman from  California for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise with great enthusiasm to support this outstanding  legislation which is H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship Act of  2020.   Mr. Speaker, 250,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Today 720,000  Americans applied for unemployment insurance, and here we are today  recognizing the pain that America is experiencing, but more importantly  giving an opportunity for young Americans and others to be part of a  major apprenticeship program which invests more than $3.5 billion over  5 years in expanding opportunities and access to registered  apprenticeship, youth apprenticeship, and preapprenticeship.   I am glad to be an American. I am glad to be a union supporter, and  one of the reasons is that I look over the landscape of my mother's  work and my father's work, and I saw lives improve as unions gathered  together to ensure that Americans could have a decent living, support  their family, and provide opportunities for their children.   Here we are today investing $3.5 billion, but the return will be  $10.6 billion in net benefits to the United States taxpayers. I believe  that that is a real darn good return.   This legislation could not be more timely because of the record  unemployment and because of the pain America is experiencing. This  legislation also creates an additional 1 million new apprenticeship  opportunities.   Let me tell you what I did before I flew up here to Washington. I  visited Lone Star College--it hadn't opened yet--at the Fallbrook  campus. But they understood what apprenticeship is all about. They have  a logistics apprenticeship that is going to be part of their  educational system. That will give people the opportunity in this whole  new business of online selling and buying. Yes, it is innovative.   HCC apprenticeship program, Houston Community College, has electrical  contractors, plumbers, masonry, ironworkers, asbestos workers,  glaziers, painters, and stationary engineers. Let me tell you the real  picture that we see of this issue of helping with apprenticeship, Mr.  Speaker. These are the faces from all over our city.   And guess what?   According to the Houston Chronicle: ``Interested in a new career?  Consider an apprenticeship. Union-sponsored programs build skills,  careers.''   Mr. Speaker, I include that article in the Record.                        [From the Houston Chronicle]  Interested in a New Career? Consider an Apprenticeship Union-Sponsored                      Programs Build Skills, Careers.         Houston Community College is restoring an old high school       and converting it into college classrooms. And it's using       some of its own apprentices to do it.        San Jacinto Senior High was built in 1960, and the       community college is gutting it for new academic classrooms.       The project started about a year ago, and is scheduled to be       completed in October.        The eight apprentices--six plumbers and two pipe fitters--      are among the thousands of student workers in Houston who       spend their days doing construction and their nights hitting       the books. Houston's 11 union-sponsored programs, including       the plumbers and the pipe fitters, last for five years; other       programs, such as ironworkers and glaziers, last three years.        But once the newly minted journeymen and women graduate,       they should have great skills and--if the economy       cooperates--a great career path.        Chuck Fell, president of CFI Mechanical, which is       installing the plumbing, heating and air conditioning in the       new community college building, gave the group of apprentices       a pep talk last week at the job site.        ``You are learning skills,'' Fell said to the plumbers and       pipe fitters who are spending their days assembling and       installing the massive piping systems and four hours a night,       two nights a week in school learning their craft.        Those skills can take you a long way, whether you opt to       stay working in the craft or move up to foreman,       superintendent or project manager, said Fell, who attributed       his own success and that of nearly all of his project       managers to their own apprenticeship training.        ``You could be an owner of a company,'' said Fell, who       became a plumber/pipe fitter apprentice in Orlando, Fla.,       after graduating from college with a degree in architecture.  [[Page H5974]]         He went to work for a mechanical contractor who suggested       that to really learn the business, Fell needed to become an       apprentice.        As part of that training, Fell spent two years at Walt       Disney World's Epcot Center installing the mechanical and       plumbing systems.        ``Set your sights high,'' Doug Posey, director of       apprenticeship programs for Houston Community College, told       the apprentices. ``The opportunities are just incredible to       excel and to do great things.''        Posey recalled how he put himself through college as a pipe       fitter apprentice. He started his apprenticeship immediately       after high school and eventually ended up with a degree in       mechanical engineering from the University of Houston.        While the concept of apprenticing yourself to a master       craftsman and learning a trade is centuries old, it's not       exactly a well-known career path today. But two apprentices       who are working on the CFI Mechanical project are glad they       discovered the old-fashioned way to learn a skill.        Jaime Moncivais, a third-year apprentice, said he would       never have heard about the program if it hadn't been for his       cousin and his uncle, who are foremen at the job site. He was       working for a small company for two years before he left to       join the program.        Moncivais is 23 and earns about $43,000 a year, plus health       insurance and retirement benefits, by working full time       during the day. After work two nights a week, he attends       class for four hours. That costs him $88 a semester.        ``I'm enjoying it,'' said Moncivais, who says he's going to       get his state plumbing license before he decides what's next.        So does his fellow apprentice Rudy Flores, who said he was       drawn by the money. He estimates he earns about $50,000 a       year.        Flores, a fifth-year apprentice who has already received       his state plumbing license, found out about the       apprenticeship training program while working for a plumber       in Houston who was also a former apprentice.        He said he appreciates the intensive training of the       program that sets him and the other apprentices apart.        ``We like to see institutions put their money where their       mouth is,'' said Richard Shaw, secretary-treasurer of the       Harris County AFL-CIO. ``It sends a message that you ought to       be training our students.''        Shaw has been critical of school districts and other       community colleges for not hiring their own graduates when       the schools need construction work.        Funding for the apprenticeship programs comes in part from       the state of Texas. But the bulk of the money comes from       contractors and union members.        For example, members of the plumbers union as well as       plumbing contractors each contribute 55 cents per work hour       for the training program.        HCC is the fiscal administrator of the union programs as       well as the two nonunion programs that train building       engineers and electrical workers.        Calvin Speight, business manager of Plumbers Local Union       No. 68, said he has 60 apprentices starting in the fall and       another 30 the following semester.        In the meantime, they're working as ``provisionals'' to see       if they like the job. Apprentices must be 18 years of age and       either have graduated from high school or have a general-      equivalency degree.    Madam Speaker, one of the major leaders in the fight  against COVID-19, Dr. Osterholm, said a few days ago that, if we  continue on this same path, there will be 1,400 persons a day that may  die of COVID-19.   This is a season that we gather together as family members and, as  well, a season of joy. But I believe it is important for those of us  who hold the reins of government, as we have been doing in this  Congress under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi: One, to fight without  ceasing to pass the Heroes Act legislation for dollars for our local  cities and counties and States, for testing, for PPEs, and, of course,  our businesses and restaurants.   Before I left Houston this week, I did a press conference to call  upon my local authorities to issue a public safety alert. It was done  in California, and out of that came 30,000 people to be tested. This  weekend, I am calling for a citywide challenge for people to be tested  before Thanksgiving.   I ask my colleagues to join me at the testing sites that are  available because we must save lives. Wash your hands, where a mask,  socially distance; but, on Thanksgiving, ensure that you are outside  and in groups of less than 10 people.   Houston, do the testing regimen. Join us at the Allen Parkway  Village. Get tested and save lives and stop community spread.                            ____________________
