 Mr. President, I am pleased to follow the Senator  from Minnesota, as because of him I had the chance to be on the HELP  Committee during all of those hearings--all of those dozens and dozens  of Republican amendments that took place during the vibrant, robust,  bipartisan process in the HELP Committee. Senator Franken was still in  litigation over his election so his seat on the HELP Committee was  vacant, and Harry Reid asked if I would take that seat. My senior  Senator Jack Reed and I, both of Rhode Island, were there in the room  day after day, week after week, while this exhaustive, public,  bipartisan process went forward.   I can even remember working with Senator Isakson, of Georgia, and  supporting his amendment that would allow a doctor to be paid for  having a conversation with a very ill patient about what his desires  were if his condition did not get better. What type of end-of-life care  did he want? Did he want every possible intervention or did he want  dignified time at home with his family? What were his desires? That is  a conversation that is important for doctors to have with those  patients.   In the environment of the time, that became the death panel phony  story. So I was there. I saw it happen. Thanks to Senator Franken's  delay in getting here, Jack Reed and I were in the room.   Why does this matter? This matters because, like the story of Leanna  and Henry, there are people on the other side of what is--apparently,  for our Republican colleagues--a purely political piece of  parliamentary chicanery.   I have a constituent, a woman named Pamela, who lives in Jamestown,  RI. She works with people and nonprofit organizations that advocate for  people who have very rare diseases so, in her work, she has seen the  before and after of the Affordable Care Act.   ``Before the Affordable Care Act,'' she wrote to me, ``I saw many  patients and families distraught by medical bankruptcy.''   Then it came even closer to home for Pamela when she was diagnosed  with stage IV breast cancer. If there were an annual or a lifetime  limit on health benefits, she would be in deep trouble. If the  protection for people with preexisting conditions were undone, that  would imperil her ability to get insurance in the future.   She wrote to me:         As a patient myself, with a chronic, costly medical       condition, I am very worried that [these] protections will be       taken away, making my life-sustaining care unaffordable.    Pamela deserves to be heard, but nobody can speak up for her with a  bill that nobody can see.   From Cumberland, Marilyn wrote to me. Marilyn is a family physician.  She knows the healthcare system. She also has severe asthma. She has  had asthma since she was a little child, and she manages her severe  asthma with very expensive medication. Her husband is retired, and  Marilyn purchased her health insurance through HealthSource RI--our  ObamaCare health insurance marketplace--which, by the way, is working  very well. There is no need to undo what is going on in Rhode Island.  It gives her peace of mind, and she wrote to me to say she was  terrified by the possibility that the preexisting condition clause will  be allowed back in.   She wrote:         I am not a specialist but a family medicine physician,       doing the best I can to pay my student loans and daily       expenses. I could not afford the lifesaving treatment I       require to function. . . . I do not know how I would survive       financially if the current legislation the House has approved       is allowed to become law.    Gina wrote to me from Lincoln, RI. Gina's daughter, Sofia, is 6.  Sofia has cerebral palsy. We think we have problems here. I tell you,  whatever the political problems we have over the Affordable Care Act,  have a 6-year-old with cerebral palsy, and then come back and tell me  you have a problem not liking ObamaCare.   Sofia needs round-the-clock care and she gets it because of Medicaid.  Gina wrote to me: ``From her home nursing care to her wheelchair, we  could not live without [Medicaid].''   Before Sofia came along, Gina and her husband never imagined they  would need Medicaid; it never crossed their minds. But now, the welfare  of their little daughter is entirely dependent on Medicaid. Depending  on what we do here, Gina wrote:         Will there even be a Medicaid then? This administration is       stripping benefits from the most vulnerable in our society.       How will they survive?    The last story I will share is from Tony and his family, who live in  North Kingstown, RI. Tony has a son whose name is Michael. Michael,  right after he was born, was diagnosed with something called  mitochondrial disorder. It is a severely, catastrophically debilitating  illness. It left Michael severely disabled. Michael is 10 years old  now, but developmentally he is more like a 3-month-old. He can't walk,  he can't talk, he can't feed himself, but he is happy, and he is sweet,  and he is a source of joy for his parents and his four siblings.   Through Medicaid, Michael can receive up to 30 hours per week of care  from a certified nursing assistant. It is  [[Page S3598]]  this program--it is Medicaid--supporting the certified nursing  assistant those 30 hours per week that lets Michael live at home with  his parents and those four siblings. Otherwise, he would have to be  institutionalized. Somebody explain to me why a political victory  shoved through this body after secret proceedings is worth explaining  to Michael's parents that he is at risk of losing that coverage.   When President Trump said that the House bill was mean, he was not  kidding around. It is mean, mean, mean--dirty, rotten mean. And if you  think the one on the Senate side is going to be any better, there is  one little phrase I would like to bring to your attention: ``We're not  stupid.''   ``We're not stupid'' is what a Republican staffer said when he was  asked, Why aren't you guys having a public process? Why are you trying  to jam this through in secret? His answer: ``We're not stupid.''   Well, what can you logically deduce from that? What kind of bill  would be stupid to show the American public? If this was a bill that  was going to be greeted with great applause and joy and relief and  satisfaction by the American public, would you hide it? No. If it were  terrible, if it would threaten people all across this country, then you  wouldn't want them to see it. That would be stupid.   So that is what they are up to. They know perfectly well that this  bill is not good for America. That is why showing it to the American  people would be, by their own words, stupid.   Let me switch to my geek point before I go, because this is something  I talk about a lot, and it bothers the heck out of me. This is a graph  that shows healthcare in most of the countries that compete with us-- the OECD nations.   This chart shows life expectancy in years. At the bottom is 72, at  the top is 86, so where you fall in this shows where your life  expectancy is in the different countries, and life expectancy is a  pretty good measure of how good the healthcare system is.   Here is the cost of healthcare per capita, averaged across the  population. And as you will notice, most everybody is right up in  here--Japan, Switzerland, Netherlands, United Kingdom. Most of our  competitors, including France and Germany--they are up in here. Where  are we? Out here. The most expensive other country in the world is  Switzerland, which doesn't break $6,000 per person; we are over $8,000.  The average in here, where Japan comes in, above where the United  Kingdom comes in, is $4,000 per person; we are above $8,000. We are 100  percent more expensive than the average and more than 50 percent more  expensive than the least efficient other country in the world.   So there is progress to be made at bringing costs down, if we would  pay attention to this real problem instead of the imaginary problem of  Americans having too much healthcare.   And over here--look at the life expectancy in years. Look where we  come in. We match the Czech Republic. So there is progress to be made  on cost and on outcomes in this country. And, believe it or not, we are  actually starting to make a little progress. Let me take my colleagues  through this graph, and then I will leave you be.   This top line was drawn by the Congressional Budget Office back in  2010. They project forward into the future where they think healthcare  costs are going to go. These are all Federal healthcare costs; the  whole Federal healthcare costs, all of them piled up--Medicare,  Medicaid, veterans--all of it. So here is what they projected it would  be, this top line, in 2010. Then, they got to 2016, and they did  another projection because they realized that as of 2014, things were  coming in below their expectations. After the Affordable Care Act,  things started to change. So they did another projection in 2016, and  they projected this line right here.   Those of us who serve on the Budget Committee know that we think in  10-year increments. So here is a 10-year increment from 2017 to 2027.  And if you look just at the difference between what CBO predicted in  2010, before the Affordable Care Act, and what they predicted in 2016,  after the Affordable Care Act: $3.3 trillion in savings--$3.3 trillion  in savings. Think of what a difference that makes for our country if  you can save $3.3 trillion in our healthcare costs.   Healthcare costs are what is driving most of our debt and our  deficit, so $3.3 trillion in savings? I tell you what, I want to see  this bill because I want to know what CBO thinks about what happens to  that $3.3 trillion in savings. If the cost of this Republican  parliamentary chicanery is going to be losing $3.3 trillion in savings,  the American people ought to know about that.    So I call on my Republican colleagues to have a process. I don't know  if the Presiding Officer has seen the bill yet. It is so close hold, I  don't think all of the Republicans have even seen it. But for gosh  sake, when you have these stories from Rhode Island and from all the  other States around the country, when you have real fellow Americans  counting on the healthcare that the Affordable Care Act made possible,  the idea that you throw that out to score political points and to give  super rich people a tax break is disgraceful. It is a disgrace.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.
