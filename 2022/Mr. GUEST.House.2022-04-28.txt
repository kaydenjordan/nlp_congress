 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the previous question.   Right now, the men and women of law enforcement are battling to  secure our borders. Every day they are pushing back against drug  smugglers, human traffickers, and the cartels. Make no mistake, this is  the worst border crisis in our Nation's history and this administration  took just over a year to bring our national security to this state.   I know because I have seen it myself. I was at the border a few days  ago for my second trip in two weeks and I heard from the men and women  on the border. Every single person we talked with told the same story.  They told us that this administration, President Biden's  administration, has abandoned them. They asked us to please provide  help.   Instead of providing help, President Biden and many of my colleagues  on the left have attacked the last tool the men and women of law  enforcement have to perform their duties.   Without the Court's intervention, this administration would have  stripped the last tool these law enforcement officers have to secure  our border. I am glad that some of my colleagues across the aisle have  seen the value in preserving title 42.   They have seen the importance of securing our borders against  criminals and terrorists that we know are exploiting the crisis to  enter America. They see the devastating impact that 18,000 encounters a  day would have on communities across our Nation if title 42 is removed.  Most importantly, they see the hard work of the men and women of law  enforcement on the border, and like Republicans, they want to help.   I hope the rest of the Democratic Caucus will join them and support  these men and women who are risking their lives to secure our Nation.
