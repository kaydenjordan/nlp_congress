 Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege today of honoring Jack  Holder, who passed away on February 24, 2023, at the age of 101.   Jack was a constituent and a U.S. Navy veteran of the attack on Pearl  Harbor, the Battle of Midway, Guadalcanal, and dozens upon dozens of  missions in support of the Allied Forces during World War II.   Born Joseph Norman Holder on December 13, 1921, Jack was raised in a  farming family in Gunter, Texas. Jack's father served in the trenches  of World War I, and his uncle flew crop dusters over the family farm.   With that heritage, it was only natural that combat aviation was a  fit for Jack when he joined the U.S. Navy on April 24, 1940, at 18  years old.   Jack attended boot camp and trained as an aviation machinist and  mechanic in San Diego. He was then assigned to a flying boat squadron  based on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.   Jack recalled how, soon after he lined up for roll call that fateful  Sunday morning, the first bomb was dropped on Pearl Harbor only about  100 yards from him.   He wrote how he heard ``the screaming aircraft with the rising sun  insignia and loud explosions,'' and how, ``as I looked up, I saw a  plane circle and head straight for us, so we jumped in a nearby  ditch.''   Jack never forgot that moment, seeing the face of the pilot, hearing  the roar of the plane's engine, and the sight of his guns aimed right  at him. Nor did he ever forget the prayer he offered: ``God, don't let  me die in this ditch.''   Thankfully, Jack was spared, and that ditch would become a makeshift  machine gun nest that he would man for the next 3 days.   After the attack at Pearl Harbor, Jack flew missions in support of  Hawaii and Midway. At Midway, Jack's aircraft was the second to spot  the Japanese fleet, but his was the first to transmit the fleet's  position clearly to the USS Yorktown.   Jack's crew would later fly 48 missions in support of the Solomon  Islands campaign, including at Guadalcanal. Jack then transitioned to a  Navy variant of the B-24, performing in 56 anti-sub patrols in the  English Channel and assisting in sinking a German submarine.   In total, Jack flew over 100 missions and was one of the select few  who flew combat missions in both the European and Pacific theaters.   For his brave service, he was twice awarded the Distinguished Flying  Cross and received six Air Medals, a Presidential citation, and six  commendation medals. Jack was honorably discharged in 1948 and would go  on to become a pilot and an aviation engineer.   My office honored Jack several years ago at my Salute to Veterans  event celebrating Veterans Day. I have heard over the years from  constituents and veterans who attended the event that the retelling of  Jack's courageous acts during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor  formed a lasting impression that will remain in their hearts and minds  forever.   Jack, you were more than a constituent. You were a hero, a patriot,  and a good friend. You gave so much to preserve this Nation in the face  of tyranny. Your love for these United States, our Constitution, and  our freedom were an inspiration to so many, and I pray that future  generations will appreciate and follow your example.   Fair winds and following seas, my friend. You will never be  forgotten.                            ____________________
