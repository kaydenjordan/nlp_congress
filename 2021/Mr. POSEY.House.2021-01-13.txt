 In our campaigns, we may be adversaries, but usually,  after campaign season is over, we have traditionally come together for  the good of our Nation.   Now more than ever in our lifetimes, we are a divided Nation. One of  the reasons? The resist movement, which has harassed, harangued, and  otherwise denigrated the President since the second he became the  nominee.   While his sins may be different than yours or mine, they are clearly  not treasonous. Let our men and women in blue, who suffered a lot more  stress than the Members of Congress they protected, have the time they  deserve to recuperate, and do the same for millions of Americans who  feel they have been disenfranchised.   I beseech my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: If you truly want  our Nation to heal, vote ``no'' on this resolution.   It reeks of nothing more than revenge and sets a dangerous precedent.  May God continue to bless the United States of America.
