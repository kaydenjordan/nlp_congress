 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California  for yielding.   It is certainly my pleasure to be on the side of the gentlewoman from  California. Every time we have got in these fights to attack Dodd- Frank, she has been on the right side of the issue.   So let me clearly, though my voice is a little raspy, speak on behalf  of those, as my colleagues have spoken about, of us who certainly have  a degree of education and receive those long statements where there are  big fights and the print is so small.   I will tell you that the proxy advisers are representing not us, but  those vulnerable pensioners who put everything they have ever had in  that pot, and those advisers give those public pension funds the  counsel and advice that is necessary.   First of all, this bill is entirely impractical. Pension plans and  other institutional investors often hold shares in thousands of public  companies. The bill will require proxy advisory firms, who provide  voting recommendations to these shareholders, to provide the management  with more than 4,000 public companies with the opportunity to present  detailed comments on the firm's draft recommendations before paying  shareholders receive a final report.    It also wants to burden them with all kinds of extra trinkets that  they have to give information about, an unprecedented right to weigh in  by the corporations on voting recommendations, executive compensation,  nondiscrimination policies. Again, the proxy advisers work with the  public pension funds.   Who are they?   They are the coal miners and the bus drivers. They are, in fact,  those teachers, firemen, and policemen. They are Americans who depend  upon their pensions.   Mr. Speaker, the reason that I wanted to stand on this floor today  is, just a few minutes ago, we again voted for this catastrophic tax  bill. I wanted to tie this to, as I heard my good friend from Texas,  jumping up and celebrating. I assume they will run to the White House  when this bill is passed in one way or the other.  [[Page H10324]]    Let me describe to you what I believe is the scenario on the tax  bill. We all like cliffhanger movies. Cliffhanger movies always get the  family together to be able to tell the story or to sit in the movie and  look at the cliffhanger because it is always the heroes that win on a  cliffhanger. You are waiting for the hero to launch down and save  everyone.   Here is the Republican cliffhanger: it is this tax bill, and the  cliffhanger is you are going up a mountain. As you go up the mountain,  here are the Republicans and this tax bill that is going to take away  millions of dollars from Medicaid.    They are throwing over the cliff the Medicaid  recipients, people with dementia. My good friend who has ALS, who is in  a wheelchair, thrown over the cliff. They are throwing over teachers.  They are throwing over individuals who are believing them that they are  going to get jobs, but they are getting no jobs. They are throwing over  families, working class families, 86 million of them--throwing them  over the cliff.   It is not a good ending. It is a tragic ending, and they are standing  one by one by one and throwing them over this cliff with this phony tax  bill. They are not going to be able to do what is right for those who  are truly in need. The benefits for those who are working Americans is  temporary, and those of corporations is forever.    Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to celebrate the  life of a dear friend, the Honorable Peter Brown, former council member  at large for the city of Houston. Tomorrow he will be memorialized in  Houston, Texas.   It saddens me that I will not be able to join him and his family and  the many, many Houstonians and friends who will come to honor him. The  reason is because Peter Brown was Houston's chief champion. He loved  Houston. He loved to talk about mobility in Houston. Even before most  Houstonians understood the value of the light rail system, Peter Brown  was on the forefront.   He was an architect, and he understood beauty and planning. He had a  humorous and wonderful touch, but he also was serious and stern when it  came to planning and the environment. Peter Brown wanted to see Houston  as it is and as it continues to be a world class city. Before we spoke  of greenery and all the things that make a city great, the parks, green  space, Peter Brown was doing so.   Peter Brown was also a dear friend to me, my family, and so many  others. He lost his battle just about 10 days ago to a terrible and  vicious disease. But as I visited Peter, I can assure you that on the  occasions I went to see him, he was always thinking about others and  thinking about the city, thinking about our State and the Nation,  always sharing, but fighting his fight.   To his family and his children and to the people who love him, I just  simply want to say: tonight and tomorrow we honor a great American, a  friend to us all.   He may be from Houston, Texas, but if you got a chance to know him,  you would love him, too.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in honor of the Honorable  Peter Brown.                            ____________________
