 ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to  H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency Act.   As a farmer and as someone who has started a small business from the  ground up, I know firsthand the unnecessary burden government  regulations can place on small business owners.   Unlike large corporations, America's 5 million small businesses do  not have the manpower, time, or resources to comply with more undue  regulatory burdens.   Furthermore, it is concerning that H.R. 2513 lacks provisions that  would ensure our small business owners' privacy. Under H.R. 2513, small  business owners, after submitting their personal information, cannot  trust that it would be safe or protected. As offered, H.R. 2513 lacks  the safeguards necessary to provide our small business owners the  confidence that their personal information will be safe and protected,  once submitted.   At a minimum, if Big Government demands personal information, it must  protect that data.   In addition, H.R. 2513 is built around arbitrary thresholds. I have  yet to see a convincing explanation for why the threshold is a maximum  of 20 employees or $5 million in gross receipts.   Under this legislation, if small business owners are unable to submit  the required personal information, they may face criminal penalties of  $10,000 and 3 years in prison. That would kill any small business.   Let us not forget, small businesses are the heart and drivers of job  creation in many rural communities, as is the case for many of the  communities I proudly represent in Tennessee's Sixth District.   We cannot unleash innovation in our country when we continue to force  Big Government on America's small farmers and business owners.   The esteemed ranking member from North Carolina and I urge our fellow  Members to join us in voting against H.R. 2513, the latest rendition of  burdensome regulations and personal privacy invasions.    ROSE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    ROSE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I am speaking tonight  on behalf of the people I represent in the Sixth Congressional District  of Tennessee.   In Tennessee, I hear excitement about the leaps forward our country  has made under the leadership of our President, Donald Trump. We are  enjoying the lowest unemployment rate of my lifetime, and more  Americans are employed than at any point in this Nation's history.   In the short time that I have in this, my first elected office, I  have seen the great race in Washington that goes on daily. It is a race  to take credit for anything positive, to run away from anything  negative, and an all-out sprint away from the real problems facing our  Nation.   Well, in the race to the ridiculous, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have clearly won. A closed-door, secretive, biased, so- called inquiry is shaming this House and not doing the first positive  thing for the people back home.   Drop the political charades, Madam Speaker, and let this House go  forward.                            ____________________
