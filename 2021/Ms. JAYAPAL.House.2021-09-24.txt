 Madam Speaker, one in four women across America has had  an abortion. I am one of them.   It is a deeply personal choice about control of our own bodies and  the consequences of a choice that only we will have to live with. Do  not criminalize me and millions of women like me around the country. Do  not criminalize those that help us.   Let me be clear. The cruel Texas abortion law and decades of efforts  to repeal Roe v. Wade are nothing but attempts to control our bodies  and our choices.   Madam Speaker, terminating my pregnancy was not an easy choice for  me, but it was my choice. It is time to preserve that for all people.
