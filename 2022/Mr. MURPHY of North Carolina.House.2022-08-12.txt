 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  this reckless bill today. I want to speak specifically to one issue,  and that is medicine.   As a practicing physician, I have seen miraculous curative  advancements made in medicine over the last 15 years. This partisan  package will destroy medical innovation and cripple independent private  physicians. Up to 342 new lifesaving drugs will be prevented by this  bill.   We all agree that the cost of medicine is way too high in this  country, but instead of attacking the real causes, we are now going to  be shifting Medicare dollars away from doctors, those who actually take  care of patients, and give them to insurance companies and Green New  Deal policies.   Some physicians will see, on average, a 40 percent reduction in  reimbursement. Given the constant threats of Medicare cuts for  physicians, who the hell would want to practice medicine or could  afford to practice medicine in this country anymore?   This scheme will have long-lasting negative impacts on patients,  physicians, and the solvency of Medicare, and it will set a dangerous  precedent for future medicine to use Medicare as a piggy bank to  subsidize unrelated policies.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.  [[Page H7669]]
