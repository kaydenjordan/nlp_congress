 Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 397.

I know when we get home it is always the number one issue  that is out there. I don't think there has been enough talk about how  the inflation came about.   The inflation came about because of excessive spending. Every middle  school student should know that if the Federal Government spends wildly  more on the amount going out than the amount going in, the Federal  Reserve has to, in essence, print the dollars to make those payments,  and when the Federal Reserve prints more dollars, the value of the  dollar drops, which is why we have these huge spending increases.                                time  1900    Now, I will make a couple of comments on them.   First of all, I think the numbers that we are supposed to talk about,  the 9.1 increase in inflation, are woefully underrated. Here is the  graph that all of us politicos are supposed to talk about.   Does anybody believe that the cost of shelter in the last 12 months  has only gone up 5.6 percent? Where is the press? They ought to be  making fun of that number.   When I talk to my landlords, when I talk to my builders, nobody  thinks things have gone up only 5.6 percent in the last year. I think  the cost of a new house has gone up 20 to 25 percent. I think the cost  of rentals has gone up by 10 or 15 percent. It is way more than the 5.6  percent on this chart.   The same thing is true of automobiles. They tell us used automobiles  have gone up by about 11.4 percent in the last year. Talk to your car  dealers. They will laugh at the idea that used cars have only gone up  by 11.4 percent in the last year.   Things are much worse than the numbers that are put out there by the  Biden administration. Therefore, the American public is suffering a lot  more than even this so-called record inflation increase of 9.1. It is  much more than that.   But once we get done looking at that, let's look at the new spending  bills that are coming out. Have people learned their lesson? All of a  sudden, we are going to produce even on the relatively small part of  the budget, this discretionary spending, which is the part we vote on  around here? Are we going to do something to maybe have no increase  there or 2 or 3 percent increase there? No.   When we look at the bills, some of which we passed last week, and  they break up what I think the people at home would call the budget  into a variety of different bills, military construction and veterans  affairs, people want an 18 percent increase for the year beginning  October 1; financial services and general government, 17 percent  increase; the Department of the Interior and the environment, up 18  percent.   In other words, even after the horrific inflation, when we come back  to the regular budget, this place has the pedal to the metal, trying to  spend another huge amount.   I think the press ought to wake up and pay attention to both of these  issues. I beg the press to talk to your local car dealers, to talk to  your local landlords and see: Have we only had a 5.6 percent increase  in shelter? Have we only had a 7.1 percent increase in used cars? No  way. They are giving us numbers that are much lower than the reality.   The press ought to look at this, and rather than just sleepwalk  through these budgets that get passed around here, we ought to be  paying a little bit more attention to the sizable increases in these  budgets, line by line, or the amount of inflation we have seen so far  would be a drop in the bucket. Wake up, American press corps.
