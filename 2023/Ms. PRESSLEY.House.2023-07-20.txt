 Madam Speaker, I rise as the Representative of the  Massachusetts Seventh Congressional District, which is home to Boston  Logan Airport, critical to our economy, for travel, a job engine, and  it has created a number of quality-of-life issues for those who live in  proximity to it.   As a proud member of the Congressional Quiet Skies Caucus, I want to  talk about what these constituents are experiencing--and they write my  office daily--living proximate to one of the Nation's busiest airports:  Loud air traffic starting in the early morning hours and lasting until  midnight, adverse health effects exacerbated by interrupted sleep,  aircraft noise, air pollution. It is all taking a toll.   That is why I support provisions in the FAA bill that invest in noise  abatement, clean energy, and, most importantly, community input. It is  through cooperative governance and listening to impacted communities,  who are often the most underserved and overlooked, that we can advance  policies that are responsive to their needs, the needs of my  constituents in Charlestown, East Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville.   I am proud to have secured more than $80 million for Boston Logan  Airport, and I will work to ensure this bill and those funds move us  closer to quiet skies in the Massachusetts Seventh.                            ____________________
