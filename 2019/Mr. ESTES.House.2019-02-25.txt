 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse).   You know, those numbers are just shocking, as you related, in terms  of how it would devastate the American economy and American families.   Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to add my voice in opposition to this so- called Green New Deal.   You know, this outrageous proposal would be a massive government  takeover of every facet of our daily lives. From how we eat, to how we  travel, this so-called Green New Deal calls to replace every building  and car in America within 10 years. It would cost up to $93 trillion.  That would cost every American household an extra $65,300 per year.   That might be crumbs in New York and California, but it is not in  Kansas, where the average family income is $56,422.   If the crushing tax increase on every family isn't bad enough, the  plan also calls for an eventual end to air travel.   As representative of the Air Capital of the World, clearly, this is  alarming.   According to the Kansas Department of Transportation, aviation is  responsible for 91,300 jobs in Kansas and has an economic impact on our  state of $20.6 billion.   Grounding air travel would decimate jobs in Kansas, just as the  entire Green New Deal would devastate the economy of our country.   The only thing this proposal accomplishes is exposing the priorities  of politicians who are determined to increase taxes and expand  government to impose their agenda on every family, farm, and business.   Kansans know how to protect our environment and quality of life  without being told to do so by government officials in Washington,  D.C., and I stand with them in opposing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Newhouse for leading this special  order.
