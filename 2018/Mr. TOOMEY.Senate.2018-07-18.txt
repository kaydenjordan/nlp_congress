 Mr. President, I want to reflect on some of the data that  has been coming in on our economy in response to our tax reform and  deregulatory push.   Before I do, I want to commend my colleague from Missouri and thank  him for his leadership and work on the incredible crisis of opioids we  are dealing with. It is not a uniformly national crisis; it is more  concentrated regionally, and my State of Pennsylvania is affected as  badly as any place in the country.   I am pleased we have been able to take a number of constructive  measures, but we have a lot of work yet to do as we try to deal with  this scourge. I want to thank him for that.
