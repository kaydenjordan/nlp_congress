 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Bruce Burnham, a  retired member of the military police who served in the Vietnam war and  was awarded the Bronze Star.   After retiring from the military, Mr. Burnham began teaching at  Armwood High School, where he taught history, social studies, and  classes on the Vietnam war for 30 years.   Known affectionately as the mayor of Armwood, Mr. Burnham continues  to dedicate his retirement to the students. He serves as the announcer  for the Armwood varsity football team and continues to give speeches to  high school students on the Vietnam war.   Mr. Burnham was placed on the front lines of history, and he has  spent the last 30 years retelling that history to his students.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Burnham clearly has the love of our community. He  also has the respect of our country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962, the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which is necessary to  save the innocent lives of innocent children, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request can't be  entertained, I urge the Speaker to--    Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I was one of 169 House  Members who signed a letter to President Trump urging him to reject any  appropriations legislation that would undermine pro-life protections.  The President agreed. He agreed that long-standing pro-life provisions  should be retained and has promised to veto any bill that weakens those  pro-life protections.   Unfortunately, the legislation before us not only strips pro-life  provisions, but it includes language that, in fact, undermines efforts  to promote life. In this bill, Democrats included provisions that would  prevent the Trump administration from implementing its Title X and  conscience protection rules to protect life.   The Title X Family Planning rule ensures that Federal funds do not go  to facilities that perform or promote abortion as family planning. For  more than 40 years, this country has operated under the policy that not  one cent of taxpayer money can be used to fund abortion.   We are a Nation that deeply values religious liberty, and this rule  further protects Americans' tax dollars from being forced to subsidize  entities that kill unborn children.   Accordingly, I am fully supportive of Representative Roby's  amendment, that we will debate this afternoon, to strike the language  that would halt this important rule and the other amendments that will  restore pro-life policies to this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support these  provisions.
