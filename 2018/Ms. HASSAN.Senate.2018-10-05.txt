 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in  expressing my opposition to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. I will speak  later in the evening about my overall assessment of Judge Kavanaugh's  record and nomination and about why I think some of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle are focusing on the wrong thing in deciding  to support him.   To echo my colleague from Michigan just now, no one has a right to a  seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. What we should be focused on is that  the country has a right to an impartial, nonpartisan U.S. Supreme  Court. They have a right to Justices whose character and fitness for  the office is beyond reproach and beyond doubt. Despite everything I  have heard from Judge Kavanaugh's supporters, I do not think they can  make that case.  [[Page S6591]]    My purpose in speaking right now is to express my deep concerns with  Judge Kavanaugh's record of ruling against access to healthcare.   If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh will be a deciding factor in the lives  and livelihoods of millions of Americans. Yet, time and again, he has  demonstrated a commitment to a partisan agenda that would strip away  care from some of our most vulnerable people.   As recently as 2017, Judge Kavanaugh criticized Chief Justice  Roberts' decision upholding the Affordable Care Act, and in his  confirmation hearing, Judge Kavanaugh would not commit to upholding  legal protections for people with preexisting conditions--preexisting  conditions such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, and more.   Confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court would put those  protections at risk. I have heard from people across New Hampshire who  are concerned about what will happen to them if they are denied  coverage because of their preexisting condition. People like Kristen  from Derry, NH. Kristen relies on medications that cost more than  $1,200 every month to stay healthy, but if she lost her insurance  because of her preexisting condition, she would not be able to afford  that medication. Kristen said:         I wouldn't be able to breathe correctly. My COPD would       worsen. My current standard of living--working full time as a       social worker, a runner, active with my children--would       quickly come to an end.    That is what is at stake with this vote.   Republican attorneys general, backed by the Trump administration, are  suing to eliminate protections for preexisting conditions. This case  will soon be in front of the Supreme Court, and the next Supreme Court  Justice could very well be the deciding vote in that decision.   We need a Justice who would rise above partisanship, someone who will  act impartially and rule on behalf of what is right for the American  people. It is evident Judge Kavanaugh is not that person, and there is  no reason to believe he would be an impartial arbiter when it comes to  issues related to healthcare.   Throughout this confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has revealed  himself to be staunchly partisan, and never was that more clear than  during his hearing on the allegations raised by Dr. Christine Blasey  Ford.   During that hearing, he called those credible allegations against him  ``revenge on behalf of the Clintons'' and seemed to threaten his  political enemies by saying: ``What goes around comes around.''   There is ample reason to believe that Judge Kavanaugh would be an  ally on the Supreme Court for the Trump administration and Republicans  in Congress who are seeking to undermine our healthcare system, and for  the health and well-being of Granite Staters and all Americans, I  cannot support his nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Duckworth and  Senator King and so many of my colleagues in opposing Judge Brett  Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.   One of the most solemn responsibilities of a U.S. Senator is  providing advice and consent upon the President's nominating an  individual to the Supreme Court. This is a duty and a decision that I  do not take lightly. This is a lifetime appointment to the highest  Court in our land, which will impact the lives of every single person  in this country.   Supreme Court Justice is not a position that any person is entitled  to. Any individual nominated to the Court must be subject to security  on the totality of their record, their temperament, and their past  actions.   Yet, throughout the process of this nomination, my colleagues in the  majority have made clear that they will stop at nothing to get Judge  Kavanaugh on the Court, no matter his record, no matter his  temperament, no matter his character.   When Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's serious and credible allegations  came to light, we saw a truly disturbing scene from both Judge  Kavanaugh and my colleagues on the other side of this aisle. Judge  Kavanaugh himself lashed out, claiming a political conspiracy against  him, refusing to answer questions, and seemingly threatening those who  raised serious, good-faith questions about his fitness. He said these  words: ``What goes around, comes around.'' His behavior and his words  reflected a partisan who sees those with whom he differs as enemies,  not opponents.   While many of my colleagues in the majority praise Dr. Ford's bravery  in sharing her story, and even agreed that her testimony was credible,  they blocked any serious professional attempt to get to the facts.   I want to take a minute here to address one of the most disingenuous  claims I have heard from the majority when it talks about Dr. Blasey  Ford.   Over the last week, Members on the other side of the aisle have  expressed concern and regret that Dr. Blasey Ford's letter outlining  her allegations was leaked, forcing her story into public view. But the  fact that Dr. Blasey Ford didn't choose if and when to reveal her  allegation to the public does not relieve the U.S. Senate of its duty  to pursue the truth or to treat Dr. Blasey Ford with the respect and  compassion the majority says it feels for her, something it could  simply demonstrate by acceding to her request for what normally happens  after a report of sexual assault: a full investigation before the  hearing.   I, too, will note that I watched and listened to Dr. Blasey Ford's  testimony. I considered the additional evidence that would have  particular weight in a court of law of her corroborating statements  well prior to any suggestion that Brett Kavanaugh would ever be  nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States. I compared her  testimony to that of Judge Kavanaugh, and I believe Dr. Blasey Ford.   Even though the committee rejected the doctor's request for an  investigation prior to the hearing, which would have been normal  course, which would have produced a much more meaningful and insightful  and fact-based hearing, I was hopeful when it was announced last week  that the nomination process would be paused for the FBI to investigate  Dr. Blasey Ford's allegations. I was so hopeful that there would be a  thorough, intensive process in order to get to the truth.   But after reading the FBI report that was presented to Senators, it  is clear that the FBI was not allowed to conduct a serious  investigation.   I am an attorney, and I have to say that any good attorney allowed to  read the FBI's supplemental background investigation--what we have been  calling the report here--would tell you that it is not the type of  comprehensive investigation that could lead to the truth. The limited  scope of the investigation produced a sham.   Let me be clear. Nothing in the FBI report exonerated Judge  Kavanaugh. It wasn't comprehensive enough to prove or disprove Dr.  Blasey Ford's allegations or Judge Kavanaugh's denials. It was clearly  designed just to provide cover so that the majority could vote yes and  jam this nomination through.   Even before Dr. Ford bravely stepped forward with her allegations of  sexual assault, I had concluded that Judge Kavanaugh's nomination  should not go forward, that Judge Kavanaugh did not belong on the  Supreme Court of the United States.   Having reviewed his record and hearing his testimony before the  Senate Judiciary Committee, it is evident that he does not have the  impartiality that is required to serve on the Supreme Court. His record  shows that he is a partisan who promotes a partisan rightwing ideology  deeply at odds with the will of the American people.   On issue after issue, Judge Kavanaugh has promoted a judicial  philosophy that diminishes the rights of individuals, particularly  women, and puts corporations before people.   On healthcare, Judge Kavanaugh's agenda has been clear. As recently  as October 2017, Judge Kavanaugh criticized Chief Justice Roberts'  decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. In his confirmation  hearing, Judge Kavanaugh would not commit to upholding protections for  people who have preexisting conditions, such as asthma, cancer,  diabetes, and more.   The Trump administration and the majority in Congress have been  relentless in their attempts to sabotage our healthcare system,  underscoring the need to have a Supreme Court that would rise above  partisanship, but Judge Kavanaugh will not do that.   On the issue of reproductive rights and a woman's right to chart her  own destiny, Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly tried to dodge and mislead,  but none of his judicial opinions or comments indicate that he believes  Roe v. Wade was rightly decided or that he would respect Roe's  precedent if he had the opportunity to do so.   With Judge Kavanaugh on the Bench, Roe and the personal, economic,  and reproductive freedom that it has delivered to women is directly  threatened.   When it comes to checks and balances on the President's power, Judge  Kavanaugh's record and opinions are also extremely concerning,  particularly given that a clear pattern of criminality continues to  emerge from the Mueller investigation.   Judge Kavanaugh has a history of supporting an unchecked Presidency.  He has written that Presidents should be essentially above the law by  claiming that they should not be the subject of civil lawsuits,  criminal prosecutions, or even criminal investigations.   During his hearing, Judge Kavanaugh refused to commit to recusing  himself from matters involving investigations of the very President who  nominated him. Especially at a time like this, it is too dangerous to  place a Justice on the Supreme Court who believes in virtually no  checks on a President's power, but it appears that the majority is  committed to doing just that.   This nomination has been an outrage, and the way it has been handled  is a failure of this institution. The majority has put the interests of  its party and a nominee who has made clear he will serve those  interests before the interests of the court and the country.  [[Page S6619]]  The nominee, who will apparently--given today's developments--be  confirmed tomorrow, is without the character or temperament needed to  serve on the Supreme Court without the credibility that the American  people deserve. He is, in fact, the antithesis of that impartial  arbiter that a Supreme Court Justice has to be.   The people of New Hampshire deserve better. The people of the United  States of America deserve better. That is why I will be voting no on  Brett Kavanaugh's nomination tomorrow, and I would urge all my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.   I yield the floor.
