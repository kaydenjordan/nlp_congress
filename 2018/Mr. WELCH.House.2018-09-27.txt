 Mr. Speaker, it is with some sadness that I have to say I  believe this is an absolutely terrible tax bill.   The economy is growing. That has been a claim that has been made by  proponents of this tax policy. But it is growing for the few. It is not  growing for the many.   We have the lowest unemployment rate we have had in years. We have  had the highest profits in corporations that we have had since before  the Great Depression. Yet, right now, in this country, childhood  poverty is increasing relentlessly. Relentlessly.   How does that happen when we have such a great so-called economy?   It happens because we have created the hydraulic system that is  transferring money from the low income and middle class to the very  wealthy. That is what this Congress has done. And there are  consequences to the children who are now in poverty and will be in  poverty, but also to those everyday families who aren't on the right  side of the digital divide and whose wages for the past 20 years have  been stagnant or declining, even as the things they need--college  education for their kids, prescription medication for their families-- those prices are exploding.   And by the way, Pharma gets a huge giveaway. They have got the  highest profits they have ever had, and we are passing a tax bill that  gives them more. We are shoveling money to them when they are sticking  price increases to all of us.   This doesn't happen by accident. This has nothing to do with the so- called entrepreneurial economy. This has to do with a Congress that has  no conscience, that doesn't stand up for everyday people and say: We  want policies that let you have a chance.  [[Page H9116]]    Mr. Speaker, defeat this bill.
