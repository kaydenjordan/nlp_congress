 Mr. President, I wish to recognize a dedicated public  servant and proud student of West Virginian and American history,  Dennis E. Frye, on the occasion of his retirement from the National  Park Service. Innumerable visitors to Harpers Ferry National Historical  Park benefited from his wealth of knowledge and notorious performances  that brought history to life.   As Dennis tells it, at a young age, he wanted to be either a  historian or an astronaut. Once he found out that becoming an astronaut  entails being very good at math, he decided history was the way to go.  He studied at what was then Shepherd College in Shepherdstown, WV,  while volunteering at Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, becoming  a park ranger in 1977. Eschewing the traditional route of advancement  in the National Park Service through moving from park to park, Dennis  stayed put and advanced within the park, and set about the task of  changing perceptions of Harpers Ferry in the Civil War history  community.   As staff historian and later chief historian at the park and through  his work in various historical societies concerned with the Civil War,  Dennis emphasized the importance of Harpers Ferry to the history of the  Civil War. Thanks, in large part, to his efforts, the Battle of Harpers  Ferry and the importance of the town in the history of America are  better recognized by the historical community, of which he is a vocal  member. Indeed, Dennis's dedication to his passion as an advocate and  student of history is apparent from the 10-year sabbatical he took to  focus on writing historical works and to serve as president of the  Civil War Trust, an organization dedicated to the preservation of Civil  War battlefields. He is also a recipient of the Shelby Foote Award from  the Civil War Trust, the National Park Service's Freeman Tilden Award  for excellence in interpretation and education, and the Nevins-Freeman  Award for outstanding contributions to the study of the Civil War.   Dennis later returned as chief historian of Harpers Ferry National  Historical Park, where his work of inspiring and educating visitors,  including my staff and myself, through meticulous detail and dramatic  performances continued to the present day. If the job of a historian is  to both impart knowledge and ensure the lessons of history remain with  us, then Dennis Frye is a master in his field.   No one who knows him doubts that Dennis E. Frye will continue to be a  forceful advocate for his passions in retirement, which includes being  an ardent fan of the Boston Red Sox. I believe I speak for many when I  say that I sincerely appreciate his public service and the  contributions he has made to a better understanding of the history of  West Virginia and America. I am proud to call him a friend, and I wish  him well in his future pursuits.                            ____________________
