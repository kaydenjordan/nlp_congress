 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Speaker-designate  Pelosi, Whip Hoyer, and Representative Sarbanes for honoring the will  of the American people and pledging to make democracy reform a top  priority for the 116th Congress.   One of the greatest promises of our democracy is that our government  is of, by, and for the people. Our democracy has always been a messy  experiment. It is not perfect. It is not a spectator sport. But it is  our greatest hope. At this point in time, unfortunately, many of our  democratic structures are under attack.   In my home, Pennsylvania, over the past decade, we have seen the  impact of antidemocratic policies. The cards have been stacked against  the voices of Pennsylvanians through unconstitutional gerrymandering,  repressive voter ID laws, and restrictive absentee ballot deadlines.  These tactics have been used to muzzle the voices of our constituents,  as well as voters in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia, and other  citizens across the country.                                time  1030    The H.R. 1 package being advanced by Representative Sarbanes and the  Democracy Reform Task Force is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to  restore the American people's faith in our institutions. History has  shown us that our American experiment is at its best when we face  complex challenges head-on and we are better for taking them up.   H.R. 1 is our path forward to a more perfect democracy. Our elections  are the bedrock of this Nation, and the sanctity of those elections  must be protected from threats, both foreign and domestic.   We can make it easier, not harder, for eligible Americans to vote. We  can end the dominance of Big Money in our politics. We can ensure that  public officials, from the White House to Members of Congress, put the  interests of the American people first. We can do all of those things,  and we must.   Public opinion polls show that the American people's distrust of our  governmental institutions is at staggering levels. We must work  together, Democrats and Republicans, to change course and restore the  people's faith. We have real work to do, and Members of the incoming  class are ready to roll up our sleeves. The voters have charged us to  restore the balance of our political institutions and make sure that  everyday Americans have a seat at the table.   When we listen to people instead of special interests, we can raise  the minimum wage and create good-paying jobs; we can lower prescription  drug prices and give people better access to healthcare; we can make  real investments in our infrastructure; we can reduce gun violence; and  we can increase funding for job training programs and public education.   Mr. Speaker, we owe it to the generations before us who worked to  establish this democracy and we owe it to the generations that follow  to ensure that we have a Government that is truly by and for the  people. We can work on this together. It is up to us to get it done,  and this work starts now.                            ____________________
