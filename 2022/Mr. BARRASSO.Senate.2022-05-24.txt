 Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the  retirement of Cyndy Novotny, principal of St. Anthony's Tri-Parish  Catholic School in Casper, WY.   This summer, Cyndy Novotny marks her 17th and final year as principal  at St. Anthony's School. The present St. Anthony's School building  stands as a testament to her 45-year career in education. St. Anthony's  Catholic School was dedicated on September 27, 1927, in the belief that  education is one of the most important ways that the Catholic Church  fulfills its commitment to God.   St. Anthony's School is dedicated to achieving academic excellence in  a faith-filled community. Guided by strong religious and educational  leadership, Casper students from preschool through eighth grade can  learn to live enriched lives committed to Christian service.   Cyndy was instrumental in the design and fundraising for this  classic, state-of-the-art building. The school is able to meet  students' educational needs while keeping them connected to their  faith. Her skills in fundraising also supported student tuition, making  Christian education accessible for many families.   Cyndy grew up in the Chicago area, receiving her bachelor of science  in elementary education from Illinois State University in 1977. After  moving to Casper, she taught at several schools, including first grade  at Southridge Elementary for 7 years and second grade at Sagewood  Elementary for another 7 years. While continuing to teach, she earned  her master's degree in teaching from Grand Canyon University in 2001.   Cyndy was a leading light in the development of the groundbreaking  innovative Woods Learning Center in Casper. Cyndy taught at Woods for  14 years before accepting the principal position at St. Anthony's Tri- Parish Catholic School.   Cyndy is an accomplished academician, educator, and public servant.  She worked to enhance educational curriculum and administration as a  speaker at the National School Board Annual Convention and  International Reading Association Annual Conference. Cyndy is also a  dedicated wife, mother, and grandmother. While teaching, she met her  husband, Scott Novotny, a now-retired teacher from Natrona County High  School. Together, they have three children, Mick Novotny with wife Dr.  Ruma Novotny, Caitlin Dixon with husband Brian Dixon, and Connor  Novotny. Cyndy and Scott also have five grandchildren: Ashwin, Colter,  Aubrey, Austin, and Jackson.   Cyndy's community involvement is extensive, having been awarded the  Natrona County School District Significant Educator three times and the  Ellbogen Meritorious Education Award She was nominated for Disney  Teacher of the Year and was twice nominated for the Presidential Awards  for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.   Children across Wyoming and the Nation benefited from her involvement  with the National Education Association, National Center of Innovation  Conference, Wyoming Reading Association, and Casper Reading  Association.   Cyndy's accomplishments and contributions will continue to enrich the  education of future generations of students. The community thanks Cyndy  for her public service. We recognize her invaluable contribution to the  St. Anthony's Tri-Parish Catholic School, Natrona County School  District No. 1, and the development of educational curriculum across  Wyoming. Cyndy is a pillar of the Casper community.   Cyndy's dedication to her faith is evident through her service as a  eucharistic minister, Music Minister, and a member of the Parish  Council at St. Patrick's Catholic Church. She exemplifies Christian  values and the Code of the West, living each day with courage and  taking pride in her work. Cyndy's joy in her work touched the lives of  hundreds of children, including my own.   It is with great pleasure that I recognize this outstanding member of  our Wyoming community. My wife Bobbi joins me in extending our best  wishes to Cyndy Novotny upon her retirement.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor the 150th  anniversary of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. This organization  is of incredible historical and influential importance for the State of  Wyoming and agriculture everywhere.   From Wednesday, June 8, to Saturday, June 11, 2022, the Wyoming Stock  Growers Association will host their annual Wyoming Cattle Industry  Convention. They will celebrate their 150th anniversary with a rodeo,  banquet, and parade. They will meet in Cheyenne, WY, where they can  trace their beginnings back to 1872. There, a group of five cattlemen  met in a livery stable to organize a group to tackle the growing threat  of stock rustlers. Their organization, then known as the Stock  Association of Laramie County, was only the second State cattlemen  association in the United States. Wyoming, however, was not yet a  State.   Over the years, members included mayors, State legislators,  Governors, and congressmen. U.S. Senators Robert D. Carey, John B.  Kendrick, and Cliff Hansen all served as presidents of the Wyoming  Stock Growers Association. My colleague Senator Cynthia Lummis is an  honorary life member.   Every Wyoming student knows of the infamous 1889-1893 Johnson County  War involving the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. It required  intervention by U.S. cavalry troops sent by President Benjamin  Harrison. The conflict has been recounted by numerous personalities  ranging from rodeo champion and singer/songwriter Chris LeDoux to the  fictional Rooster Cogburn.   Today, you will find members promoting the beef industry through  their Young Producers Assembly, Environmental Stewardship Program,  Centennial Farm and Ranch Program, and the Endowment Trust.   Local input is essential to the services provided by the Wyoming  Stock Growers. On any given week, you will find a county cattlemen  group meeting together to bring their issues and priorities to the  State association. The Stock Growers' auxiliary, the Cow-Belles, are  integral members of their communities and are fantastic promoters of  Wyoming's beef industry.   Regional education events bring valuable expertise to the raising of  healthy cattle on healthy lands. Information is made widely available  through their various publications. The association's staff does an  incredible job of serving their membership through educating and  promoting their trade to the public.   The Wyoming Stock Growers of 2022 have a remarkable leadership team.  Executive director Jim Magagna has lead the association since 1998 and  is Wyoming beef's greatest advocate. He is joined by Olivia Sanchez and  Susan Skinner in their office in Cheyenne.  [[Page S2661]]  The board of directors includes president David Kane, first vice  president Jack Berger, regional vice presidents Kahla Mills, Dan Frank,  Leif Hanson, Brad Mead, Darla Griffin, and Young Producers Assembly  president Sage Askin. These steadfast individuals wear many hats in  their communities and around Wyoming. Their dedication will ensure a  robust cattle industry in the state and a strong organization to  support them well into the future.   The mission of the Wyoming Stock Growers is an important one to the  character of the State. They advocate for the cattle industry and rural  life. They develop policies to conserve and best manage the vast  Wyoming landscape. They work with regulators at every facet of  government. The Great Seal on every Wyoming flag and our State seal  displays a rancher. This is the heritage of the stewards of the land  who provide the Nation with quality products and food on their tables.   Cattlemen and their families created towns and built economies around  the industry starting when Wyoming was still a territory. The tenacity  and principles of these hard-working people are embodied through our  Code of the West, the University of Wyoming's ``Cowboys,'' and the work  of the Wyoming Stock Growers. The theme of the Stock Growers centennial  celebration in 1972 was ``Guardian of the Grasslands.'' They continue  to serve and conserve their industry and values in an ever-changing  environment.   It is a great privilege to recognize this incredible organization and  their dedication to the Wyoming's cattle and agriculture industry.  Bobbi joins me in extending our congratulations and deep gratitude to  the Wyoming Stock Growers Association on their 150th anniversary  celebration.                            ____________________
