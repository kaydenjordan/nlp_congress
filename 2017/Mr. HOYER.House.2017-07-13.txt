 Mr. Chair, this amendment is not about defense, this  amendment is about politics, and I congratulate Chairman Thornberry for  urging that this amendment not be added to the bill in committee.   We ought to defeat this amendment. It has one purpose, and one  purpose only: to politically denigrate some of our fellow citizens, to  treat them less equally than we would want to be treated.   Let us not do that. Let us not sink to that level. We are better than  that. We are representative of all of the people.   Reject this amendment. Get on with the defense of this country and  its values.   Mr. Chair, I rise in very strong opposition to this amendment.   It is discriminatory.   It is disparaging to our military--to all our men and women in  uniform.   And it hinders our armed forces from carrying out their mission of  keeping our country safe.   It is appalling that the Rules Committee would even make this  amendment in order, the first ever to come to this floor that directly  takes away the rights of transgender Americans.   For those transgender Americans currently serving, it would deny them  health care services open to other service-members.   For those thinking of enlisting, it would be a powerful deterrent,  keeping talented, driven, and dedicated men and women from serving.   I hope my colleagues in both parties who are ashamed that this  amendment has reached the floor will join me in voting to defeat it.   Mr. SMITH OF Washington. I yield back the balance of my time.
