 Madam Speaker, the American people have spoken. It is time  to build back better.   Today's historic vote shows that President Biden and the Democratic  Congress are united and that we are keeping our promises to the  American people who put us in office.   Today, we move forward on the bipartisan infrastructure package to  rebuild our Nation. Today, we move forward on the Build Back Better  reconciliation bill to invest in American families. And today, we move  forward on restoring the Voting Rights Act to protect our democracy.   It is not a moment too soon. Florida's Ninth Congressional District  is the fastest growing district in the Nation, 40 percent growth, as I  represent 955,000 constituents.   Whether it is central Florida or across the Nation, it is time to  upgrade America's roads, bridges, ports, airports, rural broadband,  clean water, and resilient and renewable energy. It is time to make  childcare costs and  [[Page H4416]]  workforce education more affordable. It is time to help our seniors,  extend middle-class tax cuts, combat climate change, and build back  better.                            ____________________
