 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  threat of extreme heat in the United States and applaud the action of  President Biden in mobilizing an all-of-government effort to protect  our vulnerable populations from this increasingly common disaster.   Climate change threatens everyone on this planet, and it will  continue to do so for generations. While some regions will experience  scorching droughts and wildfires, others will experience catastrophic  hurricanes and flooding.   Environmental activist Wendell Berry said, ``The world is not given  by our fathers, but borrowed from our children.'' The consequences of  our past and present decisions are creating a dismal and desolate  future for our children and for our children's children.   Unfortunately, even if we rapidly reduce our carbon emissions today,  our planet will continue to warm for some time.   Heat threatens the lives of children, the elderly, outdoor workers,  and more, as prolonged exposure leads to health risks, such as heat  cramps, heat stroke, and of course death.   This summer we experienced this new, hotter than normal heat across  this country. In late June, the Pacific Northwest region experienced an  abnormal heat wave that led to unprecedented numbers of deaths and  hospitalization.   July was the Earth's hottest month on record.   In early August, over 80 million people across 20 States, from  Washington to Florida, were under excessive heat warnings and  advisories. Simultaneously, States along the East Coast experienced  triple-digit heat indexes as a combination of heat and humidity created  hazardous and deadly situations.   Most recently, following Hurricane Ida, 10 people died from heat in  New Orleans after vulnerable residents lost power, and temperatures  climbed to over 90 degrees.   Disadvantaged communities suffer the most from these frequent heat  occurrences. Communities of color and low-income communities  disproportionately experience higher temperatures than their White and  wealthier counterparts.   Decades of discriminate urban planning, like reducing tree cover or  increasing hard surfaces, have led to temperature disparities in our  most vulnerable communities.   Moreover, in many of these communities residents struggle with  significant preexisting and chronic illnesses, like heart disease,  diabetes, and high blood pressure, which become fatal in extreme heat.   For some Americans, higher temperatures are not merely a nuisance,  they can be deadly. I applaud President Biden's recent decision to  address extreme heat.   From protecting outdoor workers by establishing OSHA standards to  expanding cooling centers and cooling assistance amidst heat waves,  President Biden's commitment to the health and safety of the American  population is vital to ensure that fewer lives will be lost to  increasing temperatures.   Earlier this year I was proud to introduce the SHADE Act, which  aligns with the ambitious goals of President Biden's extreme heat  initiatives and addresses the heat disparity experienced in  disadvantaged communities. The SHADE Act would create a grant program  to plant trees in formerly redlined districts and overburdened  communities.   Thanks to the research of Dr. Jeremy Hoffman, Dr. Vivek Shandas, and  Nicholas Pendleton, we now know that historical discriminatory housing  policies have long-lasting consequences, making formerly redlined  neighborhoods hotter than non-redlined neighborhoods.    Climate change is not a distant or slow moving threat. It is here  now, and many Americans are battling the consequences of it alone. Too  many are losing that battle.   While efforts to combat climate change must be a priority, we must  also mitigate the impacts we are already facing. We must ensure that  all Americans can adapt and can survive in this new normal.                            ____________________
