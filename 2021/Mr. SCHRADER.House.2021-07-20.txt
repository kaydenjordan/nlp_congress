 Mr. Speaker, I ask that Chairman Pallone engage in a  colloquy with me on the effect of this bill on small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I support the purpose of the Consumer Protection and  Recovery Act to allow the FTC to get money back for consumers who have  been harmed by violations of FTC laws.   I am concerned that small business owners who inadvertently harm  customers will, on top of paying restitution, however, get hit with  unreasonable penalties for what was essentially an honest mistake.   As a small business owner, I know how difficult it can be to keep up  with all the rules and regulations that small businesses must abide by.  And I think we should only allow civil penalties for punitive damages  where bad actors knowingly violate the law.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the chairman to clarify the extent of this bill  with respect to small businesses.    I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his assurances  that the intent of this bill is to protect consumers and not to hurt  honest small businesses by subjecting them to excessive penalties.
