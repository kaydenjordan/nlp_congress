 Mr. Speaker, today, on Transgender Remembrance Day, I  rise to remember Tracy Single, who was killed in July of this year in  my district, the 15th transgender woman of color murdered this year.   A music lover with an eye for fashion and an ear for music, 22-year- old Tracy moved to Houston to pursue her dream of becoming a rapper.  Tension around her gender identity forced her out of her home, and she  experienced a very hard time, but she was persistent and upbeat, always  working to achieve her goals.   Her life reminds us that creative and vibrant people can thrive even  in the most difficult circumstances. And her death reminds us that  transgender people are under attack and must have equal protection  under the law.                            ____________________
