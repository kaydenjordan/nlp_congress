 Madam Speaker, this morning, I wanted to share with the  Chamber the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and  the Department of Health and Human Services regarding infection rates  and vaccination rates in the country.   I am proud to say, the State of Connecticut, which the Speaker knows  well, we ranked as the lowest infection rate in the country, 1.4  percent, 14 cases per 100,000.   Simultaneous with that report were the numbers regarding vaccination  rates. For the population 18 and over, we are at an 80 percent  vaccination rate, which, again, is the highest in the country.   It is blindingly obvious there is a causal connection between  communities that come together to boost vaccination rates and the  benefit and the result of reducing infection rates. The benefit, in  terms of our hospital system in the State of Connecticut, again, we  have 9 per 100,000 COVID patients, which ranks number three in the  country, right behind Vermont and the State of Massachusetts, which are  7 per 100,000 and 8 per 100,000.   What does that mean? It means there is no pressure on your ICU units.  There is allowance for normal elective surgeries and the processes of  hospitals to continue, which is the endgame of what we all should be  focused on like a laser, which is to get beyond this pandemic.   It didn't happen by itself.   Anecdotally, in my district, I was over at the Coast Guard Academy  the other day: a 99 percent vaccination rate with the student body at  the Coast Guard Academy. These are the future leaders of our coastal  sea service, and they get it. They understand the benefits, that they  can attend class and have a normal campus life.   Across the river, the submarine base in Groton, again, just shy of a  90 percent vaccination rate. That is 10,000 sailors and officers. These  are people with families. These are folks who have pregnant spouses.  But they get it. I mean, there is no way you can socially distance in a  submarine. They are now the number one naval installation in America in  terms of vaccination rates.   Again, it did not happen by itself. Governor Lamont, back in the  spring of 2020, basically tuned out all the noise. He brought together  experts from the Yale School of Public Health. He brought together  experts from the Hartford HealthCare hospital system, which is the  largest hospital system. They brought together the community health  centers. They brought together community groups. They stayed focused in  terms of getting testing, masking, and vaccinations out there to the  public at large.   I would note, Madam Speaker, that when we passed the American Rescue  Plan back in March, like every State, we were given an allocation to  our public health system for communication and education. Again, it has  been put to good use, obviously, as these numbers show this morning.   On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced the release of funding  for community health centers, which have been the backbone in terms of  reaching hard-to-get populations, to get the help that they need during  this pandemic. In eastern Connecticut, the two community health  systems--United Children and Family Services, and Generations--are  getting close to $1 million for new equipment and new infrastructure to  carry out their mission to make sure that we are going to beat this  virus once and for all.   All the issues that we talk about here--and they are all so  important--right now, we still cannot be distracted from the need to  get on the other side of this pandemic. These numbers from my State  today show that when you work together, when you just combat all the  misinformation and bad stuff  [[Page H5557]]  that is out there about vaccines and masking--we had a hearing in  Hartford where we had people up there saying that the authorization  from the FDA was only for the German vaccine, not the American Pfizer  vaccine, which is ridiculous. That stuff is out there, but we have  overcome that.   Again, the numbers speak for themselves in terms of that success.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that we  keep this priority number one, two, and three because that is how we  recover our economy, and that is how we recover a normal life in this  country. So, let's work together.                            ____________________
