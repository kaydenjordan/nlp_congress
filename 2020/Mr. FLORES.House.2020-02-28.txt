 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Walden for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2339, a bill that  bans all flavors of all tobacco products while imposing a new excise  tax on vaping products.   Let me start by saying this: I don't smoke. I don't chew. I don't  vape. And I don't dip. But I do represent adult constituents who do.   Bills like this make it clear that House Democrats are more  interested in placing partisan politics over real solutions.   Since 2011, the share of high school students who say they have  smoked cigarettes recently has fallen from 16 percent to 6 percent.  More than 2.5 million U.S. adult smokers have quit smoking by switching  to e-cigarettes, and many rely on flavored e-liquids.   If flavored e-cigarettes are outright banned and e-cigarettes have  increased taxes, as this bill does, many of these ex-smokers will  return to traditional cigarettes while others will be forced into the  dangerous e-cigarette black market that this legislation creates.   Let's be clear: Science proves that e-cigarettes are safer than  traditional smoking.   Both Congress and President Trump have taken important steps to  address the youth vaping epidemic. Unfortunately, today's legislation  has nothing to do with the youth vaping epidemic and would instead  eliminate consumer choice for millions of law-abiding adults.
