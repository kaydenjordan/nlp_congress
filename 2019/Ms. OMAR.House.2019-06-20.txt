 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R.  3055.   My amendment addresses the misguided use of solitary confinement  within our Nation's prison systems and the harmful impact it has on  incarcerated populations.   Solitary confinement is torture. For people with mental health  issues, landing in solitary not only produces behaviors that yield more  time in solitary, but it can also extend prison sentences, sometimes  drastically. For these already vulnerable people, solitary confinement  generates a cycle of punishment that for some can literally be endless.   In many prisons in this country, the de facto penalty for even minor  prison rules violations, including those obviously caused by  psychological distress or disability, has become solitary confinement.  The isolation of solitary almost inevitably causes a measurable  deterioration in mental health, which in turn leads to more behavioral  issues punished with more solitary confinement.   Oftentimes, someone who was only supposed to spend a couple of years  in prison ends up spending the rest of their life there, or they end up  returning because they have been so damaged by solitary confinement  that they can't adjust to life outside of prison.   This vicious cycle of violence must end. Individuals with underlying  psychological disabilities are already overrepresented in prisons and  jails, and this inhumane, inexcusable punishment is only perpetuating  those problems. That is why we must put an end to solitary confinement  once and for all.   I believe that, together, we can reform this cycle.  [[Page H4937]]    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Serrano).    Mr. Chair, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
