 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4998), to prohibit certain Federal  loans, grants, and subsidies from being used to purchase communications  equipment or services posing national security risks, to provide for  the establishment of a reimbursement program for the replacement of  communications equipment or services posing such risks, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4998         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Secure and Trusted       Communications Networks Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2.

(a) Publication of Covered Communications Equipment or       Services List.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Commission shall publish on its       website a list of covered communications equipment or       services.        (b) Publication by Commission.--The Commission shall place       on the list published under subsection (a) any communications       equipment or service, if and only if such equipment or       service--        (1) is produced or provided by any entity, if, based       exclusively on the determinations described in paragraphs (1)       through (4) of subsection (c), such equipment or service       produced or provided by such entity poses an unacceptable       risk to the national security of the United States or the       security and safety of United States persons; and        (2) is capable of--        (A) routing or redirecting user data traffic or permitting       visibility into any user data or packets that such equipment       or service transmits or otherwise handles;        (B) causing the network of a provider of advanced       communications service to be disrupted remotely; or        (C) otherwise posing an unacceptable risk to the national       security of the United States or the security and safety of       United States persons.        (c) Reliance on Certain Determinations.--In taking action       under subsection (b)(1), the Commission shall place on the       list any communications equipment or service that poses an       unacceptable risk to the national security of the United       States or the security and safety of United States persons       based solely on one or more of the following determinations:        (1) A specific determination made by any executive branch       interagency body with appropriate national security       expertise, including the Federal Acquisition Security Council       established under section 1322(a) of title 41, United States       Code.        (2) A specific determination made by the Department of       Commerce pursuant to Executive Order 13873 (84 Fed. Reg.       22689; relating to securing the information and       communications technology and services supply chain).

McCain National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-232;       132 Stat. 1918).        (4) A specific determination made by an appropriate       national security agency.        (d) Updating of List.--        (1) In general.--The Commission shall periodically update       the list published under subsection (a) to address changes in       the determinations described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of       subsection (c).        (2) Monitoring of determinations.--The Commission shall       monitor the making or reversing of the determinations       described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (c) in       order to place additional communications equipment or       services on the list published under subsection (a) or to       remove communications equipment or services from such list.       If a determination described in any such paragraph that       provided the basis for a determination by the Commission       under subsection (b)(1) with respect to any communications       equipment or service is reversed, the Commission shall remove       such equipment or service from such list, except that the       Commission may not remove such equipment or service from such       list if any other determination described in any such       paragraph provides a basis for inclusion on such list by the       Commission under subsection (b)(1) with respect to such       equipment or service.        (3) Public notification.--For each 12-month period during       which the list published under subsection (a) is not updated,       the Commission shall notify the public that no updates were       necessary during such period to protect national security or       to address changes in the determinations described in       paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (c).       SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF CERTAIN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES.         (a) In General.--        (1) Prohibition.--A Federal subsidy that is made available       through a program administered by the Commission and that       provides funds to be used for the capital expenditures       necessary for the provision of advanced communications       service may not be used to--        (A) purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain any covered       communications equipment or service; or        (B) maintain any covered communications equipment or       service previously purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise       obtained.        (2) Timing.--Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any       covered communications equipment or service beginning on the       date that is 60 days after the date on which the Commission       places such equipment or service on the list required by       section 2(a). In the case of any covered communications       equipment or service that is on the initial list published       under such section, such equipment or service shall be       treated as being placed on the list on the date on which such       list is published.        (b) Completion of Proceeding.--Not later than 180 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission       shall adopt a Report and Order to implement subsection (a).

SEC. 4. SECURE AND TRUSTED COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS                     REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--The Commission shall establish a       reimbursement program, to be known as the ``Secure and       Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program'', to       make reimbursements to providers of advanced communications       service to replace covered communications equipment or       services.        (b) Eligibility.--The Commission may not make a       reimbursement under the Program to a provider of advanced       communications service unless the provider--        (1) has 2,000,000 or fewer customers; and        (2) makes all of the certifications required by subsection       (d)(4).        (c) Use of Funds.--        (1) In general.--A recipient of a reimbursement under the       Program shall use reimbursement funds solely for the purposes       of--        (A) permanently removing covered communications equipment       or services purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise obtained       before--        (i) in the case of any covered communications equipment or       services that are on the initial list published under section       2(a), August 14, 2018; or        (ii) in the case of any covered communications equipment or       services that are not on the initial list published under       section 2(a), the date that is 60 days after the date on       which the Commission places such equipment or services on the       list required by such section;        (B) replacing the covered communications equipment or       services removed as described in subparagraph (A) with       communications equipment or services that are not covered       communications equipment or services; and        (C) disposing of the covered communications equipment or       services removed as described in subparagraph (A) in       accordance with the requirements under subsection (d)(7).        (2) Limitations.--A recipient of a reimbursement under the       Program may not--        (A) use reimbursement funds to remove, replace, or dispose       of any covered communications equipment or service purchased,       rented, leased, or otherwise obtained on or after--  [[Page H10283]]         (i) in the case of any covered communications equipment or       service that is on the initial list published under section       2(a), August 14, 2018; or        (ii) in the case of any covered communications equipment or       service that is not on the initial list published under       section 2(a), the date that is 60 days after the date on       which the Commission places such equipment or service on the       list required by such section; or        (B) purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain any covered       communications equipment or service, using reimbursement       funds or any other funds (including funds derived from       private sources).        (d) Implementation.--        (1) Suggested replacements.--        (A) Development of list.--The Commission shall develop a       list of suggested replacements of both physical and virtual       communications equipment, application and management       software, and services or categories of replacements of both       physical and virtual communications equipment, application       and management software and services.        (B) Neutrality.--The list developed under subparagraph (A)       shall be technology neutral and may not advantage the use of       reimbursement funds for capital expenditures over operational       expenditures, to the extent that the Commission determines       that communications services can serve as an adequate       substitute for the installation of communications equipment.        (2) Application process.--        (A) In general.--The Commission shall develop an       application process and related forms and materials for the       Program.        (B) Cost estimate.--        (i) Initial estimate.--The Commission shall require an       applicant to provide an initial reimbursement cost estimate       at the time of application, with supporting materials       substantiating the costs.        (ii) Updates.--During and after the application review       process, the Commission may require an applicant to--         (I) update the initial reimbursement cost estimate       submitted under clause (i); and        (II) submit additional supporting materials substantiating       an updated cost estimate submitted under subclause (I).         (C) Mitigation of burden.--In developing the application       process under this paragraph, the Commission shall take       reasonable steps to mitigate the administrative burdens and       costs associated with the application process, while taking       into account the need to avoid waste, fraud, and abuse in the       Program.        (3) Application review process.--        (A) Deadline.--        (i) In general.--Except as provided in clause (ii) and       subparagraph (B), the Commission shall approve or deny an       application for a reimbursement under the Program not later       than 90 days after the date of the submission of the       application.        (ii) Additional time needed by commission.--If the       Commission determines that, because an excessive number of       applications have been filed at one time, the Commission       needs additional time for employees of the Commission to       process the applications, the Commission may extend the       deadline described in clause (i) for not more than 45 days.        (B) Opportunity for applicant to cure deficiency.--If the       Commission determines that an application is materially       deficient (including by lacking an adequate cost estimate or       adequate supporting materials), the Commission shall provide       the applicant a 15-day period to cure the defect before       denying the application. If such period would extend beyond       the deadline under subparagraph (A) for approving or denying       the application, such deadline shall be extended through the       end of such period.        (C) Effect of denial.--Denial of an application for a       reimbursement under the Program shall not preclude the       applicant from resubmitting the application or submitting a       new application for a reimbursement under the Program at a       later date.        (4) Certifications.--An applicant for a reimbursement under       the Program shall, in the application of the applicant,       certify to the Commission that--        (A) as of the date of the submission of the application,       the applicant--        (i) has developed a plan for--         (I) the permanent removal and replacement of any covered       communications equipment or services that are in the       communications network of the applicant as of such date; and        (II) the disposal of the equipment or services removed as       described in subclause (I) in accordance with the       requirements under paragraph (7); and         (ii) has developed a specific timeline (subject to       paragraph (6)) for the permanent removal, replacement, and       disposal of the covered communications equipment or services       identified under clause (i), which timeline shall be       submitted to the Commission as part of the application; and        (B) beginning on the date of the approval of the       application, the applicant--        (i) will not purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain       covered communications equipment or services, using       reimbursement funds or any other funds (including funds       derived from private sources); and        (ii) in developing and tailoring the risk management       practices of the applicant, will consult and consider the       standards, guidelines, and best practices set forth in the       cybersecurity framework developed by the National Institute       of Standards and Technology.        (5) Distribution of reimbursement funds.--        (A) In general.--The Commission shall make reasonable       efforts to ensure that reimbursement funds are distributed       equitably among all applicants for reimbursements under the       Program according to the needs of the applicants, as       identified by the applications of the applicants.        (B) Notification.--If, at any time during the       implementation of the Program, the Commission determines that       $1,000,000,000 will not be sufficient to fully fund all       approved applications for reimbursements under the Program,       the Commission shall immediately notify--        (i) the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee       on Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (ii) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation       and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate.        (6) Removal, replacement, and disposal term.--        (A) Deadline.--Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and       (C), the permanent removal, replacement, and disposal of any       covered communications equipment or services identified under       paragraph (4)(A)(i) shall be completed not later than 1 year       after the date on which the Commission distributes       reimbursement funds to the recipient.        (B) General extension.--The Commission may grant an       extension of the deadline described in subparagraph (A) for 6       months to all recipients of reimbursements under the Program       if the Commission--        (i) finds that the supply of replacement communications       equipment or services needed by the recipients to achieve the       purposes of the Program is inadequate to meet the needs of       the recipients; and        (ii) provides notice and a detailed justification for       granting the extension to--         (I) the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives; and        (II) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation       of the Senate.         (C) Individual extension.--        (i) Petition.--A recipient of a reimbursement under the       Program may petition the Commission for an extension for such       recipient of the deadline described in subparagraph (A) or,       if the Commission has granted an extension of such deadline       under subparagraph (B), such deadline as so extended.        (ii) Grant.--The Commission may grant a petition filed       under clause (i) by extending, for the recipient that filed       the petition, the deadline described in subparagraph (A) or,       if the Commission has granted an extension of such deadline       under subparagraph (B), such deadline as so extended, for a       period of not more than 6 months if the Commission finds       that, due to no fault of such recipient, such recipient is       unable to complete the permanent removal, replacement, and       disposal described in subparagraph (A).        (7) Disposal of covered communications equipment or       services.--The Commission shall include in the regulations       promulgated under subsection (g) requirements for the       disposal by a recipient of a reimbursement under the Program       of covered communications equipment or services identified       under paragraph (4)(A)(i) and removed from the network of the       recipient in order to prevent such equipment or services from       being used in the networks of providers of advanced       communications service.

(C) Reports to congress.--Not less frequently than once       every 180 days beginning on the date on which the Commission       first makes funds available to a recipient of a reimbursement       under the Program, the Commission shall prepare and submit to       the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate a report on--        (i) the implementation of the Program by the Commission;       and        (ii) the work by recipients of reimbursements under the       Program to permanently remove, replace, and dispose of       covered communications equipment or services identified under       paragraph (4)(A)(i).        (e) Measures to Avoid Waste, Fraud, and Abuse.--        (1) In general.--The Commission shall take all necessary       steps to avoid waste, fraud, and abuse with respect to the       Program.        (2) Spending reports.--The Commission shall require       recipients of reimbursements under the Program to submit to       the Commission on a regular basis reports regarding how       reimbursement funds have been spent, including detailed       accounting of the covered communications equipment or       services permanently removed and disposed of, and the  [[Page H10284]]       replacement equipment or services purchased, rented, leased,       or otherwise obtained, using reimbursement funds.        (3) Audits, reviews, and field investigations.--The       Commission shall conduct--        (A) regular audits and reviews of reimbursements under the       Program to confirm that recipients of such reimbursements are       complying with this Act; and        (B) random field investigations to ensure that recipients       of reimbursements under the Program are performing the work       such recipients are required to perform under the commitments       made in the applications of such recipients for       reimbursements under the Program, including the permanent       removal, replacement, and disposal of the covered       communications equipment or services identified under       subsection (d)(4)(A)(i).        (4) Final certification.--        (A) In general.--The Commission shall require a recipient       of a reimbursement under the Program to submit to the       Commission, in a form and at an appropriate time to be       determined by the Commission, a certification stating that       the recipient--        (i) has fully complied with (or is in the process of       complying with) all terms and conditions of the Program;        (ii) has fully complied with (or is in the process of       complying with) the commitments made in the application of       the recipient for the reimbursement;        (iii) has permanently removed from the communications       network of the recipient, replaced, and disposed of (or is in       the process of permanently removing, replacing, and disposing       of) all covered communications equipment or services that       were in the network of the recipient as of the date of the       submission of the application of the recipient for the       reimbursement; and        (iv) has fully complied with (or is in the process of       complying with) the timeline submitted by the recipient under       subparagraph (A)(ii) of paragraph (4) of subsection (d) and       the other requirements of such paragraph.        (B) Updated certification.--If, at the time when a       recipient of a reimbursement under the Program submits a       certification under subparagraph (A), the recipient has not       fully complied as described in clause (i), (ii), or (iv) of       such subparagraph or has not completed the permanent removal,       replacement, and disposal described in clause (iii) of such       subparagraph, the Commission shall require the recipient to       file an updated certification when the recipient has fully       complied as described in such clause (i), (ii), or (iv) or       completed such permanent removal, replacement, and disposal.        (f) Effect of Removal of Equipment or Service From List.--        (1) In general.--If, after the date on which a recipient of       a reimbursement under the Program submits the application for       the reimbursement, any covered communications equipment or       service that is in the network of the recipient as of such       date is removed from the list published under section 2(a),       the recipient may--        (A) return to the Commission any reimbursement funds       received for the removal, replacement, and disposal of such       equipment or service and be released from any requirement       under this section to remove, replace, or dispose of such       equipment or service; or        (B) retain any reimbursement funds received for the       removal, replacement, and disposal of such equipment or       service and remain subject to the requirements of this       section to remove, replace, and dispose of such equipment or       service as if such equipment or service continued to be on       the list published under section 2(a).

(h) Rule of Construction Regarding Timing of       Reimbursement.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to       prohibit the Commission from making a reimbursement under the       Program to a provider of advanced communications service       before the provider incurs the cost of the permanent removal,       replacement, and disposal of the covered communications       equipment or service for which the application of the       provider has been approved under this section.        (i) Education Efforts.--The Commission shall engage in       education efforts with providers of advanced communications       service to--        (1) encourage such providers to participate in the Program;       and        (2) assist such providers in submitting applications for       the Program.

(a) In General.--Each provider of advanced communications       service shall submit an annual report to the Commission, in a       form to be determined by the Commission, regarding whether       such provider has purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise       obtained any covered communications equipment or service on       or after--        (1) in the case of any covered communications equipment or       service that is on the initial list published under section       2(a), August 14, 2018; or        (2) in the case of any covered communications equipment or       service that is not on the initial list published under       section 2(a), the date that is 60 days after the date on       which the Commission places such equipment or service on the       list required by such section.        (b) Rule of Construction.--If a provider of advanced       communications service certifies to the Commission that such       provider does not have any covered communications equipment       or service in the network of such provider, such provider is       not required to submit a report under subsection (a) after       making such certification, unless such provider later       purchases, rents, leases, or otherwise obtains any covered       communications equipment or service.

DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4998.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as  much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first off, I want to thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking  Member Walden and their staffs for their dedication and working  together to come to an agreement on this legislation and bringing it to  the House floor today.   Today, the House will consider H.R. 4998, the Secure and Trusted  Communications Networks Act, introduced by Chairman Pallone and Ranking  Member Walden. This bill would prohibit the use of Federal funds and  FCC universal service programs for the purchase and use of  telecommunications equipment which poses significant risks to national  security. It would also authorize the creation of a program to enable  telecommunications service providers to remove and replace untrusted  telecom equipment.   It has become clear that untrusted equipment in U.S.  telecommunications networks poses an unacceptable threat to our  national security, and I am very happy that we were able to come  together to address this serious issue.   Small broadband providers in mostly rural parts of our country have  turned, understandably, to the cheapest option they could find to  provide service. All too often, that has been Chinese equipment  provided by Huawei or ZTE. These companies have been propped up and  supported by the Chinese Government as a way of expanding Chinese  influence and gaining a foothold for the Chinese Government in the  networks of foreign nations.   We are coming together today to say that the risks posed by this  equipment are simply not acceptable to our country or to anyone who  uses these networks. Increasingly, all aspects of our economy, civil  discourse, and culture run over the internet, and giving a foothold to  those who might do us harm is a risk we can no longer afford.   What is frustrating is that large telecom providers knew the dangers  [[Page H10286]]  posed by the equipment from companies like Huawei and ZTE years ago  because of warnings inside our government. But smaller providers didn't  get the same heads-up by our government, and when confronted with  rumors about untrusted equipment and the certainty of their bottom  lines, they went with their bottom line.   My hope is that this legislation can help these folks address the  threat posed by this untrusted equipment in an expeditious fashion.  This bill should signal to our allies and partners around the world  that network security must be a priority as we enter a new generation  of communication capabilities.   I am proud of the bipartisan work of my colleagues on the Energy and  Commerce Committee to advance this legislation to the floor today. I  especially want to acknowledge the important contributions Subcommittee  Vice Chair Doris Matsui made to put this bill together and move it  through the legislative process.   I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot reiterate enough how important it is that we  pass this legislation and address this critical weakness in our  Nation's telecommunications infrastructure.   This legislation came about through the hard work of the majority  staff and the minority staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee. In  particular, I would like to thank Gerry Leverich, Phil Murphy, Dan  Miller, AJ Brown, Parul Desai, and Alex Hoehn-Saric of the majority  staff, and Kate O'Connor, Evan Viau, and Rachel Rathore on the minority  staff for their hard work and diligence to get this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4229) to require the Federal  Communications Commission to issue rules relating to the collection of  data with respect to the availability of broadband services, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4229         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 4229.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first off, I want to thank Ranking Member Walden and his  staff for their willingness and dedication in working with us to come  to an agreement on this legislation and work with us to move it through  the House.   H.R. 4229, the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological  Availability, or DATA, Act, introduced by Mr. Loebsack and subcommittee  Ranking Member Latta, would require the Federal Communications  Commission to take steps to address the many problems with our current  broadband maps. We have talked about incomplete and inaccurate  broadband maps for as long as I have been on the Energy and Commerce  Committee, and I am glad that my colleagues were able to come together  and finally address this important issue.  [[Page H10290]]    Accurate maps of who does and doesn't have access to broadband are a  critical first step in closing the digital divide. We can't hope to  solve this problem if we don't know the scope of it and where to put  our resources. This bill would dramatically improve the FCC broadband  maps by requiring the FCC to collect and disseminate far more granular  broadband data for both fixed and mobile services. The bill would also  allow the FCC to use crowdsourced data to help verify and supplement  carrier-provided data.   This bill also integrates concepts and principles from H.R. 4128, the  Map Improvement Act of 2019, introduced by Representatives Lujan,  Bilirakis, and myself; H.R. 2643, the Broadband Mapping After Public  Scrutiny Act of 2019, introduced by Ranking Member Latta and my good  friend, Congressman Welch, who has been a leader on addressing the  broadband mapping issue; and H.R. 3162, the Broadband Data Improvement  Act of 2019, introduced by Representatives McMorris Rodgers and  O'Halleran.   H.R. 4229 is a commonsense bill with bipartisan support to fix a  longstanding problem in our Nation's broadband maps.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes  to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack), who is the Democratic prime  sponsor and author of this bill.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have no more  speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as FCC Commissioner Rosenworcel said at our last  oversight hearing, we need accurate maps before we spend money, and we  need better data if we want good deployments.   More than that, I would add, the FCC needs to fix the maps that they  have before they go out spending billions of dollars on broadband  deployment in rural communities. Some of the funding choices the  Commission has discussed making could impact these communities for the  next 10 years.   The Commission has also acted on a range of regulatory actions  related to  [[Page H10291]]  deployment and competition using bad maps.   To be honest, I think the FCC needs to fix its maps before it makes  either funding or regulatory decisions. To be honest, it seems like the  FCC is a fact-free zone when it comes to the disconnect between how bad  their maps are and the kinds of actions they are taking.   I want to thank the good work done by my colleague  Dave Loebsack.  The broadband mapping issue has been a passion of his for a long time,  and I am glad that we are acting to address it before Dave retires. I  know that he and his staffer Scott Stockwell, who is celebrating his  birthday--and I wish Scott a happy birthday--have worked hard to get  this legislation to the floor today. It is a critical first step in  getting our Nation on the right track to closing the digital divide.   I also thank our committee staffers Jerry Leverich, Dan Miller, AJ  Brown, Parul Desai, Phil Murphy, and Alex Hoehn-Saric on the majority  staff, and Kate O'Connor, Evan Viau, Mike Engel, and Rachel Rathore on  the minority staff for their hard work and diligence to get this bill  to floor.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and address a critical  shortfall in our Nation's broadband deployment policy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4227) to prohibit the submission to  the Federal Communications Commission of broadband internet access  service coverage information or data for the purposes of compiling an  inaccurate broadband coverage map.

DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4227.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, the House will consider H.R. 4227, the Mapping  Accuracy Promotes Services Act, or MAPS Act, introduced by Mr. McEachin  and Mr. Long.   This legislation would specify that it is unlawful to willingly,  knowingly, and recklessly submit mapping data that is incorrect. This  is an issue that the FCC has been wrestling with for years.   Earlier this year, the FCC claimed that, based on data they had  collected, the number of Americans who lacked access to broadband had  dropped 25 percent since 2017. However, this statistic was based on a  colossal error by one provider that skewed results for the whole  Nation. The provider claimed that they served 62 million people, or 20  percent, of the Nation with fiber. This would have made this single  provider the fourth largest provider in the country when, in fact, they  were the 81st largest.   Our mapping problems don't end there. The FCC delayed their Mobility  Fund 2 proceeding last year because the data submitted by wireless  carriers was so inaccurate that it was unclear what basis the FCC would  use to award over $4 billion in broadband deployment funds.   This fund was intended to pay for the deployment of 4G wireless  broadband services to rural and unserved communities. The FCC halted  that proceeding for over a year and just last week announced that they  would be moving forward on a revamped proceeding sometime next year.   The major sticking point is that they will need to go out and redo  all the inaccurate maps, which are based on fraudulent and overstated  data, that they currently have. To add insult to injury, the FCC isn't  even taking action against the carriers that submitted the faulty or  fraudulent data in the first place.   This legislation addresses many of these issues by making it unlawful  to willingly, knowingly, or recklessly submit inaccurate data about the  availability or quality of service of broadband.
