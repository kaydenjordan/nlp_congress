Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today, the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule, House Resolution 838, providing for consideration of H.R. 5314,  the Protecting Our Democracy Act, under a structured rule. It provides  1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. It  self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairwoman Maloney and makes  in order 34 amendments. It also provides en bloc authority to  Chairwoman Maloney and one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of S. 1605, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, under a closed rule. It  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services. It  provides authority for the chair of the Armed Services Committee to  insert into the Record explanatory materials through December 10 and  provides for one motion to commit.   The rule also provides for consideration of S. 610, the Protecting  Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, under a closed  rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and  Means and provides for one motion to commit.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader the ability to en bloc  requested roll call votes on certain suspension bills through December  9, 2021.   Mr. Speaker, ever since the founding of our great Nation, we have  debated how to appropriately check and balance the various branches of  our government with a primary concern, dating back to the 1700s, being  how to prevent abuses of executive power and how to address such abuses  when they occur.   In the 1970s, Congress passed a variety of reforms in response to  abuses of the Nixon administration to address the imbalance between  Congress and the President--laws like the War Powers Act, the Inspector  General Act, the National Emergencies Act, and the Impoundment Control  Act.   Now, just like then, Congress must pass additional reforms to protect  against Presidential impunity and reset the dysfunctional relationship  between the branches of government.   Many Americans did not realize that we didn't already have laws to  prevent the kinds of abuses we saw during the Trump administration.  They thought that our laws required the disclosure of tax returns by  Presidential candidates and the avoidance of financial conflicts,  particularly from foreign nations, and that our laws prevented the use  of pardons to protect political allies from criminal liability.   In a country founded by men for whom public service to promote the  common good was the highest calling, we have long expected our elected  leaders to adhere to ethical standards that far exceed minimal  legality, and for the most part, they have. People didn't realize that  a wayward President might have a dangerously wide berth to avoid legal  and ethical guardrails, subvert the other branches of government, and  escape accountability for doing so.   They were surprised that the former President and his administration  would offer pardons in return for political favors, illegally repurpose  taxpayer dollars, violate the Hatch Act, or remove inspectors general  when they investigated executive misconduct.   They were surprised that the former President would politically  interfere in  [[Page H6922]]  Federal law enforcement investigations and prosecutions, order Federal  agents to violently disperse peaceful protesters, or use his office to  direct business to properties that he owned and profited from.   This is no way for a democracy to function. When a President, any  President, abuses the power of their office, we all suffer, and our  democracy is weakened. We often hear that the United States is a nation  of laws, not men, but so long as those laws are enforced by men, we  need a functional system of oversight and accountability to prevent  lawlessness, graft, nepotism, crony dealings, and abuses of  Presidential power.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act focuses on three major areas of  reform: limiting abuses of Presidential power; improving  accountability, transparency, and the system of checks and balances;  and protecting against foreign interference in our Nation's elections.   Former President Trump and his administration made it abundantly  clear that the functioning of our democratic institutions had become  too dependent on the good behavior of good people and that our  government was vulnerable to the dangers posed by people in positions  of power who might value their own political or financial interests  more than public service or the common good.   These are not esoteric concerns. Just last week at a townhall,  several of my constituents asked sharp questions about the failure to  hold anyone accountable--so far--for inciting the January 6 attack on  the U.S. Capitol, the misuse of government funds intended for COVID  relief, and the measures necessary to hold people in contempt when they  defy congressional subpoenas.   While the Trump administration may have ended, our democratic  institutions are still vulnerable to future Presidents who try to  commit the same crimes, abuses of power, and other improper actions.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act is the culmination of years of work  by dozens of bipartisan Members and nine congressional committees to  institute reforms to protect our democracy and rebalance the  relationship between Congress and the President.    For decades, Congress has ceded many administrative and oversight  responsibilities to the executive branch. Congress is granted broad  powers in Article I of the Constitution, but over time, many of these  powers have been weakened or absorbed by the Presidency.   This has been a long and slow process with Presidents of both parties  over the past 50 years taking advantage of the broken system of checks  and balances to expand Presidential power. But it has become  increasingly clear, particularly so over the last administration, that  this problem has dangerous consequences.   To protect against abuses of Presidential power, the Protect Our  Democracy Act prevents Presidents from pardoning themselves and updates  Federal bribery laws to prevent quid pro quo pardons. The Protect Our  Democracy Act suspends the statute of limitations so that Presidents  cannot escape accountability for crimes committed before or during  their terms in office. And this act would allow Congress to enforce the  Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, preventing future Presidents  from accepting money or gifts from foreign governments or others who  seek to influence Presidential actions.   To improve transparency and accountability, this act makes a series  of necessary reforms to bolster the enforcement of congressional  subpoenas. Presidents have increasingly used a variety of legal methods  to stall or obstruct congressional investigations, and these issues  came to a head during the Trump administration where the executive  branch refused to turn over information to Congress for so long that  the administration ended before Congress could obtain that information.  Congress needs to be able to promptly and effectively conduct oversight  in order to fulfill its constitutional role as a check and balance to a  rogue administration.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act's reforms will give Congress  important legal remedies to ensure that the recipients of congressional  subpoenas actually comply with them in a timely manner. It will place  important limits on presidentially declared emergencies so that  Presidents cannot indefinitely maintain emergency powers.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act will additionally prevent the  President from illegally diverting or spending taxpayer dollars. It  will prevent Presidents from dismissing inspectors general when they  conduct investigations that disclose misconduct by an administration.                                time  1730    Importantly, the Protecting Our Democracy Act will reinforce measures  to prevent the White House from trying to interfere in Federal law  enforcement for political reasons.   Lastly, the Protecting Our Democracy Act includes policies to protect  our Federal elections from foreign interference. Since 2016, numerous  foreign governments have gone to great lengths to interfere in our  elections and manipulate American public opinion.   Building on the reforms passed by the House as part of H.R. 1, the  For the People Act, the Protecting Our Democracy Act would require  campaigns to affirmatively report any contact with a foreign government  or its agents, expressly prohibit those contacts, and strengthen  criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations of the  prohibitions.   All in all, the reforms in the Protecting Our Democracy Act will  establish essential guardrails to protect our democratic institutions  from illegal and unethical behavior by a President or his or her  administration. These reforms are long overdue, and I strongly  encourage my colleagues to support this bill when it is considered on  the floor.   However, I do want to note to my colleagues that while the Protecting  Our Democracy Act can address many of the abuses of the recent  administration, and prevent them in the future, ultimately, the  responsibility for holding the executive accountable falls to Congress.   Under our Constitution, Congress plays an equal role in the  functioning of our government. Through our powers to authorize and  appropriate funds, conduct oversight, pass laws, structure government  agencies, and grant executive authority, under Article I, the first  article of the Constitution, Congress has the ability to limit  Presidential power and punish Presidents who break the law, violate  norms, or act in ways to undermine our constitutional order. And we all  must have the courage to exercise that power.   So while it is true that Congress has ceded many of its Article I  powers, the responsibility to get them back falls entirely on us. We  cannot count on an executive, of any party, to relinquish powers that  we have given away. Whether it is war powers, emergency powers, or the  enforcement of subpoenas, ethical norms, and criminal penalties, it  falls on Congress to pass legislation to resolve these issues.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule also provides for consideration of the  fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. I applaud the work  of my House colleagues to consider and pass the NDAA in a timely  fashion, and I regret that the Senate has once again held up  congressional business.   This year's NDAA makes important and necessary improvements to our  national security policies, ensuring that the United States is able to  appropriately respond to ongoing and emerging threats.   The NDAA will provide the resources to combat aggression and malign  activity by Russia and China; it will strengthen our security relations  with important allies in Europe and Asia; and it will continue vital  modernization and acquisition programs.   The NDAA includes important policies for my district, including  funding for five Block II Chinook helicopters and nine more V-22  Ospreys, all of which are manufactured in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania.  The 4,500 men and women who build these incredible aircraft are  immensely proud that their hard work directly supports our national  security and disaster relief efforts around the world, and the fiscal  year 2022 NDAA is an investment in these amazing workers.   The NDAA also includes funding for the fifth of five National  Security Multi-Mission Vessels which are being built at the  Philadelphia shipyard, the  [[Page H6923]]  birthplace of the United States Navy. These are training ships for our  nation's maritime academies which are needed to train the next  generation of mariners as we experience growing shortages to that  workforce. This program has already created hundreds of jobs in my  district and throughout our region, and it will create hundreds more as  work continues.   These training vessels are critical to our national commerce, our  national defense, and our regional economy. This Friday, I am looking  forward to attending the keel laying ceremony for the first of these  vessels at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.   I want to highlight, as well, the important reforms that the NDAA  finally makes to the way the military handles cases of sexual assault.  Thanks to years of work by advocates and members of the House and  Senate Armed Services Committees, the NDAA will remove special victims  crimes from the chain of command and create an Office of the Special  Victim Prosecutor within each service that is independent from the  military justice system.   These reforms will ensure that allegations of sexual assault get an  independent investigation with experienced criminal justice attorneys,  allowing our servicemembers to seek justice without the pressures and  obfuscation that keep these crimes in the shadows. While I believe that  a lot more can and should be done to address sexual assault in the  Armed Forces, the FY 2022 NDAA makes much-needed progress.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, today's rule will provide a process for  expedited consideration in the Senate of legislation to raise the  Nation's debt limit. Congressional Republicans have held the country  hostage for nearly 4 months, threatening to derail our economy, and the  world's economy, as part of a fiscally irresponsible political stunt.   Again, it is incredibly irresponsible for Members of Congress to  support fiscal policies that require the Treasury to borrow and then to  prevent the Treasury from doing so. We must raise the debt limit, and  we must be responsible stewards of the full faith and credit of the  United States.   It has been said multiple times but bears repeating: Raising the debt  limit is necessary to allow the Treasury to pay the bills our country  has already incurred. It has nothing to do with the national debt. The  United States cannot default on its bills without creating a global  financial crisis and inflicting serious financial harm on our country  and its inhabitants.    It is grossly irresponsible for any Member of this Congress to  deliberately court financial disaster by nonpayment of our debts, and  particularly to do so for partisan political purposes.   I look forward to legislative action in the future to permanently  lift the debt limit and to permanently remove this political football  from the Halls of Congress. I am glad that both Chambers of Congress  have come to an agreement on the path forward to raising the debt limit  for the present so that we can end the economic anxiety caused by this  arbitrary and functionally useless budget provision.   In addition to the debt limit provision, the rule includes important  budgetary provisions to protect funding from Medicare and other  important Federal programs as our Nation continues our robust recovery  from last year's recession, and to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chair of the Committee  on Rules.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished chair of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I would just remind our colleagues we are  here today to talk about a rule to bring the Protecting Our Democracy  Act to the floor. That is a bill that would prevent criminal behavior  by Presidents, not by illegal aliens, so I would just kind of redirect  the conversation there.   We are also here to engage in the extremely important business of  passing the National Defense Authorization Act and to help the Senate,  since they are having difficulty on their own, to raise the debt limit.  That is what we are here to discuss.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would inquire how many speakers Mr. Cole  has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, As long as I have a few minutes left, I did just want to  raise an amendment I have to the Protecting Our Democracy Act, which  has been made in order. This amendment would effectuate the findings of  the Senate Judiciary Committee report titled ``Subverting Justice: How  the Former President and His Allies Pressured DOJ to Overturn the 2020  Election.''   That report made numerous recommendations, but one of them is  directly related to the Protecting Our Democracy Act. It would increase  the frequency with which reports are made of contact between the White  House and the Department of Justice in order to make sure that  protections occur against politicization of our law enforcement arm at  the behest of bad actors in the White House.   I am very, very pleased that that amendment was made in order and, as  always, very grateful to the Committee on Rules for its continuing  efforts to make amendments in order, which it has been doing at a much  higher rate this term than last.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I completely agree that protecting Medicare  from cuts is a bipartisan issue, and we are happy to engage on that.  Unfortunately, if there is a complaint about how this bill is coming up  at this time, that is something that was pushed by Republican  leadership here in the House. That is not how our leadership proposed  to do it.   If my colleagues want to have a serious conversation about the  Nation's fiscal policies, we encourage them to do the work with us to  pass a funding bill for the current fiscal year. We are now 2 months  into this fiscal year, and we still don't have a funding bill because  Senate Republicans are refusing to work with the rest of Congress to  negotiate a bipartisan appropriations bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. The  Protecting Our Democracy Act is a necessary package of policies to  address abuses of our constitutional processes that have developed over  time but accelerated under the most recent administration. It has  become clear that our government will not survive solely on the good  behavior of good people. We need statutory guardrails to ensure  compliance with norms of good behavior.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act will impose reasonable and  constitutionally sound limits on Presidential power and then create  enforceable penalties for Presidents who abuse the powers of their  office.   I am proud of my colleagues who contributed legislation to the final  bill, especially Representative Adam Schiff, who spearheaded this  important effort.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act is an important continuation of the  House's work for the people to protect our democratic institutions at  this critical moment in time. It builds off bills like H.R. 1, H.R. 4,  and the Inspector General Independence and Empowerment Act to protect  our elections and make good government reforms to ensure that our  government works for everyone and that the rule of law applies to  everyone.   As with many of these bills and others passed by the House, I  strongly urge my Senate colleagues to join us and do some legislating.  Our country is facing multiple problems, and we frankly cannot afford  continued inaction from the Senate on voting rights, the NDAA, the debt  limit, or any of the hundreds of bills passed by the House over the  past year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the rule today  and to support the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 838         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 1995) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act       with respect to aliens associated with criminal gangs, and       for other purposes. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2)       one motion to recommit.        Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1995.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
