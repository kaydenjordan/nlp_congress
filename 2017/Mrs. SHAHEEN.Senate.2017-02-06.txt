 Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  oppose the nomination of Betsy DeVos, President Trump's choice to be  Secretary of Education. I fundamentally disagree with my colleague from  Texas who said earlier that this is a fight about power and who  maintains power, whether it is going to stay in Washington or whether  it is going to be in our State and local communities.   In New Hampshire, we believe in local control of education. It is a  bedrock principle of our public education system. This fight, today, is  not about power in Washington versus power in the States; this is a  fight about whether we are going to continue to support our public  school system and our system of public higher education, or are we  going to take the money out, the support out, and divert it into  private and religious schools, and gut the public education system in  this country?   My parents were part of the ``greatest generation,'' and they raised  me in post-World War II America. They understood that the best way for  my sisters and me to have opportunities for the future was to make sure  we had a solid education. I benefited by going to great public schools  in the State of Missouri and in the State of Pennsylvania, and I was  also able to receive a quality public higher education. Without the  opportunity to attend public universities in Pennsylvania and later in  West Virginia and in the State of Mississippi, I would not have been  able to get a college education because my parents wouldn't have been  able to afford to send me to a private college or university, just like  they wouldn't have been able to afford to send me to private K-12  schools.   I am grateful for the public schools I attended and proud of the  support my parents and so many other parents have given to public  schools across America. My children and grandchildren have benefited  from the great public schools in New Hampshire.   As Governor, I was proud to work with the Republican legislature to  improve the public schools in the State of New Hampshire. We expanded  public kindergarten in our State because at the time I became Governor,  we didn't have public kindergarten for all students. We were able to  open the door for an additional 25,000 kids to go to public  kindergarten. We were able to increase funding for schools in New  Hampshire during my time as Governor. I learned during those  experiences and also as a teacher--I taught in public schools in Dover,  New Hampshire and also in Mississippi--the close connection between  quality public education and a strong, growing economy.   I taught in Mississippi in 1970. At that time, there was no  requirement for all young people to attend school. So if you didn't  want to go to school, you didn't have to. We saw the negative impact  that had on economic indicators in the State of Mississippi. Since  then, the State has adopted compulsory education for students in  Mississippi. But it was a great lesson to me to see how important good  schools are and how they contribute to a strong economy in this  country.   As Governor, when I talked to businesses in the State of New  Hampshire, one of the things they told me that they needed in order for  their businesses to succeed was a skilled workforce, young people who  had a good education, who could learn advanced skills on the job. They  looked to locate in communities where there was a strong system of  public education.   I value public schools as one of our Nation's bedrock civic and  democratic institutions because they provide the best opportunity for  kids from all walks of life to get a quality education. They pass on to  each new generation, including the children of immigrants, America's  shared ideals and values.   Regrettably, after careful study of Mrs. DeVos's record as an  activist, I have concluded that she doesn't agree with this view of our  public schools. She has no relevant experience as a teacher or as a  leader in public schools. She has never attended a public school, and  she has not sent any of her children to a public school. To the  contrary, she has spent her entire career  [[Page S704]]  and countless millions of dollars of her personal fortune working not  to improve public schools but to privatize them, to weaken them by  diverting public funds to private and religious schools. Given her past  record, it makes no sense to put Mrs. DeVos in charge of the Department  of Education unless the aim is to devalue, defund, and perhaps  eventually destroy our public schools. I think that is unacceptable.   In my State of New Hampshire, support for our public schools is  bipartisan and it is passionate. In rural communities and small towns  and our cities across the State, public schools are institutions that  have strong support within our communities. They are a big part of our  communities' identities and shared experiences. Across centuries and  generations in the Granite State, public schools have been at the heart  of our common civic life.   I think it is not surprising that my office has been inundated with  letters, emails, and phone calls strongly opposing the DeVos  nomination. My office has received more than 4,000 letters and emails  from Granite Staters. That may not seem like a lot to somebody from the  State of California, but from the State of New Hampshire, to have 4,000  letters and emails on a nomination is unheard of. And almost all of  them oppose this nomination. In addition, we have received 1,405  telephone calls in opposition and only 3 in support. I am impressed not  only by the volume of constituent messages but by the intensity of  their opposition.   Megan is a social studies teacher in New Hampshire. She writes:         Mrs. DeVos clearly lacks even a basic understanding of       Federal education policy, laws and instructional practices.       She has no relevant experience. There is just no way I would       ever be certified to instruct students in New Hampshire if I       lacked as much knowledge and experience in my field. But she       gets to be the nation's chief educator? How is this good for       kids?    Roger is a retired public school teacher from the central part of my  State, and he writes:         Please reject DeVos because she is anti-public education in       word and in practice, lacking the understanding of the public       education system and having no understanding of the dreamers       sitting in public schools this morning, creating their own       American dreams, learning of the promise and justice that is       America.    Sam from our Seacoast region writes:         It is important that we maintain a strong public school       system. This is not a partisan issue. Any person, regardless       of party, can see that Miss DeVos is unqualified to fill the       position. You need to vote ``no'' to save our education       system.    Mike from one of our university towns writes:         I am really concerned that we might have someone with so       little experience in education and with seemingly anti-public       education views as our next education leader. I fear that a       DeVos confirmation will only exacerbate the already       segregated school experiences that children have in our       country. I want all students to have a fair shake at a high-      quality school experience, not just those who live in wealthy       communities or who have parents savvy enough to advocate on       their behalf.    Many of the letters I have received are from parents who are outraged  by Mrs. DeVos's comments on the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act, which is one of the landmark civil rights laws of the 20th  century. In response to a question from my colleague, Senator Hassan,  Mrs. DeVos made it clear that she was unaware that that law was a  Federal law and that it governs all our public schools in the United  States.   IDEA ensures that children with disabilities have the opportunity to  receive a free appropriate public education and that they are  accommodated in our schools and classrooms, just like all other  children. In her testimony, Mrs. DeVos said that decisions about how to  treat students with disabilities should be left to the States. Can you  imagine? What would happen in States that decide they don't want to  make sure that those students can go to school?   I received this message from Marilyn, who lives in the western part  of New Hampshire. She says:         Thank you for opposing the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as       Education Secretary. She is a dangerous, unqualified choice.       As the parent of a daughter with Down syndrome, I fear for       the future of IDEA if DeVos is in charge.    Ashley Preston, who was the Teacher of the Year in New Hampshire in  2016, wrote this to me:         If our Secretary of Education does not understand and value       the importance of Federal laws such as IDEA, how can we       expect states and local school districts to do that? These       are the elements crucial to ensuring the best chance for our       future.    Mr. President, the Department of Education has oversight not only of  K-12 public schools but also higher education, including a portfolio of  more than $1.2 trillion in Federal student loans. I have had the  opportunity not only to teach in our K-12 schools but to work in public  universities in New Hampshire and in private universities. Listening to  Mrs. DeVos's testimony, I was appalled by her lack of understanding of  higher education policy. She acknowledged that neither she nor her  children had ever received a Federal loan or Pell grant. And this is  the worst part: When asked to commit to enforcing rules that ensure  students are not cheated and end up with no degree but a mountain of  student debt--in other words, the predicament of students who went to  Trump University and so many other for-profit colleges--she refused to  do that. She refused to say that this is something that we should  support as a policy in America.   I am also deeply concerned by her support for charter schools that  are not accountable and her reputation as ``the four-star general of  the voucher movement.'' I believe there is a role for charter schools.  I think as we try to improve our public system of higher education, we  need to look at a number of models. I voted for New Hampshire's charter  school law, but we should hold them accountable just as we hold our  public schools accountable. We should ensure that they do not drain  resources from public schools.   There was a report that came out in 2013 that was done by a working  group under the auspices of the Annenberg Institute for Social Reform.  They uncovered similar challenges across charter schools. They found  that there was uneven academic performance; that some of them had  overly harsh discipline practices; that funding sometimes destabilized  traditional schools; that there was a lack of transparency and  oversight that led to conflicts of interest and, in some cases, fraud;  and that many of them practiced policies that kept students out for  various reasons.   Mrs. DeVos was one of the architects of Michigan's first charter  school law in 1993. It has been widely criticized for lacking  accountability and safeguards for students. In her confirmation  hearing, Mrs. DeVos refused to agree that for-profit charter schools  should be held to the same standards as public schools. Just as  disturbing is her support for school vouchers, which would siphon  funding from public schools and divert it to private and religious  schools.   Advocates of vouchers like to call it school choice, but, in  practice, parents have learned that choice is not a reality. Florida,  under Governor Jeb Bush, was the first State to enact a statewide  voucher system, and nearly 93 percent of private and parochial schools  in Florida--after that law--refused to accept any voucher students.   In New Hampshire, we have parts of the State where, if we don't have  public schools, there are no other choices for our students. I don't  care whether you have a voucher or not. You can't drive 3 or 4 hours to  get to the closest private school.   So let's be clear: Vouchers and other privatization schemes advocated  by Mrs. DeVos are not about pedagogy; they are about ideology. They are  all about disdain for what many voucher advocates like to call  government schools. Well, what they call government schools are our  public schools. They are schools that our communities have created and  control locally for the education of their kids.   What Mrs. DeVos fails to understand is that quality education has  nothing do with whether a school is public or private. We have public  schools in New Hampshire that can do better, and we have public schools  that are world class. The same can be said about our private schools in  New Hampshire. But what counts in public and private schools alike are  high-quality teachers, support from parents and communities, facilities  where kids can learn and be safe, rigorous academic standards, and the  resources to make sure that children get the instruction they need,  including individualized assistance for  [[Page S705]]  kids with special needs. What counts is the political and budgetary  commitment to create high-quality schools in every neighborhood,  regardless of ZIP Code. Because Betsy DeVos does not understand these  basic truths about education in America, because she is driven by an  ideological hostility to our public schools, she is the wrong person to  serve as our Secretary of Education.   I intend to vote no on the nomination of Mrs. DeVos, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in rejecting this  unqualified nominee.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.    Mr. President, I am really pleased to be able to join  my colleague Senator Isakson from Georgia as we have introduced our  bipartisan legislation, the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act.  I think this is a welcomed piece of bipartisan legislation at this  point in the year.   I want to start by thanking the Senator from Georgia for his very  good work on this legislation. He has been leading this effort since he  first came to the Senate in 2005, and I have been fortunate enough to  partner with him on the legislation in the past two Congresses.   I think that by working together, we could pass this commonsense,  bipartisan legislation that could change the way we do business in  Washington for the better. As Senator Isakson said, there is no  question that our budget process is broken.   Since 1980, we have only finished two budgets on time. In that  timeframe, Congress has resorted to nearly 170 short-term funding bills  or continuing resolutions. We also experienced a costly and dangerous  government shutdown in October of 2013 that cost our economy $24  billion.   It hurt small businesses. It hurt the people across this country.   That is no way to govern. I understand, as Senator Isakson said, that  biennial budgeting will not fix everything, but it is a reform that  will encourage us to work across the aisle to become better stewards of  taxpayer dollars. I can attest to this personally because, as Governor  of New Hampshire, I saw how you make a biennial budget work.   In each biennium, I worked with a Republican legislature, and we put  together a balanced budget in the first year of the legislative  session. In the second year, we had the opportunity to do oversight.  That is exactly what this bill would allow us to do here in Washington.  It is a reform that has worked in New Hampshire, and it has worked in  18 other States. So as Senator Isakson said, 19 States in all have  biennial budgeting, and it really gives us a better opportunity to  review the budget to see what is working, what is effective, and what  is not.   One example that I think shows how we can do this better is looking  at several reports that have been issued by the Government  Accountability Office. They have found areas of waste, fraud, and  duplicative programs. And they have identified ways to reform things,  like our farm program, to cut down inefficiencies in defense, and to  reduce fraud in health programs. But today, Congress hasn't really  taken the time and effort to go through those recommendations. Under  biennial budgeting, we would be able to look at those kinds of  recommendations and implement savings in the second year of the budget  process.   Biennial budgeting also reduces the number of opportunities for  manufactured crises, like a government shutdown. As Senator Isakson  said, we have gotten real momentum in the last couple of years. We had  a great vote in 2013 in the Senate, where we had an overwhelming  bipartisan group endorse the concept. We saw a vote in the House Budget  Committee, where legislation on a biennial budget passed with a  bipartisan vote. It not only passed the House but had over half of the  House Members as cosponsors. And we saw a favorable hearing in the  Senate Budget Committee on the legislation, so I think momentum is  growing for this idea. It is a real way for us to take action to reform  the budget process and make it work better.   The bill that we are introducing has 13 bipartisan cosponsors. We are  going to keep working to get more bipartisan cosponsors, and I hope  that all of our colleagues will join us in this effort.   I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Isakson and with  Senators Enzi and Sanders on the Budget Committee to get this important  reform through the Senate.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I came to the floor this afternoon to  address the nominee for Attorney General of the United States, Mr.  Sessions. The U.S. Constitution provides that the Senate will advise  and consent on all nominees put forward by the President. This  fundamental check on Executive power continues to give confidence to  the public that the individuals charged with the immense  responsibilities and authorities of our Federal Government are of the  highest ethical and professional character, are highly qualified, and  are committed to exercising those powers in a manner that is consistent  with our founding principles.   Any person seeking to serve in such high positions of public trust  ought to be able to explain his or her record of personal and  professional conduct, not only to close colleagues and friends but also  to the public they seek to serve.   I have great respect for Senator Jeff Sessions for his commitment to  public service, but I don't believe that he is the right choice to  serve as our Nation's chief law enforcement officer. Time and again in  the course of his career, his actions have demonstrated disinterest or  even hostility to many of the civil rights that we rely on the Attorney  General to protect and defend, from voting rights to civil rights, to  equality for women, minorities, the LGBTQ community, and people with  disabilities.   Senator Sessions' record in the Senate provides little evidence that  his views have evolved since the last time the Senate evaluated his  fitness to serve in high Federal office, when President Reagan  nominated him to serve as a Federal judge in 1986. Three decades ago,  the Senate voted against his confirmation to serve as Federal judge.  Today, I believe the Senate should not confirm him to serve as U.S.  Attorney General.   At this time in our history, with the growing concern about this  administration's commitment to basic democratic principles, such as  equality before the law, separation of powers, freedom of the press,  and protection of minority views, I cannot support a nominee who has  failed to demonstrate appreciation for these ideals, regardless of our  personal relationship. We need an Attorney General who will fight for  justice and equal protection for all Americans, regardless of race,  gender, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.   One of my principal objections to this nominee is his record of  making it harder for certain groups of people to vote. In 2013, in  Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down section 5 of the  Voting Rights Act, also  [[Page S843]]  known as the preclearance provision. And while the overwhelming  majority of civil rights organizations considered this ruling, which  invalidated a landmark achievement of the civil rights movement--a  devastating defeat--Senator Sessions was quoted as saying that it was a  ``good thing for the South.'' He has been quoted as saying that he  views the Voting Rights Act as an intrusive piece of legislation. We  often refer to the shorthand name for this case, calling it simply  Shelby County. But I believe the full title is instructive: Shelby  County v. Holder. Holder, of course, was Attorney General Eric Holder.  And in this case, the Supreme Court ruled against the Department of  Justice and against the views of this Congress, which voted in 2006 to  extend section 5 for another 25 years.   It also demonstrated the awesome responsibility and discretion of the  Attorney General. Eric Holder was fighting to protect minorities in  States with a history of racial discrimination from future voter  suppression efforts. In contrast, as U.S. Attorney General, Jeff  Sessions prosecuted several members of the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, the great civil rights organization formerly led  by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He indicted these people for allegedly  attempting to fraudulently register people in minority communities to  vote. All of those counts were dismissed in that case. However, the  chilling effect of this type of use of government authority on our  civil society should not be underestimated. This illustrated the  awesome power of the prosecutor in our judicial system. That power is  exponentially greater in the Office of the U.S. Attorney General.   As I said, Senator Sessions is also an outspoken advocate for voter  ID laws, including at the Federal level. In State after State,  including my home State of New Hampshire, unnecessarily stringent voter  ID laws have been passed by Republicans with the clear intent to deny  access to the ballot box on the part of minorities, the young, and the  poor. Striking down the laws passed by Republicans in North Carolina, a  unanimous Federal court ruled that they ``target African Americans with  almost surgical precision''--that is a direct quote--and ``impose cures  for problems that did not exist.''   Invalidating similar laws in Wisconsin, U.S. District Court Judge  James Peterson wrote: ``The Wisconsin experience demonstrates that a  preoccupation with mostly phantom election fraud leads to real  incidents of disenfranchisement, which undermine rather than enhance  confidence in the elections, particularly in minority communities.''   President Trump has falsely claimed on numerous occasions that 3 to 5  million undocumented immigrants voted in the election in November. We  have even heard that claim in New Hampshire, where our deputy secretary  of State, a Republican, has said those claims are not accurate.   Throughout our history, these arguments, not grounded in fact and  data, have been used as a pretext for advancing new voter ID laws,  including at the national level. Yet, as Attorney General, Senator  Sessions would enthusiastically support this agenda. I believe that to  be disqualifying for any nominee to serve as Attorney General.   When I was Governor of New Hampshire, I had the honor of being able  to appoint the attorney general in our State. My qualification was that  the attorney general should be the people's attorney. I think that is  no less true of the Attorney General of the United States.   I am also deeply concerned by the nominee's record on issues  associated with women's health and autonomy. For example, as Senator  Blumenthal said so eloquently earlier this afternoon: Senator Sessions  voted against the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women  Act. This law has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis each time it  has been brought up since 1994.   The 2013 reauthorization expanded the scope of domestic violence  programs, yet Senator Sessions was one of only 22 who voted no. This is  of particular concern when we see the framework for what is suggested  will be the Trump administration's budget, which would eliminate the  Office on Violence Against Women at a time when one in five women is a  victim of rape, either completed or attempted.   Senator Sessions has also been a fierce opponent of a woman's right  to choose. He voted against a resolution supporting the Roe v. Wade  decision, which affirmed the constitutional right of women to control  our own reproductive choices. He has cosponsored legislation to  prohibit Federal funding for health insurance plans that include  coverage of abortion. He even opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act,  which removed barriers to women who bring charges of discriminatory  wage practices.   Senator Sessions voted against it in 2008 and again in 2009, when it  became law over his opposition. Senator Sessions has consistently  argued for ``color blind'' enforcement of our Nation's civil rights  laws. He contends that racism in the United States has been effectively  addressed, and, therefore, diversity programs unfairly discriminate  against White Americans.   For the same reason, he has voted against legislation to protect the  rights and safety of the LGBT community. In 2009, he vehemently opposed  the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act, which protects LGBT Americans from  hate crimes. In debate on that proposed law, Senator Sessions said:         Today I am not sure women or people with different sexual       orientations face that kind of discrimination. I just don't       see it.    Well, Senator Sessions, if you talked to the members of the gay and  lesbian community, as I have, if you would talk to women across this  country who have faced discrimination in employment practices, who have  faced discrimination before the Affordable Care Act, in terms of our  health insurance, who have faced discrimination in terms of getting  justice in cases of violence against women, you would understand that  we need to make sure that the laws protect women and minorities.   In 2013, Senator Sessions voted against a measure to prohibit  discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation or gender  identity. He also voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban  gay marriage.   Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 1 sentence?    Mr. President, I will yield to the honorable Senator  from Missouri.   Mrs. McCASKILL. Thank you so much. I yield the remainder of my  postcloture debate time to Senator Feinstein.   I thank Senator Shaheen. I apologize for interrupting.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.   The Senator from New Hampshire.    So in 2013, as I was saying, Senator Sessions voted  against a measure to prohibit discrimination in the workplace based on  sexual orientation or gender identity. And similarly, he voted in favor  of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Finally, Senator  Sessions' views on immigration are just outside the mainstream. Most  Americans want fair, humane treatment for would-be immigrants to the  United States, as well as for undocumented immigrants who are already  here.   Senator Sessions has amply demonstrated that he does not agree with  this view. Since he came to the Senate, he has been a leading opponent  of bipartisan immigration reform efforts. In 2007 and again in 2013, he  was instrumental in defeating immigration reform proposals that had  widespread support in Congress and the country.   More recently, he has been a key adviser to Candidate Trump and now  President Trump on immigration policies, encouraging extreme positions  such as a ban on Muslim immigration and harsh treatment of DREAMers,  those undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as young  children.   I have also had the opportunity to work with Senator Sessions in  trying to renew and extend the special immigrant visa program for those  Afghans and Iraqis who helped our men and women in the military as we  were fighting conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have heard from  multiple members of our military who served that these interpreters and  these people from Iraq and Afghanistan who worked with them to make  sure that they could help keep them safe have saved lives and have made  a difference in that military conflict because of the  [[Page S844]]  help they provided to our fighting men and women.   Yet Senator Sessions, as we were trying to extend that program, was  unwilling to allow us to make sure that we could bring them to the  United States, with all of the vetting that goes on to make sure that  the people who come here are actually people who helped us. He opposed  extending that program to allow all of those folks to come here.   I believe we need an Attorney General who will not only insist on  equal enforcement of the laws but who has a passion for pursuing  justice and fairness for all Americans, as well as for those who want  to visit or who want to immigrate to the United States. In my view,  Senator Sessions has failed to demonstrate that commitment.   Indeed, I worry that as Attorney General, Senator Sessions would  affirm and encourage Trump's most troubling tendencies, especially with  regard to minorities, to women, to immigrants, and to the LGBTQ  community. I believe Senator Sessions is the wrong person for the  critically important post of U.S. Attorney General. I intend to vote  against his confirmation.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, I just wanted to take a minute. I know  we have several people waiting to speak, but I wanted to respond to my  colleague from South Dakota because I think for Senator Thune to come  to the floor and castigate Democrats for holding up Judge Gorsuch, who  has just been nominated, and for suggesting we are going to filibuster,  the fact is, throughout most of last year, we saw the Republican  majority in this body hold up the nominee Merrick Garland, President  Obama's nominee.   For the first time in history, this body refused to hold a hearing on  a nominee for the Supreme Court, refused to give an up-or-down vote,  and to suggest that we should not get a fair hearing on the nominee to  the Supreme Court--Judge Gorsuch--I think is just not someone who is  going to be good for the American people.   Unlike the Republican majority, I haven't heard any Democrats saying:  We don't think that Judge Gorsuch should get a hearing or that he  should get an up-or-down vote. Everybody I have talked to agrees he  should get a hearing and an up-or-down vote.   As for the time that it is taking us to review the nominees of this  administration, the fact is, the Trump administration was delayed in  putting forward nominees. They were much later than the previous two  Presidents. We are still waiting for many of those nominees to provide  the background information that is required for those positions to have  the background checks done, to have the questions that have been put  forward to them in hearings answered. So I think we should all work  together to move these nominees. That is what I have done on the Small  Business Committee as the ranking member, and we have worked very well  because that nominee provided all the required information. She had the  FBI background check done, and we were able to hold a hearing on her.  Well, that is what we expect from every nominee.   So I am disappointed to hear my colleague come down and say that we  are not going to give Judge Gorsuch a fair hearing. I think we are  going to do that, but we are going to do it in a way that provides  information to the American people so we all know where this judge  stands and what he thinks about the role on the Supreme Court.   I think rather than name-calling, it would be more effective for us  to work together to get this done.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.    Mr. President, I just wanted to take a minute.

I know  we have several people waiting to speak, but I wanted to respond to my  colleague from South Dakota because I think for Senator Thune to come  to the floor and castigate Democrats for holding up Judge Gorsuch, who  has just been nominated, and for suggesting we are going to filibuster,  the fact is, throughout most of last year, we saw the Republican  majority in this body hold up the nominee Merrick Garland, President  Obama's nominee.   For the first time in history, this body refused to hold a hearing on  a nominee for the Supreme Court, refused to give an up-or-down vote,  and to suggest that we should not get a fair hearing on the nominee to  the Supreme Court--Judge Gorsuch--I think is just not someone who is  going to be good for the American people.   Unlike the Republican majority, I haven't heard any Democrats saying:  We don't think that Judge Gorsuch should get a hearing or that he  should get an up-or-down vote. Everybody I have talked to agrees he  should get a hearing and an up-or-down vote.   As for the time that it is taking us to review the nominees of this  administration, the fact is, the Trump administration was delayed in  putting forward nominees. They were much later than the previous two  Presidents. We are still waiting for many of those nominees to provide  the background information that is required for those positions to have  the background checks done, to have the questions that have been put  forward to them in hearings answered. So I think we should all work  together to move these nominees. That is what I have done on the Small  Business Committee as the ranking member, and we have worked very well  because that nominee provided all the required information. She had the  FBI background check done, and we were able to hold a hearing on her.  Well, that is what we expect from every nominee.   So I am disappointed to hear my colleague come down and say that we  are not going to give Judge Gorsuch a fair hearing. I think we are  going to do that, but we are going to do it in a way that provides  information to the American people so we all know where this judge  stands and what he thinks about the role on the Supreme Court.   I think rather than name-calling, it would be more effective for us  to work together to get this done.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.
