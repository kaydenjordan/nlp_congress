 Mr. President, I commend the Senate for its passage  of our bipartisan resolution, S. Res. 437, condemning anti-Semitism,  including any anti-Semitic acts committed on university or college  campuses. No one deserves to feel unsafe in their community or school  or threatened because of their religion or ethnicity. On October 16,  the FBI released their annual statistics on hate crimes, which stated  that anti-Semitic hate crimes rose 25 percent from 2021 to 2022 and  accounted for over half of all reported religiously based hate crimes.  The onset of war between Israel and Hamas has further exacerbated these  anti-Semitic threats and incidents targeting Jewish Americans and  Jewish organizations here in the United States. As a member of the  Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism, I have an  enduring and ongoing commitment to confront anti-Semitism wherever it  rears its ugly head and to ensure we take all steps necessary to  protect the Jewish community.   As we consider the best ways to counter anti-Semitism, it is  important that we consult a range of definitions and tools to  understand this problem. The White House's National Strategy to Counter  Antisemitism notes several of these tools, including the International  Holocaust Remembrance Alliance--IHRA--definition of anti-Semitism, as  well as the Nexus Document and other efforts. Moreover, as Special  Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt  made crystal clear during her confirmation hearing, ``Criticism of  Israeli policy is not antisemitism.'' Unfortunately, there are some who  are attempting to politically weaponize anti-Semitism by equating  criticism of Israeli Government actions with anti-Semitism. These  politically motivated charges only weaken good faith efforts to  confront the very real danger of anti-Semitism. That is why our  bipartisan resolution is so important during these troubling times; it  sends a clear, united message that anti-Semitism cannot be tolerated  and the fight against it should not become politicized.                            ____________________
