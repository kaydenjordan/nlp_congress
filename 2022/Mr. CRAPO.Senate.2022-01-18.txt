 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch,  Representative  Mike Simpson and Representative Russ Fulcher, I  congratulate Andy Brunelle on his remarkable career in government  service. Andy is retiring on January 31, 2022, after 27 years with the  U.S. Forest Service.   For more than 20 years, Andy has worked with our offices in his  position as the Capitol City Coordinator for the U.S. Forest Service.  In this position, he has represented both the U.S. Forest Service  Region 1 and Region 4 and the seven National Forests in Idaho as he has  served as a liaison working with State and local government officials,  Agency directors, Idaho's congressional delegation, and interest groups  in Idaho on issues of statewide concern. Given the importance of the  natural resources and species habitat on the more than 20 million acres  of Federal forested land in Idaho he has acted on behalf of, Andy has  worked on many challenging issues over the years. This includes working  closely with our delegation concerning improving and extending the  Secure Rural Schools Program, a vital resource for Idahoans. We thank  him for his thoughtful, helpful, and pragmatic work for the betterment  of our great State and country.   Andy began working for the U.S. Forest Service in 1995 after serving  as special assistant for natural resources in the Office of Idaho  Governor Cecil D. Andrus. From 1988 to 1995, he was the Governor's key  staff person on a wide variety of natural resource issues, including  challenging issues such as water quality, Federal lands management, and  protection of Snake River salmon. Additionally, he served on the  Northwest Power Planning Council, Boise City Planning and Zoning  Commission, and City of Boise advisory committees. Andy also dedicates  considerable time to serving on boards of nonprofit organizations,  including the Boise WaterShed Exhibits Environmental Education Center,  Idaho Environmental Forum, Ted Trueblood Chapter of Trout Unlimited,  and Harris Ranch Wildlife Mitigation Association.   As we wish Andy well in his well-earned retirement, we express our  deep gratitude for dedicating so much of his time and talents to  enhancing, sustaining, and conserving such an essential part of our  State's treasures. Thank you, Andy, for your decades of dedicated work  and skilled problem-solving on behalf of Idahoans, and congratulations  on your retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I congratulate Lindsay Nothern, a cherished  member of my staff who is retiring from Senate service.   In Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous poem about how to measure success, he  concludes, ``to know that even one life has breathed easier because you  have lived. This is to have succeeded.'' I am among the many who have  breathed easier because of Lindsay. He has represented me, spoken for  me, written for me, and provided outstanding counsel. He has aptly  communicated the needs of Idahoans and kept Idahoans informed about the  happenings in Congress. For example, this includes him taking a direct  interest and involvement in advocating for Idaho domestic violence  victims and Idahoans affected by Cold War era above-ground nuclear  testing, often referred to as ``downwinders.'' He has taken on each  challenge with great compassion and persistent optimism.   Prior to joining my staff, Lindsay was a journalist and worked in  news management. He also served as press secretary for former Idaho  Governor Phil Batt and campaign press secretary for Representative   Mike Simpson. Lindsay has been with me since I began my Senate service  in 1999. I am so grateful my then communications director insisted on  waiting until Lindsay was available to bring onto the staff. Lindsay  has been with me ever since, moving from press secretary to  communications director in 2011. Throughout, Lindsay has been patient,  kind, empathetic, a great listener, and a trusted adviser.   Thank you, Lindsay, for your service to this extraordinary branch of  our government, and, most importantly, your service on behalf of the  great people of Idaho. I understand you have said you have had two of  your three wish-list jobs--bartender, radio disc  [[Page S274]]  jockey, and cabdriver--and you still have one job on your list left to  do. Thank you for diverging from that list to be such a valuable part  of my staff for all these years. I hope that in your retirement, you  may reach all your dreams and more. You have certainly earned it. Thank  you for your outstanding help and guidance, and congratulations on a  very successful career.                            ____________________
