 Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment,  although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, first, I want to commend the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Meng) for offering this in the series that she is  offering. I think they are constructive amendments to this  reauthorization and important insights on what we should be doing to  recruit in the Federal workforce.   And we have a major need, though it is not in the financial services  jurisdiction, but it is really important for all of us to acknowledge  that we have a need in the Federal workforce for a wider set of views  and expertise coming into the Federal workforce. I think this is a  thoughtful attempt to do those things, so I do appreciate the  gentlewoman's efforts.  [[Page H8886]]    I would say this: The bill encompasses historically Black colleges,  women's colleges, and others, and Ex-Im will tell you that it doesn't  engage in a lot of recruitment efforts named in this legislation, not  because it doesn't care about diversity, but because it is a small  agency of around 400 staff. But I think it is important they have this  as a part of their charter.   But let me just say this: This bill and this reauthorization is  unnecessarily doomed. Chairwoman Waters and I negotiated a bipartisan  deal, a bill that is in the Clerk's office called H.R. 3407, which  would have reauthorized this institution for a 7-year term, increased  its size, and focused on really important things that relate to our  national security and our economic security, including combating the  rise of Chinese aggression.   And that bill is still an opportunity for bipartisanship. What we  have before us today is not. So, while I appreciate the gentlewoman's  efforts on this amendment, this bill is not going anywhere in the  Senate. The President said he is going to veto it. Because of those  things, this bill is unnecessarily doomed.   This reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank is unnecessarily put in  jeopardy because of the approach taken here in the House, and that is  unfortunate. I hope that cooler heads will prevail, and we will be able  to extend and keep the bank open, the institution open, for a longer  term. I think that will happen in the appropriations process or in the  continuing resolution, and I would support those measures.   But the bill before us today Republicans will largely oppose. So, Mr.  Chair, I would encourage my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, though I am not  opposed.    Mr. Chairman, let me say, to begin with, that, again,  Republicans and the Financial Services Committee unanimously supported  the agreement that Chairwoman Waters and I reached on a bipartisan bill  that would strengthen the Bank and combat Chinese aggression, both  their economic and military aggression, around the globe. It forced the  Ex-Im Bank to not subsidize Chinese state-owned enterprises that are  engaged in especially the service to the military and intelligence  bureaus or the repression of the people in Hong Kong or religious  minorities. That is the focus of it.   Rather than focus on those important economic interests for us as  Americans, we are getting into a number of issues of social policy.  That was the main set of policy changes that we have before us in this  partisan bill that we are debating, that the Senate majority leader  already says they won't take up, and the President already said he is  going to veto.   At the end of the day, we are going to have a clean reauthorization  of the Bank. It could have been different. We could have had a  different outcome.   I commend Mr. Brown for offering the amendment. Look, diversity and  inclusion, we have a subcommittee. It has been a priority of Chairwoman  Waters, and we have heard testimony in that committee from witnesses  emphasizing the need to change the corporate culture to improve  recruitment and retention of women and minorities, not for just the  social purpose of recruiting more diverse people, but for the economic  outcome that a better workforce, a more diverse workforce, both  experientially and every type of measure of diversity, leads to better  economic returns for the shareholders of those companies.   I think it is really important, what the gentleman is emphasizing  with his amendment. It has an important social purpose. It does. But it  also has an important economic outcome. It means that we get better  policies as a result of better workforce and better inclusion processes  for recruiting new folks and also, once you have folks internally, how  we work with each other.   Quite frankly, the Congress could use, I think, a little bit of this,  a little bit of the medicine we are giving to agencies.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, let me say this. Chairwoman Waters and I  negotiated a bipartisan deal, and it was a priority for me to ensure  that this agency of government didn't discriminate against different  energy sources--high priority for Republicans and some Democrats.   Coal country was at risk in these negotiations because there is an  extreme element of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who  want to limit our capacity to export American technology that uses  coal, which is far cleaner than what is being used around the globe,  and limit the export of our natural resources that power our economy.  So I am grateful that the partisan bill before us did not go to that  [[Page H8889]]  very far left position that would have limited our coal technology from  being used to export.   So my colleague, Mr. Lamb, represents a significant piece of historic  coal country. It makes it easier for someone like him who represents  the interests of his district in that regard to vote for this bill  because they didn't include those extreme measures that would have  limited and particularly hurt coal country and the technology developed  here in the United States on the use of fossil fuels. So that is a  laudatory thing.   Now, there are minor measures in here that have sort of minor  discriminatory effects against the use of nuclear power and the  measurement of carbon, but not to the extent that I feared in this  bill. So I am grateful that what is before us isn't the most extreme.  It is just merely not helpful to the export of certain American  technologies and energy.   I am grateful that Chairwoman Waters didn't decide to go to that far  left element that would have gone to the extreme of saying we are not  going to export, specifically, coal technology using the Export-Import  Bank. That limitation is not in here, and so I am grateful for that.   So we have an amendment before us that Mr. Burgess of Texas offered  to say that, in particular, nuclear technology would be a helpful thing  and an emphasis for the Export-Import Bank. My colleagues on the other  side of the aisle voted against that by voice vote, and then they asked  for a rollcall vote. I anticipate that they will have a negative vote  on their side on this, but it shows that Republicans are interested in  the diverse array of energy sources and making sure that we don't  discriminate against our American technology being exported that is  useful globally.    So this amendment is fine. I think it is important that we do measure  jobs and impact, specifically, on energy jobs. In the bipartisan bill  that Chairwoman Waters and I negotiated, I pushed hard for a similar  provision, where the Bank would need to provide job creation  information to Congress. That was stripped out. It is not before us  today.   So what the gentleman is offering is constructive. It is good. It  should have a bipartisan vote. I thank the gentleman for offering this,  for having the view and the eye of his constituents in mind,  specifically when it comes to energy production.   I know that western Pennsylvania still has this great, strong,  vibrant energy production capacity; and so I am grateful that my  colleague would offer something that not only helps his district, but  also helps American job creation and ensures the Bank measures that job  creation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   If I may begin by commending the Speaker, Speaker Pelosi. You won't  hear this often, and probably won't hear it often from her, that she  agrees with me nor I with her; but when it comes to China, we see it  very similarly.   Her track record is, indeed, long and it is, indeed, strong when it  comes to human rights abuses, in particular around religious minorities  in China. But, also, she has spoken out consistently in her term of  service here in Congress against Chinese abuses.                                time  1000    I think we should have a bipartisan understanding. Sadly, when she  says that the earlier fight that she had with China was hijacked by  corporate America, sadly, the language that Chairwoman Waters and I  attempted to pass out of committee in good faith was hijacked by  corporate America, because they don't want to see any limitation on  their capacity to get subsidization from Ex-Im to export.   So I hope that we can come back together after this bill doesn't go  anywhere in the Senate, and we can come back together on strong enough  language so that we can do something proactive and together when it  comes to China.   Small businesses, indeed, need more emphasis from the Ex-Im Bank, and  that is why I am saddened that it takes 10 years for this bill to  actually raise the small business mandate and tell Ex-Im to prioritize  small businesses.   So, again, it is a special moment when, I think, we have folks on the  left and the right together on an important economic issue like China.  That is why the underlying bill that we negotiated was really  important, and this is a bad bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I think it is important that we promote these  policies. Again, what Chairwoman Waters and I negotiated in H.R. 3407,  which was a bipartisan product to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank,  prioritized economic policy and national security policy. It  prioritized innovative technologies, especially when it comes to energy  development, and it put limitations on Ex-Im Bank subsidizing Chinese  foreign policy and economic policy.   So additional social legislating is fine. This is a social  legislating reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. That is the  emphasis Chairwoman Waters chose. The Democrats chose to bring a bill  that prioritized social policy over economic policy, so this is  probably a fine addition to it.   But if we are going to talk about diversity and ensuring diversity in  the workforce of the Export-Import Bank, shouldn't we also be talking  about protection of religious minorities and making sure that we are  not subsidizing products that are used to repress people in Hong Kong  or religious minorities in China? That is what current Ex-Im policy  permits.   There are examples of this. We have strategic competitors, we have  companies that have significant abuses, and yet we are still doing  business with them through the Export-Import Bank. I think that is bad  policy.   We need to look no further than Hong Kong or the Uighurs in China to  see the Chinese true intent here.   I wish there was the same vigor from social policy applied by my  Democratic colleagues applied to thwarting the ever-expanding Chinese  Communist Party's actions through their state-owned enterprises.   So, Mr. Chair, it is a fine amendment, we should agree to it. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, Republicans unanimously voted for a  bipartisan agreement that Chairwoman Waters and I negotiated in the  Financial Services Committee. I just want to reiterate that.   The focus there was combating Chinese aggression, it was focused on  economic policy. There were a number of bipartisan tradeoffs in order  to ensure that the Bank was focused on economic policy, not mainly on  social policy, but what we have before us is mainly a social policy- related reauthorization of this important economic institution.   I think it is important that all businesses be considered and have  significant small business outreach by the agency. This is a  significant addition to it, and I think it is worthy of support.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Unfortunately, what we have before us is really a sideshow and a  waste of time while the impeachment hearings are going on. It is quite  a filler for the House floor for a bill that won't make it into law.   So here we go. We have wasted a significant week here on the House  floor with something that is not going to actually end up anywhere.   So there we go. The amendment is fine to support, but let's just get  this thing over with.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am  not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, we did have a bipartisan bill that we  negotiated. That is not before us today. That bill would have combated  Chinese aggression.   What we have before us is a partisan bill, and the partisan bill is  focused more on social policy than economic policy. It doesn't link up  our American foreign policy and economic interest with the charter of  this institution, so it is a huge, missed opportunity.   This amendment would take a good step in promoting accountability for  the effects of projects financed by the Bank. I appreciate the  gentleman's interest in helping communities and ensuring the Bank has  that focus. We welcome this transparency and accountability.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, going back to the bill that Chairwoman Waters  and I negotiated that we filed as H.R. 3407, we took on some of these  tough issues about human rights abuses and did it in an aggressive way,  especially when it pertains to China.   The amendment here is fine. It actually will have zero effect,  though, because, if you are a sanctioned entity, American businesses  are prohibited from doing business with you. So what this says is not  only are you prohibited from doing the business, you also can't get  financing for the business you are not permitted to do.   Okay. That is fine. You can put it in the bill or you cannot put it  in the bill. Ex-Im will not finance a business that is prohibited under  law.   So now the gentlewoman is saying they are prohibited under law from  getting financing. Okay. That is good.   Again, it is a nice cover for what was gutted out of the bill that  Chairwoman Waters and I negotiated, which actually did tough things. In  that legislation, Republicans sought to restrict Ex-Im assistance for  entities involved in sanctionable human rights abuses, including human  trafficking and sex trafficking.   It goes beyond this amendment. Rather than support those provisions,  Democrats decided to allow this amendment, which is simply a watered- down version of that provision that Republicans supported in committee.   It will do nothing. It will do nothing in fact; it will do nothing in  law. And so this is much more about political cover, and I will tell  you how I will know.   I am not going to ask for a rollcall vote on this, but I would  suspect my Democrat colleagues will ask for a rollcall vote on this  amendment so it gives them political cover rather than actually do  something of substance.   Tens of millions of individuals, worldwide, are victims of human  trafficking. It is a tragedy. It is awful. This amendment will not have  any effect on stopping human trafficking and human rights abuses, and,  in fact, it merely restates existing law rather than striking  meaningful steps toward ending these horrific practices. So that is  fine.   I commend my colleague for offering this. It gives a number of their  colleagues who wish to have a watered-down bill before us, it gives  them political cover, but it is simply a restatement of existing law.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As we close this debate, and this is the last amendment before us, I  do want to reiterate that I am grateful to Chairwoman Waters. Again, I  want to thank the gentlewoman for ignoring the requests from the  extreme left of her own party and their demands for having the Bank ban  coal technology exports.   There are some minor environmental provisions in here that have a  negative impact on American industries and their ability to sell  overseas, but I am grateful that she ignored the request from members  of her party on the extreme left and their demands to tell the Bank to  stop funding coal and only fund clean energy projects; so the Bank will  continue to be able to fund coal and cleaner coal technology exports in  adherence with the environmental standards of the regime they are  sending.   It could have been absolutely devastating in terms of the  consequences on energy production, but they simply chose to do minor  things. I think that is a laudatory thing that deserves some bipartisan  praise that the extreme left did not win the day in terms of that piece  of policy in this bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on final passage of  this bill. We will have an extension of the Bank. We will continue to  use Export-Import financing for perhaps up to 2 percent of our exports.  That will be a helpful thing.   But what we need to do is focus, also, on combating the rise of  Chinese aggression economically, and I think we have that capacity.  This is not the way to do it. This bill is going nowhere in the Senate.  The President has already said that he will veto it.   So let's get on with the business of the American people, and let's  get back to sensible policy discussions here.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment--though it  will have no impact whatsoever; it is a restatement of existing law; it  is fine, but it doesn't actually have real teeth to it--and vote ``no''  on the final passage of this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
