 Mr. President, I pay tribute to Mike Quickel, the U.S.  Senate Finance Committee's policy director, who is leaving Congress  after more than 25 years of devoted service.   One of the things that eases our jobs in the Senate is knowing we  have solid people working steadily and earnestly beside us on behalf of  the great people we represent. Idaho and our country have had that for  decades with Mike Quickel. Since 2000, when he came to work in my  office, after working more than a year as staff assistant for the U.S.  House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations, he has consistently supported Idahoans  and the important work we do here in the Senate on behalf of the  American people.   After little more than a year of serving as a legislative  correspondent, Mike was quickly promoted to serve as my tax and budget  adviser, and he has generally served in this capacity through multiple  positions since. As senior policy adviser, he staffed my positions on  the Senate Finance and Budget Committees. His responsibilities included  developing well-defined strategies for various tax legislative efforts.  He also helped lead the bipartisan Senate Finance Committee Task Force  on Savings and Investment. The task force crafted retirement savings  proposals that were later enacted into law as part of the SECURE Act in  2019. Every American worker should have the opportunity to save for a  secure retirement, and Mike's work on this legislation has helped make  it easier for Americans to do so.   His steadiness, dependability, and strong grasp of policy and its  practical effects also saw him tasked with critical, but under the  radar, responsibilities like editing constituent response letters. I  always have known I can count on him for the small and big tasks at  hand. He proved this when he helped develop fiscal reform and debt  reduction proposals when I served on the bipartisan Simpson/Bowles  Commission in 2010. I cannot mention that commission without also  noting that our country would now be on better fiscal footing if  Congress had fully enacted the fiscal reforms Mike worked on more than  a decade ago.   But, back on point, when I began leading the Senate Committee on  Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs as ranking member and chairman, Mike  came with me and served as policy director for the committee. During  this time, he worked tirelessly on drafting and negotiating the  historic enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, TCJA. This law,  which is probably the achievement he is most proud of during his time  in the Senate, lowered tax rates for all Americans, ensured American  job-creators could better compete and bring jobs back to our country  and led to the strongest economy in many of our lifetimes prior to the  pandemic.   He also successfully led bipartisan efforts to reauthorize the  Export-Import Bank in 2019, as well as Senate confirmation of its  chairman and board members. The Export-Import Bank had operated without  congressional authorization and a Senate-confirmed chairman for several  years, and Mike was instrumental in fixing this lapse. Additionally, he  supported the successful bipartisan enactment in 2018 of the Economic  Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. This law has  enabled financial institutions to better serve their customers and  communities, while maintaining safety and soundness and important  consumer protections.   When I became ranking member of Senate Finance in 2021, I once again  asked Mike to come with me and serve as policy director for the  committee. Throughout this time, he has continued to dependably and  professionally contribute to consequential legislation and policy  initiatives, including his work to strengthen retirement security  through the enactment of the SECURE 2.0 law in December 2022. This law  expanded opportunities for Americans to increase their retirement  savings and improve workers' long-term financial well-being. He has  also been instrumental in successfully protecting the TCJA from  attempts to undo its tax reform benefits.   In addition to his policy expertise and keen knowledge of the Senate,  Mike has helped and supported others. He has mentored countless young  staffers and even set up annual Thanksgiving dinners for staff, many of  whom were far away from home during the holidays. He is known as being  loyal to everyone he has worked with over the years.   Mike has been a steady, unassuming, and strong influence in the  Senate. He is quiet but thorough. When I think of Mike, I think of  God's instruction in the Bible verse James 1:19-20. He is truly quick  to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger. He listens carefully  before framing the task or problem to fix that is weighed against his  significant experience, knowledge, and know-how. He listens and reasons  first and then acts prudently and never impulsively. This has been  invaluable, as he has helped shape tax, retirement and economic policy  that has had far-reaching benefits for our country. It will take a  great deal of time to get used to not having Mike as a central part of  my staff, but I wish him all the best. He has more than earned more  time with his lovely family--wife Meg and son Davey--that I am hopeful  his departure from Washington, DC, will afford him.   Thank you, Mike, for your 25 years of dedicated, sound, and measured  service to our country.                            ____________________
