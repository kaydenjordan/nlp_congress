 Madam President, first let me say, after listening to  my colleague from Texas, if half of what he said I thought was  accurate, I would not be supporting Judge Jackson. Fortunately, it is  not. So I rise today to urge the Senate to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson to the United States Supreme Court. I am so excited about her  nomination.   Her nomination, we know, is historic--not just because Judge Jackson  is eminently qualified for the position. Both Democrats and Republicans  agree. In fact, based on her broad range of experience, you could argue  she is more qualified to serve on the Supreme Court than any sitting  judge. It is not just historic because of the dignified and honorable  way she has conducted herself during this entire nomination process. If  you think your last job  [[Page S1999]]  interview was rough, take a look at hers. Judge Jackson showed  incredible grace during more than 20 hours of questioning that at times  was incredibly hostile and rude. I would challenge any Member of this  Chamber to endure that level of pressure without cracking. I am quite  certain I couldn't do it. She is eminently qualified, and we have seen  her judicial temperament up close.   What really makes Judge Jackson's nomination historic is this number:  115. One hundred and fifteen. That is how many U.S. Supreme Court  Justices have served in our Nation's entire history--115. Out of those  115 Justices, 108 have been White males. Just think about it for a  moment. In other words, nearly 94 percent of the Supreme Court Justices  in our Nation's history have been White men. That is a very exclusive  club.   And like many very exclusive clubs, it has tended to leave a lot of  folks out in the cold. In a country as magnificently diverse as ours,  that is simply not right, and I am so grateful that President Biden  understands this.   The decisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court touch every single  American. What does the right to vote truly mean under our  Constitution? Freedom of religion; our freedom of speech. How are we as  consumers or workers treated under our Constitution? Can a public  school district force White students to attend one school while sending  Black students to another? Can that same public school district refuse  to educate students with disabilities? Can a couple be prevented from  marrying and spending the rest of their lives caring for one another  because they happen to be gay? And can a State override a woman's right  to privacy and force her to continue a pregnancy that puts her own  health and future at risk?   These are some of the types of decisions made by the U.S. Supreme  Court every day. And when the Supreme Court doesn't look like America,  it means that its decisions are less likely to take into account the  lives and the needs of all Americans.   The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a straightforward answer  when she was asked how many women should serve on the U.S. Supreme  Court. How many was enough? ``Nine,'' she would say.   Well, we are not quite there yet--but four? I would say that is a  pretty good start. And a Black woman Justice? It is about time. It is  past time.   You may have seen a wonderful photo making the rounds. It is of Judge  Jackson's 17-year-old daughter Leila. It was from the first day of the  nomination hearing. Leila is wearing a beautiful lavender suit and  sitting behind her mom.   The expression on her face is absolutely priceless. She is looking at  her mom with such admiration and pride.   Well, Leila isn't alone. Millions of young Black girls and their moms  and their grandmas are looking at Judge Jackson with that same pride  and admiration. They have never had someone who looks like them serving  on our Nation's highest Court.   And how many of these young girls will see this incredibly  accomplished woman and think, ``Hey, that could be me''? I hope they  all do.   I will be honored to support Judge Jackson's confirmation. I am  excited. I am proud of her. And I urge my colleagues to do the same. It  is past time.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 13 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
