 Madam Speaker, in 2016, in Hoboken, New Jersey, my  district, a New Jersey Transit commuter train ran past the end of the  track and into the terminal, killing a young mother and injuring over  100 passengers and crew members.   In the wake of this tragedy, it was made public that the Federal  Railroad Administration had been conducting a deep audit on New Jersey  Transit for months, prompted by an increase in safety violations. At  that time, the safety review was not known to relevant Members of  Congress or the public who relied on New Jersey Transit to take them to  work and bring them home safely every day.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 543 is a simple, straightforward piece of  legislation. When the FRA begins a safety assessment on an intercity or  commuter passenger rail system, it must notify Members of Congress and  Senators on committees of jurisdiction or representing the State in  which the assessment is conducted. The FRA will have 10 business days  after the assessment begins to notify these parties.   The FRA will also need to transmit its findings, including any safety  recommendations, to the relevant parties within 90 days of completion  of the assessment.   Madam Speaker, this bill brings us one step closer to ensuring full  transparency for Federal agencies and helps us ensure that our rail  transportation infrastructure is safe.
