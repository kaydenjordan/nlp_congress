 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor with somber news for  Colorado and our country. It is about a gentleman I have talked about  many times on this floor and across Colorado--Donald Stratton, a  veteran of World War II, who was on the USS Arizona on December 7,  1941. Our country has suffered a great loss this past week with Mr.  Stratton's passing.   A gallant man, Donald Stratton served his country, his family, and  our great State with honor, pride, and courage. He was the type of  person who only comes around once in a generation and was someone whom  I was lucky to have gotten to know and certainly proud to have worked  with. It is with great emotion that I come to the floor to share his  story once again. I am sure it will not be the last time, but it is  certainly the most personal time that I have ever shared this story.   Donald Stratton was born in a tiny town in Nebraska--Red Cloud--in  1922. Its population today is of 900 or so people. I didn't have a  chance to look up how big it was when he was born in 1922. I imagine it  may have been a little bit bigger. It has certainly faced the fate that  many rural communities in America have. It has seen times of growth and  times of loss. Certainly, the people of Red Cloud know they have lost a  great hero as well.   Donald Stratton wrote in his memoirs on December 6, 1941, as a young  Nebraskan sailor, that he felt like the luckiest boy from Red Cloud  because he was in an incredibly beautiful part of the world. In fact,  he wrote in his memoir that he was in the Navy, seeing the world, and  was stationed in one of the most beautiful parts of the world. He was  19, and his entire life stretched before him. That next morning,  December 7, 1941, would change forever Donald Stratton and his country.   In his book, he talked about that day, December 7, 1941. A little  after 5 a.m., he had awoken, on his cot, about an hour and a half  before sunrise.   He writes:         I stretched, rubbed the sleep from my eyes, and folded up       my cot. I stored it in the incinerator room, then went below       to shower. After, I dressed for the day in the typical casual       clothes that sailors wore on Sundays--a clean pair of       pressed, white shorts and a white T-shirt, along with my       sailor's hat.    A few minutes later, a 5:30 reveille sounded over the intercom, and  the ship stirred to life, he talked about. Below decks, men tumbled out  of their hammocks and headed to the showers. A few hours later, at 7:55  that morning, after a Sunday morning breakfast, he heard airplanes and  bombs in the distance as the attacks on Pearl Harbor began. By 8:06--11  minutes later--two-thirds of his body would be engulfed in flames.   He was at his station, directing anti-aircraft guns, and trying his  best to fight off the surprise attack by the Japanese. At that moment,  a 1,700-pound armor-piercing bomb was dropped from 10,000 feet above  the USS Arizona. That bomb came crashing down through four steel decks,  where it reached the ammunition magazine, causing a series of  explosions and shooting a fireball 500 to 600 feet in the air,  engulfing Donald Stratton and his shipmates in even more flames.   That Sunday morning of December 7, aboard the USS Arizona, were 1,512  officers, sailors, and marines. The attack that day--that 1,700-pound  bomb and so many others--killed 1,177. Only 335 brave people survived  that morning. Donald Stratton was one of those 335 sailors. His story  of survival happened because of a sailor who was stationed next to the  USS Arizona on a ship called the Vestal. He was a sailor by the name of  Joe George.  [[Page S1230]]    On that morning, as they were trying to fight back, they had been  trapped in their tower. Donald Stratton and five of his other shipmates  were burning--trapped on that tower--as the ship was going down. Joe  George, a sailor aboard the Vestal, saw them and saw what was  happening. He tried many times to throw a rope over to the USS Arizona  to provide help. Finally, he succeeded. Out of the smoke and out of the  flames, a lifeline from Joe George to that tower was seen, and they  were able to affix it to the tower. Miraculously, Donald Stratton and  these other sailors were able to shimmy across the rope, over the  burning water, to safety on the Vestal. Despite their terrible wounds,  they made it to the Vestal.   This story led to an incredible fight again by Donald Stratton. After  he spent a year recovering from the burns that were over almost all of  his body, he told his parents that he couldn't just abandon the fight,  that he couldn't abandon his country, that he had to go back to duty.  With that, he went back into service for his country. But the fight  Donald Stratton gave for this country and for his fellow sailors didn't  stop there. After he served in the Navy, after he left it, he knew he  had to spend the rest of his life fighting for the man who saved his  life and his fellow shipmates.   It wasn't like people left the ship at the end of the day on December  7 to go back to the office and fill out reports and say: Well, it was a  busy day at the office. These things happen.   America was at war. Thousands of lives had been lost. In the fire, in  the smoke, and in the fight, what Joe George had done for Donald  Stratton and those other brave sailors was lost for that time. Donald  Stratton went back into service. He went back into the fight. He spent  the rest of his life trying to find the man who saved his life. He  spent a decade-plus looking for Joe George, finding out who he was.  After he found out who he was, he spent 16 years fighting the Navy so  that Joe George would be recognized for his heroic actions.   Donald Stratton went to the Arizona Legislature, and he went to the  Colorado Legislature. They passed resolutions asking that Joe George be  recognized for his acts of bravery and his courage.   He then came to this Congress. Lauren Bruner, Donald Stratton, and  the other members who survived the USS Arizona--the remaining few of  the USS Arizona--came to the Senate and said: As fewer and fewer of us  are able to celebrate and to commemorate December 7 each and every  year, would you please celebrate one more life--Joe George's? On  December 7, 2017, the Navy recognized Joe George with the Bronze Star  and the ``V'' for valor device.   I have a picture of Donald Stratton as he said goodbye one more time  to his fellow shipmates on December 7, 2017. He thanked Joe George for  saving his life and probably never fully understood why his mission  didn't end that day while so many others' missions did, but thank God  he was able to continue the fight for this country.   While Donald Stratton was on the brink of death, he knew he had to  get back into the fight, and he did. He went back into the Pacific  theater.   He wrote in his book:         Though I may have left Pearl Harbor on a stretcher, I had       returned on a destroyer. I had recovered my strength, as had       my country. I was ready to meet what was coming, and I had a       boatload of reinforcements with me.    Donald Stratton came back, fighting for our country and fighting for  the man who saved his life.   He wrote in his memoir that, in life, the only question that matters  is ``Have I lived a good life?'' He wrote that he wonders if he will be  remembered when he is gone. He wonders who will remember him and why.   Please know that we will remember you eternally and your family for  what you have done for this country.   I introduce a resolution to recognize and remember Donald Stratton's  life because there are only a few remaining brave men and women who  survived that day, who survived that war, who fought for us so many  years ago. I hope all of my colleagues will support it so that this  American hero and his incredible life can be remembered by our Nation  forever.   The first time I met Donald Stratton, he told me his story. He told  me what he had done. He told me how he and his wife had met and how he  had gone back into the fight after receiving such severe burns that his  wife used to take a bristle brush to them to help his skin feel better.   I asked how he did it and said: Mr. Stratton, I am pretty sure I  never could have done what you did.   In his kind of ``ah, shucks'' demeanor from Red Cloud, NE, he said:  ``Well, Cory, everyone has to be somewhere.''   It was not the response I thought I was going to get, but everybody  does have to be somewhere. Thank God Donald Stratton was on that boat  on December 7, 1941. Thank God Joe George was on that boat on December  7, 1941. Thank God that rope was thrown over to the tower to save his  life. Thank God Donald Stratton returned to the fight to stand up for  this country, to continue his fight for Joe George, and to have an  incredible family who continues to share in his legacy today.   Thank God for all of them. Thank God for all of the men and women who  were there that day and what they have been able to do to fight for  this country, to stand for this country, to pay back the blessings of  this country as we must fight each and every day to pay back the  blessings they so generously bestowed upon this Nation when they stood  up, because they were there.   We know that Donald Stratton has joined his fellow shipmates. That  reveille at the Pearly Gates must be quite spectacular. He passed away  at his home in Colorado Springs on February 15, at the age of 97, next  to his beloved wife. He joins Lauren Bruner, another survivor of that  morning on the USS Arizona, who came to my office to fight with him for  Joe George--Bruner, a shipmate who passed away on September 10 of last  year and who was interred in the USS Arizona this past December 7 on  the 78th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. I pray that they all  rest in peace as they join their family in arms.   This Saturday, the community of Colorado Springs and our State will  hold a memorial service for Donald Stratton when he will be lain in his  final resting place next to his daughters in Nebraska. As we say  goodbye to this hero, let us all do it with thanks to Donald Stratton  and to the two remaining survivors of the USS Arizona today, Lou Conter  and Ken Potts.   To every brave man and woman who serves our country, we are eternally  grateful.   I am going to miss him.                            ____________________
