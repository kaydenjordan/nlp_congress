 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 45, which was  received from the House.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the  concurrent resolution be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate will consider  another batch of well-qualified nominees. These are men and women who  have chosen to serve the American people in a variety of ways  throughout the Federal Government, and we owe it to them to get them  off the Senate calendar and on the job.   Among the nominees we are considering this week is Susan Combs, who,  as the Presiding Officer knows, is a fellow Texan who has been  nominated to serve as the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management  and Budget at the Department of the Interior. Susan has led an  impressive career in both the public and private sectors and has served  our State as a member of the Texas House of Representatives, then as  the first female agriculture commissioner, and, later, as the Texas  comptroller of public accounts.   In each job, she gained the respect of virtually everyone she worked  with. So, for those who know Susan, her nomination has come as no  surprise. What is surprising, though, is how long it has taken her to  reach this point and be confirmed. She was nominated in July of 2017.  Within 1 month, she testified before the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources, and she received unanimous support. Suffice it to  say, her nomination was not controversial. So why has it taken 2 years  for her to get a vote on the Senate floor?  [[Page S3180]]    Unfortunately, our colleagues across the aisle have pulled every  trick in the book to slow down the nominations process, not because  they have objected to a particular nominee or because a nominee has  been unqualified, but because it has been part of a broader effort to  stymie the President and this administration and bring the work of this  body to a crawl.   With each day that has passed since the President has been  inaugurated, the growing backlog of nominations has allowed hundreds of  important positions throughout the Federal Government to have remained  vacant. That is not fair to the people who have been nominated; that is  not fair to the administration; and it is particularly not fair to the  American people, whom these individuals are to serve.   A couple of months ago, we passed a modest rules change that broke  the logjam, at least to some extent, and allowed us to finally begin to  make some much needed progress. In the, roughly, 3 months prior to the  rules change, we were able to confirm only 23 nominees. In the,  roughly, 2 months since, we have more than doubled that number. We have  begun to fill dozens of positions, including those of Federal judges,  ambassadorships, and sub-Cabinet officials at various Departments and  Agencies. Two weeks ago, we confirmed the 41st circuit court judge  since President Trump took office, and we are making progress on  filling more judicial vacancies.   As we approach the 2-year anniversary of Susan Combs' nomination  having been sent to the Senate, I am glad we can finally vote on her  confirmation and continue our work to confirm well-qualified nominees.
