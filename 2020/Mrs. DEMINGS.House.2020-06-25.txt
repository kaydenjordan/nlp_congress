 Madam Speaker, I joined the police department in 1984.  Few words can describe the feeling that I had when I took my oath to  protect and serve. I took it to heart.   We all know the majority of police officers do the job well every  day. But today is about those who don't, those who should have never  been hired, or those who have forgotten their oaths of office.                                time  1515    Police misconduct has resulted in the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna  Taylor, and Rayshard Brooks--people who should be alive today.   As Members of Congress, our primary responsibility is the health,  safety, and well-being of the American people. We have made progress.  We have come a long way, but we still have a ways to go. Good police  officers want us to get there. They need us to help them improve the  profession that they love.   As a former police officer and a police chief, I am supporting the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Passing this bill will change  much. I ask my colleagues to vote for it and pass this legislation.
