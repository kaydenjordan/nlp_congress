 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr.  Robert ``Bob'' Billingslea of Orlando, who passed away on Friday,  September 1.   Dr. Billingslea was the founding executive of Walt Disney's Corporate  Urban Affairs and Development department, and served as its vice  president until his retirement in 2012. In this position, he led the  company's minority outreach efforts, and was a firm believer that  diversity drives growth, creativity, and innovation.   Bob's unwavering commitment was evident by his service. He served on  numerous organizations and boards, including Historically Black  Colleges and Universities, Boys and Girls Clubs, and founded the  Orlando Urban League, to name a few.   When Bob walked into a room, people noticed; and when Bob spoke,  people listened. Bob Billingslea was smart, impactful, and  unforgettable. He made a difference.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing time for this tribute as we  celebrate the life of Dr. Bob Billingslea.                            ____________________
