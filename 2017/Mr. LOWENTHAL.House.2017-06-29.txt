 Mr. Speaker, the Senate version was supposed to be the  one, according to the President, with heart. There is no heart in this  bill.   Sixty percent of my constituents live in Los Angeles County which, in  total, has about 5 percent--one county in the country has about 5  percent--of this country's Medicaid recipients. The proposed Senate  bill cuts to Medicaid would put more than a quarter of those currently  receiving Medicaid assistance in L.A. County, nearly 900,000 people, at  risk for losing health insurance.   This is not a healthcare bill. This is a tax cut for the wealthy,  dressed up to look like serious legislation. The rich get richer, while  everyone else is left to get poorer and sicker.   This is not who we are as Americans.                            ____________________
