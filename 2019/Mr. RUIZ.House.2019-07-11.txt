 Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendments to protect  our servicemembers from toxic smoke exposure and move us closer to  ending the use of burn pits.   Burn pits are large fields where the military burns waste, including  batteries, jet fuels, and medical waste, causing our men and women in  uniform to inhale toxic chemicals, carcinogens, and particulate matter.  These hazardous materials have been linked to life-threatening cancers,  lung diseases, and rare illnesses.   Exposure to burn pits took the life of Jennifer Kepner, a veteran and  mother of two from Cathedral City in my district, who lost her life to  pancreatic cancer that her doctor believed was most probably caused by  her exposure to burn pits.   Jennifer's story has become all too common. As a physician and a  public health expert, I know that, when there is a high enough  suspicion of harm that causes a severe enough illness, we must act.   As the co-chairman of the bipartisan Burn Pits Caucus, I am working  to end the use of burn pits, educate doctors and veterans about their  health effects, get exposed veterans the healthcare and benefits that  they have earned and need and deserve, and do more research on the  health effects of burn pit exposure.   Madam Chair, my amendments will require the Department of Defense to  conduct an implementation plan to end the use of nine active burn pits  continuing to threaten the health of our servicemembers stationed  overseas.   In addition, my amendments will require DOD to provide a list of all  locations where open-air burn pits have been used and report to  Congress on its research assessing their health effects.   Finally, my amendments require the Department of Defense to train  doctors on the potential health effects of burn pits, helping them  catch the early warning signs of serious life-threatening illnesses  before it is too late.   I would like to thank Congressman Peter Welch for his support and  commitment to protecting the health of our servicemembers and veterans,  and I urge my fellow Representatives on both sides of the aisle to  support these critical amendments.   As Jennifer Kepner said to me before she died:         Burn pits are the Agent Orange of our generation. We must       take action before more veterans and servicemembers lose       their lives.
