 Mr. Speaker, about a year ago, it was 4  a.m. in the morning when I got a call from the West Palm Beach  paramedics. They had received a call from my mother's Apple watch-- believe it or not--and they rushed to her apartment, and they found her  lying on her apartment floor. She had fallen and broken her hip.   I stayed close as she suffered through surgery and hospitalization  and rehabilitation. I counted the endless medical bills paid by  Medicare and her own personal funds. I watched as my independent mom  became fearful of living alone and moved into an assisted living  facility.   Mr. Speaker, I will say, there is some very good news about my mom,  she is alive and well and adapting to her new lifestyle. She uses a  walker and aging has reduced her stamina, but her bridge partners will  tell you she still has a very sharp mind.   Listen to this. Her surgeon told me her recovery at her age, which  was 96 at the time of the fall, was an exception, that most her age,  after a brutal injury, quickly sundown to death.   Mr. Speaker, you may ask why am I telling this story? Because  tomorrow is the first day of fall, and not only are the leaves turning,  but it marks the start of Fall Prevention Awareness Week, a nationwide  effort to raise awareness that falls are preventable, and also, to  bring awareness to fall prevention strategies and resources.   Mr. Speaker, after my mom fell, I started hearing story after story  from friends and colleagues about their own personal experiences of  people who had fallen, and you know what I learned? Falls are the most  frequent cause of injuries and injury-related death among people over  65.   There are 36 million falls a year in people over 65 here in America,  leading to broken bones and broken spirits, and 34,000 of those  becoming deadly. The cost--this is an amazing figure--the cost to the  American health system is $50 billion a year from injuries related to  falls. That is billion with a b.   Here is the most important message I have today: Falls are  preventable. I am going to say it again: Falls are preventable. There  are simple things that seniors can do with assistance from their  doctors and their family and their friends and caretakers to stop the  falls before they happen.   Here are some of the top tips from Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention. Make sure that medications don't have side effects that can  cause dizziness or loss of balance, stay hydrated, get eyes checked  every year. And because most falls happen in the home, make critical  changes like installing grab bars, clearing tripping hazards, and make  sure that the rugs are flat on the floor. If necessary, use mobility  aids like walkers and canes, when needed, even in your own home.   There are also simple exercises that seniors can do to improve joint  strength, especially in the ankles, to help improve balance and  stability.   I am pleased to say, Mr. Speaker, that the House Labor, Health, and  Human Services' budget plusses up fall prevention research and programs  in the 2023 budget. I am hoping that the Senate will go along with  that.   Mr. Speaker, I call on all my colleagues to recognize this week as  Fall Prevention Awareness Week and help me spread the word: Falls are  preventable. It is on all of us to keep our loved ones on their feet.                            ____________________
