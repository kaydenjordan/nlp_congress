 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support of this bill and of the 1.4 million first responders, teachers,  transit workers, sanitation workers, and other public servants already  laid off from State and local governments across this Nation. We must  act before more people lose their jobs, and before more lifesaving  programs are cut.   Madam Speaker, the State and local funding included in this package  will provide many local governments dedicated support for the first  time since this pandemic struck. It can be used to administer vaccines,  increase testing, and save countless jobs by replacing lost revenue.   For New York City, which last month projected a $10.5 billion loss in  expected tax revenue, this money would mean it can continue to provide  vaccines and food assistance and reopen schools safely. Hundreds of  local officials told us the relief in this bill will mean recovery  instead of recession and cannot come fast enough. Taken together, this  could be the light this--  MALONEY of New York (for herself,               Mr. Reed, Ms. Speier, Ms. Adams, Mrs. Axne, Mr. Bera,               Mr. Blumenauer, Ms. Bourdeaux, Ms. Brownley, Mr.               Butterfield, Mr. Carbajal, Mr. Cardenas, Mr. Carson,               Mr. Case, Ms. Chu, Mr. Cicilline, Ms. Clark of               Massachusetts, Ms. Clarke of New York, Mr. Cleaver,               Mr. Cooper, Mr. Costa, Mr. Crow, Ms. Dean, Mr.               DeFazio, Ms. DeGette, Ms. DeLauro, Ms. DelBene, Mr.               Espaillat, Mr. Evans, Mrs. Fletcher, Mr. Foster, Mr.               Garamendi, Ms. Garcia of Texas, Mr. Garcia of               Illinois, Ms. Haaland, Mr. Hastings, Mr. Horsford,               Ms. Houlahan, Mr. Huffman, Ms. Johnson of Texas, Mr.               Johnson of Georgia, Mr. Jones, Mr. Keating, Mr.               Khanna, Mr. Kildee, Mr. Kilmer, Mr. Krishnamoorthi,               Mr. Larson of Connecticut, Mr. Lawson of Florida, Ms.               Lee of California, Mr. Levin of California, Ms.               Lofgren, Mr. Lynch, Ms. Manning, Ms. Matsui, Mr.               McNerney, Mr. Meeks, Ms. Meng, Mr. Morelle, Mr.               Moulton, Mrs. Napolitano, Mr. Neguse, Ms. Newman, Ms.               Norton, Mr. O'Halleran, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Pascrell,               Mr. Payne, Mr. Price of North Carolina, Mr. Quigley,               Miss Rice of New York, Ms. Ross, Ms. Roybal-Allard,               Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Schakowsky, Mr. Schiff, Mr.               Schneider, Mr. Schrader, Ms. Schrier, Mr. David Scott               of Georgia, Ms. Sewell, Mr. Sherman, Ms. Sherrill,               Mr. Smith of Washington, Ms. Spanberger, Ms. Stevens,               Mr. Swalwell, Mr. Takano, Ms. Tlaib, Mrs. Torres of               California, Mr. Torres of New York, Mrs. Trahan, Ms.               Velazquez, Mrs. Watson Coleman, Ms. Wexton, and Ms.               Williams of Georgia):        H.J.
