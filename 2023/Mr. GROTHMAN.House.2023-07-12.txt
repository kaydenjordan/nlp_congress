 Madam Speaker, I will address one of the very important  Supreme Court decisions which came down in the last couple weeks and  some of the comments that have been made critical of that decision. I  am talking about the one that dealt with a policy now known in the  United States as affirmative action.   What that policy does is it gives, as a practical matter, preferences  both on  [[Page H3217]]  the basis of race and gender in university admissions. Actually, the  public debate should go beyond that because in this country not only do  we have a policy in which we try to have certain groups jump ahead of  other people based on test scores or grade point average, we also have  preferences, or encourage, as a practical matter, preferences in hiring  for government jobs as well as hiring in jobs working for a private  organization, if that private organization has at least 50 employees  and does business with the Federal Government. There are also  preferences with regard to government contracting.   As a practical matter, we have had these preferences since 1965. We  are talking about things that are 67 years old.    I will point out that sometimes with regard to government  contracting, it encourages lying. I have talked to people in my  district who talk about their colleagues putting businesses in the name  of their wives so they can get the preference for a woman-owned  business even though the guy continues to run the business.   My friend doesn't like it because he is an honest person and he  refuses to lie. He doesn't like the fact that people who are lying move  ahead of him. He is in the construction field.   There are two ideas put forth as to why we need these preferences:  One is to undo past injustices from years ago, going all the way back  to slavery in the 1860s; and, secondly, the idea that somehow we should  ask businesses or government to have a more diverse task force. I am  going to deal with each of one of these separately.   First of all, with regard to past injustices, the benefits in  universities and the benefit in government affirmative action goes to  people who were never even in this country. We have to ask ourselves,  why, if my ancestors came here from Peru in the 1990s and never  experienced a period in this country, assuming there was such a period  in which there was a lot of prejudice, why would we be giving  preferences to people who moved here in the 1990s?   Also, Madam Speaker, Black people who moved here from Jamaica or the  Bahamas in the 1990s, well past the era of Jim Crow, much less well  past slavery times, why would we be giving them preferences?   The Biden administration, most recently, is trying to add another  group to get preferences, people from the Middle East or northern  Africa. Why, if someone moves here from Algeria or Syria today, they  may not even be citizens, why would they be given preferences? What is  the underlying rationale?   The other thing to point out here is that we are hypothetically  giving preferences to people who are doing better than the native-born  population. This is something people should remember before they  advocate for this or if they have children or grandchildren making the  pitch for this.   Right now the ethnic group in America that is doing the best  financially--and money is not the most important thing in life, but  nevertheless, that is frequently what we look to when we determine  these programs--are Indian Americans who are the most successful group  in America today. Behind that, we have people from China. I think the  number two group right now is from the Philippines. People from Cuba  are doing better than the native born.   According to Thomas Sowell--this is a book somewhat dated--according  to Thomas Sowell, the second generation after people move here from the  West Indies, Jamaica, and the Bahamas do better than the average  American.   Given that, like I said, we are dealing with people who came here  well past the time of prejudice. Why in the world would we be giving  preferences to these people?   The next thing I will point out is that some people fall back on the  idea that we need a diverse group of students or a diverse workforce.  This is kind of a bizarre argument, and it is something people should  have to defend.   Let's say I am one-quarter Peruvian--I am not, but let's say for the  sake of argument I am one-quarter Peruvian. I have never been to Peru.  I don't know a word of Spanish. I have never been to a Spanish-speaking  country. Why in the world would we be giving me preferences to bring  the Peruvian viewpoint to an engineering firm, let's say?   It makes no sense at all. I have no connection other than DNA with  people that are Peruvian.   These are some of the ideas that I think people should have to  respond to before they are critical of that decision, or people who  want this sort of policy to continue.                            ____________________
