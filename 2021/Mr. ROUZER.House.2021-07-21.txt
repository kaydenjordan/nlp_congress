 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a very distinguished  American and longtime public servant of the people of Southeastern  North Carolina as well as the United States Congress.   Billy Barker has served this institution for 24 years, 18 years for  former Congressman Mike McIntyre and 6 years with me as agriculture  field director.   He also served a number of years for North Carolina's longtime  Commissioner of Agriculture, the late Jim Graham. Following more than  three decades of serving the citizens of North Carolina, Billy recently  retired from his work in public service.   Billy was one of my first hires after I was elected to Congress in  2014. He is a great friend who has been an incredibly valuable source  of information for me and many others. The contributions he has made to  the agriculture community and our farm families cannot be measured.  Sometimes it was help on a pressing issue with USDA; other times, it  was just a friendly visit to talk local scuttlebutt and take a break  from the stresses on the farm.   It is no exaggeration to say that North Carolina's farm economy  wouldn't look the same without Billy's hard work and influence. Through  numerous hurricanes and other storms, the COVID-19 pandemic, and every  other challenge, Billy Barker has been a constant presence on the  ground, providing our farm families and rural communities a steady hand  to guide them through recovery and ensuring they have the resources  they need.   Without question, the citizens of North Carolina are better off for  his service. I wish him a well-deserved retirement and a relaxing and  rewarding next chapter of life. I am grateful for his service to the  State, and I am proud to call him my friend.   Tribute to Bob Sutter, CEO of North Carolina Peanut Growers Association     Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my longtime  friend, Bob Sutter, who will be retiring after serving 28 years as the  CEO of the North Carolina Peanut Growers Association.   Prior to his lifelong career in agriculture, Bob honorably served his  country for 2 years in the U.S. Navy and 5 years in the U.S. Navy  Reserve. From there, he worked for the USDA Farm Service Agency, and  then later took the helm of the North Carolina Peanut Growers  Association as its CEO in 1993.   Bob has made countless contributions to the North Carolina  agriculture community, everything from the formation of the National  Peanut Board, educating the public on health benefits of peanuts, and  advocating for research to improve yields. He leaves behind a  successful legacy of helping peanut farmers and their families  establish and maintain successful farms that support our Nation's  abundant food supply.   Bob has also been a leading voice for North Carolina producers when  it comes to developing strong national farm policy. His advocacy in the  halls of Congress and the executive branch of the Federal Government,  as well as the State legislature and beyond, has been critical to the  development and implementation of policies that have helped many of our  farmers survive major challenges and succeed--whether they were caused  by the weather, trade distortions, or the market.   Bob has had a remarkable career, and on behalf of the agriculture  community and the fine citizens of North Carolina, I thank him for his  dedicated service to the State and to the many farm families he has  represented all these years. I wish him and his wife, Sylvia, the best  as they move into their next chapter of life.                                Hyde Amendment     Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  longstanding Hyde amendment. For nearly 45 years, the Hyde amendment  has received support from Republicans and Democrats alike. Lawmakers on  both sides of the aisle understood that no taxpayer money should be  used to fund abortion. Every President since Jimmy Carter has signed  the Hyde amendment into law, including President Obama.   As a Senator, President Biden was a strong supporter of the  amendment. Yet, in his latest budget proposal, he removed Hyde  protections that would enable taxpayer funding support for abortions,  meaning that tax dollars taken from those who oppose it will now be  used for just that. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is  fundamentally wrong to take taxpayer dollars of someone who is opposed  to abortion and use their hard-earned tax dollars to fund the same.   On the question of life itself, the Hyde amendment is credited with  saving more than 2.4 million innocent lives from abortions since 1976.  It is our moral obligation to fight for and protect the lives of those  who cannot speak for themselves, the lives of those who are no  different than our own.   I call on my colleagues to pass H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion Act, to stand up for pro-life Americans, preserve the Hyde  amendment, and ensure taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortion.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in absolute and unequivocal  support of the Cuban people protesting their evil and oppressive  Communist regime. Unfortunately, there is nothing new about their  brutality and willful violations of universally recognized human  rights. The United States should make it very clear that we stand on  the side of the Cuban people as thousands have joined one of the  biggest anti-Communist demonstrations the country has witnessed during  its 62-year dictatorship.   Since the protests began, hundreds have been detained or are missing,  including: artists, peace activists, and priests. The Cuban people  deserve and need our help. In the words of the late Senator Jesse  Helms:         The United States must speak out clearly on behalf of those       whose own voices are choked by Communist repression.    Despite what many of our own people have been brainwashed by our  education systems to believe, America is the greatest force for freedom  and liberty that the world has ever known. I implore this  administration, the Biden administration, and this Congress to utilize  every tool of the U.S. Government to support the Cuban people in their  effort to defeat the Communist regime and break the shackles of its  oppressive government.
