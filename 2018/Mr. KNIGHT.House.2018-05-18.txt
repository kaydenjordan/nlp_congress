 Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman  Roskam for his work on this amendment.   I do speak in favor of amendment No. 14 which strengthens Federal  laws against animal fighting and has garnered bipartisan support many  times over the past two decades. This is something that still happens.  It still happens in our country. Just a month ago, over 1,000 birds  were collected in a cockfighting raid just in my district in southern  California.   Forcing two animals to fight to the death is not only a crime  problem, it is a moral problem as well. There is strong bipartisan  agreement that animal fighting is an inexcusable crime. We should  strengthen our laws to protect animals and society from this barbaric  activity which has no place in modern society.
