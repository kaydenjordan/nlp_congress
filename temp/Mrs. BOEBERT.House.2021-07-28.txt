 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in defense of those who  cannot defend themselves, the voiceless, the unborn.   I rise to say what we all know to be true, that human life begins at  conception, because we know science is real.   The more than 60 million babies that have been ripped from their  mother's womb since Roe v. Wade were no less valuable or worthy of life  than any of us here today. No taxpayer should ever be forced to pay for  abortion.   Abortion is not healthcare, it is murder. I will not stand by  quietly. I say Planned Parenthood can go fund themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
