 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to control the  time of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as you all know, the Judiciary Committee worked  diligently for a year on legislation that does two things: one, protect  Americans' civil liberties by requiring a court order to access section  702 data during domestic criminal investigations; and, two, reauthorize  the 702 program, which is our Nation's most indispensable national  security tool.   We achieved that by passing the USA Liberty Act in the House  Judiciary Committee last year by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, which  is no easy task; however, we were able to responsibly balance civil  liberties with national security.   The bill we will vote on today was drafted in the spirit of the USA  Liberty Act. It is not perfect and the process getting here was not  ideal, but the bill requires, for the first time, a warrant to access  section 702-collected communications on U.S. persons in criminal  investigations.   Moreover, in routine criminal cases, when the FBI accesses U.S.  person communications that were incidentally collected without first  obtaining a warrant, the FBI will not be permitted to use those  communications in a criminal prosecution. This will prevent a national  security tool from advancing run-of-the-mill criminal prosecutions.   These are meaningful reforms. The bill that was presented to us  before Christmas with its optional warrant construct was not real  reform. The bill we are debating today, however, contains meaningful  reforms.   I would have preferred to include additional reforms, but I cannot  stress to my colleagues enough that our choice cannot be between a  perfect reform bill and expiration of this program. The 702 program is  far too important for that. With this bill, we can have meaningful  reform and reauthorization. In its current form, this bill will pass  the Senate.   I also want to caution everyone that we cannot go too far in seeking  to alter this program. There is an amendment that will be offered  sponsored by Mr. Amash and Ms. Lofgren that would prevent the FBI from  ever querying its 702 database using a U.S. person term.   Imagine the FBI getting a tip from a flight instructor whose student  acts suspiciously by expressing great interest in learning how to take  off and fly a plane but has no interest in learning how to land the  plane. This could be innocent behavior, but we want law enforcement to  at least be able to perform a search to see if they already have, in  their possession, any communications between the student and a foreign  actor involved in organizing terrorist plots.   The Judiciary Committee-passed bill would have allowed the search and  allowed law enforcement to view the metadata without a warrant while  requiring a warrant to view the content of the communications.   The Amash-Lofgren amendment, which was rejected in the Judiciary  Committee, goes too far and would prevent such a search from even being  done. It would, thus, kill this critical program by preventing the FBI  from even looking at its own databases without a warrant, rendering it  ineffective in preventing terrorist attacks and stifling its ability to  gather necessary intelligence. It must not be adopted.   I will vote to support this bill. I will oppose the Amash-Lofgren  amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me. Vote for reform and  reauthorization.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), a member of the Judiciary Committee and  the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Carter of Georgia). The gentleman from  Virginia has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 2\1/ 4\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, in response to those who advocate for the Amash-Lofgren  amendment, this amendment will very, very seriously damage our national  security. Section 702 is a program for which there is no evidence of  abuse and is used to gather information about non-United States  citizens outside the United States. In a targeted fashion, they have to  go to the court and get approval for the selectors to gather  information on a quarterly basis. They gather information incidental to  that. Sometimes there is information about United States citizens.   But guess what. The information does not come with little labels  attached saying: this is a United States citizen communicating here, or  the communication involves someone in the United States.   Therefore, it is absolutely vitally important that we not impair the  most important electronic intelligence-gathering mechanism that the  United States has to keep us safe. Oppose the Amash amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have only one speaker remaining to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), a member of the Judiciary Committee, to  close the debate on this side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.                     Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Amash     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized  for 10 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment, plain and simple, would disable 702, our most  important national security tool. If passed, any chance of reform  through the underlying bill is dead on arrival in the United States  Senate. We cannot risk 702 collection ending.   This Chamber cannot be complicit in allowing terrorists to fly under  the radar if this amendment kills 702, and I sincerely urge you to  oppose the Amash amendment and not lose the opportunity to successfully  balance national security and civil liberties, which is what the  underlying bill does.   We definitely need to have a move toward more protection of our  Fourth Amendment rights, and a warrant requirement in domestic criminal  cases and a requirement that if you are doing a national security  investigation and you find that the information is useful in a criminal  case and it is precluded from court are two major improvements to our  702 law that protect Americans' civil liberties.   This bill must be passed. It is absolutely essential for our  protection. It surveys people outside of the United States who are not  United States citizens. The fact that it collects incidental  information about U.S. citizens should not be a prohibition on this  effort. But if you apply this amendment, you are not going to be able  to have our national intelligence officials looking at this information  carefully, and they are going to have to, in many instances, get a  warrant when they need to act because they think it is a national  security concern. A warrant either will be unattainable or it will be  in a circumstance where it is too late, and, in both instances, we  cannot allow that.   This bill provides balance. That bill goes too far. The amendment  goes too far. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 1\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 1 minute remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, let me pose a hypothetical about the Amash amendment. In  the criminal world, if an FBI agent is told through a tip that someone  has just purchased unusual amounts of fertilizer that could be used to  make a bomb, the Amash amendment would prevent that FBI agent from  looking at the FBI's databases to determine if the suspicious  individual's email address or other identifier--not the content of the  email, just the email address or identifier--is located in the 702  database.   What would the American people say if we hamper our law enforcement  from protecting them? What would people of this country say if we had  another Murrah Building blow up and the FBI couldn't look at even an  email address?   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question  is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash).   The question is on the amendment by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Amash).   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
