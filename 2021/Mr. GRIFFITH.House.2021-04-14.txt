 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1899,  the Ensuring Compliance Against Drug Diversion Act. This is a small but  very important step that could play a key role in helping contain the  opioid epidemic.   License to distribute opioids is not a commodity to be freely bought  and sold. We must ensure that those who wish to engage in opioid  distribution earn the ability to do so.   An investigation, as the Speaker has heard, published by the Energy  and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in 2018 found  that the current procedures for transferring the licenses to distribute  controlled substances lacked sufficient accountability.   In one instance, a distributor and its pharmacy customer did not go  through the appropriate process of transferring registration to a new  pharmacy owner, but the mistake wasn't caught until long, long  afterward. As a result, there was a period of time during which the DEA  was unaware that a particular pharmacy was distributing controlled  substances.   Failing to properly verify whether a transfer has been approved  creates a serious risk of drug diversion. This bill amends the  Controlled Substances Act to prohibit the transfer of any DEA  registration without consent from the agency.   By requiring written approval from the DEA before the transfer of  registration, we decrease the risk of controlled substances falling  into the hands of those who have not been vetted by appropriate  regulatory authorities.
