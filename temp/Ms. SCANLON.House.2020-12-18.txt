 Madam Speaker, I rise in support today of eviction  relief, which we expect to see included in the COVID package we vote on  soon.   While we need to do more, this bill provides a meaningful start to  addressing the eviction crisis caused by the pandemic. In Pennsylvania  alone, nearly one-quarter million households are behind on their rent  and facing the real threat of eviction.   This bill will allow, as an authorized administrative expense, funds  to be sent to civil legal aid organizations to help keep people in  their homes. Under this crucial legislation, legal aid organizations,  including faith-based groups, can represent tenants in eviction cases,  improve access to utilities, and ensure housing conditions meet  necessary standards.   Rental assistance alone will not help the thousands of people facing  eviction; families often need access to legal advice to protect their  rights. Legal counsel should not be a privilege saved for the  wealthiest in our country. It is a basic necessity for navigating the  difficult problems facing Americans who are on the bottom rungs of our  economy.   I will continue advocating for the families hardest hit by the COVID  pandemic, and I thank my colleagues for their hard work on this  legislation.                            ____________________
