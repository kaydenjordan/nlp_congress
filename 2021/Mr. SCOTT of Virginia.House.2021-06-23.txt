 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 486,  I call up the bill (H.R. 2062) to amend the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act of 1967 and other laws to clarify appropriate standards  for Federal employment discrimination and retaliation claims, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2062, the Protecting  Older Workers Against Discrimination Act of 2021.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older  Workers Against Discrimination Act, which I reintroduced this year with  our colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).   For decades, the Federal Government has recognized the need to  protect older workers against discrimination on the basis of age.  Unfortunately, in 2009, the Supreme Court severely eroded protections  for older workers in the case of Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.   In its decision, the Court set a significantly higher burden of proof  for workers alleging age discrimination. Under this standard, workers  must prove that age discrimination was the decisive cause of an  employer's action rather than just one of the motivating factors, as  was the case before the Gross decision.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the NAACP  supporting the bill and discussing the Gross decision.                                                              NAACP,                                     Washington, DC, June 19, 2021.      Re NAACP Support for H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers           Against Discrimination Act of 2021 (POWADA) Urges a           ``Yea' Vote on Final Passage.       Hon. Robert (Bobby) Scott,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Scott: On behalf of the National       Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),       our nation's oldest, largest and most widely recognized       grassroots based civil rights organization, I thank you for       your leadership and work for the passage of H.R. 2062, the       Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act of 2021       (POWADA). This bill is a crucial component of the NAACP's       vision for ensuring a society in which all individuals have       equal rights and equal protection under the law as a key       measure to ensure that illegal workplace discrimination is       ended for all. To that end, we are convinced that POWADA       takes a critical steps forward to ensure older workers,       especially those who are persons of color and women, are       protected from age discrimination in the workplace.        The Supreme Court's 2009 decision Gross v. FBL Financial       Services, Inc., significantly reduced the ability for       employees to challenge an employer's age discriminatory       employment practices in court. The decision forces employees       to prove that age is a `but-for' cause of an age       discrimination employment action. Worse, some circuit courts       extended the Gross but-for standard into other civil rights       statutes as well. The NAACP urges full Congressional support       for, and passage of POWADA, a bill that restores the ability       of plaintiffs to challenge age and other forms of       discrimination in court by returning the Age Discrimination       in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the       Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the retaliation provisions of       Title VII to the mixed-motive standard of proof used under       Title VII of the Civil Rights Act for decades.        The importance of countering age discrimination cannot be       understated, especially since age discrimination often       intersects with other forms of discrimination based on race       and gender. The evidence for this is clear: Nearly two-thirds       of women and more than three-fourths of African American       workers age 45 and older say they've seen or experienced age       discrimination in the workplace. Over 9 percent of African       Americans felt pressured into early retirement because of       their age, compared to 6.7 percent for other races. During       the COVID-19 pandemic, the decline in employment for older       African American, Hispanic, and Asian worker was twice that       of older white workers. The ability for workers to confront       age discrimination is an integral part of confronting       discrimination generally in our Country.        For the preceding reasons, the NAACP strongly urges       Congress to pass POWADA (H.R. 2062) and protect our nation's       older workers as soon as possible.        Thank you again for your leadership and attention to this       crucial issue of civil rights and equal protection under law.       If you have any questions or other concerns with the NAACP's       position on this matter, please do not hesitate to contact       me.            Sincerely,      Hilary O. Shelton,        Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President       for Policy and Advocacy.     Mr. Speaker, making cases more difficult to  prove contradicts our responsibility to support older workers who have  been vulnerable to workplace discrimination. In fact, more than half of  older workers are pushed out of longtime jobs before they choose to  retire.   Age discrimination also holds back our economy. Research by AARP and  the Economist Intelligence Unit found that, absent age discrimination,  older workers would have contributed $850 billion more in 2018 to the  gross domestic product. Clearly, our labor market and economy cannot  fully recover from the pandemic if we fail to support our older  workers.   The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act is a  bipartisan initiative that would restore the pre-2009 evidentiary  standard for age discrimination claims. This would effectively realign  the burden of proof for age discrimination claims so it would again be  the same standard that is required for proving discrimination based on  sex, race, religion, and national origin.   This legislation also reinstates this standard for disability  discrimination claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the  Rehabilitation Act, as well as claims for retaliation for rights  protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These statutes have all  been implicated by the Gross decision.   Last Congress, 261 bipartisan House Members voted in favor of passing  the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act. This Congress,  I hope we can come together again and take this next step to ensure  that older workers can achieve justice.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy in support of H.R. 2062.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 2062--Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act--Rep.                      Scott, D-VA, and 112 cosponsors         The Administration supports House passage of the Protecting       Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (POWADA). The       bipartisan legislation would restore legal protections for       older Americans and hold employers accountable for age       discrimination.        The bill amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act       (ADEA), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the       Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Rehabilitation       Act of 1973, to replace the ``but-for'' test established in       Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. with the ``motivating       factor'' test. The bill thereby aligns the burden of proof       for age discrimination with similar standards for proving       discrimination based on race and national origin. In       addition, the bill allows individuals claiming discrimination       to rely on any type or form of admissible evidence to prove       an unlawful practice occurred.        Workplace discrimination prevents people from fully       accessing the American dream and limits the contributions       that they can make to our shared prosperity. Ending it is a       priority for the Administration. The President supports this       bipartisan legislation that protects workers from age       discrimination.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3054]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the co-chair of the House  Democratic Caucus Task Force on Aging.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), chair of the Subcommittee on  Civil Rights and Human Services.

Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Louisiana.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I include in the Record a letter from the AARP, which says, in part,  ``Older workers are valuable assets to their employers and the economy.  Despite that, 78 percent of older workers reported having seen or  experienced age discrimination in the workplace in 2020, up markedly  from 61 percent in 2018. More than half of older workers are forced out  of a job before they intend to retire. Nine out of 10 of those who do  find work never again match their prior earnings. Making matters worse,  the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly diminished job prospects and  future retirement security of older workers. In April, over half of job  seekers ages 55 and older continued to be long-term unemployed, 53.3  percent, compared to 42.3 percent of job seekers ages 16 to 54. The  labor force participation rates for older women workers, along with  their earning power and future retirement security, have been  particularly hard-hit by COVID.'' All of that is in the letter.                                                           AARP,                                                      June 14, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our nearly 38 million       members and all older Americans nationwide, AARP urges you to       vote in support of H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers       Against Discrimination Act (POWADA), important bipartisan       legislation sponsored by Chairman Scott and Rep. Rodney Davis       (R-IL) to restore protections against age discrimination.        Older workers are valuable assets to their employers and       the economy. Despite that, 78 percent of older workers       reported having seen or experienced age discrimination in the       workplace in 2020, up markedly from 61 percent in 2018. More       than half of older workers are forced out of a job before       they intend to retire. Nine out of 10 of those who do find       work never again match their prior earnings. Making matters       worse, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly diminished the       job prospects and future retirement security of older       workers. In April, over half of job seekers ages 55 and older       continued to be long-term unemployed (53.3 percent) compared       with 42.3 percent of job seekers ages 16 to 54. The labor       force participation rates for older women workers, along with       their earning power and future retirement security, have been       particularly hard-hit by COVID.        POWADA is a bipartisan, commonsense bill that would restore       fairness for older workers. The bill reinstates well-      established legal standards on workplace discrimination that       were undermined by the 2009 Supreme Court decision in Gross       v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. and subsequent discrimination       cases. POWADA would help level the playing field for older       workers and restore their legal rights. Older Americans have       waited for over a decade for this legislation to be enacted.        AARP strongly supports POWADA and urges you to enact it as       soon as possible. If you have any questions, please feel free       to contact me, or have your staff contact Michele Varnhagen       on our Government Affairs staff.            Sincerely,                                                   Bill Sweeney,                                              Senior Vice President,                                                Government Affairs.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act is a  bipartisan bill that has been introduced over many Congresses with  growing support. Over the last decade, Members have debated this bill  through multiple legislative hearings, and bills in both the House and  the Senate have been introduced and improved every Congress since 2009.   Despite the bipartisan legacy of this proposal, some of my colleagues  have raised disappointing opposition today. But let's be clear. This  bill is not about increasing the number of age discrimination claims.  It is about giving victims of discrimination a fair shot at getting  relief. It is simply restoring basic protections for older workers.   Yes, discrimination against older workers is already illegal, but,  regrettably, it is unnecessarily harder to prove because of the 2009  decision. In spite of the fact that it is more difficult, cases are  still being brought. But if the cases were as easy to bring or the same  difficulty to bring as other cases, even more cases would have been  filed.   We know this is more difficult because in the original case of Gross  v. FBL Financial Services, Jack Gross successfully proved that his  employer had demoted older workers who refused to accept a buyout,  while giving their jobs to younger workers. Yet it was only after the  Supreme Court changed the rules and required Mr. Gross to retry his  case that he lost with the higher standard, because, despite having the  same facts, the same parties, and the same court, he lost his case.   The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act is designed  to ensure that older workers like Mr. Gross are not denied justice and  fair treatment that they deserve.   We have heard about attorneys' fees. We need to just remind everybody  that lawyers are only awarded attorneys' fees when they win the case.  So if you want to reduce attorneys' fees, the businesses can stop  discriminating.   I hope we can all agree that it is time to stand up for older workers  and treat all workers facing discrimination, whether it is on the basis  of sex, race, religion, national origin, or age, with consistency and  fairness.   I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) again for  working with me on this bipartisan priority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 486, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 1.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, there are two amendments in this en bloc amendment.   Mr. Brown has offered an amendment to require the EEOC to submit an  annual report to Congress on the number of age discrimination claims  brought under this act.   Ms. Williams has offered an amendment to require the EEOC to submit a  report to Congress on any remaining disparities faced by workers  pursuing relief under the mixed motive standard whose cases were  covered by the ADEA, as well as other antidiscrimination laws.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to state that these  two amendments would improve the bill.   The one from Mr. Brown would give information that is already being  provided now, but this would just make sure it continues. It is being  provided on a voluntary basis, these annual reports.   And Ms. Williams offers a very interesting analysis that some people  may be being discriminated against on multiple grounds and pointed out  the Federal Reserve study that showed that older workers who happen to  be women fared a lot worse than the older workers who happen to be men.  We may need to figure out how we deal with that, but we need the data  before we can move forward.   I hope that we adopt this amendment, and, Mr. Speaker, I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 486, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina, (Ms. Manning), a distinguished member  on the Committee of Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from North Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, very briefly, the first amendment that requires the GAO  study only seeks to say whether the cases went up or down. The cases  can go up because there is more discrimination. It has nothing to do  with whether or not it was because of the change in standard. It could  be in spite of the standard. And all it does is delay the  implementation of the bill.   The other sets a different standard for retaliation, where you can  win your case that you didn't get promoted but lose your case on the  fact that you got hired just because there is a differential standard.  Well, that doesn't make much sense.   It seems to me that we should go back to the way it was before the  Gross decision, have one standard in all of the discrimination cases,  and have people be able to prove their case the way they have always  been able to prove their case.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendments en  bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Illinois for his hard work on this amendment and on the bill itself. He  has been a leader on helping older workers avoid discrimination.   This amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois and cosponsored  by the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree), would provide further  information on how many women are adversely affected by age  discrimination as a motivating factor in the workplace, as well as  provide best practices to combat gender and age discrimination. These  practices will help support older women who may face multiple kinds of  discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for offering the amendment, and I  also want to thank him for his distinguished leadership on the  underlying legislation.
