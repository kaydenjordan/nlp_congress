 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the urgent  need to tackle the affordable housing crisis. The cost of housing is  the single biggest challenge facing the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.   Last week, I hosted an affordable housing conference in Attleboro  with my friend and colleague Juana Matias, the HUD regional  administrator for New England. We spoke with housing officials and  developers across the district about the programs and funding available  for affordable housing development. I reiterated my commitment to  policies from zoning reform to LIHTC expansion to increased production  of affordable housing.   Expanding affordable housing is a multigovernment effort that needs  support on the Federal, State, and local levels. As the next Congress  approaches, we must recommit ourselves to making housing more  affordable for working families.                            ____________________
