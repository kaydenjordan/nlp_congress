 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 492,  I call up the bill (H.R. 582) to provide for increases in the Federal  minimum wage, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the idea behind the Federal minimum wage is simple:  Hardworking Americans should be paid at least enough to provide for  themselves and their families.   After more than a decade with no increase in the minimum wage, the  longest stretch since the minimum wage was established in 1938, it is  no longer serving that purpose.   Today, the Federal minimum wage is a poverty wage in every region of  our Nation. Our Nation's workers deserve better.   The Raise the Wage Act, H.R. 582, gradually increases the Federal  minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. After 2025, this legislation  indexes future increases to the minimum wage to increases in the median  wage so that the value does not erode over time. It gradually phases  out the subminimum wages to ensure that tipped workers, youth workers,  and workers with disabilities are paid at least the full Federal  minimum wage.   The benefits of this legislation are significant and widespread.  Economic analysis estimates that the Raise the Wage Act would increase  wages for up to 33 million workers and lift 1.3 million Americans out  of poverty.   The Raise the Wage Act is not just good for workers. It is good for  the economy.  [[Page H7097]]    While the Republican tax bill gave the largest benefits to  corporations and the wealthy, this bill puts money directly into the  hands of workers, who will spend that money in their communities.   Today is a historic day. For the first time in more than 12 years,  the House is voting to restore the value of the Federal minimum wage  and restore the value of work in America.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support the Raise the Wage  Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that a vote  against this bill is a vote to deny about 37 percent of workers in her  district of North Carolina a raise of about $3,800 a year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici), the chair of the Education and Labor Subcommittee on Civil  Rights and Human Services.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote against the bill is a vote to deny about 38 percent of the workers  in his district in Pennsylvania an average wage of about $3,300 a year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano), the chair of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote against this bill is a vote to deny about 41 percent of the  workers in his district in South Carolina a raise of about $3,800 a  year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wilson), the chair of the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pension  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote against this bill is a vote to deny about 41 percent of the  workers in his district in Tennessee an average raise of about $3,700 a  year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Adams), the chair of the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote against this bill is a vote to deny about 32 percent of the  workers in his district in Michigan an average raise of about $2,300 a  year. And in the CBO report that he cited, three of the most recent  studies cited in that report show an actual increase in jobs, not a  decrease.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal),  the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, a gentlewoman who can talk  specifically about Seattle.    Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman has suggested,  his vote against the bill is a vote to deny about 43 percent of the  workers in his district in Pennsylvania an average raise of $3,900 a  year, while the tax bill that he supported, 80 percent of the benefits  of that bill went to the top 1 percent and corporations.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the House majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote against this bill is a vote to deny 41 percent of the workers in  his district in Georgia an average raise of about $3,800 a year, and I  don't think they are laughing about that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Pocan), the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote against this bill is a vote to deny about 37 percent of the  workers in his district in Alabama an average wage of about $3,700 a  year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Norcross), a distinguished member of the Committee on Education and  Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote against the bill is a vote to deny about 34 percent of the workers  in his district in Pennsylvania an average raise of $3,200, and that,  in fact, wages for low-income workers have been going up, but only  because States and localities have been increasing the minimum wage,  just like this bill does.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Levin), the vice chair of the Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of  the United States House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone), the distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote against this bill is a vote to deny about 35 percent of the  workers in his district in Pennsylvania an average raise of about  $3,200 a year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Wild), a distinguished member of the Committee on Education and  Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time  is left on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Texas  that a vote against this bill is a vote to deny about 30 percent of the  workers in his district in Texas an average raise of about $3,800 a  year.   I also will point out that the same CBO report that he cited cites  the three most recent studies showing the number of jobs will actually  go up as a direct result of the passage of this bill, and 27 million  people are getting a raise.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Mrs. Trahan), a distinguished member of the Committee on Education and  Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the chair of the Committee  on Small Business.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the chair of the Labor,  Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee  of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire again as to the  time remaining on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the vice chair on  the Joint Economic Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds  to the gentlewoman.    I yield the gentlewoman such time as she may  consume.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a leader of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the following  organizations in support of the Raise the Wage Act: the National  Employment Law Project, cosigned by 500 other organizations, AFSCME,  the National Women's Law Center, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights  Under Law, National Urban League, Disability Coalition, healthcare  groups, Interreligious Working Group on Domestic Human Needs, First  Focus Campaign for Children, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice,  Oxfam, Americans for Democratic Action, National Employment Lawyers  Association, and a recent article in Politico by Reverend William  Barber.                                National Employment Law Project,                                                      July 15, 2019.        Dear Representative: The National Employment Law Project       (NELP), a non-profit organization that advocates on behalf of       workers in low-wage jobs, enthusiastically supports the Raise       the Wage Act of 2019. We urge you to vote Yes on the bill and       No on any Motion to Recommit when the measure comes before       the House later this week.        Last month, our nation marked a shameful milestone when the       longest period passed without an increase since the 1938       enactment of the minimum wage. Nearly ten years have passed       since the last increase to $7.25 on July 24, 2009. The cost       of wage stagnation for workers making wages at or near the       federal minimum wage is inexcusable in a country with the       collective wealth we enjoy and with an economy that is       booming for those who already live comfortable lives.        The Raise the Wage Act will gradually raise the federal       minimum wage to $15 by 2025, gradually eliminate the       subminimum wages for tipped, disabled and youth workers, and       eventually index the minimum wage so that it rises as all       other wages rise.        If signed into law, this Act will not only dramatically       decrease poverty and income inequality. By phasing out       subminimum wages and restoring the value of the federal       minimum wage, this Act will also help address the       systemically lower wages disproportionately affecting people       of color, women and disabled workers as a result of the       structural inequities baked into our current federal minimum       wage policy.        Though opponents of raising the minimum wage will claim       that it will result in job loss, these prophesies of doom       have no basis in fact. Just two weeks ago, a detailed and       rigorous study of minimum wage increases since 2005,       including the first increases that went to $15, demonstrated       that there are no discernable negative effects on employment       or hours worked. Rather, it found that minimum wage increases       lead to substantial declines in household and child poverty.       Further studies show that raising the minimum wage also leads       to a reduction in suicides, a decrease in criminal       recidivism, improved maternal and child health, increased       consumer spending, increased worker productivity, lower       turnover in jobs, and rise in employment of older workers.        It's no wonder that the minimum wage enjoys such broad       popular support, with polling showing 65% for a $15 federal       minimum wage even in battleground Congressional districts.        This bill is a crucial step forward in the move to raise       wages, fight income inequality, reduce poverty, and eradicate       at least some measure of racial, gender and disability       discrimination that is inherent in our federal minimum wage       policy. It is also an important step in making sure that       working people achieve a more equitable share of the rewards       of their labor.        We hope that you will stand with the nearly 35 million       workers who will receive a raise if the Raise the Wage Act is       passed and vote Yes on the bill and No on any Motion to       Recommit that is offered.            Sincerely,                                                Christine L. Owens,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                           AFSCME,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members of the       American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees       (AFSCME), I am writing in support of the ``Raise the Wage Act       of 2019'' (H.R. 582). This legislation would have a critical       impact on millions of workers by gradually lifting the       current federal minimum wage.        The current federal minimum wage rate of $7.25 an hour       makes it very difficult for workers to meet basic family       needs. The last federal minimum wage increase was in 2009.       This unjustifiable delay contributes to wage stagnation in       our country. A full-time minimum-wage worker earning the       federal minimum wage makes barely $15,000 per year. A worker       supporting two kids on an equivalent salary would not even       make enough to reach the poverty level. Taking that into       consideration coupled with the fact that most minimum-wage       jobs rarely include health insurance coverage or child-care       assistance, it should be easy to understand why working       families in America deserve better. As a result of wage       stagnation and income disparity nearly 40 percent of all       American families struggle with basic needs.        Raising the minimum wage lifts the wages of low-wage       workers but also helps to raise the wages of all workers.       H.R. 582 allows for a raise in the federal minimum wage to       $8.55 this year and increases over the next six years until       it reaches $15 an hour at the end of that period.       Subsequently, the minimum wage will adjust each year to keep       pace with growth in typical workers' wages. The legislation       also immediately phases out the outdated subminimum wage for       tipped workers, which has been frozen at a meager $2.13 since       1991 and sunsets the subminimum wage for workers with       disabilities.        Raising the minimum wage will help grow the economy.       Workers who are paid a living wage are more productive, and       more likely to spend their extra earnings immediately.        America needs a raise. AFSCME strongly supports the ``Raise       the Wage Act of 2019.'' The 10-year delay has pushed millions       of working families below the poverty line. Please vote yes       on the bill and no on any efforts to weaken it, including any       motions to recommit.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                      National Women's Law Center,                                                      July 15, 2019.      Re: Pass the Raise the Wage Act of 2019        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Women's Law       Center, I strongly urge you to vote for the Raise the Wage       Act of 2019 when it comes to the House floor, and vote       against any Motion to Recommit, or any amendment that would       limit the scope of the bill or create anything other than a       single, fair, and adequate federal minimum wage for all       working people in the United States. Like the recently passed       Paycheck Fairness Act, the Raise the Wage Act is essential to       advance equal pay for women and economic security for their       families.        Today, women across the country--especially women of       color--continue to experience a pay gap and a higher risk of       poverty than men. Women working full time, year round       typically make only 80 percent of what their male       counterparts make, leaving a wage gap of 20 cents on the       dollar. This wage gap varies by race and is larger for women       of color: Black women working full time, year round typically       make only 61 cents, Native women only 58 cents, and Latinas       only 53 cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-      Hispanic male counterparts. While Asian American and Pacific       Islander (AAPI) women make 85 cents for every dollar paid to       white, non-Hispanic men, many AAPI communities experience       drastically wider pay gaps.        The Paycheck Fairness Act will address the pay       discrimination, often cloaked by employer-imposed pay secrecy       policies, that is one factor driving these persistent wage       gaps. But women's overrepresentation in low-wage jobs is       another key factor: women are close to two-thirds of the       workforce in jobs that pay the minimum wage or just a few       dollars above it, and more than two-thirds of workers in       tipped jobs. Women of color are particularly overrepresented       among tipped workers and other low-wage workers. And they are       particularly harmed by a $7.25 federal minimum wage that has       not gone up in a decade--and by a $2.13 tipped minimum cash       wage that has been frozen for an astonishing 28 years.        The Raise the Wage Act will raise the federal minimum wage       from $7.25 to $15 an hour by 2025, then index the minimum       wage so that it continues to rise along with wages overall.       It will also end unfair exclusions for tipped workers, people       with disabilities, and youth so that they, too, can benefit       from a decent minimum wage. The Economic Policy Institute       (EPI) estimates that the bill (as introduced) would give       nearly one in three working women a raise, including 41       percent of Black working women, 38 percent of working       Latinas, 29 percent of white working women, and 18 percent of       Asian working women. Because women are the majority of       workers who would see their pay go up, wage gaps would likely       narrow as well; indeed, NWLC research shows that women       working full time, year round in states with a minimum wage       of at least $10 per hour face a gender wage gap that is one-      third smaller than the wage gap across states with a $7.25       minimum wage. And in ``One Fair Wage'' states where employers       already have to pay their tipped workers the regular minimum       wage before tips, the average poverty rate for women tipped       workers is lower--and wage gaps for women overall are       smaller--  [[Page H7120]]       than in states that follow the $2.13 federal standard. One       Fair Wage also ensures that women in tipped jobs have a       paycheck they can count on, making them less vulnerable to       the sexual harassment from customers that women can feel       forced to tolerate when they have to rely on tips for nearly       all of their income.        A $15 minimum wage will make a meaningful difference for       millions across the country who are struggling to put food on       the table, access the health care they need, and support       themselves and their families. But it is still a modest wage       relative to the expenses that women and their families face       every day, no matter where they live in the United States.       According to EPI, by 2025, a single worker without children       will need at least full-time earnings at $15 an hour ($31,200       annually) to meet basic needs, and workers in costlier areas       and those supporting families will need more. By establishing       a $15 federal minimum wage by 2025 and phasing out harmful       exclusions, the Raise the Wage Act gradually reaches a single       wage floor that will benefit working people and our economy       nationwide.        We strongly urge you to reject any amendments or       alternatives that would establish a regional minimum wage at       the federal level, which would leave women of color behind       and cement the wage disparities that the Raise the Wage Act       is critically needed to address. And we urge you equally       strongly to reject any and all carveouts for certain       employers or certain types of employees. Equal pay for women       requires a single, fair, and decent federal wage floor for       all working people across the country--including the tipped       workers, young workers, and workers with disabilities who       have been harmed by exclusionary policies for generations.        Women and people of color have been left behind by our       economy and our policies far too often, for far too long.       Adopting the Raise the Wage Act will mark a vitally important       step toward ensuring they can work with equity, dignity, and       safety. We urge you to pass the Raise the Wage Act on the       House floor and reject any alternative, or any amendments       that would reduce its strength or scope.            Sincerely,                                                Emily J. Martin,                                        Vice President for Education      & Workplace Justice.                                   ____                                              Lawyers' Committee for                                          Civil Rights Under Law,                                                      July 12, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative, On behalf of the Lawyers' Committee       for Civil Rights Under Law (hereinafter ``Lawyers''       Committee''), a nonpartisan civil rights organization formed       at the request of President Kennedy to enlist the private bar       in providing legal services to address racial discrimination,       we urge you to vote for H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act, and       against any motion to recommit (MTR) the bill. The Raise the       Wage Act is a necessary step to increase the federal minimum       wage, which has remained at $7.25 per hour for ten years, and       phase out the subminimum wage for tipped workers, which has       been frozen at $2.13 for nearly three decades. The Act would       raise wages for millions of workers of color and reverse the       growing trend of pay inequality that disproportionately       impacts African Americans, Hispanics and other people of       color.        The Lawyers' Committee strongly believes the Raise the Wage       Act is an essential step towards reducing pay inequality and       achieving economic security for communities of color. Our       economy has grown immensely over the past several decades,       but wages have not--particularly for people of color. Workers       of color are more likely to be among the working poor, with       African American and Hispanic women respectively making up       10.5% and 9.6%, compared to 4.9% of white women.       Additionally, people of color disproportionately live in       poverty, with 20% of African Americans and 16% of Hispanics       living in poverty compared to 8% of whites. With the Raise       the Wage Act, nearly two-fifths of African Americans and one-      third of Hispanics would receive a raise, lifting many of       these families out of poverty and ensuring they can work with       equity, dignity and safety.        We urge you to vote for final passage of the Raise the Wage       Act and against any motion to recommit because all workers,       especially workers of color, need and deserve adequate wages       to achieve economic security.            Respectfully submitted,                                                     Kristen Clark,      President & Executive Director.                                   ____                                                      July 16, 2019.        The undersigned organizations enthusiastically support the       Raise the Wage Act of 2019, introduced by Senators Bernie       Sanders (VT) and Patty Murray (WA), Representatives Robert C.       ``Bobby'' Scott (VA), Mark Pocan (WI) and Stephanie Murphy       (FL).        If enacted, this legislation would:         Gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an       hour in 2025;         After 2025, adjust the minimum wage each year to       keep pace with growth in the typical worker's wages;         Phase out the outdated subminimum wage for tipped       workers, which has been frozen at a meager $2.13 since 1991;       and,         Sunset the much criticized ability of employers to       pay workers with disabilities a subminimum wage through       certificates issued by DOL.         Phase out the subminimum wage for workers under       the age of 20.        At a time when wage stagnation and income inequality pose       serious threats to our families and our economy, the Raise       the Wage Act of 2019 will begin to reverse that cycle and       raise pay broadly across the bottom of the workforce.       According to the Economic Policy Institute, this Act will       deliver long-overdue raises to more than 1 in 4 workers, 90%       of whom are over the age of 20. The average age of workers       who would get a raise is 35, nearly half have some years of       college education. In fact, those who work year-round would       see a raise in the order of $3,000 a year, which is enough to       make a tremendous difference in the life of a preschool       teacher, bank teller, or fastfood worker who today struggles       to get by on around $20,000 per year.        28 percent are working parents with children, and half have       family incomes of less than $40,000 per year. Women make up       nearly 58 percent of the workers who would benefit from a $15       minimum wage, which would be instrumental in helping to close       the gender-wage-gap. Raising the minimum wage to $15 would       also significantly benefit workers of color, with 38 percent       of African American workers and 33 percent of Latinos seeing       a pay increase once this law goes into effect.        These are the frontline workers who make America run--yet       due to the erosion of the real value of the minimum wage over       the last half century, they are struggling even as our       economy enjoys a solid recovery.        The time for the Raise the Wage Act is long overdue, and we       cannot delay in working toward its passage. We call on       Congress to enact this important piece of legislation as       quickly as possible, and for President Trump to sign it when       it comes to his desk.

Dr. William J. Barber II)         This week, the House of Representatives will have a chance       to end a pernicious legacy of slavery. Lawmakers will vote on       the Raise the Wage Act, which would boost the minimum wage       across the country to $15 an hour by 2024. This would be a       crucial step toward the first federal minimum wage increase       in more than a decade.        A just-released Congressional Budget Office report finds       that a $15 minimum wage would have tremendous benefits for       low-wage workers of all races and ethnicities. Yet the stakes       are particularly high for black workers. The share who would       benefit from the Raise the Wage Act is far larger than the       share of white workers who would benefit--38 percent compared       with 23 percent.        There's another provision in the legislation--eliminating       the subminimum tipped wage--that corrects a wrong that goes       much further back than the previous federal minimum wage       increase. For workers regularly making more than $30 a month       in tips, employers can currently pay as little as $2.13 an       hour. That subminimum wage has been frozen at this level for       decades. Should the Raise the Wage Act pass the House, it       will mark the first time that either chamber of Congress has       moved to eliminate the subminimum wage, which not only       deepens economic inequalities but also happens to be a relic       of slavery.        You might not think of tipping as a legacy of slavery, but       it has a far more racialized history than most Americans       realize. Tipping originated in feudal Europe and was imported       back to the United States by American travelers eager to seem       sophisticated. The practice spread throughout the country       after the Civil War as U.S. employers, largely in the       hospitality sector, looked for ways to avoid paying formerly       enslaved workers.        One of the most notorious examples comes from the Pullman       Company, which hired newly freed African American men as       porters. Rather than paying them a real wage, Pullman       provided the black porters with just a meager pittance,       forcing them to rely on tips from their white clientele for       most of their pay.        Tipping further entrenched a unique and often racialized       class structure in service jobs, in which workers must please       both customer and employer to earn anything at all. A       journalist quoted in Kerry Segrave's 2009 book, Tipping: An       American Social History of Gratuities, wrote in 1902 that he       was embarrassed to offer a tip to a white man. ``Negroes take       tips, of course; one expects that of them--it is a token of       their inferiority,'' he wrote. ``Tips go with servility, and       no man who is a voter in this country is in the least       justified in being in service.''        The immorality of paying an insufficient wage to workers,       who then were forced to rely on tips, was acknowledged at the       time. In his popular 1916 anti-tipping study, The Itching       Palm, writer William Scott described tipping as an       aristocratic custom that went against American ideals. ``The       relation of a man giving a tip and a man accepting it is as       undemocratic as the relation of master and slave,'' Scott       wrote. ``A citizen in a republic ought to stand shoulder to       shoulder with every other citizen, with no thought of       cringing, without an assumption of superiority or an       acknowledgment of inferiority.''        Several states sought to end the practice in the early       1900s, often in recognition of its racist roots. But the       restaurant industry fought back and was powerful enough to       roll back local bans on tipping. And tipped workers--along       with most others, as the act applied to industries that       together made up only one-fifth of the labor force--were       excluded from the first, limited federal minimum wage law       passed in 1938.        It took until 1966 for advocates to win a base wage for       tipped workers, and that amounted to only 50 percent of the       minimum wage already guaranteed to other workers. Congress       continued to raise the subminimum tipped wage until 1996,       when Herman Cain, who headed the National Restaurant       Association at the time, offered legislators a bargain: The       industry would accept a small increase in the minimum wage as       long as the tipped wage was frozen at $2.13 an hour.        Congress agreed to the deal, and the tipped minimum wage       remains just $2.13 to this day. Employers are supposed to pay       the difference if tips don't bring workers to the full       regular minimum wage. But too often that law is not enforced.       When the Department of Labor conducted an unusual compliance       sweep of 9,000 full-service restaurants between 2010 and       2012, they found that 84 percent had violated the subminimum       wage system.        A century later, the industry lobby continues its fight to       uphold this two-tiered pay system. Where social movements       have gotten cities to pass minimum wage hikes, the lobby has       pressured state legislatures to ban local wage increases       altogether. The industry also fought to overturn voter-      approved initiatives in Maine and Washington, D.C., that       would have ended the subminimum tipped wage, while they       lobbied legislators in Michigan to keep the issue from       reaching the ballot in the first place.        That's why national action to finally reverse this       particular vestige of slavery is so vital. No one can live on       $2.13 an hour--a poverty wage.        We may live in a very different society from 150 years ago,       but the subminimum tipped wage still exacerbates the       inequalities passed down from that time. Workers in the       restaurant industry are far more likely to be poor or near-      poor than the general population. Sure, upscale restaurants       where wealthy patrons offer servers good tips on expensive       menu items can provide a good living, but those jobs are few       and far between--and dominated by white men.        Research also shows that tipping itself has a racial       component: Customers generally give white workers bigger tips       than black workers, regardless of service quality. Thanks in       part to segregation within the industry and discrimination       from patrons, restaurant worker poverty rates are highest for       women and people of color.        Ending the subminimum wage would right one of the       historical wrongs keeping certain groups of workers from       receiving the full protections they are due, but ultimately,       low wages driven by racism hurt workers of all races. Three       times as many white workers as black workers stand to get a       raise if the federal minimum wage hike passes. Undoing       systemic racism opens up opportunities for all people.        With a Republican Senate and president, the Raise the Wage       Act might not become national law in the immediate future.       But a vote by the House to end the subminimum tipped wage       would send an unmistakable signal to the several states       considering similar legislation: The days of these racist       tiered wage systems are coming to an end.     Will the Chair please tell me how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that  youth workers--we have heard about youth workers--should not be paid  less for the same work than anyone else. Several of my colleagues have  pointed out that there may be a $9 billion loss in income. According to  the CBO, that comes from families making more than $232,000 a year.  Families making less than that will get an increase in pay.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of my colleagues, including members  of the Committee on Education and Labor and Representatives across the  Nation who have been instrumental in advancing this legislation. But  most of all, I want to recognize the workers in communities across the  country who stood up and demanded a fair day's pay for a fair day's  work. There are some of them with us today, the Fight for $15 workers,  the SEIU workers, and others from across the country.   I also want to acknowledge a broad coalition of business support,  including Business for a Fair Minimum Wage and the U.S. Women's Chamber  of Commerce.   Proposals to increase the minimum wage are always met with the same  baseless predictions we have heard today. Opponents cried wolf in the  1930s, and we should not fear the impact of putting money in workers'  pockets or, as President Roosevelt said in a fireside chat way back in  1938: ``Do not let any calamity-howling executive with an income of  $1,000 a day . . . tell you . . . that a wage of $11 a week is going to  have a disastrous effect on all American industry.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take that advice, pass the Raise  the Wage Act and give a raise to 33 million Americans. It is a raise  that is long overdue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 582.
