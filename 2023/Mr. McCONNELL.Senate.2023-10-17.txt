 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, one month from now, Congress will face  another deadline to avoid a lapse in Federal Government funding.   Between now and then, the Senate needs to do our part to pass as many  full-year appropriations bills as we possibly can. First in line is the  minibus legislation that would send critical resources towards  supporting America's farmers, keeping promises to our veterans, and  rebuilding crumbling infrastructure.   Before the State work period, the Senate Republicans agreed on a list  of amendments that would allow this package to move quickly here on the  floor, and I am hopeful that the Democratic leader will call it up this  week and give the full Senate the chance to take an important step  toward funding the government.   Of course, passing the minibus is just an early step. We have a great  deal of work still ahead of us to finish the job that Senator Collins,  Senator Murray, and our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee have  been focused on, literally, for months.   And as I have said before, we also need to consider additional, time- sensitive resources for a number of supplemental priorities. But we  cannot get on with this work unless we clear an important hurdle this  week.  [[Page S5025]]
