 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise for truth and accountability. That is why we are  here. We are dealing with common criminals. You see a guy running down  the street in this city with a television on his back strapped to it,  you start to wonder. We have had enough of those incidents to indicate  to us that is what we are dealing with.   The gravest attack ever on the U.S. democracy came 288 days ago. It  was born of lies. Steve Bannon spread those poisonous lies, and Bannon  was guided by the dictator. We must pursue the truth. We go only where  the facts take us. Refusing a subpoena is obstructing justice. We don't  allow the plaintiff to prosecute or to decide. We decide it through the  courts. If you can't take the Constitution, go to Russia. It shows you  have something to hide. What are you hiding?   This is a vote of conscience.    Mr. Speaker, refusing a subpoena is obstructing  justice. This is a vote of conscience.   Do you agree with the rioting terrorists or our democracy? Are we a  country of laws or a country of men?   We must hold all involved accountable; this includes those who  attacked the police and those organizers who spread the lies, and the  President who organized it.   This is America, not Russia.                                time  1245
