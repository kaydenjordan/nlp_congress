 Mr. Speaker, it is interesting being able to listen to  this debate. The common ground is we want to be able to have consumers  have access to capital, and we also want responsible lending. We now  need to reset this debate to the reality that is being faced on the  ground.   In an already challenging loan environment for many banks nationwide,  the Madden v. Midland decision has further limited the ability of  national banks to be able to issue credit. Because of the court's  decision not to apply the valid-when-made doctrine to its decision,  which would have preserved lawful interest rates originated by a bank  for nonbanks and third parties, access to credit and risk mitigation  tools have been placed into jeopardy.    The legal uncertainty resulting from the Madden decision has led to a  reduction in responsible and affordable lending, and has limited  consumers' access to better and cheaper choices.   Fortunately, the vice chairman's legislation, the Protecting  Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017, would reassert the valid-when- made principle, to ensure that a loan that is valid at its inception  cannot become invalid or unenforceable upon a subsequent transfer to  another person or party.   This legislation promotes healthy financial markets and would help  improve the often-limiting loan environment facing banks nationwide.  This  [[Page H1152]]  measure is important for our families and small businesses, for whom  access to credit is critical to success.   Further, this legislation ensures that innovative marketplace lending  remains intact while simultaneously providing safe consumer  protections.   I would like to thank Mr. McHenry for supporting and developing this  bipartisan legislation to be able to help preserve access to credit for  those who need it most, and I encourage my colleagues to support the  measure here today.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard those of us who are opposed to this  legislation repeat over and over again that this is all about predatory  lending; that this bill would open the gates wide to the kind of abuses  that we have been fighting so hard against.   Mrs. MALONEY asked the questions: Why do you want to do this to your  constituents? Why do you want to do this to the very consumers that we  are supposed to be protecting?   I have raised a question to those who come from States where the  attorneys general oppose this legislation. The gentlemen from North  Carolina and Pennsylvania, who are here in support of this bill, they  are ignoring the fact that their State attorneys general are saying  that this bill is a bad bill.   Of course, if H.R. 3299 was really about expanding access to  underserved populations, as the proponents claim, then they may be  surprised to learn that the Nation's leading civil and consumer groups  are all opposed to this legislation because it will harm consumers, not  help them.                                time  1445    According to a news article from last November, there is a reason the  NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Consumer Law  Center, the Consumer Federation of America, and dozens of churches,  women's groups, and antipoverty organizations from around the country  have denounced the bill.   In September, those groups wrote a joint letter to Congress warning  that H.R. 3299 ``wipes away the strongest available tool against  predatory lending practices'' and ``will open the floodgates to a wide  range of predatory actors to make loans at 300 percent annual interest  or higher.''   The article goes on to say: ``But you don't have to take the NAACP's  word for it, just take a look at the companies who are lobbying in  favor of H.R. 3299.''   Well, they aren't many, as it is a complicated and obscure issue. But  one of them, according to a Federal lobbying disclosure form, is a firm  called CNU Online Holdings, LLC. Most customers of CNU Online Holdings  don't even realize they use it. They are more familiar with CNU's  parent company, payday lending giant Enova Financial; or its flagship  brand, CashNetUSA.   The bottom line is that this bill is not helping our consumers, but,  rather, lining the pockets of predatory lenders who are looking for any  way around State interest rate caps and consumer protections.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
