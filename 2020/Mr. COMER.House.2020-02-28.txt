 Madam Speaker, few would deny that we are facing a  dangerous epidemic of youth vaping.   But the bill before us today is not about youth vaping. Instead, this  legislation seeks to eliminate consumer choice of flavored tobacco  products for law-abiding adults over the age of 21.   With this bill Democrats are seeking to play politics with a crisis  and ram through an extreme, partisan measure that is government  overreach at its finest.   We should be focused on reducing youth consumption and removing  counterfeit products from the market. That is what this debate should  focus on, not reducing the freedoms of law-abiding adults.  Unfortunately, Democrats are making clear that they are uninterested in  further action to reduce youth tobacco use. By banning flavored tobacco  products and the sale of menthol cigarettes for adults, they are  seeking to destroy consumer freedom in this country.   Thankfully, if this bill were to pass today, this anti-consumer  choice overreach will be stopped in its tracks in the Senate.
