 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Republicans'  plan to avoid a Federal default, to rein in spending, and get our  economy back on track: The Limit, Save, Grow Act.   Over the last 2 years, Democrats' out-of-control spending has  drastically and dramatically increased our 10-year spending trajectory.  That includes the $2 trillion misnamed American Rescue Plan that  ignited the highest rise in consumer prices and inflation in 40 years.  Americans are paying the price for this radical spending that  completely bloated our Federal spending.   House Republicans are committed to finding a sensible debt ceiling  solution that will strengthen the American economy, protect American  families, and save taxpayers over $4 trillion over the next 10 years.   The Limit, Save, Grow Act will do the following:   It will limit Washington's irresponsible spending.   It will save taxpayer dollars.   It will grow the American economy.   House Republicans are the only ones who have actually put forward a  plan that will keep our Federal Government from defaulting. It is time  for President Biden to come to the table and negotiate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  legislation that will help families, businesses, and farmers in west  Tennessee and across the Nation.
