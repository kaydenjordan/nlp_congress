 Mr. Speaker, May is Foster Care Month  and a time to recognize the almost 800,000 foster youth in America.  During this month, we renew our commitment to ensuring that every child  has a safe, loving family. I am a member of the Congressional Caucus on  Foster Youth, and also had a foster brother growing up. He is still my  brother today.   I know firsthand how a loving, supportive home can make all the  difference in a young person's life. Every child deserves to grow up  healthy and safe. We know that when children grow up in stable  households, they are much more likely to succeed as adults.   This month, we both recommit ourselves to ensuring that every child  has access to the promise of the American Dream while honoring the  countless professionals and individuals who make selfless sacrifices to  make this promise a reality.   Mr. Speaker, today is Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day. More  than 100 foster youth from across the country will be here in Congress  spending the day with Members of Congress. Shadow Day allows foster  youth to share their experiences in foster care directly with Congress  to help inform and improve child welfare policy. The child welfare  system directly impacts their lives, so it is important foster youth  voices are heard here in Congress.   Today, I am proud to have Lawrence White with me as a part of Shadow  Day. Lawrence is a 22-year-old from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was in  the foster care system from the time he was 10 years old until the time  he turned 20. That is when he aged out of the system.   During those 10 years, Lawrence shuffled between 19 different homes  and placements. Despite moving so often, Lawrence was able to stay in  programs that he enjoyed, such as theater and church activities. He  said such activities kept him grounded, or, as he puts it, ``I was  fortunate enough to remain humble and beat the odds.''   Mr. Speaker, the experiences of youth who transition out of the  foster care system without a permanent home place them at a higher risk  of unemployment, poor educational outcomes, health issues, early  parenthood, long-term dependency on public assistance, increased rates  of incarceration, and homelessness. But, as Lawrence said: He beat the  odds.   Lawrence graduated from high school and earned a scholarship to  attend Point Park University in Pittsburgh. He now works as a youth  support partner with young people in the foster care system.   He currently attends Daytona State College, where his future goal is  to become a business owner and an author. I have no doubt that the  future is bright for Lawrence.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that I can spend time today with Lawrence  and hear about how we can improve the foster care system, because every  child deserves a safe, supportive, and permanent family.        Thanking the USO for Its Commitment to American ServiceMembers     Mr. Speaker, the USO was on Capitol  Hill yesterday for a service project where volunteers can assemble  snack packs for servicemembers who are currently deployed. More than  2,000 snack packs were assembled as a part of the Force Behind the  Forces campaign.   The USO strengthens America's military servicemembers by keeping them  connected to family, home, and country throughout their service to the  Nation. USO has more than 200 locations around the globe. It serves 4.9  million Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve members and their families.   For more than 75 years, the USO has been by the side of America's  military servicemembers. From the moment they join, through their  assignments and deployments, and as they transition back to their  communities, the USO has been there.   There are USO centers at or near military installations across the  United States and throughout the world, including in combat zones, and  even un-staffed USO service sites in places too dangerous for anyone  but combat troops to occupy.  [[Page H4586]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank the USO for its dedication to our servicemembers  and their families.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor this  year's Penn Brad Oil Museum's annual Yellow Dog Winner, Joyce Cline.   Joyce has provided exceptional service to the cause of preserving the  oil and gas heritage of the Bradford, Pennsylvania, region. She has  been a dedicated member of the community who has given her time and  leadership to many organizations.   Joyce graduated from Lawrence Park High School in 1959 and was a  teacher with the Bradford Area School District for 19 years.   In 1974, she married Bill Cline. He owned a small oil-producing  company, and Joyce began her journey in the oil industry. In 1982, she  joined the Derrick Club of Bradford, where she served in various roles,  including president in 1983 and 1984.   Joyce and Bill became members of the Pennsylvania Independent  Petroleum Producers Association in 1986, 1 year after the organization  was formed. This turned into a lifelong commitment for the Clines. In  2012, Joyce and Bill were honored with the Gary Hovis Memorial Award  for their service.   Mr. Speaker, throughout her life, Joyce has shown her dedication to  the industry. I wholeheartedly congratulate her on this outstanding  achievement.                            ____________________
