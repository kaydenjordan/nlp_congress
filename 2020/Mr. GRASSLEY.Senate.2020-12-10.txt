 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, I want to remind people of how Senator  Johnson and I have been attacked over the months of 2020 for some  investigation we have been doing, and I want to speak to that now.   For over a year, Senator Johnson and I investigated the Biden  financial family dealings. We found that they engaged in potential  criminal financial deals across the globe, including China, which  created counterintelligence concerns.   We showed our work, and we made our findings very public, but the  liberal media and members of the other political party chose to dismiss  our work. They even falsely claimed that our work was Russian  disinformation. I think they did this in order to protect leaders of  the other party. Those same liberal outlets that disparaged our  investigation now report that Hunter Biden's financial deals in China  raised counterintelligence concerns.   Yesterday, the Biden transition team confirmed that Hunter Biden is  under criminal investigation for his taxes and financial dealings.   So you can understand why I think it is very outrageous that the  Fourth Estate would choose to ignore facts when they are uncovered by  Republicans.   Senator Johnson and I don't do oversight work just for the fun of it.  Oversight work is serious business. It shouldn't take subpoenas and  confirmation from Hunter Biden himself to get the rest of the press to  pay attention.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
