 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I will  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize a family-owned small business, Batteries Plus Bulbs of  Bowling Green, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Since 2004, David Paschall has owned and operated a Batteries Plus  Bulbs franchise in Bowling Green, KY. As a young man, David owned and  operated a successful service station in Puryear, TN. After meeting his  wife, Dorothy, David relocated to Bowling Green in 1988. Dorothy, who  was working in Bowling Green at the time, is a Kentucky native and a  graduate of Western Kentucky University. Over the next few years, David  started working in the batteries industry. When local entrepreneur  Steve Sheldon opened a Batteries Plus Bulbs franchise in 1999, David  joined his friend as store manager. In 2004, when Steve moved on from  the company, David and Dorothy purchased the store.   Today, Batteries Plus Bulbs Bowling Green continues to thrive under  David and Dorothy's leadership. In addition to their original location,  they own and operate Batteries Plus Bulbs franchises in Elizabethtown  and Somerset, KY, and Clarksville, TN. David and Dorothy's care and  attention to detail are evident in every aspect of their business.  Their strong sense of family has built a tight-knit and supportive  team, with several long-time employees working over a decade at the  store. Customers are regularly greeted by name and treated according to  the golden rule. Finding a solution to a customer's problem is  prioritized over pushing a sale. Notably, Batteries Plus Bulbs Bowling  Green is known for its  [[Page S4587]]  beloved mascot, Morris. A rescued cat, this 13-year-old orange tabby  delights staff and visitors alike. The Bowling Green Area Chamber of  Commerce recognized David's outstanding work, naming him the 2016 Small  Business Person of the Year.   Together with his wife, Dorothy, David gives back to his community.  Locally, Batteries Plus Bulbs has sponsored several sports teams and  charitable organizations, including the Bowling Green/Warren County  Humane Society. David and Dorothy are active within their local church  community as well. Notably, Dorothy also served as executive director  of the Barren River Area Development District and was involved with the  Hospice of Southern Kentucky.   Like many small businesses, David and his team stepped up to keep  their community supplied during the COVID-19 pandemic. As an essential  business, they stayed open and adapted to State guidelines, ensuring  all of their employees stayed healthy. Despite the challenges, at the  end of 2020, Batteries Plus Bulbs Bowling Green was ranked No. 25 out  of 740 franchises nationwide by the national corporate office.   Batteries Plus Bulbs is a notable example of the endurance and  resilience of family-owned businesses. Small businesses like Batteries  Plus Bulbs form the heart of towns and cities across Kentucky,  regularly stepping up to support their communities. Congratulations to  David, Dorothy, and the entire team at Batteries Plus Bulbs Bowling  Green. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their  continued growth and success in Kentucky and beyond.                            ____________________
