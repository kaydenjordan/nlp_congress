 Madam Speaker, overturning Roe overturned  our freedom. The freedom to make our own healthcare decisions is  fundamental to our humanity and our dignity. It is about the right to  control our own lives.   It is about the mother of three who simply can't afford to care for  another child. It is about a young rape victim who shouldn't be  mandated to carry her attacker's pregnancy to term. It is about the mom  who desperately wants a baby but has a miscarriage and needs abortion  care to prevent a potentially lethal infection.   Government-mandated pregnancy, that is our new reality.   This week, House Democrats will protect access to abortion and secure  the right to reproductive care. We will fight against the Republican's  scorched earth campaign against freedom for women, freedom to practice  our faith, and freedom to make decisions for our families. We will  fight to let every person control their bodies, their choices, and  their futures.                            ____________________
