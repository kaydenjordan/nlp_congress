 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect Cristel, an attorney who came to this  country when she was only 9 years old.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman  from Oklahoma has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the  unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Hawaii  (Ms. Gabbard) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
