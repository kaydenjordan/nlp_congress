 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor and celebrate the  life of my constituent, Juan Carlos Reynaga.   Juan was 17 years old; he was a lineman for Anaheim High School  varsity football team, and he was keeping his grades up. He wanted to  become a certified crane operator after graduating from high school.   Sadly, last Friday, after working his late-night shift at Walmart,  when he was walking home, a car drove up; two individuals in the car  asked him: Are you a gangbanger? And he said: No, I am not a gang  member. They shot him in the back, anyway, killing him.   Juan was a hardworking, honest young man. He was looking for the  American Dream and working hard to achieve the American Dream. Sadly,  his life was taken from him by gangbangers.   My heart goes out to his family. As the father of four, I can't  imagine the pain and the grief of losing your child to a senseless gang  shooting.   Juan, thank you for giving us so much in your very short life.   Go Colonists.                            ____________________
