 Madam President, let me first associate myself with  the remarks of the chairman of the Finance Committee. These tax  treaties are extremely important to a number of American businesses,  and I thank him for his advocacy.                            ____________________     Madam President, the Senate and the Nation are closely  watching the situation in the Gulf. Last week, the recent recklessness  from Tehran reached a new level. Iran fired on an unmanned U.S.  intelligence aircraft that was flying over international waters. This  is as violent and dangerous an overt provocation as any nation has  aimed at the United States in, literally, years.   This is not a time for partisanship, but, unfortunately, we are  already seeing extreme voices on the far left that are so afflicted by  the ``Trump derangement syndrome'' that they repeat Iranian talking  points and advertise the absurd notion that our country, our  administration, our President are somehow to blame for Tehran's violent  aggression. Blame America first. By 2019, nobody should need a history  lesson on Iran, but, apparently, some need a refresher, because there  should be no question about who is at fault.   Iran has disregarded international law and violated the laws of armed  conflict since the first days of the Islamic Republic. Its malign  activities as the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism  include its crusade to destroy Israel, including its sponsorship of  countless terrorist attacks; the malevolence throughout the Persian  Gulf, including proxies in Yemen who have recently attacked civilian  targets; perennial threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, a key  international waterway that is essential to global commerce; and, of  course, the longstanding asymmetrical war it has waged against us that  began with the infamous takeover of the U.S. Embassy in 1979 and the  50-plus hostages who were held captive for 444 days; the provision of  weapons, training, funding, and direction to terrorist groups,  including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Taliban,  and Shiite militias in Iraq, which are responsible for the murders of  hundreds of U.S. servicemembers from Lebanon to Iraq to Afghanistan,  and more attacks plotted on U.S. targets worldwide, including in our  own homeland.    The record is blindingly obvious. It is why so many of us opposed the  Obama administration's deal with Iran. Many of us understood that the  agreement not only failed to properly address the nuclear threat but  that it also completely ignored the other threats that Iran posed to  international peace and stability. In fact, some prescient Members of  this body warned that the deal would amplify Iran's dangerous behavior.   I remember back in 2015 when the current ranking member on the  Foreign Relations Committee insisted the Obama administration's policy  would invite the kind of mess we see today.  [[Page S4476]]    Here is what he said:         If there is a fear of war in the region, it will be one       fueled by Iran and its proxies and exacerbated by an       agreement that allows Iran to possess an industrial-sized       nuclear program and enough money in sanctions relief to       significantly continue to fund its hegemonic intentions.    This was said by our colleague from New Jersey, who was the ranking  member on the Foreign Relations Committee back in 2015.   Here is my colleague from New York, the current Democratic leader,  and what he said: ``Under this agreement, Iran would receive at least  $50 billion in the near future and would undoubtedly use some of that  money to redouble its efforts to create even more trouble in the Middle  East and, perhaps, beyond.'' That was from the Democratic leader in  that same year.   He acknowledged that the hard-liners' ``No. 1 goal [is] strengthening  Iran's armed forces and pursuing even more harmful military and  terrorist actions.''   This is exactly the situation President Trump inherited in 2017, as  emboldened Tehran was committed to spending its new resources on  military capabilities, exporting terrorism, and pursuing regional  hegemony. So President Trump was right to seek a better deal and apply  maximum pressure on Tehran until it changed its destabilizing behavior.  Tough sanctions are compounding the economic pain the mullahs have  brought on their own people through corrupt mismanagement.   Iran is responding to this legitimate and judicious application of  diplomatic and economic pressure the way it has effectively operated  for years--what do they always do?--through violence, attacks against  commercial vessels in international waters, sponsored attacks against  civilian targets in the Gulf, and then last week's unprovoked attack on  our unarmed aircraft.   We face a choice here. Will we legitimize and incentivize Iran's use  of terror and aggression or will we stay resolute and apply appropriate  and proportionate pressure until Tehran respects the fundamental norms  of international behavior?   Last Thursday, President Trump consulted with a bipartisan group of  congressional leaders and national security chairmen and ranking  members. The President weighed advice from a number of sources. It is  clear he was listening to congressional leaders. Clearly, the President  wants to avoid war--hence the deliberate and judicious approach he has  taken since the shoot-down; hence his repeated efforts to give Iran's  leaders an off-ramp toward negotiations.   Nevertheless, there is a general consensus that this act of  aggression cannot stand. Tehran must understand it may not respond to  legitimate diplomatic pressure with illegitimate violence. It is in our  national security interest for the United States to deter attacks  against American forces that are operating legally in international  waters and to honor our long history of defending the freedom of the  seas and the freedom of international commerce.   Since Iran's aggression and threats to global commerce threaten  everyone, I hope all nations will join the United States and its allies  in condemning Tehran and imposing significant consequences for its  hostile acts.   Look, I understand the significant appetite in Congress for the  President to consult with us as he continues to deliberate. Obviously,  that is appropriate. My colleagues should share their views with the  administration. I understand that the Foreign Relations and Armed  Services Committees will be holding hearings with senior administration  officials after July 4. What is not productive is an effort being  promoted by the Democratic leader that would preemptively tie the hands  of our military commanders, weaken our diplomatic leverage, embolden  our adversaries, and create a dangerous precedent.   Therefore, I will strongly oppose the Udall amendment, which would  gratuitously take crucial options off the table. It would hamstring  both our commanders and our diplomats, all of whose leverage depends on  the knowledge that the United States reserves the right to act  forcefully if and when necessary.   Ten years ago, my friend the Democratic leader said verbatim: ``When  it comes to Iran, we should never take the military option off the  table.'' That is exactly what the amendment he supports would do.   Nearly every President has utilized a limited use of force against  adversaries without pre-authorization from Congress. Nearly every  President has done that. Of course, major hostilities require  congressional concurrence and the support of the American people. So  the Democrats should stop their fear mongering because no one is  calling for major military operations--not the President, not his  military commanders, not the Republicans in Congress.   This amendment would impose unprecedented limitations that would go  far beyond the War Powers Resolution. As drafted, it could prevent U.S.  military forces from defending themselves against an attack or  conducting a timely counterattack. If we had actionable intelligence  that an attack were imminent, it would prevent U.S. forces from doing  anything about it. If Israel were attacked, it would prevent U.S.  forces from providing immediate assistance to our closest ally in the  region.   This amendment flies in the face of many Democrats' past clarity  about Iran, and it casts doubt on our seriousness in defending our own  military personnel, much less the freedom of the seas.   The Democrats must set aside the habit of unthinking, reflexive  opposition to every single thing this President does. That is why I  call it the Trump derangement syndrome. Perhaps it would help if they  were reminded of what the Democratic candidate for President in 2016  had to say about what her policy would have been toward Iran and the  Gulf had she been elected.   Here is what Hillary Clinton had to say:         I will reaffirm that the Persian Gulf is a region of vital       interest to the United States. . . . We'll keep the Strait of       Hormuz open. We'll increase security cooperation with our       Gulf allies, including intelligence sharing, military       support, and missile defense to ensure they can defend       against Iranian aggression, even if that takes the form of       cyberattacks or other nontraditional threats.    She went on:         Iran should understand that the United States, and I as       President, will not stand by as our Gulf allies and partners       are threatened.    She concluded by saying:         We will act.    That was from Hillary Clinton.   So nearly every word of that statement accurately describes the  policy the Trump administration has pursued for the last 2 years.   Our Gulf allies and partners are threatened by Iran. Israel is  threatened by Iran. The Strait of Hormuz is threatened by Iran. And  America has been attacked by Iran. The threat is not in doubt. The  question is whether Democrats still mean what they said or whether they  completely changed their minds about how the U.S. must respond simply  because--simply because--the White House has changed parties.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a related matter, this week the  Senate is considering the National Defense Authorization Act. The  current situation with Iran is a stark reminder of our urgent  responsibility to ensure our military remains equipped and ready to  deter threats and defeat potential challenges to our security.   When we pass the NDAA this week, the Senate will extend a 58-year  tradition of authorizing the resources U.S. forces need to stay on the  cutting edge. And I hope we will do so with wide, bipartisan support.   This year's NDAA directs $750 billion to fund the priorities of the  Department of Defense, from the Navy's fleet strength to missile  defense capabilities. It increases procurement for critical weapons  systems, doubles down on research and development of next-generation  technologies, and makes new investments in training and support  services for servicemembers and their families.   In short, this is legislation that sends a clear signal to our men  and women in uniform and to the rest of the world. Here is what it  says: The United States  [[Page S4477]]  takes today's challenges seriously. We take our commitments seriously.  And we take our defense seriously.   So especially in light of current events, I was incredulous to hear  the Democratic leader call yesterday to postpone moving forward with  the NDAA. Apparently, some of our Democratic friends need to go hit the  Presidential campaign trail. They can't be here because they have to go  campaign for not 1 day but 2 this week. They are too busy to stay in  the Senate and authorize the resources that our All-Volunteer Armed  Forces rely on. Postpone legislation on our national defense to  accommodate the Presidential race in the middle of this ongoing crisis  overseas? Come on. Come on.   I am sorry our Democratic friends feel compelled to skip out so they  can compete for the favor of ``the resistance.'' The rest of us, the  Republican majority--we are going to be right here. We are going to be  right here working and voting to make America stronger and safer.   Of course, the NDAA does not exhaust the urgent priorities we should  attend to this week. As my Republican colleagues and I have been  arguing for 2 months now--2 months--Congress must address the  humanitarian crisis down on the southern border. The situation is well  documented. Nobody is in doubt.   For months, record numbers of people have arrived at the border,  overwhelming--completely overwhelming agencies and facilities. The  Department of Homeland Security has had to redirect resources and  personnel from other critical missions to assist the Border Patrol. The  Secretary of Health and Human Services has said: ``We are running out  of money.'' This is the Secretary of Health and Human Services. ``We  are functionally out of space.''   I was encouraged last week when badly needed emergency funding  finally garnered some momentum. Under the leadership of Chairman Shelby  and Senator Leahy, the Appropriations Committee approved funding 30 to  1. That is about as close to bipartisan as it could ever get.   There is no reason, no excuse, why this noncontroversial measure  should not get a similar, overwhelmingly bipartisan vote here on the  floor this week--this week, not some other time. Actually, there is no  reason it shouldn't happen today. Partisan delays have exacerbated this  crisis long enough. It is well past time my Democratic colleagues stop  standing in the way and let the Senate get this done.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, June 26; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate resume  consideration of S. 1790; finally, that notwithstanding the provisions  of rule XXII, the cloture motions filed during Monday's session ripen  at 12 noon tomorrow.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order following the remarks of Senators Fischer, Risch, and Brown.
