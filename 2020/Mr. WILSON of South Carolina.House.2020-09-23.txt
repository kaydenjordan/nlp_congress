 Mr. Speaker, the Post and Courier of  Charleston on September 19 editorialized ``Good news at last from the  Middle East.''   ``A series of friendship treaties between Bahrain and the United Arab  Emirates with Israel, midwifed by his (Trump's) unorthodox Middle East  diplomatic team, provides constructive news from a region that sorely  needs it.''   ``With strong support from his first United Nations ambassador, Nikki  Haley, Mr. Trump rejected his predecessor's ambiguous stance toward  Israel and strongly supported the Jewish nation. With worries  increasing about Iranian aggression and power, some Arab nations began  looking at Israel as a potential ally rather than an enemy.''   ``But Mr. Trump has been constructive in limiting Iranian  interference in Iraq and promoting friendship between Israel and major  Sunni Arab nations . . . he deserves credit for seizing the moment to  take an important step toward creating a more peaceful region.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.  [[Page H4725]]                                ____________________
