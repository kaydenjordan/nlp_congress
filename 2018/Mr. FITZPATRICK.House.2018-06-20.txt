 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of several young people in Bucks County, Pennsylvania,  who are advocating for environmental protection using their artistic  talents.   Recently, the Countryside Gallery in Newtown featured an exhibit,  titled, ``One Planet: Wildlife Vulnerable to Climate Change.'' This  exhibit gave students, under the guidance of artist Bonnie Porter, the  ability to share their wildlife paintings in an effort to spread  awareness of the threat of climate change. I am proud to recognize them  now:   Amelia Binkley, Bella Cacciatore, Allison Cirillo, Victoria Cirillo,  Taylor Dahms, Amanda Gardner, Olivia Kelly, Brady Klein, Addison  Kohler, Emily LaPlante, Kate Logan, Jessica Martin, Nicole Mercora,  Grace Porter, Olivia Ralston, Nolan Riesenberger, Chris Riether, Violet  Schroeher, Gabi Smith, Abby Steadman, Erin Stone, Katie Sukunda, Ella  Walsh, and Anna Williamson.   Madam Speaker, I applaud the activism, thoughtfulness, and impressive  artistic abilities of these young citizens. I am proud to stand with  them and will continue to fight with my colleagues to combat climate  change and protect our environment.        Recognizing Bucks County Outstanding Law Enforcement Officials     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of two  outstanding law enforcement officials in Bucks County, Pennsylvania,  who are working tirelessly to make our community a safer place.  Assistant District Attorney Megan Brooks and Deputy District Attorney  Kristen McElroy were selected by fellow prosecutors in honor of their  public service in pursuit of justice.   Megan received the Danny E. Khalouf Memorial Award for Outstanding  Performance. Described as a rising star, Megan works for the Youthful  Offender program and the Special Victims Unit.   Kristen received the Robert Rosner Memorial Award for Exceptional  Service, Professionalism and Integrity. Known for her unparalleled work  ethic, Kristen is the chief of the Special Victims Unit for adult sex  crimes and directs the internship program.   I commend these fine public servants for their dedication to law, to  safety, and to protecting our community.   I applaud District Attorney Matt Weintraub for leading such a fine  team of attorneys that work tirelessly on behalf of all of us in Bucks  County.                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month     Madam Speaker, June is Post-Traumatic Stress  Disorder Awareness Month, and I would like to take this time to  recognize an organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that works to  rehabilitate heroes who struggle with this illness.   Since 2014, Shamrock Reins in Pipersville has offered equine therapy  to help veterans and first responders recover from PTSD.   Founded by Janet Brennan, a registered nurse whose father served in  the Vietnam war, Shamrock Reins uses a range of equine services,  including riding therapy, to help assimilate our servicemen and -women  back into society following their tours of duty.   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am continually in  awe of the sacrifices that our soldiers and our first responders make  every day. I applaud Janet for her service to our Nation's heroes, and  I encourage all of our constituents to follow her lead. Together, we  can defeat PTSD.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I intend to withdraw the amendment, but I want to take  a moment to highlight an issue of critical importance to my home State  of Pennsylvania where communities across the Commonwealth have been  suffering from the scourge of the opioid crisis.   First, I want to thank the committee for tackling the IMD exclusion  problem. We must ensure access to treatment to get people suffering  with addiction on the road to recovery. Going forward, we must ensure  that States have the flexibility that they need to provide access to  treatment and not unintentionally create obstacles or bureaucratic  barriers to care.   This is exactly what I had in mind when I introduced my Road to  Recovery Act last year. I worked with various stakeholders across the  Nation and in Pennsylvania, including Pennsylvania State Representative  Gene DiGirolamo and Deb Beck, the head of the Drug and Alcohol Service  Providers Organization of Pennsylvania.   I determined that States deliberately tailoring criteria to meet  their unique situation, whether it be specific local realities or  socioeconomic factors, need flexibility and should not be bound solely  to the proprietary criteria of one organization--which, in fact,  endorsed my Road to Recovery Act that included this same State  flexibility criteria provision.   I am concerned for Pennsylvania and other similarly situated States  that could be left behind, especially in the public patient and  residential treatment context.   For instance, in Pennsylvania, we currently use the Pennsylvania  client placement criteria tool for determining the appropriate level of  care for an individual seeking treatment or already within  Pennsylvania's treatment system. And there are simply differences  between the ASAM standard specified in this bill and the criteria used  by my home State of Pennsylvania.   Additionally, in States that may be transitioning to the ASAM  guidelines, much work is needed to implement these changes. So, States  need the flexibility and assurances to be able to address facility  needs during this transition period. This would ensure access to care  if the State sees a necessity for it.   Furthermore, the CMS guidance for the States applying for 1115  waivers already gives the ability to use either the ASAM criteria or  other patient placement assessment tools.   A manual published by SAMHSA discusses the ASAM criteria and notes  the following: ``. . . The ASAM criteria were not as applicable to  publicly funded programs as to hospitals, practices of private  practitioners, group practices, or other medical settings. Therefore,  some States supplemented or adapted ASAM criteria.''   The same manual goes on to say that several States have adopted  variations of the ASAM criteria to fit their systems and that many  States have made significant improvements in the ASAM criteria to make  them more appropriate to their systems and easier to use.                                time  1430    So as you can see, Mr. Chairman, one size, or, in this case, one  criteria, might not fit all for States that need  [[Page H5342]]  to tailor their criteria for their specific public health needs.   I look forward to working with the committee and with the Senate in  conference to ensure that States have the flexibility that they need to  provide access to care.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden).    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the remarks from the  chairman.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.
