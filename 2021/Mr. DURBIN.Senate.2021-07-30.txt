 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this has been a sad week in the U.S.  Senate.   First, we lost Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming and last night brought  news of the passing of Senator Carl Levin of Michigan.   Carl was an extraordinary Senator and an extraordinary person. I  remember after I had been in the Senate a few years, my friends back  home said: Well, who are the real stars of the U.S. Senate?   There were many who were as obvious as could be, Ted Kennedy, for  example. I said: There are two you probably don't know much about that  I would turn to time and again if I had to make an important decision,  either policy or politics, that I know I would get a thoughtful,  intelligent response. One was Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, and the other  was Carl Levin of Michigan. Those two, more than many of the colleagues  I served with, really represented the best of the U.S. Senate.   Carl Levin was brilliant, nothing short of brilliant, and he was my  friend. Many times we sat together and talked. I reflected on the way  he approached legislation. Many of us think about the big-picture items  and leave the details to staff--not Carl. Somebody would bring an  amendment to the floor. Carl would say: I would like to get a copy of  that. That, in itself, is unusual. We usually trust our staff to look  at copies of amendments.   Then he would say, as he read the amendment: Can I take this home  tonight and read it and tell you what I think about it in the morning?  You knew that wasn't a pose; that was a fact. Carl took his job that  seriously.   He served in the Senate, representing his beloved State of Michigan,  for 36 years. When he retired in 2014, he left a legacy in the Senate,  certainly, of important and good legislation but, more importantly, of  the image of a real Senator. He left a powerful example of what we can  achieve in life and in politics when we choose integrity over ideology  and common good over confrontation. His keen intellect, his honesty and  fairmindedness, decency and unfailing civility earned him the respect  of Senators on both sides of the aisle.   The list of laws that he can claim to have authored is long and  historic.   If you knew his background, you understood where this man came from  and what made him what he was in the Senate.   First and foremost, he was a son of Detroit, MI. He showed up in  Washington in 1979. He was driving a 1974 American-made Dodge Dart with  a hole in the floorboard. He was still driving that car 10 years later.  That is how devoted he was to the U.S. auto industry, its workers, and  unions.   He wasn't flashy. I don't think he owned a shirt of any other color  than white. And when we would go on the informal weekends with our  families, he would be wearing a white shirt, which he rolled the cuffs  up on to merely let his hair down and be informal. He was just that  humble a man.   But when General Motors and Chrysler faced potential collapse in  2008, he knew what he had to do. He pressed Congress and the new  President to support those companies with billions of dollars in loans,  and thank God he did. He saved jobs and saved companies that are still  major players in the industry. By the time he retired 6 years later,  the loans to those companies had been paid off, and the companies were  earning record profits.    His work on the Armed Services Committee is known to all. For 36  years, he served on that committee. He was the champion of America's  military and military families and veterans and one of Congress's most  respected voices on national security and the military issues. He voted  for the repeal of don't ask, don't tell when it was far from a popular  thing to do anywhere, and he voted against the war in Iraq. I felt  honored to be joining him in that vote. He and I were 2 of only 23  Senators who voted no on that, sadly, misguided war, and I will tell  you for sure, before I made a final decision, I sat down in that seat  right--I can see it from here, right next to Carl Levin--and we talked  about what it meant. It was amazing. I was making that decision before  an election, just a few weeks, but he was making that decision as  chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was a brave vote,  and history has shown that he was right.   A Jewish publication in Detroit once wrote that Carl Levin and his  brother--my pal--former Congressman Sandy Levin, both deserved what  they called ``honorable menschen awards,'' with the accent on  ``mensch,'' for their historic service to America. I couldn't agree  more.   Loretta and I extend our deepest condolences to Sandy and the entire  Levin family, especially to Carl's beloved wife Barbara, their children  and grandchildren.   And to their cousin Dan Levin, my pal in Chicago, IL, I know how  proud the Levin family was of their name and reputation. It was well  earned in whatever they chose to do--law, politics, business. Carl  Levin was a great man and a good friend. I will truly miss him.                                 Immigration    Madam President, last night, we had an opportunity. We sat down with  the President of the United States for more than an hour. We were  discussing with him and with Vice President Harris our Nation's need  for immigration reform.   The Presiding Officer was there, Senator Menendez, Senator Lujan,  Senator Padilla, along with our colleagues in the House. We got to  speak to the President in a very informal setting.   I want to thank President Biden for taking the time to meet with us.  He could have taken the whole day on a victory lap in the Senate after  passing the historic infrastructure plan or at least starting the  debate on it 2 nights ago. But instead President Biden said: I want to  meet with you. He gave us his undivided attention for more than an  hour. That is because President Biden understands that we cannot wait  any longer to fix America's broken immigration system.   It has been 35 years--35 years--since we passed any meaningful  immigration bill. We passed it here. It was known at the time as the  Simpson-Mazzoli bill, and it was sent to President Ronald Reagan, who  signed it. Critics of what was signed called it amnesty, but it was a  sincere and bipartisan effort to deal with a broken immigration system.  We have since learned that the immigration system is broken again in  many significant ways. This effort that we are discussing now has been  decades in the making.   Back when we passed that original immigration reform under President  Reagan, our adversary in the world was the Soviet Union. ``Top Gun''  was the most popular movie in America. Under the last administration,  our broken immigration system absolutely collapsed. Former President  Donald Trump's zero-tolerance policy at the southern border was not  only inhumane, it was ineffective. It made our Nation weaker and less  safe.   The hatred that many people in the Trump administration had for  immigrants was palpable. I can go through the list of names, but I  don't want to give them any satisfaction to hear their names on the  floor of the Senate. But what they think of people who were not lucky  enough to be born in America is just sad, in many ways, disgusting.   Some of my Republican colleagues have tried to blame President Biden,  who has been in office for 6 months, with the failure of our  immigration system, but the reality is Donald Trump was the one who  provoked the crisis at our border.  [[Page S5200]]    Do you remember the speeches when he talked about all the rapists and  murderers who were coming in, wanting to live in the United States? Do  you remember what he did to our Muslim friends and their families when  he cut off immigration from their countries?   His administration implemented policies that blocked nearly all  claims by asylum seekers. They also prevented members of law  enforcement from exercising prosecutorial discretion, which made it  harder for ICE and DHS to apprehend true criminals. Former President  Trump's hate-based policies created a massive bottleneck at our border  and a giant backlog of cases that our courts are still working through.   President Biden understands that closing our doors to families and  children fleeing violence is not only cruel and inhumane, it is not  good policy. And it is contrary to the values of this country. The  stories are legendary about when the United States closed its borders  in World War II under a Democratic President, Franklin Roosevelt,  turning away people who were escaping the Nazis in Europe, sending them  back to their deaths in the Holocaust.   We learned a bitter lesson during that war that that is not what the  United States is all about. And we have tried to make it up ever since,  trying to lead the world when it came to refugees embraced in America.  And those refugees have proven over and over again that they are  positive influences on this Nation.   The Biden administration is bringing order to immigration  enforcement, and it will take some time, but it is on its way. Since  President Biden took office, roughly 7 in 10 individuals apprehended at  our border have been denied entry into the country--7 out of 10. You  wouldn't know that from the speeches given on the other side.  Of course, there should be exceptions to the policy, humanitarian  exceptions. Our Nation has a moral obligation, a moral responsibility,  to provide refuge to families and unaccompanied children fleeing gang  violence, natural disasters, paramilitary violence, and other crises.    This is at the heart of our values as a nation, and under President  Biden's leadership, our Nation is no longer tearing babies away from  mothers' arms.   I just read a story in the newspaper yesterday about efforts that are  being made in Guatemala and other countries, going deep into the  forests and jungles to try to find families whose children were taken  away from them by the policies of the previous administration. The  lengths we are going to, to try to reunite them, were totally  unnecessary if they had just kept records of the families and children,  but they tore these kids away from their mothers and had no plan at all  to reunite them.   President Biden also recognizes that just fixing the mess of Donald  Trump is not enough. We need to provide a path to citizenship for  Dreamers and others who make our economy better every day and who help  over the years to add to its growth. The vast majority of Americans  agree with this--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Tens of  thousands of Dreamers have been saving American lives during this  pandemic as nurses and doctors and first responders. Tens of thousands  more help the economy grow every day as teachers, engineers, business  owners, entrepreneurs, essential workers. They even have volunteered  for our military. They respect our country so much, though so many in  the Senate do not respect them.   The Dreamers need to be provided a path to citizenship as well as the  farmworkers who are toiling in sweltering heat right now, right now at  this moment, in this terrible heat that we are witnessing across the  country. They are out in the fields, picking the crops that will be on  our tables today, tomorrow, and beyond.   We had a recent hearing on farmworkers in the Senate Judiciary  Committee. One of the Republican Senators said: Here we are talking  about mass amnesty, giving these people an automatic path to  citizenship.   Automatic? Read the bill that passed the House of Representatives. Do  you know what it takes to be eligible for citizenship as a farmworker  under that bill? Nineteen years of back-breaking work in the fields.  Automatic? Nineteen years of slaving away at jobs that Americans don't  sign up for--ever--and a possibility at the end of 19 years that they  can be citizens. They should be given that chance. Every day, these  workers head out to the fields and do back-breaking labor, sometimes  for 14 hours straight, just to put food on our tables. Giving these  people a chance to become citizens is the right thing to do.   It will help our economy. Reforms of our immigration system could add  $150 billion to spending power in our economy every year and, over the  next 10 years, boost our Nation's GDP by $1.5 trillion. That is enough  money to pay off every student loan in America just by doing the right  thing for immigrants in our country.   Providing these essential workers a path to citizenship puts more  money in the pockets of every American. It will create 400,000 new  jobs, increase each American's annual wage by $600. These people, when  they are given some clear picture of what their future will be, can  plan it, can start making decisions that in the long haul will make  them better and our Nation stronger. That is what it means to bring  these immigrants into the sunlight and to give them a chance to be part  of America.   By nearly every measure, a path to citizenship is an investment in  our Nation's future. Last night, President Joe Biden agreed. It can't  wait any longer. There is going to be a bill soon called  reconciliation.   In 2005, Senate Republicans used the budget reconciliation process to  dramatically increase the number of green cards available to  immigrants. During the Trump administration, Republicans used the  budget reconciliation process to enact a $1.9 trillion tax cut for  wealthy donors and corporate fat cats, and they tried to use it to  repeal the Affordable Care Act. So there is ample precedent for passing  important legislation through budget reconciliation.   I have tried for many years to pass a citizenship program through  regular order. Senate Republicans have obstructed bipartisan  immigration reform time and again, filibustering the DREAM Act five  times. In 20 years, I have brought the DREAM Act to the floor five  times and been stopped by the filibuster. They repeatedly blocked  bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform, passing the Gang of 8 bill  but never returning to it.   This year, I am convinced bipartisan immigration negotiations are not  going to lead us to where we need to be. Republicans made unreasonable  demands in that process to limit the path to citizenship to a number  that was dreamed up by President Trump as fair--650,000 current DACA  recipients. Sounds like a lot. However, that approach would exclude  Dreamers who have been blocked from the program for years by President  Trump. Republicans also wanted to attach partisan provisions to block  innocent asylum seekers and to cut legal family immigration.   For all of these reasons, I believe the only viable option, at this  time, for passing a path to citizenship is through reconciliation. The  overwhelming majority of Americans support this pathway for Dreamers,  many of whom have risked their lives to save Americans during the  pandemic. This is a critical component of our economic recovery and  rebuilding our communities. It cannot wait any longer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate  return to regular order.                                Vote on Motion     Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, for almost 20 years, U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services, known as USCIS, has been charged with defending  America's status as the land of opportunity. The Agency has nearly  20,000 employees. They operate in 220 offices around the world, where  they provide assistance to immigrants seeking a new life in America and  help protect America from any foreign threats.   But after 4 years of neglect and mismanagement under the Trump  administration, USCIS is in dire need of leadership. Today, the Senate  has an opportunity to provide that Agency with that leadership by  confirming Ur Jaddou as USCIS Director. Ms. Jaddou may be the most  qualified person ever to be nominated for this job. She has nearly 20  years of experience in immigration law, policy, and administration. She  is the daughter of immigrants from Mexico and Iraq. She personally  understands the importance of ensuring our Nation's immigration system  is both accessible and safe. And if confirmed, Ms. Jaddou would make  history as the very first woman to lead USCIS.   Let me tell you a little bit about her background. Ms. Jaddou began  her career working on immigration policy and oversight for 9 years in  the House of Representatives. She worked for my friend and former  colleague Zoe Lofgren of California, who is the authoritative voice on  immigration in the House of Representatives.   Following that role, Ms. Jaddou served as a senior official in the  State Department and then as Chief Counsel at USCIS. As the Agency's  highest ranking legal officer, Ms. Jaddou not only sharpened her  mastery of immigration law, she also gained valuable experience  navigating USCIS's administrative complexities and operations. As Chief  Counsel at this Agency, she managed more than 220 attorneys who support  the work of tens of thousands of USCIS employees who are located in  offices around the world.   Ms. Jaddou's extensive background is exactly what we need at this  moment.   As I mentioned, the Trump administration led a deliberate effort to  undermine this Agency's work. You remember--anything relating to  immigration, the Trump administration tried to create a problem. For  instance, when the former President took office, USCIS had  approximately $800 million in cash reserves. Not bad. Four years later,  those cash reserves had been virtually depleted, putting thousands of  Federal employees at the Agency at risk of being furloughed in the  middle of a pandemic.   These Federal employees deserve leadership that advocates for their  interests and supports their work. Ms. Jaddou is that person. In fact,  the union that represents over 13,000 USCIS employees published a  letter in support of her nomination, writing: ``Ms. Jaddou is well- acquainted with the significant financial and operational challenges  facing the Agency.''   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter in support of her  nomination as well. They wrote: ``Ms. Jaddou's knowledge and experience  would be indispensable in providing the critical leadership needed to  stabilize the agency.''   Leaders inside government and outside government recognize that Ms.  Jaddou is the legal expert our Nation needs to take the reins of this  vital Agency.   Given the urgent need for Senate-confirmed leadership to address the  critical issues they face, as well as Ms. Jaddou's eminent  qualifications for that position, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting her nomination    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Maine (Mr. King), and the Senator from  Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.
