 Madam Speaker, I would like to talk about several  issues which have either not been covered enough lately or not covered  in the appropriate way.   The first thing I would like to talk about is the loan forgiveness  program and the recent change in the law increasing public loan  forgiveness.   When my constituents back home ask me, what is the biggest problem? I  say, well, we certainly have problems with the economy, we certainly  have problems with education, we certainly have problems with crime-- but I say the biggest problem is we are in a moral breakdown in this  country.   I would like to address the way the loan forgiveness program and  public loan forgiveness is changing America, I think, for the worst.   The first thing I would like to address is the fact that this  institution has apparently felt that you are a lot better off, or it  should be much easier for you to have your loan forgiven if you work  for a nonprofit organization or a governmental entity.   Now, whenever I go around my district, the manufacturers, the  farmers, a couple of big insurance companies, they are all looking for  more people to work. But the message out of Washington is, don't work  for business, which, after all, is the engine that really makes our  country go around. It shows kind of a hatred for manufacturers, a  hatred for agriculture, a hatred of retail, a hatred of insurance.   People working in this building who work with our government  employees, their staff is government employees, apparently felt: Well,  I think those hardworking people in government, they ought to be  offered a tremendous benefit that people who don't work for the  government don't get. We are going to find a way to forgive the  people's loans if they are the nice, noble people who work for  government. And if they are somebody who, say, works for a  manufacturer--which is so important for the country--well, we don't  care about those people. We hate those people.   The next message in our loan forgiveness policy is the dislike of  people who don't go to college. One of my goals in the legislature-- which I think I am succeeding at a little bit--is educating people  about all the good, necessary jobs we have in our country that don't  require a 4-year college degree.   Recently, The Wall Street Journal pointed out--I am told--that if you  are a plumber and compare your lifelong earnings to someone who is a  general practitioner, it is about the same. We so desperately need more  people in the  [[Page H8053]]  trades. We so desperately need more people who are skilled in the  manufacturing field.   But what do we do here?   We turn around and put them or their children in greater debt with  this loan forgiveness program or it will likely drive up insurance more  with the loan forgiveness program that is going to cost over $300  billion a year.   We benefit the people who go to college. We treat the people who  don't go to college like dirt: No, you are not getting anything,  inflation is going to go up and hurt you because we have to give money  to the people who went to college.   The next bad message that it sends is, I think it is discriminating  against the hardworking.   I ran into somebody recently, heard about somebody who got a nice job  out of college, but with pride he said he was going to work extra hard  and pay off that student loan. So he got a job as an Uber driver and he  got a job as a bartender. I am sure between them both he was working  well over 60, 65 hours a week but he was proud to pre-pay that student  loan.   And what does the government say to somebody who works especially  hard and pays off their student loan?   Sucker. We are going to give the same benefit to someone who didn't  work that second or third job.   Again, you are eating away at the moral fiber of America.   The next group is the frugal. I always thought it was wise to be  frugal, wise to be debt-free, pay off that debt before you take out  your credit card and buy a fancier car or buy more furniture or buy a  fancy vacation or something. But we look at the people who are frugal  and use their frugality to pay off their student loan. Again, we say:  Sucker, you shouldn't have paid off your student loan. The government  will pay off the student loan for somebody who wasn't as frugal, and we  consider you kind of foolish for being frugal.   And the final thing I would point out is that under the proposed  forgiveness by President Biden, we give out twice the forgiveness if  you originally took out Pell grants.   Now, one of the problems I have talked about with the Pell grants in  the past is that it is easier to get a Pell grant if you are not  married, which probably isn't a good thing, but that is the way it is.   Now, you already get the benefit of the Pell Grant for not being  married in the first place. Now we double the amount of loan  forgiveness if you wind up originally getting this additional boost  with the Pell grant.   So, again, it is sending the wrong message to people. In addition to  the fact that it is another $360 billion log on the fire of inflation.  And then people will pretend they don't know where inflation came from.  But when the Treasury is spending 360 billion bucks, that is where the  inflation came from.   The next thing I am going to address is what is going on at the  border. And as I mentioned before, this is another topic that the press  underreports.   Earlier this week, one more time, we had the information come out on  the number of people who came across the border in August. It varies  from month to month, between 140,000 and 180,000 people crossing the  border. But that is just totally inappropriate. It makes a mockery of  our immigration laws to people who are doing it right.    We know that some of these people, after all, had to break the law to  come here, and are going to be disproportionately in a situation in  which they have to take advantage of the public benefits of this  country. And we don't know whether they have been adequately blended  into America, think like Americans, think with the self-reliance that  Americans should have. I don't think any serious country believes in  open borders, except for we do here.   In addition to the obvious problem of the adults coming here, we  have--depending on the month--about 10,000 unaccompanied minors coming  here to be dropped off, presumably at relatives, somebody or other. I  don't know where the press is that always worries about broken  families, when our open borders results in 9,000 or 10,000 people, who  at least claim to be minors, without a parent around.   The next problem, a humanitarian problem, when you have such a huge  number of people crossing the border, people die coming over the  border. The last time I was down on the border, they found two bodies  of people around San Diego and the Pacific Ocean. We were told it was  more common to find bodies on the Mexican side of the border. We hear  about people dehydrating to death in the Arizona desert. We hear about  people drowning in the Rio Grande.   Nevertheless, these things are not talked about. They are an  inevitable consequence of sending a message to people all around the  globe that we don't care what happens at the border.   Another problem is, depending on the person, they frequently are  charged $5,000, $10,000, $20,000 to come here. Who is benefiting by  this?   The Border Patrol believes that the drug cartels are right now making  more money smuggling people across the border than they do selling  drugs.   So what is the effect of the drug cartels making more money? It gives  them even more of a stranglehold on our southern neighbor, Mexico,  which is quickly becoming more and more of a narco State.   I think part of that is our fault in America for having too many  people consume drugs that are snuck in across the southern border. But  some of the fault also has to lie in this open-door policy pursued by  the Biden administration as the Mexican drug cartels get wealthier and  wealthier and wealthier.   Another thing to point out is we are not inappropriate otherwise as  far as letting people in this country. Depending on the year, we have  over 800,000 new people sworn in as American citizens. That is  certainly very generous, particularly when compared to other countries.  Meanwhile, we have a situation in which we are encouraging people to  come here right now.   Madam Speaker, 65 percent of the bursts of illegal immigrants are  people on Medicaid, which would indicate that it is still a greater  burden on our budget to have more people come here.   The American Medical Association points out the huge number of  illegals who show up in emergency rooms. Of course, as a practical  matter, they are in charge of this if something passes through to the  other people who are paying for their medical care. But, again, we have  to say one of the reasons for the spiraling costs of medical care in  this country is people who show up in the emergency rooms and don't  pay. That would be illegals.   I recently talked to someone who operates a free clinic in my  district. And they told me that a significant number of the people that  they deal with at the free clinic are people here illegally.   This could become even greater if eventually President Biden gets his  dream--it could very easily happen if the elections go away. I don't  want to have them go away--in which we give Pell grants to people who  come here illegally which results in close to a free college education  that the American middle class doesn't get. But apparently an  inducement to have more people come here is we are going to give Pell  grants to people who come here illegally.   I hope that the American press corps pays more attention to the  numbers introduced earlier this week, as far as the number of people  who came here illegally in August. It should be a banner headline. It  will be a permanent change in America when over 150,000 people come  here.   And I should point out that as more people come here, it doesn't mean  we are kicking out more people who break our laws. At the same time, we  are deporting only about a quarter of the number of people who  President Trump was deporting for breaking the law. So we are, in  essence, allowing more people who are criminally prone to come into  this country.   The next issue I want to talk about that the press should be paying  attention to: I recently talked to someone who claims that in the  military, where they had required vaccines, we have recently heard of  increases in miscarriages, cancer, blood clots, neurological  complications, and deaths.   I would hope the press would dig into this, make some freedom of  information requests. If it really is true, as my friend tells me, that  there is an increase in medical problems at the same time that our  military was required to get the vaccine, it is something we should  know not only for the benefit of the military but the rest of America  as well.   I haven't seen this being adequately covered given the huge amount of  [[Page H8054]]  money we are putting in these vaccines, as well as the fact that we are  encouraging children to get these vaccines. I would hope that a lot of  attention is being paid to the effect of vaccines on the primarily  young military population, and a population that is generally in shape.   The next thing that not only the press should be paying attention to  but, quite frankly, the business lobbyists should be paying attention  to is something called the PRO Act.   The PRO Act passed the House of Representatives two terms in a row.  It is being held up in the Senate right now only because of the  filibuster rule. Depending upon what happens in the elections in  November, one could easily see the PRO Act become law.                                time  1800    The American public does not know what is in the PRO Act. Lobbyists  in this building, who should know better, don't know about the PRO Act.  We are very close to changing the labor laws in this country where you  can wind up having an election to unionize with only 14 days' advance  notice. These elections would take place with an open ballot. You fill  out your ballot, and people can know how you vote. If it is perceived  that the management team did something untoward during the election,  the labor relations board can deem there to be a union, even though  nobody even voted to be unionized.   It can create a situation in which different franchisees can be  lumped together, and even though no employees in one location want to  unionize, they can be forced into a union.   It would be a fundamental change in the way we do business in this  country. I have nothing against people who belong to a union, but this  would overwhelmingly shift the bias toward forcing people to join a  union when they don't necessarily want to. It is something our business  groups, whatever association it is, should familiarize themselves with  and make sure their members know what could very easily happen.   I also think the PRO Act has been very underpublicized by our press  corps. If it turns out in January that we begin down a process of mass  unionization and we go down a path in which all employees' numbers have  to be turned over--their address, their email address, their phone  number--without their say so, the American public ought to know what  they are voting for in November.   I don't believe the press corps in this country has adequately  explained to both management, employees, everybody, how close we are to  that PRO Act becoming law. Everybody ought to know it. I think it would  be devastating for American business, particularly American business  that has to compete abroad, if the PRO Act were to pass. But if it  passes, I bet very few people will understand what effect this election  has on it.   There is another significant bill that is being held back only  because of the filibuster rule in the Senate. Even though this bill  passed this session, the average American does not know how close we  are to this becoming law. I speak about the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act.   In this act, both for the purpose of censuses and other government  forms, American citizens and American children will be asked to declare  a sexual preference or sexual identity, be it bisexual, be it binary,  be it transgender, what-have-you. I think this is highly offensive.  There was a time when the gay rights movement meant we weren't supposed  to ask what people do in bed. Now, it is going to be the government's  business, and you are going to be asked to declare your sexual  preference, which by itself is outlandish.   But just as outlandish is this declaring goes all the way down to  kids who are 7 or 6 or 5 years old. Now, there the form may be filled  out by parents or by a teacher. It includes forms other than just the  census, forms that school districts are required to fill out.   Nevertheless, I think it is a fundamental change in America that we  are going to be collecting data on sexual preferences from any age  group. Outlandish for age 5; outlandish for age 12. But this, to me, is  a fundamental change in the way America operates, and the information  that people are supposed to turn over to the government is a  fundamental change.   I would be surprised if one out of 300 Americans knew we are so close  to making that requirement in the United States. I hope that our  slumbering press corps--I don't mean to refer to them that way--but I  hope that the average American knows how close we are to that bill  becoming law.   The next issue that I think we ought to look at a little bit concerns  the continued effort to claim we have a huge racism problem in this  country. I do not believe we have a racism problem in the country. The  easiest way to see that is when you look and see how well the  immigrants who just come here are able to do, despite the fact that  many of the immigrants who come here don't even know English.   I have recently spoken to people from the Hmong community, from the  Indian community, and from the Filipino community, and all of them are  so happy to be in America and think America is the land of opportunity,  that people do so well in America.   I talked to a Hmong individual recently, and he had between himself,  his children, and his siblings' children, about 30 children or nieces  or nephews. Every one of them is thriving in America. Nobody has broken  any laws. They all have decent jobs. They are educated in one fashion  or another. These are people who came here from an entirely different  culture. Many were not Christian. Their parents or grandparents did not  know English when they came here, but they thrive in America.   I have been talking to some Indian immigrants, and they say how  wonderful the opportunity is here. Again, I talked to somebody recently  who came here, didn't know any English. He had to start out as a  dishwasher. He worked his way up and is doing fantastically well in  America. The fact that he is of Indian heritage had no effect on him  whatsoever, and he couldn't think of any way in which he had been  discriminated against. Same thing is true with somebody from the  Philippines.   But what do we get here out of Washington? We get Joe Biden talking  about we have to pass a bill--I will talk about in a second--we have to  make it easier to sue police, in part, because we perceive the police  are prejudiced.   We continue to promote the Black Lives Matter movement, which is  built on the lie that we have a huge problem with racist police in this  country. But nevertheless, we coddle them, people give them money, and  they are treated with respect.   In our election law, we are told we have to get rid of photo ID,  something that many other countries have, because it is racist to  require photo ID. That is some horrible slander that Joe Biden has  against the people of this country.   I would ask that the press begin to treat these claims of racism a  little more skeptically. I think they should ask people details when  they claim racism is a big problem, because it is not without harm. I  think it causes people to walk around with a chip on their shoulder. I  think that it causes unnecessary divisions in Americans. I think  America has been a melting pot my whole life and well before I was  born.    People come here from all around the globe. I should point out that  insofar as there are ethnic problems, they are frequently greater in  other countries. That is one thing that people from India pointed out  to me, that there are problems between different religious groups or  ethnic groups in India in which people even get killed. There is  nothing like that in the United States.   It is time the politicians of this building, rather than trying to  take political advantage of the grievances that they try to bring up,  they should tell people that anybody who works hard in America has an  opportunity to succeed and that that is something they can be proud of  about of America. They can just use their common sense.   If you are down at the border, the people who come here, come here  from all around the globe, because they know that despite the fact they  might not know the native language, despite the fact that they don't  have a job lined up when they get here--whether you are coming here  from Peru or Cuba or Ecuador or Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, anywhere--you  are going to be better off in the United States. Not Christian, not  northern European, not European at all, you are still going to be  better off in the United States.   So many immigrants have told me there is unlimited opportunity in the  [[Page H8055]]  United States. That is why they are here. One of the major reasons, I  think, why some people don't succeed in taking advantage of that  opportunity is because they are told by opportunistic politicians that  America is a racist country and you cannot succeed in America.   The final comment that I think the press should be picking up going  into the election cycle is a law that right now has passed the House  twice but has only not passed the Senate because of the filibuster  rule, which could change with a shift in just two votes in the U.S.  Senate, is the law making it easier to sue police.   There are a variety of reasons why crime has gone up so dramatically  in this country in the last 2 years, and there is no question that part  of it is we are not adequately funding our police departments. But even  more than that, we are not speaking positively about police. Now, we  have a bill out there making it easier to sue police if they handcuff  somebody or if they wrestle with somebody.   This rhetoric from politicians and also this proposed law causes  police, I think, to be very reluctant to physically engage somebody,  very reluctant to be aggressive. As a result, we have in Milwaukee, the  city of my birth, and many other urban cities, including Washington and  Baltimore, right up the freeway, dramatic increases in the number of  homicides. It didn't just happen. It happened, in part, because of  rhetoric from politicians tearing down police, encouraging lack of  respect for the law.   The final highlight of this drive to dislike police could easily  happen in January when we get rid of the limited immunity that police  currently have if they have to engage someone. It would dramatically  change policing, make it more difficult to find police, and make it  easier to sue police.   I hope our press corps pays special attention to these laws, which  did not pass out of this Congress, but passed only out of the House.  But if there is a slight shift in the partisan makeup in January, they  could easily become law. The American citizens ought to know about  these laws before they go to vote in November. I am afraid they are not  going to know it, because they are not adequately covered by our  slumbering journalists.   I ask one more time that they pay attention to laws related to  racism; laws related to suing police; laws related to the LGBTQI+ Data  Inclusion Act, in which they go around and try to collect data on  sexual preferences from all Americans; and the PRO Act, in which we, I  think, just shamefully tip the balance of the scales toward forcing  people to become members of a union.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
