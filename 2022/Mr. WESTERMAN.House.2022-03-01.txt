 Mr. Speaker, as we witness an evil empire trying to  remake itself, I reflect on Mrs. Bolin's first grade class in my tiny  rural school in the heartland of America and, as a 6-year-old living  during the Cold War, trying to understand how crouching under a desk as  part of our nuclear attack drill would save anyone. The simple truth  is, it wouldn't.   Crouching, hiding, and being intimidated only emboldens Communists.  Standing up strong is how you beat the evils of communism.   Last year, I had the great experience of standing at the Brandenburg  Gate in Berlin, where Ronald Reagan spoke those famous words in 1987:  ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''   Remarkably, less than 2\1/2\ years later, that wall came down, and by  the end of 1991, the evil Soviet empire had dissolved. The Soviet Union  was gone, but the seeds of the evil in the Communist government of  Russia and other parts of the world still remain.   As brave Ukrainians are fighting a David and Goliath type battle of  survival, we must stand strong and create a long-term plan to crush the  Russian energy grip on Europe and our allies. Energy revenue feeds the  Russian beast, and we have the resources and the technology to starve  it to death.    Only a few years ago, the United States became energy independent.  But my, how quickly things have changed.   On his first day in office, President Biden canceled the Keystone XL  pipeline that could have reduced our reliance on Russian oil. But it is  not just Keystone. All U.S. pipeline projects are being held up, and  Russian hackers even attacked our existing pipelines with no recourse.   A week into office, the Biden administration doubled down on their  anti-American energy agenda, ordering an indefinite freeze on new oil  and gas leasing and, to this day, has issued zero new leases on Federal  lands or waters.   President Biden's policies are choosing Russian oil and Russian jobs  over American energy and our own national security. In fact, in 2021,  U.S. imports from Russia reached an 11-year high, and we are sending  tens of millions of our dollars every day to fund Putin's war machine.   Why are we doing this to ourselves when we have so many resources at  our fingertips?   Our bill is simple, and it stands up to Russian aggression by going  after their major source of funding. It will empower U.S. domestic  production by immediately approving the Keystone XL pipeline; by  restarting the oil and gas leasing program on Federal lands and waters;  by requiring President Biden to submit an energy security plan to  Congress; by unleashing liquefied natural gas exports to displace  Russian gas abroad; and, finally, requiring drawdowns from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be replaced by increased Federal oil and  gas leasing.   I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up strong and  join Mrs. McMorris Rodgers and me in cosponsoring the legislation.    I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question  so that our legislation can be considered immediately by the House of  Representatives.                                time  1245
