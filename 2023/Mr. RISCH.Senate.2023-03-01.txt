 Madam President, I rise today to honor a great Idahoan and  the new Federal Engineer of the Year, Chad Kidd.   Over the past decade, Mr. Kidd has served as an electrical engineer  for the Bureau of Reclamation. Throughout his time he has displayed a  consistent record of outstanding design, installation, commissioning,  and professional engineering support for Reclamation's hydro generation  program. Mr. Kidd is also a stalwart leader in electrical safety for  power plants in the Columbia-Pacific Northwest Region. Most notably,  Mr. Kidd developed and delivered electrical awareness and safety  training across the region years before a formal Reclamation electrical  training program even existed. Mr. Kidd has won numerous awards and  accolades to commemorate his phenomenal work and is a six-time  recipient of the STAR Award.   In addition to his many engineering accomplishments, Mr. Kidd has  also displayed himself as a great community leader. He has spent  hundreds of hours volunteering for the Boy Scouts of America, Meals on  Wheels, Declo High School, and other organizations providing his labor  and expertise to help those around him.   Idahoans like Mr. Kidd make our State proud. I am thankful for his  work in our great State and congratulate him on this high achievement.                            ____________________     Madam President, Senator Crapo and I rise today to  honor the service of the retiring director of the Idaho Department of  Agriculture, Mrs. Celia Gould.   Celia was appointed the director of the Idaho State Department of  Agriculture in January 2007 as the first woman to ever serve in the  position. She provided unmatched leadership and integrity throughout  her tenure and exemplified what it is to be a public servant. As a  third-generation rancher herself, she utilized firsthand knowledge and  made thoughtful decisions, which further solidified the incredible  success of Idaho agriculture. Before spending 16 years as Idaho's  director of agriculture, Celia served 16 years in the Idaho House of  Representatives. There is truly no one else who knows the State quite  like she does, and we will miss her dearly.   Senator Crapo and I are happy to join the rest of the State in  wishing her the very best in her well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
