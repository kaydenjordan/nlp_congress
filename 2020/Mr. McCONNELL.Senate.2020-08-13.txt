 Mr. President, the Senate was supposed to spend this  week finalizing another bipartisan rescue package for the American  people. Millions of laid-off workers needed more Federal assistance to  weather the storm. Small businesses needed more support to make  payroll. Schools and families need more funding, tools, and certainty  with reopening dates fast approaching. Doctors, nurses, and healthcare  workers need more backup as they hold the line against this disease. We  all need more gas for the race toward more testing, better treatments,  and the vaccine that will finish this fight. So last week I canceled  the first week of our August State work period in the hope that the  Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader would put aside their  ideological demands with no relation to this pandemic and finally let  Congress legislate.    Unfortunately, the Democrats have continued to let working families  down. They are still rejecting any more relief for anyone unless they  get a flood of demands with no relationship to COVID-19.   It has been more than 2 weeks since Senate Republicans put out a  trillion-dollar plan to help America reopen, recover, and stay on  offense against this virus. Republicans did the same thing that worked  back in March. We set up the same process that built the unanimous  CARES Act in a matter of days. We laid out a strong marker built by our  chairmen and our committees, fitted to real, fact-based needs of our  Nation and then invited the Democrats to negotiate.   We want another round of direct cash payments for American families.  We want to send $105 billion to help schools and universities safely  reopen and billions more to help working parents with childcare. We  want to create new incentives for retaining and rehiring America's  workers and for businesses to improve workplace safety. We want to  create the smart legal protections that small businesses and university  presidents are pleading for, so they can reopen safely for students and  workers without paying a ransom to the trial lawyers.   These are the strong policies we proposed because these are the  policies our  [[Page S5404]]  Nation actually needs. We want to take second runs at the best and most  successful parts of the bipartisan CARES Act while adding in bold new  steps for this new phase of our Nation's battle.   But as I said right from the outset, Republicans had no illusion that  our initial marker would become law. That isn't how divided government  operates. There was never any question that bipartisan compromise would  be needed to get an outcome. So I expected that, just like in March,  the Democratic ranking members would sit down with our chairmen, bring  some of their own serious ideas to the table, and work together to  build a bipartisan bill. That is what happened back then. But, instead,  the country got something else entirely.   Instead of working with our serious framework, the Speaker of the  House and the Senate Democratic leader spent weeks insisting on a  completely--completely--unrealistic, far-left proposal that even their  own Democratic Members mocked as a go-nowhere messaging stunt the  instant it was first released.   Instead of letting their committees and their Members discuss  substantive issues across the aisle, they said nobody could negotiate  but them. And instead of staying focused on the real needs of our  Nation, these two Democratic leaders have held the talks hostage for  weeks now--weeks--over nonCOVID-related ideological items, which the  political left has wanted since well before this virus hit our shores.   You know what I am talking about. By now, the whole country knows  what I am talking about: the absurd issues the Democrats have turned  into sticking points; the bizarre, parochial leftwing favors that  Democrats have put ahead of the help that working families need right  now, like the massive tax cuts for the highest earners in the bluest  States--an idea that even supposedly progressive economists have said  is ``not a good idea''; the trillion-dollar slush fund for State and  local governments that have only spent 25 percent--25 percent--of the  billions that we sent them back in March, totally out of proportion to  any estimate of urgent pandemic shortfalls; the socialist insistence on  the Federal Government paying people more not to work--not to work-- than essential workers earn when they are on the job.   Go to any kitchen table in America, outside of a few skyscraper  penthouses, and put these bizarre demands up against the trillion  dollars of real, practical relief that Republicans wanted to get out  the door weeks ago. No family in Middle America is saying: Thank  goodness. Thank goodness the Democrats are blocking cash payments to  me, money for my kids' schools, and money for vaccines until Manhattan  millionaires get a tax cut.   No working people are saying: Thank goodness the Democrats are  blocking the next small business rescue plan, money for testing, and  rehiring incentives until Malibu, CA, gets Federal money to keep buying  more electric cars, which they wrote to the Congress demanding.   Families aren't saying this. Outside of Speaker Pelosi and Leader  Schumer, even Washington Democrats aren't saying this.   While the press tries its hardest to praise Speaker Pelosi for  ``playing hardball,'' her own House Democrats are rebelling. They say  they are ``frustrated'' and ``angry'' that relief is being held up over  what they themselves acknowledge is a ``political wish list.''   ``[T]he HEROES Act went too far,'' is another quote.   These are Democrats talking about the Heroes Act.   Even the Speaker's own members are not buying their political spin.  They want what Republicans want, what the administration wants, what  America's families everywhere want. We need to get an outcome.   The Secretary of the Treasury and the White House chief of staff have  given ground. They have put new issues on the table that Democrats  wanted. They have worked to find commonality. But the Democrats are  barely even pretending to negotiate--barely even pretending. The  Speaker's latest spin is that it is some heroic sacrifice to lower her  demands from a made-up $3.5 trillion marker that was never going to  become law to an equally made-up $2.5 trillion marker. She calls this  meeting in the middle.   That is not negotiating; that is throwing spaghetti at the wall to  see what sticks. People who have serious policy proposals that are  fitted to actual needs cannot breezily knock off a trillion here and  add a trillion there.   Heck, by the Speaker's logic, they should have just opened with their  entire $93 trillion Green New Deal. Then they could have blamed the  President for not meeting them halfway at the cut-rate bargain sum of  $45 trillion.   Come on. In point of fact, the Speaker and the leader have not  conceded anything at all. They haven't budged on their absurd demands.  They just moved the expiration date a few weeks on the exact same crazy  wish list, so the pricetag comes down without moving an inch on the  merits.   They have refused Republicans' offer to pass everything that we can  agree on. The administration has said: Let's pass things we can agree  on right now.   The Republicans don't think that a disputed issue should hold up the  most urgent aid for working families, but the answer so far from the  Democratic leadership is no. The partisan games continue, so the  Nation's pain continues as well.   Laid-off workers and kids and parents and doctors and nurses are  waiting for help. Our people are waiting for help. Republicans have  been at the table for weeks. We just need seriousness on the other  side. American families' livelihoods are at stake. American lives are  at stake. Democrats must rerun their political calculations and  finally--finally--let Congress act                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  after the Senate adjourns today, we will have our regular pro forma  meetings through the end of the State work period.   If the Speaker of the House and the minority leader of the Senate  decide to finally let another rescue package move forward for workers  and for families, it would take bipartisan consent to meet for  legislative business sooner than scheduled. As has been the case,  [[Page S5406]]  Senators would receive at least 24-hours' notice before any  unanticipated votes.   The American people need more help. The coronavirus is not finished  with our country, so Congress cannot be finished helping our people.  The Republicans have been waiting and trying to pass bipartisan relief,  literally, for weeks. I hope our Democratic colleagues will let the  Senate act sometime soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 771.
