 Mr. Speaker, recently FEMA released a report into its own  response after Hurricane Maria swept Puerto Rico last year.   To sum up the report, FEMA screwed up.   FEMA underestimated how much food people would need.   FEMA miscalculated how much fresh water people would need.   FEMA didn't foresee how difficult it would be to get supplies to the  island.   And when Hurricane Maria struck, FEMA's warehouse in Puerto Rico was  basically empty.   I was most shocked by FEMA's admission that its plans for a crisis in  Puerto Rico were based on a focused disaster like a tsunami, not a  major hurricane devastating the whole island.   Just last week, the island's death toll was adjusted to reflect the  reality that thousands of people died because of Hurricane Maria. Mr.  Speaker, these were American citizens.   The Federal Government must do better. Lives are at stake.                            ____________________
