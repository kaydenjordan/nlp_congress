 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mayor Kevin  Cotton from Madisonville, Kentucky, for being named a 2021 Angel in  Adoption by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute.   The Angels in Adoption program seeks to honor individuals and  organizations that focus on adoption, permanency, and child welfare  issues.   Mayor Cotton and his wife, Donna Cotton, consistently give back to  the community by fostering children in their home. Throughout the  years, they have provided love and care to 46 children, three of which  they adopted.   Those who know Mayor Cotton know him best for his love of children,  passion for foster care, and desire to make a lasting impact in the  community through his business and public service.   I appreciate the profound contributions the Cottons have made and am  grateful for their dedication to the gift and treasure of adoption. The  nomination is symbolic of their devotion to children as well as an  ambitious, caring vision for the lives of others.   I am proud to recognize Mayor Kevin Cotton and his wife, Donna, for  their incredible work in the child welfare arena. On behalf of all my  constituents, I congratulate them on their efforts to make the dream of  a family a reality for children in need.                            ____________________
