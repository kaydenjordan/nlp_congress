 Mr. President, today I am proud to reintroduce the  Mare Island Naval Cemetery Transfer Act, which would transfer control  of the Mare Island Naval Cemetery from the City of Vallejo in  California to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) where it belongs.   The Mare Island Naval Cemetery is the oldest military cemetery on the  West Coast. Opened in 1856, it was originally part of Mare Island Naval  Shipyard, the first U.S. naval base established on the Pacific Ocean.  The historic cemetery is the final resting place for 860 veterans and  their loved ones, including three Medal of Honor recipients. Anna  Arnold Key, the daughter of Francis Scott Key, is also buried there,  next to her husband who fought in the War of 1812. After the base  closed in 1996, the nearby City of Vallejo assumed control of the naval  property and cemetery.   Unfortunately, the city doesn't have the necessary funds to properly  care for the cemetery. The city is also ineligible for VA support since  it's not part of the State or Federal government. The maintenance,  therefore, is left to volunteers with limited resources who lack the  expertise necessary to maintain this historic cemetery.   The cemetery has fallen into disrepair and is no longer a fitting  tribute to the brave men and women buried there. Gravestones are  toppled over, broken, or sinking into the ground. Plants and weeds are  overgrown, and water is pooling due to the lack of proper drainage. The  cemetery's current condition requires urgent action to restore the  gravestones and grounds to a respectable condition. Our bill would  accomplish this by transferring control to the VA's National Cemetery  Administration.   The transfer would not only allow the VA to restore the cemetery, but  also ensure it's maintained for future generations to pay their  respects to the heroes buried there. I want to thank Congressman Mike  Thompson (D-CA) for leading this effort in the House. Passing this bill  would be a small, but important, token of our gratitude to the veterans  to whom we owe so much.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am proud to reintroduce the  Mare Island Naval Cemetery Transfer Act, which would transfer control  of the Mare Island Naval Cemetery from the City of Vallejo in  California to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) where it belongs.
