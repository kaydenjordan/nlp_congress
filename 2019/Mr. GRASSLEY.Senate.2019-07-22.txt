 Mr. President, first, I have a duty to perform for the  leader.   I understand that there are two bills at the desk due a second  reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business  for 1 minute.    Mr. President, passing the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement means more market access for our farmers and businesses and  more protection for our workers. This agreement includes new  commitments in critical areas such as customs, digital trade, services,  environment, and labor that are crucial to bringing higher wages and  more jobs to American workers.   Of course, enforcement is key to a strong and durable trade agreement  that will deliver all of the benefits that I just listed. We need  enforcement measures that work for all aspects of this agreement.   It is time to bring NAFTA into the 21st century, and that is what the  U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will do. The time for USMCA is now.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
