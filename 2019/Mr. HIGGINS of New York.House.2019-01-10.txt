 Madam Speaker, we are entering the longest  government shutdown in the Nation's history and, ironically, most of  the Federal employees who are affected by the shutdown are the very  Federal agents who we depend on to protect our borders.   To a national audience 2 days ago, the President repeatedly warned  that terrorists are pouring into the United States from Mexico. This is  the President's central argument for a 25 to $40 billion border wall.  He is now threatening to declare a national emergency to go around  Congress to get that wall.   The President's own counterterrorism officials and experts said there  has never been a case of a known terrorist sneaking into the country  through open areas of the southern border. The Department of Homeland  Security's threat assessment rates the situation at the southern border  as a minimal threat. Who are we to believe?   Mr. President, open the government and prove that you can manage the  situation at the border as Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton did  before you.                            ____________________
