 Madam Speaker, on page 1 of the original Thomas  Jefferson Manual of Parliamentary Practice he writes that: ``It is very  material that order, decency, and regularity be preserved in a  dignified public body.''   Now, we all have the awesome privilege of serving in that dignified  public body: this, the people's House. Our American democracy and its  institutions are looked up to as an example for the entire world.  Jefferson's emphasis on order and decency is just as important today is  it was more than 200 years ago.   Unfortunately, that was not the case today.   Madam Speaker, today is a day that historians will write about. It is  a sad day for this House, the people's House. Our rules of order and  decency were broken today, and worse, the House just voted to condone  this violation of decorum.   Madam Speaker, I know there is frustration in this body. But it is  our duty to focus not on retribution but on building a more perfect  union.   We can be doing so much more, and we should be doing so much better.   Madam Speaker, I would ask that all Members take it upon themselves  to uphold the dignity of this institution. Let us preserve and promote  those ideals of order and decency that this body was founded upon and  that this body will need if we are to address the many challenges  facing our Nation.   Madam Speaker, it is not just our Nation that is watching; the world  is watching us. I hope we can rise to the occasion.
