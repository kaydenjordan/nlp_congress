 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3152 and  to honor the life and legacy of Senator Richard Lugar, who passed away  earlier this year.   Senator Lugar was a true statesman, whose unwavering dedication to  his community and his country led to a lifetime of service. He worked  tirelessly to champion freedom, advance democracy, and build peace and  prosperity both at home and abroad. His wisdom, bipartisanship, and  commitment to America's ideals made our country stronger and safer.   Though we will miss his spirit and conviction, the values he fought  for will endure in those who follow his example of servant leadership.  He built a foundation of opportunity and empowerment so future  generations of Hoosiers could carry on his life's mission.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3152  to dedicate the Richard G. Lugar Post Office in Indianapolis and to  celebrate a leader who never stopped working to make the world a better  place.                            ____________________
