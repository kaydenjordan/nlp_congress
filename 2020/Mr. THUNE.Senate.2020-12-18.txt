(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) During times of economic downturn or recession,       communities of color, and businesses within those       communities, are generally more adversely affected, which       requires an expansion of the ability of the Federal       Government to infuse resources into those communities.        (2) Despite the growth in the number of minority business       enterprises, gaps remain with respect to key metrics for       those enterprises, such as access to capital, revenue, number       of employees, and survival rate. Specifically--        (A) according to the Department of Commerce, minority       business enterprises are 2 to 3 times more likely to be       denied loans than non-minority business enterprises;        (B) according to the Bureau of the Census, the average non-      minority business enterprise reports receipts that are more       than 3 times higher than receipts reported by the average       minority business enterprise; and        (C) according to the Kauffman Foundation--        (i) minority business enterprises are \1/2\ as likely to       employ individuals, as compared with non-minority business       enterprises; and        (ii) if minorities started and owned businesses at the same       rate as non-minorities, the United States economy would have       more than 1,000,000 additional employer businesses and more       than 9,500,000 additional jobs.        (3) Because of the conditions described in paragraph (2),       it is in the interest of the United States and the economy of       the United  [[Page S7744]]       States to expeditiously ameliorate the disparities that       minority business enterprises experience.        (4) Many individuals who own minority business enterprises       are socially disadvantaged because those individuals identify       as members of certain groups that have suffered the effects       of discriminatory practices or similar circumstances over       which those individuals have no control, including       individuals who are--        (A) Black or African American;        (B) Hispanic or Latino;        (C) American Indian or Alaska Native;        (D) Asian; and        (E) Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.        (5) Discriminatory practices and similar circumstances       described in paragraph (4) are a significant determinant of       overall economic disadvantage in the United States, which is       evident in the persistent racial wealth gap in the United       States.        (6) While other Federal agencies focus only on small       businesses and businesses that represent a broader       demographic than solely minority business enterprises, the       Agency focuses exclusively on--        (A) the unique needs of minority business enterprises; and        (B) enhancing the capacity of minority business       enterprises.        (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are to--        (1) require the Agency to promote and administer programs       in the public and private sectors to assist the development       of minority business enterprises; and        (2) achieve the development described in paragraph (1) by       authorizing the Assistant Secretary to carry out programs       that will result in increased access to capital, management,       and technology for minority business enterprises.

(2) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System       should, consistent with its mandates, work to increase       lending by minority depository institutions and community       development financial institutions to underserved       communities, and when appropriate, should work with the       Department of the Treasury to increase lending by minority       depository institutions and community development financial       institutions to underserved communities.        (3) The Department of the Treasury and prudential       regulators should establish a strategic plan identifying       concrete steps that they can take to support existing       minority depository institutions, as well as the formation of       new minority depository institutions consistent with the       goals established in the Financial Institutions Reform,       Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to preserve and promote       minority depository institutions.

SEC. 4507. ENSURING DIVERSITY IN COMMUNITY BANKING.         (a) Sense of Congress on Funding the Loan-loss Reserve Fund       for Small Dollar Loans.--The sense of Congress is the       following:        (1) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund       (referred to in this subsection as the ``CDFI Fund'') is an       agency of the Department of the Treasury, and was established       under section 104(a) of the Community Development Banking and       Financial Institutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4703(a)). The       mission of the CDFI Fund is ``to expand economic opportunity       for underserved people and communities by supporting the       growth and capacity of a national network of community       development lenders, investors, and financial service       providers''. A community development financial institution is       a specialized financial institution serving low-income       communities and a Community Development Entity (referred to       in this subsection as a ``CDE'') is a domestic corporation or       partnership that is an intermediary vehicle for the provision       of loans, investments, or financial counseling in low-income       communities. The CDFI Fund certifies community development       financial institutions and CDEs. Becoming a certified       community development financial institution or CDE allows       organizations to participate in various CDFI Fund programs as       follows:        (A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, which provides FDIC-      insured depository institutions awards for a demonstrated       increase in lending and investments in distressed communities       and community development financial institutions.        (B) The CDFI Program, which provides financial and       technical assistance awards to community development       financial institutions to reinvest in the CDFI Fund, and to       build the capacity of the CDFI Fund, including financing       product development and loan loss reserves.        (C) The Native American CDFI Assistance Program, which       provides CDFIs and sponsoring entities Financial and       Technical Assistance awards to increase lending and grow the       number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans to help build       capacity of such CDFIs.        (D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, which provides tax       credits for making equity investments in CDEs that stimulate       capital investments in low-income communities.        (E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which provides awards to CDFIs       and nonprofit affordable housing organizations to finance       affordable housing solutions and related economic development       activities.        (F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source of long-term,       patient capital for CDFIs to expand lending and investment       capacity for community and economic development purposes.        (2) The Department of the Treasury is authorized to create       multi-year grant programs designed to encourage low-to-      moderate income individuals to establish accounts at       federally insured banks, and to improve low-to-moderate       income individuals' access to such accounts on reasonable       terms.        (3) Under this authority, grants to participants in CDFI       Fund programs may be used for loan-loss reserves and to       establish small-dollar loan programs by subsidizing related       losses. These grants also allow for the providing recipients       with the financial counseling and education necessary to       conduct transactions and manage their accounts. These loans       provide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other       nontraditional forms of financing that often impose excessive       interest rates and fees on borrowers, and lead millions of       people in the United States to fall into debt traps. Small-      dollar loans can only be made pursuant to terms, conditions,       and practices that are reasonable for the individual consumer       obtaining the loan.        (4) Program participation is restricted to eligible       institutions, which are limited to organizations listed in       section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and       exempt from tax under 501(a) of such Code, federally insured       depository institutions, community development financial       institutions and State, local, or Tribal governmental       entities.        (5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has awarded over       $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and CDEs and has allocated       $54,000,000,000 in tax credits and $1,510,000,000 in bond       guarantees. According to the CDFI Fund, some programs attract       as much as $10 in private capital for every $1 invested by       the CDFI Fund. The Administration and Congress should       prioritize appropriation of funds for the loan loss reserve       fund and technical assistance programs administered by the       CDFI Fund.

TITLE V--DOWNPAYMENT ON BUILDING 21ST CENTURY INFRASTRUCTURE       SEC. 5001. FINDINGS.

(2) The current COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionally       impacted communities of color and exacerbated the conditions       that, combined with persistently underfunded critical       priorities like public health, child care, infrastructure,       and job creation, have led to record levels of poverty and       sickness.        (3) The historical record of Federal underinvestment in       communities of color has created systematic disparities that       cross nearly every economic sector and require Congressional       and Executive action to undo.        (4) This Act makes critical short term investments to       respond to these disparities exacerbated by the pandemic, in       areas like in child care, mental health and primary care, and       job creation.        (5) This Act has a secondary objective of helping to build       long lasting wealth, health,  [[Page S7758]]       and economic stability in these communities with an initial       commitment to be made over the next 5 years through       investments in infrastructure, a homeowner down payment tax       credit, Medicaid expansion, and more.        (6) This Act is not the conclusion of efforts in this       space, but an initial down payment to communities of color       and the first in many focused investments and policy       initiatives to begin dismantling systematic racism.

       (cc) for each employee, the provider will pay the full       compensation described in subsection (e)(1)(C), including any       benefits, that was provided to the employee as of March 1,       2020 (referred to in this clause as ``full compensation''),       and will not take any action that reduces the weekly amount       of the employee's compensation below the weekly amount of       full compensation, or that reduces the employee's rate of       compensation below the rate of full compensation; and        (dd) the provider will provide relief from copayments and       tuition payments for the families enrolled in the provider's       program and prioritize such relief for families struggling to       make either type of payment;         (III) for a provider described in subparagraph (B)(ii)(II),       an assurance that--         (aa) for the duration of the provider's closure due to the       qualifying emergency, for each employee, the provider will       pay full compensation, and will not take any action that       reduces the weekly amount of the employee's compensation       below the weekly amount of full compensation, or that reduces       the employee's rate of compensation below the rate of full       compensation;        (bb) children enrolled as of March 1, 2020, will maintain       their slots, unless their families choose to disenroll the       children;        (cc) for the duration of the provider's closure due to the       qualifying emergency, the provider will provide relief from       copayments and tuition payments for the families enrolled in       the provider's program and prioritize such relief for       families struggling to make either type of payment; and        (dd) the provider will resume operations when the provider       is able to safely implement policies in line with guidance       from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the       State, tribal, and local health authorities, and in       accordance with State, tribal, and local orders;         (IV) information about the child care provider's--         (aa) program characteristics sufficient to allow the lead       agency to establish the child care provider's priority       status, as described in subparagraph (F);

SHORT TITLE.         This subtitle may be cited as the ``Minority Business       Resiliency Act of 2020''.       SEC. 4202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) During times of economic downturn or recession,       communities of color, and businesses within those       communities, are generally more adversely affected, which       requires an expansion of the ability of the Federal       Government to infuse resources into those communities.        (2) Despite the growth in the number of minority business       enterprises, gaps remain with respect to key metrics for       those enterprises, such as access to capital, revenue, number       of employees, and survival rate. Specifically--        (A) according to the Department of Commerce, minority       business enterprises are 2 to 3 times more likely to be       denied loans than non-minority business enterprises;        (B) according to the Bureau of the Census, the average non-      minority business enterprise reports receipts that are more       than 3 times higher than receipts reported by the average       minority business enterprise; and        (C) according to the Kauffman Foundation--        (i) minority business enterprises are \1/2\ as likely to       employ individuals, as compared with non-minority business       enterprises; and        (ii) if minorities started and owned businesses at the same       rate as non-minorities, the United States economy would have       more than 1,000,000 additional employer businesses and more       than 9,500,000 additional jobs.        (3) Because of the conditions described in paragraph (2),       it is in the interest of the United States and the economy of       the United  [[Page S7744]]       States to expeditiously ameliorate the disparities that       minority business enterprises experience.        (4) Many individuals who own minority business enterprises       are socially disadvantaged because those individuals identify       as members of certain groups that have suffered the effects       of discriminatory practices or similar circumstances over       which those individuals have no control, including       individuals who are--        (A) Black or African American;        (B) Hispanic or Latino;        (C) American Indian or Alaska Native;        (D) Asian; and        (E) Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.        (5) Discriminatory practices and similar circumstances       described in paragraph (4) are a significant determinant of       overall economic disadvantage in the United States, which is       evident in the persistent racial wealth gap in the United       States.        (6) While other Federal agencies focus only on small       businesses and businesses that represent a broader       demographic than solely minority business enterprises, the       Agency focuses exclusively on--        (A) the unique needs of minority business enterprises; and        (B) enhancing the capacity of minority business       enterprises.        (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are to--        (1) require the Agency to promote and administer programs       in the public and private sectors to assist the development       of minority business enterprises; and        (2) achieve the development described in paragraph (1) by       authorizing the Assistant Secretary to carry out programs       that will result in increased access to capital, management,       and technology for minority business enterprises.

SEC. 4507. ENSURING DIVERSITY IN COMMUNITY BANKING.         (a) Sense of Congress on Funding the Loan-loss Reserve Fund       for Small Dollar Loans.--The sense of Congress is the       following:        (1) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund       (referred to in this subsection as the ``CDFI Fund'') is an       agency of the Department of the Treasury, and was established       under section 104(a) of the Community Development Banking and       Financial Institutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4703(a)). The       mission of the CDFI Fund is ``to expand economic opportunity       for underserved people and communities by supporting the       growth and capacity of a national network of community       development lenders, investors, and financial service       providers''. A community development financial institution is       a specialized financial institution serving low-income       communities and a Community Development Entity (referred to       in this subsection as a ``CDE'') is a domestic corporation or       partnership that is an intermediary vehicle for the provision       of loans, investments, or financial counseling in low-income       communities. The CDFI Fund certifies community development       financial institutions and CDEs. Becoming a certified       community development financial institution or CDE allows       organizations to participate in various CDFI Fund programs as       follows:        (A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, which provides FDIC-      insured depository institutions awards for a demonstrated       increase in lending and investments in distressed communities       and community development financial institutions.        (B) The CDFI Program, which provides financial and       technical assistance awards to community development       financial institutions to reinvest in the CDFI Fund, and to       build the capacity of the CDFI Fund, including financing       product development and loan loss reserves.        (C) The Native American CDFI Assistance Program, which       provides CDFIs and sponsoring entities Financial and       Technical Assistance awards to increase lending and grow the       number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans to help build       capacity of such CDFIs.        (D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, which provides tax       credits for making equity investments in CDEs that stimulate       capital investments in low-income communities.        (E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which provides awards to CDFIs       and nonprofit affordable housing organizations to finance       affordable housing solutions and related economic development       activities.        (F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source of long-term,       patient capital for CDFIs to expand lending and investment       capacity for community and economic development purposes.        (2) The Department of the Treasury is authorized to create       multi-year grant programs designed to encourage low-to-      moderate income individuals to establish accounts at       federally insured banks, and to improve low-to-moderate       income individuals' access to such accounts on reasonable       terms.        (3) Under this authority, grants to participants in CDFI       Fund programs may be used for loan-loss reserves and to       establish small-dollar loan programs by subsidizing related       losses. These grants also allow for the providing recipients       with the financial counseling and education necessary to       conduct transactions and manage their accounts. These loans       provide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other       nontraditional forms of financing that often impose excessive       interest rates and fees on borrowers, and lead millions of       people in the United States to fall into debt traps. Small-      dollar loans can only be made pursuant to terms, conditions,       and practices that are reasonable for the individual consumer       obtaining the loan.        (4) Program participation is restricted to eligible       institutions, which are limited to organizations listed in       section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and       exempt from tax under 501(a) of such Code, federally insured       depository institutions, community development financial       institutions and State, local, or Tribal governmental       entities.        (5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has awarded over       $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and CDEs and has allocated       $54,000,000,000 in tax credits and $1,510,000,000 in bond       guarantees. According to the CDFI Fund, some programs attract       as much as $10 in private capital for every $1 invested by       the CDFI Fund. The Administration and Congress should       prioritize appropriation of funds for the loan loss reserve       fund and technical assistance programs administered by the       CDFI Fund.

(5) Removal of designation.--If the appropriate Federal       banking agency determines that a depository institution       designated as an impact bank no longer meets the criteria for       such designation, the appropriate Federal banking agency       shall rescind the designation and notify the depository       institution of such rescission.        (6) Reconsideration of designation; appeals.--Under such       procedures as the Federal banking agencies may establish, a       depository institution may--        (A) submit to the appropriate Federal banking agency a       request to reconsider a determination that such depository       institution no longer meets the criteria for the designation;       or        (B) file an appeal of such determination.

TITLE V--DOWNPAYMENT ON BUILDING 21ST CENTURY INFRASTRUCTURE       SEC. 5001. FINDINGS.

(2) The current COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionally       impacted communities of color and exacerbated the conditions       that, combined with persistently underfunded critical       priorities like public health, child care, infrastructure,       and job creation, have led to record levels of poverty and       sickness.        (3) The historical record of Federal underinvestment in       communities of color has created systematic disparities that       cross nearly every economic sector and require Congressional       and Executive action to undo.        (4) This Act makes critical short term investments to       respond to these disparities exacerbated by the pandemic, in       areas like in child care, mental health and primary care, and       job creation.        (5) This Act has a secondary objective of helping to build       long lasting wealth, health,  [[Page S7758]]       and economic stability in these communities with an initial       commitment to be made over the next 5 years through       investments in infrastructure, a homeowner down payment tax       credit, Medicaid expansion, and more.        (6) This Act is not the conclusion of efforts in this       space, but an initial down payment to communities of color       and the first in many focused investments and policy       initiatives to begin dismantling systematic racism.
