 Mr. Chairman, the Northern Plains Unmanned Aircraft  Systems Test Site in Grand Forks, North Dakota, is doing extensive work  with private industry stakeholders in advancing this very important  emerging industry. However, the growth of the UAS industry is reliant  on receiving dedicated spectrum allocation to ensure the connection for  beyond visual line of sight operations.   My amendment simply directs the FAA, the NTIA, and the FCC to submit  to Congress a report on whether UAS operations of all sizes, at all  altitudes, should be permitted to operate on spectrum that is  designated for aviation use. It may also include recommendations of  other licensed spectrum frequencies, such as LTE, that may be  appropriate for flying UAS.   I encourage my colleagues to vote for my amendment to advance the UAS  industry, and I look forward to working with stakeholders and Members  of the Senate to take it across the finish line.
