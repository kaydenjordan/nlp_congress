 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize M's  Machine and Manufacturing Company of Monona, IA, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week during National Women's Small Business Month.   M's Machine and Manufacturing Company was founded by Phil Murphy and  Chet Allen in Monona, IA, in 1981 as a way to provide original  equipment manufacturers--OEMs--CNC machine services. In 1989, Virginia  Drahn purchased M's Machine and Manufacturing from the original  founders and continued their legacy while being a female-owned and  operated business. In 2008, Virginia sold the company to family members  Casey, Candace, and Cory Drahn, with Casey currently serving as the  president and Candace as vice president. Four generations of the Drahn  family have worked at the company, which is still a woman-owned  provider of CNC machine services. They offer CNC machine parts to the  agriculture, automotive, industrial, and medical industries throughout  the Midwest and have customers in North Carolina and South Carolina.  M's Machine and Manufacturing Company has grown to 32 full-time  employees and celebrated its 42nd business anniversary in 2023.   M's Machine and Manufacturing Company and the Drahn family are  Clayton County and Monona community staples. In 2017, they were  featured on KCRG's ``Made in Eastern Iowa'' segment, highlighting their  business's growth and success as a women-owned manufacturer. The team  at M's Machine and Manufacturing Company not only works hard, but they  also give back. They have participated in National Manufacturing Day,  an event held on the first Friday of October and have hosted local  students to learn about manufacturing and encourage them to pursue jobs  in the industry.   M's Machine commitment to providing OEMs with high-quality CNC  machine services in Monona, IA, is clear. I want to congratulate the  Drahn family and the entire team at M's Machine and Manufacturing  Company for their continued dedication. I look forward to seeing their  continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize  Steffensmeier Welding and Manufacturing of Pilot Grove, IA, as the  Senate Small Business of the Week during National Women's Small  Business Month.   Steffensmeier Welding and Manufacturing was founded by Ben  Steffensmeier in 1982 as a one-person welding shop. He founded the  business 2 years after graduating from Fort Madison High School in Fort  Madison, IA, and learning how to weld from Joe Mertens and Paul Conrad.  In 1985, the one-person shop expanded after Ben hired his brother Glenn  Steffensmeier and in 1986 moved the business to their current city of  operation, Pine Grove. Steffensmeier Welding and Manufacturing started  as a local shop that helped local farmers and has grown to service  several big-name clients. In 2000, his wife Jenny started working at  the company in a part-time capacity. Jenny eventually took over the  day-to-day control of the company in 2011 following Ben's battle with  Frontotemporal Dementia. In 2015, Ben  [[Page S4976]]  Steffensmeier passed away leaving behind a legacy of hard work,  resilience, and excellence in the welding profession.   Today, Jenny Steffensmeier continues to lead the company and has  grown to include 12 employees, including 4 of her 5 children working at  the company in varying capacities. While in this position, Jenny  Steffensmeier has been recognized for her contributions to the welding  and manufacturing industry as a female president. She is an alumna of  the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Program, a program that  promotes, highlights, and educates small businesses and their  importance in the U.S. economy. She has been featured on the Iowa  Business Report radio program, Southeastern Community College  ``Friends'' profile, and the ``Talks at GS'' episode where she joined  Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds for a conversation on small businesses.  Jenny also serves on the boards of the Iowa Association of Business and  Industry and the Iowa Economic Development Authority. In April, 2022, I  had the opportunity to tour Steffensmeier Welding and Manufacturing  with Jenny and her daughter Rachel as part of my River to River Tour.  Steffensmeier Welding and Manufacturing's hard work has paid off; in  2023, they celebrated their 41st business anniversary.   Steffensmeier Welding and Manufacturing's commitment to providing  high-quality commercial welding and manufacturing services in Pilot  Grove, IA, is clear. I want to congratulate the Jenny Steffensmeier,  the Steffensmeier family, and the entire team at Steffensmeier Welding  and Manufacturing for their continued dedication. I look forward to  seeing their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
