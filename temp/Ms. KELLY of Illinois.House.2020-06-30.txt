 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2, the Moving Forward Act.   For too long, we have neglected our Nation's roads, bridges, and  airports, while inequalities in broadband access and healthcare have  increased.   Our Nation's infrastructure is in need of significant upgrades to  make our roads safer, reduce congestion, and make our transportation  networks more energy efficient.   The Second District of Illinois, in particular, will benefit from the  support for small airports, investment in rail, and increased access to  affordable housing.   This bill invests $100 billion to promote competition for broadband  internet infrastructure for underserved rural, suburban, and urban  communities.   The coronavirus epidemic has shown just how important it is to have  access to high-speed internet. From completing school classes at home  to conducting a virtual visit over telehealth, the need for  connectivity has never been higher.   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will continue to  look at infrastructure as a bipartisan issue and support this package  to upgrade our communities for the 21st century.
