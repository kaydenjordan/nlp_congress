 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the  bipartisan House Career and Technical Education Caucus, I rise to  commemorate the 100th Anniversary of Advance CTE: State Leaders  Connecting Learning to Work.   Advance CTE was founded in 1920 and is the longest standing national  nonprofit that represents State career and technical education  directors and leaders responsible for secondary, postsecondary, and  adult career and technical education across the Nation.   Each year, CTE provides 12 million learners with the tools to succeed  in a skills-based career of their choice. With more than 7 million jobs  available in the United States, CTE learners are helping close our  Nation's skills gap.   Advance CTE is committed to supporting States for another 100 years  to ensure high-quality CTE programs are available to all individuals,  no matter their age, background, or ZIP Code.   Earlier this week, I introduced a resolution with my friend and  colleague,  Jim Langevin, to recognize February as CTE month. In the  same spirit, I ask my colleagues to please join me in celebrating 100  years of Advance CTE and all that they do to promote skills-based  education and opportunity in life.                            ____________________
