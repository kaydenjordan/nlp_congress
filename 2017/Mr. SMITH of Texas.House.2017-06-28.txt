 Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the  gentleman from Georgia, a member of the Rules Committee, for yielding  me time.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the underlying bill, H.R. 3003, No  Sanctuary for Criminals Act; and I thank the chairman, Bob Goodlatte,  and Representatives Steve King and Andy Biggs for introducing it.   This legislation keeps dangerous criminal immigrants off our streets  and out of our neighborhoods, and it holds sanctuary cities accountable  for breaking Federal immigration laws. I have a special interest in  this legislation because it enforces a bill I sponsored in 1969, which  was enacted into law and made sanctuary cities illegal.   The American people sent a clear message to Congress last November  when they elected a President who promised to enforce our immigration  laws. A recent poll shows that 80 percent--80 percent--of voters want  cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes to be required to turn  them over to immigration authorities. Eighty percent. That is a  Harvard-Harris poll.   The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is a down payment on our pledge to  protect innocent Americans from criminal immigrants who deserve to be  jailed or sent back to their home countries. We need to enact this  legislation. There is simply no excuse for local governments to ignore  immigration laws at the expense of American's safety and well-being.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to the entire Congress  from the American Immigration Lawyers Association in opposition to this  bill; a letter from Amnesty International in opposition to this bill;  and a letter from Church World Services in opposition to this bill.  Statement of the American Immigration Lawyers Association Opposing the  ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R.                           3004), June 27, 2017.         As the national bar association of over 15,000 immigration       lawyers and law professors, the American Immigration Lawyers       Association (AILA) opposes ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act''       (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004). AILA recommends       that members of Congress reject these bills which are       scheduled to come before the House Rules Committee on June 27       and to the floor shortly thereafter. Though Judiciary       Chairman Goodlatte stated that the bills will ``enhance       public safety,'' they will do the just the opposite:       undermine public safety and make it even harder for local law       enforcement to protect their residents and communities. In       addition, the bills which were made public less than a week       before the vote and completely bypassed the Judiciary       Committee, include provisions that will result in violations       of due process and the Fourth and Tenth Amendments to the       Constitution.        At a time when over 9 out 10 Americans support immigration       reform and legalization of the undocumented, Republican       leadership is asking the House to vote on enforcement-only       bills that will lead to more apprehensions, deportations, and       prosecutions of thousands of immigrants and their families       who have strong ties to the United States. Instead of       criminalizing and scapegoating immigrants, Congress should be       offering workable reforms that will strengthen our economy       and our country.                The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003         H.R. 3003 would undermine public safety and interfere with       local policing: H.R. 3003 would amend 8 Sec. U.S.C. 1373 to       prevent states or localities from establishing laws or       policies that prohibit or ``in any way'' restrict compliance       with or cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The       bill dramatically expands 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1373 which is more       narrowly written and prohibits local law enforcement from       restricting the sharing and exchange of information with       federal authorities, but only with respect to an individual's       citizenship or immigration status.        Rather than empowering localities, the extremely broad       wording of H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the ability to       enact common-sense crime prevention policies that ensure       victims of crime will seek protection and report crimes. The       bill would also undermine public safety by prohibiting DHS       from honoring criminal warrants of communities deemed       ``sanctuary cities'' if the individual being sought by local       law enforcement has a final order of removal.        Under H.R. 3003, localities that fail to comply with       federal immigration efforts are penalized with the denial of       federal funding for critical law enforcement, national       security, drug treatment, and crime victim initiatives,       including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program       (SCAAP), Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and       Byrne JAG programs that provide hundreds of millions of       dollars to localities nationwide.        In an effort to force localities to engage in civil       immigration enforcement efforts, including those against       nonviolent undocumented immigrants, the bill would make it       far more difficult for many localities, including large       cities, to arrest and prosecute potentially dangerous       criminals. The bill could even offer criminals a form of       immunity, knowing that any crimes they commit in a designated       sanctuary city would result, at most, in their removal from       the country as opposed to criminal prosecution.        H.R. 3003 would run afoul of constitutional safeguards in       the Fourth Amendment: By prohibiting localities from       restricting or limiting their own cooperation with federal       immigration enforcement, H.R. 3003 effectively compels       localities to honor ICE detainer requests--a controversial       and constitutionally suspect practice that is nonetheless       widely-used by ICE. Federal courts have found that ICE use of       detainers violates the Fourth Amendment, and that localities       may be held liable for honoring them.        The bill also expands detainer authority by establishing       that ICE may issue detainer requests for localities to hold       undocumented immigrants for up to 96 hours--twice what is       currently allowed--even if probable cause has not been shown.       Courts have concluded that localities cannot continue       detaining someone unless ICE obtains a warrant from a neutral       magistrate who has determined there is probable cause, or in       the case of a warrantless arrest, review by a neutral       magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. The expansive       provisions in H.R. 3003 would force localities to choose       between detaining people in violation of the Constitution or       being punished as a ``sanctuary city.''        Furthermore, this bill provides government actors and       private contractors with immunity if they are sued for       violating the Constitution. Provisions in this bill transfer       the financial burden of litigation by substituting the       federal government for the local officers as the defendant.       If H.R. 3003 becomes law, American taxpayers would be stuck       paying for lawsuits brought by those who are unjustly       detained.        The bill goes even further by creating a private right of       action allowing crime victims or their family members to sue       localities if the crime was committed by someone who was       released by the locality that did not honor an ICE detainer       request.        H.R. 3003 would violate the Tenth Amendment: H.R. 3003       would compel states and localities to utilize their local law       enforcement resources to implement federal civil  [[Page H5254]]       immigration enforcement in violation of the Tenth Amendment's       ``commandeering'' principle. The Tenth Amendment does not       permit the federal government to force counties and cities to       allocate local resources, including police officers,       technology, and personnel, to enforce federal immigration       law. The federal government also cannot withhold funds from       localities refusing to participate in federal efforts if the       programs affected are unrelated to the purpose of the federal       program, or if the sanctions are punitive in nature.        H.R. 3003 would expand detention without due process: H.R.       3003 would increase the use of detention without ensuring       those detained have access to a bond determination. Under the       bill, nearly anyone who is undocumented, including those who       have overstayed their visa would be subject to detention       without a custody hearing. The bill also establishes that DHS       has the authority to detain individuals ``without time       limitation'' during the pendency of removal proceedings.       These provisions would dramatically expand the federal       government's power to indefinitely detain individuals, and       would likely result in ever growing numbers of undocumented       immigrants held in substandard detention facilities.                            Kate's Law, H.R. 3004         H.R. 3004 would expand the already severe penalties in       federal law for illegal reentry (NA 276; 8 U.S.C. 1326). The       number of people prosecuted for illegal reentry has grown       steadily to about 20,000 prosecutions each year, and such       cases comprise more than one quarter of all federal criminal       prosecutions nationwide. H.R. 3004 adds sentencing       enhancements for people who are convicted of minor       misdemeanors and people who have reentered multiple times but       have no criminal convictions. This bill will not improve       public safety and will undermine due process and protections       for asylum seekers. H.R. 3004 would waste American taxpayer       funds by imposing severe prison sentences upon thousands of       people who pose no threat to the community and who have       strong ties to the country and are trying to unite with their       loved ones.        H.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements upon       people with minor offenses: H.R. 3004 would add sentencing       enhancements for minor misdemeanor convictions, including       driving without a license and other traffic-related offenses.       Under the current version of INA Sec. 276, if a person is       charged with reentering the U.S. after being removed, their       punishment is enhanced by up to ten years only if they have       been convicted a felony or three or more misdemeanors       involving drugs or violence. Under H.R. 3004 someone who has       been convicted of any three misdemeanors regardless of       severity would be subject to a term of up to ten years.        This expansion would unfairly target large numbers of       people who are not a threat to public safety but instead are       trying to reunite with family members and have other strong       ties to the United States. Currently half of all people       convicted of illegal reentry have one child living in the       country. Increasing sentences for illegal reentry would also       waste taxpayer dollars, costing huge amounts of money to lock       up non-violent people.        H.R. 3004 would punish people who attempt to seek asylum at       the border: H.R. 3004 expands the provisions of INA 276 to       punish not only people who reenter the U.S. or attempt to       reenter the U.S., but also people who cross or attempt to       cross the border. The bill goes on to define ``crosses the       border'' to mean ``the physical act of crossing the border,       regardless of whether the alien is free from official       restraint.'' That means that people who present themselves at       ports of entry to request asylum and are taken into custody       by CBP to await a fear screening would be subject to criminal       charges based on a past removal, even though they are seeking       refuge in the U.S.        H.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements for       people with multiple entries: The bill would also create new       sentencing enhancements for people who have reentered the       U.S. multiple times, even if they have no other criminal       convictions. If someone has been removed three or more times,       and is found in the United States or attempts to cross the       border again, H.R. 3004 law would provide for sentencing       enhancements of up to ten years. The bill makes no exception       for bona fide asylum seekers, which means that people who are       seeking refuge in the U.S. from atrocities abroad could be       subject to a lengthy prison sentence under these provisions.        H.R. 3004 would undermine due process by blocking       challenges to unfair removal orders: The bill will prevent an       individual from challenging the validity of a removal order,       even it was fundamentally unfair in the first place. The       Supreme Court held in U.S. v. Mendoza-Lopez,481 U.S. 828       (1987) that due process requires that a challenge be allowed       if a deportation proceeding is used as an element of a       criminal offense and where the proceeding ``effectively       eliminate[d] the right of the alien to obtain judicial       review.'' This provision in H.R. 3004 is likely       unconstitutional and will cause grave injustice to       defendants, such as asylum seekers who were deported without       the opportunity to seek asylum.                                   ____                                            Amnesty International,                                                      June 28, 2017.     Amnesty International USA urges a vote ``NO'' on H.R. 3003 and H.R.                                    3004         Dear Representative: On behalf of Amnesty International USA       (``AIUSA'') and our more than one million members and       supporters nationwide, we strongly urge you to oppose the No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) and Kate's Law (H.R.       3004). Both bills are scheduled for House floor votes as       early as June 28. If passed, both bills would pave the way       for and accelerate the implementation of policies that       increase the criminalization and detention of immigrants and       asylum seekers, thereby violating the United States'       obligations under international law.        AIUSA will be scoring these votes.        I. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) would       prevent municipalities from determining how law enforcement       agencies are engaging in immigration enforcement, and would       dramatically expand indefinite detention and mandatory       detention of immigrants in jail-like facilities with subpar       dangerous conditions, in violation of international human       rights standards.        H.R. 3003 would prevent localities from enacting community       trust policies that instruct local police not to carry out       federal immigration enforcement, thereby undermining policing       practices designed to build trust and confidence between       local law enforcement and the communities they serve. This       bill would open the door to racial profiling against Latinos       and other communities of color, including U.S. citizens.        International law firmly prohibits discrimination, and the       United States' commitment to those obligations applies to       citizens and non-citizens alike.        States that have passed anti-immigrant legislation that       requires local law enforcement to cooperate with immigration       agencies or to inquire about immigration status regarding any       interactions with law enforcement have compromised the right       to justice for immigrant communities by discouraging       immigrant survivors from reporting crimes.        The U.S. government has an obligation to prevent and       address abuse of immigrants and ensure that all immigrants       are able to access available remedies. This includes acting       with due diligence to investigate and punish criminal conduct       committed by private individuals, and guaranteeing access to       justice for immigrant victims of crime.        Amnesty International has also documented how the increased       involvement of state and local law enforcement agencies in       immigration enforcement, without adequate oversight and       accountability to prevent abuses, contributes to the rise in       reports of racial profiling for Latino communities and other       communities of color. Numerous studies have demonstrated that       programs that integrate the criminal justice system and law       enforcement as an entry point for immigration enforcement       have led to racial profiling and other abuses.        In addition, H.R. 3003 would dramatically expand the       Department of Homeland Security (``DES'') immigration       detention powers by authorizing mandatory detention ``without       time limitation.'' This would empower the DHS to detain       untold numbers of immigrants for as long as it takes to       conclude immigration court removal proceedings, even if that       takes years. Section 4 would also authorize indefinite       mandatory detention Without providing the basic due process       of an immigration judge bond hearing to determine if the       immigrant's imprisonment was justified in the first place.       Finally, section 4 would expand mandatory detention of       immigrants with no criminal record whatsoever, including       immigrants who overstayed a visa or lack legal papers.        The mandatory detention system, which provides for the       automatic detention of individuals, amounts to arbitrary       detention, and is in violation of international law, which       requires that detention be justified in each individual case       and be subject to judicial review. The expansion of offenses       which would fall under mandatory detention as demonstrated in       H.R., as proposed by H.R. 3003, amounts to arbitrary       detention, and is in violation of international law, which       requires that detention be justified in each individual case       and be subject to judicial review. U.S. federal courts have       also consistently held that detaining immigrants for months       and years without bond hearings raises serious problems under       the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.        The proposed dramatic expansion of immigration detention       powers envisioned in H.R. 3003 comes at a time when       immigration detention has already hit record-highs, with the       average daily population (``ADP'') exceeding 40,000 in       comparison to a 34,000 ADP for the preceding seven years.       This sharp escalation in the number of detained immigrants       also comes at a time when Human Rights Watch (``HRW'') has       reported new evidence of dangerously subpar medical care in       immigration detention, including unreasonable delays in care       and unqualified medical staff that are likely to expose a       record number of immigrants to dangerous conditions. This       recent HRW report is only the latest of a series of shocking       reports documenting DHS's failure to provide care to ill or       injured immigrants in its custody.        The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights       (ICCPR), which the United States has ratified, guarantees all       people the rights to be free from discrimination and       arbitrary arrest and detention, and the right to due process,       including fair deportation procedures. Finally, noncitizens       who are detained have a right to humane conditions of       detention and are entitled to prompt review  [[Page H5255]]       of their detention by an independent court. The mass       expansion of mandatory detention and immigration detention       proposed by H.R. 3003 violates all of these international       human rights standards.        II. H.R. 3004 would increase mass incarceration of       immigrants, including survivors of persecution or torture, by       increasing criminal penalties for the mere act of migration--      in violation of international human rights standards.        Current law already criminalizes illegal reentry in       violation of international law and standards under 8 U.S.C.       Sec. 1326, imposing a sentence of up to 20 years on anyone       convicted of illegal reentry after committing an aggravated       felony. According to data compiled by the Transactional       Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, in       fiscal year 2016 federal criminal prosecutions for illegal       entry, reentry, and similar immigration violations made up 52       percent of all federal prosecutions nationwide--surpassing       drugs, weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes.        Criminal penalties for unauthorized entry are obstacles for       identifying the victims of human rights abuses, and prevent       victims from seeking justice. They undermine human rights       protections afforded in international law, including the       right to seek asylum. The Special Rapporteur on the Human       Rights of Migrants has repeatedly stressed that where       detention is used as a punitive measure, it is       disproportionate and inappropriate, and stigmatizes       undocumented immigrants as criminals.        The criminal prosecution of illegal reentry has grown       exponentially over the past decade. In 2002 there were 8,000       prosecutions for illegal reentry; in 2012 these prosecutions       had increased to 37,000. Nearly 99 percent of illegal reentry       defendants were sentenced to federal prison time, ranging       from a few days to 10 years or more for felony reentry before       they are eventually deported.        Beyond the trend towards more aggressive criminal       prosecutions for illegal reentry, a 2015 U.S. Sentencing       Commission report found nearly 50 percent of people sentenced       in fiscal 2013 for illegal re-entry had at least one child       living in the U.S. Many of the individuals charged with       illegal reentry previously resided in the U.S. for many years       and are desperate to return to their family in the U.S.        On top of this longstanding trend of harsher criminal       prosecution for illegal reentry--the sponsors of H.R. 3004       would seek to expand the category of individuals subject to       illegal reentry prosecution to include people who surrender       themselves at the southern border to seek protection in the       U.S. The bill would also expand sentencing enhancements for       illegal reentry, and would prosecute people for illegal       reentry even if their previous removal orders were unlawful       or deprived them of the opportunity to seek protection. For       example, the bill would criminalize asylum seekers who return       to the U.S. after being previously denied the opportunity to       present their claims for protection.        While all sovereign states have a legitimate interest in       regulating entry into their territories, they can only do so       within the limits of their obligations under international       law. The U.S. government has an obligation under       international human rights law to ensure that its laws,       policies, and practices do not place immigrants at an       increased risk of human rights abuses. Specifically,       individuals have a right to seek asylum from persecution and       protection from refoulement, and prosecuting asylum seekers       prior to adjudication of their asylum applications violates       U.S. obligations under the Refugee Convention. Similarly the       Convention Against Torture prohibits a State from expelling,       returning, or extraditing a person to another State where       there are substantial grounds for believing that s/he would       be in danger of being subjected to torture. Finally, all       individuals, regardless of immigration status, have a right       to family unity which can include limits on the State's power       to deport, as recognized by the Human Rights Committee's       interpretation of ICCPR obligations        All of these international human rights standards are       violated by H.R. 3004.        AIUSA strongly urges you to oppose both H.R. 3003 and H.R.       3004.            Sincerely,                                                     Joanne Lin,                                           Senior Managing Director,      Advocacy and Government Affairs.                                   ____     CWS Statement to Opposing H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals                       Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law         As a 71-year old humanitarian organization representing 37       Protestant, Anglican, and Orthodox communions and 34 refugee       resettlement offices across the country, Church World Service       (CWS) urges all Members of Congress to support the       longstanding efforts of law enforcement officials to foster       trusting relationships with the communities they protect and       serve. As we pray for peace and an end to senseless acts of       violence that are too prevalent in this country, CWS       encourages the U.S. Congress to refrain from politicizing       tragedies or conflating the actions of one person with an       entire community of our immigrant brothers and sisters and       oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and       H.R. 3004, Kate's Law.        H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, would target       more than 600+ cities, counties, and states across the       country and threaten to take away millions of dollars in       federal funding that local police use to promote public       safety. Communities are safer when they commit to policies       that strengthen trust and cooperation between local law       enforcement, community leadership and institutions, and all       residents, regardless of immigration status. The Federal       government should not hurt intentional, community-based       policing efforts that are vital in communities across the       country. Many cities have already recognized that requests by       Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold individuals       beyond their court-appointed sentences violate due process       and have been found unconstitutional by federal courts. This       bill would raise profound constitutional concerns by       prohibiting localities from declining to comply with ICE       detainer requests even when such compliance would violate       federal court orders and the U.S. Constitution. Local police       that refuse ICE detainer requests see an increase in public       safety due to improved trust from the community. It is       precisely this trust that enables community members to report       dangerous situations without the fear of being deported or       separated from their families. When local police comply with       ICE detainer requests, more crimes go unreported because       victims and witnesses are afraid of being deported if they       contact the police. This bill would also undermine local       criminal prosecutions by allowing the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) to ignore state or local criminal warrants and       refuse to transfer individuals to state or local custody in       certain circumstances. This bill would reduce community       safety by preventing state and local jurisdictions from       holding people accountable.        The United States already spends more than $18 billion on       immigration enforcement per year, more than all other federal       law enforcement agencies combined. H.R. 3004, Kate's Law,       would expand the federal government's ability to prosecute       individuals for ``illegal reentry'' and impose even more       severe penalties in these cases--even though prosecutions for       migration-related offenses already make up more than 50% of       all federal prosecutions. Yet, this bill does not include       adequate protections for individuals who reenter the U.S. in       order to seek protection, which would place asylum seekers at       risk of being returned to the violence and persecution they       fled. We have seen how Border Patrol's current practices       violate existing U.S. law and treaty obligations by       preventing viable asylum claims from moving forward. DHS has       found that in some areas, Border Patrol refers asylum seekers       for criminal prosecution despite the fact that they have       expressed fear of persecution. In May 2017, a report was       released highlighting that many asylum seekers, who had       expressed a fear of returning to their home countries are       being turned away by GBP agents. New barriers to protection       are unnecessary and would dangerously impede our obligations       under international and U.S. law.        Federal, state, and local policies that focus on       deportation do not reduce crime rates. Individuals are being       deported who present no risk to public safety and who are       long-standing community members, including parents of young       children. Immigrants come to this country to reunite with       family, work, and make meaningful contributions that enrich       their communities. Several studies over the last century have       affirmed that all immigrants, regardless of nationality or       status, are less likely than U.S. citizens to commit violent       crimes. A recent report found a correlation between the       increase in undocumented immigrants, and the sharp decline in       violent and property crime rates. Immigration is correlated       with significantly higher employment growth and a decline in       the unemployment rate, and immigrants have high       entrepreneurial rates, creating successful businesses that       hire immigrant and U.S. citizen employees.        As communities of faith, we are united by principles of       compassion, stewardship, and justice. CWS urges all Members       of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for       Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law. What we need are       real solutions and immigration policies that treat our       neighbors with the dignity and respect that all people       deserve and affirm local law enforcement officer's efforts to       build trust with their communities.    Mr. McGOVERN. Again, Mr. Speaker, our objection is that Washington  doesn't always know best. We ought to trust our local law enforcement  officials, our local police as to what is effective in terms of  protecting the citizens of our community.   To introduce legislation that would essentially punish our local  police for doing what they think is in the best interest of their  communities, this bill should be renamed ``punish our local police,''  because that is what it does.   I can't believe that we are going down this road. Maybe it is a nice  sound bite, maybe it is a nice press release, maybe it fits in with the  Trump campaign rhetoric on immigrants and immigration; but this is just  a lousy idea. And I think if we did hearings on this bill, if we  actually spent some time being thoughtful about this issue, my  colleagues would come to that conclusion.   Again, I would say that what we should be talking about is fixing our  [[Page H5256]]  broken immigration system. We need comprehensive immigration reform.  The Senate, in a bipartisan way, stepped up to the plate and did it. It  is about time Members of this House have the guts to bring a  comprehensive immigration reform bill to the floor and fix our broken  immigration system.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
