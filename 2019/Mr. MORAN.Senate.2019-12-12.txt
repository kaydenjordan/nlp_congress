 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit the  following letter from U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Robert L.  Wilkie, for the Record.   So Ordered.       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC 20510.        Dear Senator McConnell: In accordance with the requirements       of section 1703E(f)(2) of title 38, United States Code,       enclosed is the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) report on       a request for a waiver to allow VA to pilot community       partnered collaborations to expand dental care for Veterans.       We request that copies of this waiver be provided to the       Chair and Ranking Member of applicable standing committees       with jurisdiction to report a bill to amend the provision or       provisions of law that would be waived by VA, consistent with       section 1703E(f)(3).        As required by section 1703E(f)(2), the enclosed report       describes in detail the specific authorities to be waived       under the pilot program; the standard or standards to be used       in the pilot program in lieu of the waived authorities; the       reasons for such waiver or waivers; a description of the       metric or metrics VA will use to determine the effect of the       waiver or waivers upon the access to and quality, timeliness,       or patient satisfaction of care and services furnished       through the pilot program; the anticipated cost savings, if       any, of the pilot program; the schedule for interim reports       on the pilot program describing the results of the pilot       program so far and the feasibility and advisability of       continuing the pilot program; the schedule for the       termination of the pilot program and the submission of a       final report on the pilot program describing the result of       the pilot program and the feasibility and advisability of       making the pilot program permanent; and the estimated budget       of the pilot program.        Consistent with section 17.450 of title 38, Code of Federal       Regulations, this report also includes the geographic       locations for each pilot program, the rationale for those       selections, and how VA believes the selected locations will       address deficits in care for a defined population; any       applicable provision of existing regulations implementing any       laws to be waived; and any more specific definitions of terms       included in section 17.450(b), as necessitated by the       specific provisions of the proposed pilot program.        The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is       no objection to the submission of this waiver proposal to       Congress and that its enactment would be in accord with the       program of the President.        Thank you for your continuing support of our mission. A       similar letter has been sent to other leaders of the Congress       and the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs.            Sincerely,      Robert L. Wilkie.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit the  following letter from U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Robert L.
