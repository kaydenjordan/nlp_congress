 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, a bill that  promotes conflict over clarity, callousness over kindness, and politics  over problemsolving.   I am speaking today, not just as a Member of Congress, but as the  parent of three young children, two of whom attend public schools in  Louisville, Kentucky, and one who will be soon.   Parents should be involved in their kids' education, in everything  from school board elections to the PTA, to communicating with their  child's teacher on what is going on.   We received a message this morning from our kids' teacher letting us  know that there would be no band because of the fifth grade musical.   This bill is about impeding, not involvement. The reason the American  Library Association opposes this bill is because H.R. 5 clearly opens  the door to deprive our kids of fact-based education, and it is part of  a larger effort to ban free expression and ideas in the classroom. Even  Cato thinks it is unconstitutional.   Like a lot of parents, we had to step in and teach some during the  beginning of the pandemic. It wasn't easy, and I can assure you that  curriculum should be ultimately determined by experts, not untrained  individuals with extremist views.   In addition to restricting parents' rights, H.R. 5 hurts some of our  most vulnerable kids in the LGBTQ community. Why?   According to the Trevor Project, one LGBTQ youth attempts suicide  every 45 seconds, 45 seconds. Why?   Why are we being more cruel?   I believe that not just in politics but in life we are judged by how  we treat those on the margins. My message to my colleagues is simple:  Stop being mean to kids. We can be involved and be inclusive.   Normally, we warn our kids about dealing with bullies in their  classrooms. We shouldn't have to warn them about bullying from adults,  too. This message is simple, and I urge my colleagues to vote against  it.
