I. Washington, III was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina. He  devoted much of his adult life to working within the South Carolina  Democratic Party, pushing for more equitable participation and  leadership for Black members of the party.   Mr. Washington played a key role in moving Black people into the  political arena in Orangeburg County. Although he preferred working  behind the scenes, many former Black politicians from the county and  State revered him as the glue that held the political fabric together  during his time in politics.   He was also successful in his business, the Washington Poultry Farm,  which was known far and wide across South Carolina.   He served on the Santee Cooper Board of Directors and the South  Carolina State University Board of Trustees. He was also a member of  the NAACP, the Urban Planning Commission, the Board of Voter  Registration, and the Orangeburg Civic Breakfast Club.   In addition, Mr. Washington served our country with the 351st Field  Artillery Battalion in the European theater during World War II.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Mr.  Washington by naming the Post Office in Orangeburg, South Carolina,  after him.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
