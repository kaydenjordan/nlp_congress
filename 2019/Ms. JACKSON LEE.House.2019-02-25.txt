 Mr. Speaker, just recently, I was very proud and  pleased that this body passed my legislation, the Juvenile Block Grant  Anti-Bullying and Intervention Act, dealing with the prevention of  bullying but, more importantly, dealing with the opportunities for  communities across America to begin to think more creatively about how  you deal with juvenile justice, how you deal with young people of  juvenile age who have gone awry of school laws, regular actions of  criminal activities. How do you deal with these young people?   It is clear that the juvenile justice system needs to be reformed. As  a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, it is my commitment to  listen to people from across the Nation.   Many people don't realize that once you are committed to a juvenile  detention center or facility or jail, under juvenile laws in most  States, and many of them receiving Federal dollars, you will find that  there is no definitive sentence. They are sentenced and could be there  from age 14 to 21.   It may be that their parents do not have resources to get them out;  it may be that they do not have an alternative place to go; and it may  be that they have no representation. That is not the way to treat young  people.   So we will be looking for legislation to incentivize our States to  change the juvenile justice and the criminal justice system, and we  look forward to working with all of our colleagues.                            ____________________
