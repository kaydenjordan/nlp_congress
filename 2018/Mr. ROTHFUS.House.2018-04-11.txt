 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the careers of  Sergeants Charles Jeffers and Gerald ``Jake'' Stofko of the Johnstown  Police Department.   Sergeant Jeffers valiantly served the Johnstown community for 48  years, forging a legacy of bravery in public service.   Sergeant Stofko's 25-year-long career with the Johnstown Police  Department is one marked by excellence and dedication. Spending the  majority of his career working the midnight shift, the Johnstown  residents could sleep soundly knowing that Sergeant Stofko was on  watch.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank and congratulate these brave officers  for their combined 73 years of service and commitment to protecting the  people of Johnstown. I wish them both the best as they move forward  into the next chapter of their lives.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I rise to express my support for H.R. 4293, the Stress Test  Improvement Act.   I also want to commend my colleague Representative Zeldin for his  work on this important issue.   Those of us who travel our districts to speak with the men and women  who work at financial institutions are well aware of the high costs and  lack of clarity in the stress test process. Companies are being forced  to dedicate substantial resources and immense amounts of time to go  through the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, and the  Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests, DFAST.   I have spoken to compliance staff who reported submissions in the  tens of thousands of pages. For each dollar or staffer put towards CCAR  or DFAST, there are fewer resources being dedicated to innovation or  helping customers.   Of course, we all believe that stress tests can and should be useful  experiences. Some of the information turned up in stress tests could be  helpful, but we are desperately in need to enact meaningful reform to  provide better transparency, clarity, and reduce undue burden.   Columbia University Professor Charles Calomiris described the process  as one in which ``regulators punish banks for failing to meet standards  that are never stated.'' Let me repeat that: ``. . . failing to meet  standards that are never stated.'' It is sort of a Kafkaesque creature  of our bureaucracy.   Zeldin's bill improves the stress testing process by requiring the  Federal Reserve to follow regular notice-and-comment practices and  issue clear regulations on economic conditions and methodologies and to  assess the effectiveness of the Fed's models. It also alleviates the  compliance burden on firms by spacing out CCARs and DFASTs. These are  targeted, reasonable reforms that can greatly improve the process. This  will enhance, not hurt, financial stability and leave us with a  healthier more vibrant economy.   Again, I urge my colleagues to support the Stress Test Improvement  Act.
