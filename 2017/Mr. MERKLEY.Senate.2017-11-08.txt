 Mr. President, a few moments from now, we are going to  come to this Chamber to vote on the nomination of Peter Robb to serve  as general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board.   Quite frankly, if we allow this individual to be confirmed, it will  be a severe slap in the face to American workers. This is an individual  who has made a career out of attacking the ability of American workers  to get a fair share of the wealth they create. Yet here is a proposal  to put him in a leadership position at an agency whose purpose is to  fight to make sure workers get fair treatment. How does it make sense  to take someone who has fought to undermine the ability of workers his  entire life and put that person in charge of making sure American  workers are treated fairly? Certainly, it is exactly the opposite of  the argument Candidate Trump made when he said he was going to stand up  for American workers. When push comes to shove, the President wants to  shove workers down into the ditch.   It boils down to this: The National Labor Relations Board was  established 82 years ago in the middle of the Great Depression to  protect workers by encouraging and promoting their right to collective  bargaining. Think of the power of association so that workers can have  the opportunity to have a fair share, to have a basic foundation for  their families to thrive. That ability of workers to organize has been  behind every advancement we have made as a middle class in America. Be  it the 40-hour workweek, safe working conditions, standard benefits,  each and every advance was led by workers' ability to organize. Yet  here the President wants to put in place an individual who has done  everything possible to take away that right, that ability to weigh in  for basic fundamental fairness for workers.   The responsibility of the National Labor Relations Board is more  important today than ever. We have seen the impact of policies on  behalf of the privileged and the powerful--incomes stagnating while the  wealthiest Americans see their riches grow right up to the skyline. We  have seen that anti-worker forces throughout our country have led an  assault in State after State after State against the right of workers  to organize and to secure safe working conditions and fair wages.   Here we are at a time when America's workers have seen four decades  in which their wages have been flat or declining while the rich and  powerful have stripped off the growing wealth of this Nation for  themselves. Income inequality has soared, wealth inequality is massive,  and here is one more person being nominated to accentuate that  inequality in wealth and in income.   Back in 1981, Mr. Robb was lead attorney on the case to decertify the  Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization. The union was  striking, and Mr. Robb helped President Reagan break that strike, which  resulted in the firing of 11,000 striking workers and, as a commentator  at the time said, forever ``undermined the bargaining of American  workers and their labor unions.''   When he last worked on the team at NLRB, this nominee was present for  decisions that--and this is recounted in a book called ``Right Turn''-- ``[a]ltered long-standing policy . . . narrowing the scope of  activities subject to traditional National Labor Relations Board  protections; broadening the permissible range of employer conduct in  union representation campaigns; lowering the costs to employers of  unlawful activity; and otherwise narrowing or excusing the employer to  make changes subject to bargaining without informing unions before the  change was made, or by permitting employers wider latitude to end the  bargaining process by declaring impasse.''   More recently, Mr. Robb represented Dominion Energy and successfully  defeated a union organizing drive at the Millstone Power Station,  bragging on his firm's website that he was able to delay the election  for ``more than two years after the day the petition was filed.''   As many of you know, he does not want workers to have a fair chance  to vote on organizing a union or to work to press for a first contract  or to seek fair wages. He has spent his career fighting against workers  having that fair shot and defending companies against allegations from  union members regarding unfair labor practices--all kinds of unfair  labor practices, including age and sex discrimination. Never once in  this long career has he been on the side of the American worker--not  once; therefore, he has no place  [[Page S7097]]  at the head of an organization intended to support the ability of  workers to organize and to press for a fair share.   It is unthinkable that this nominee would ever even come to this  Chamber. It is certainly part of an endless stream of attacks by the  rich and powerful on working Americans that have kept their wages flat  and declining for four decades. When are we going to see an end to this  sort of oppression by the powerful class against the workers of the  United States of America?   There is one act after another by this administration--President  Trump and his team--undermining fair wages for workers in this Nation.  It is outrageous. This nomination is outrageous, and I encourage my  colleagues to vote no.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern  Zach Foote be granted privileges of the floor for the remainder of the  day.    Mr. President, we have a very important role in this  Senate--to provide advice and consent on nominees. Our forefathers, who  wrote the Constitution, envisioned that this power would be used rarely  because a President, knowing this power existed, would nominate highly  suitable people for the post that they were intended to occupy. But we  haven't seen highly suitable people coming through this Chamber this  year. In fact, we have seen one person after another fabulously  unsuited for the office or position to which they were nominated.   We saw Scott Pruitt, who took on and attacked regulations designed to  create clean air across this country time after time, in a very close  association with the fossil fuel industry that wanted to allow more  particulates, more particulates that cause a tremendous amount of  health damage in this country.   We saw Betsy DeVos come through this Chamber, an individual who was  nominated to be Secretary of Public Education but had never stepped  inside a public school, didn't respect public schools, hadn't had  children in public schools, hadn't volunteered in public schools, and  wanted to decimate public schools. The best thing we could have done  for public schools would have been to turn down that nomination, but  this Chamber said: Boy, you know, we are going to do everything we can  to damage public education.   Many of us stood up against that and said: No, let's fight for  someone who can make public education better, not tear it down. But  that is not what we got.   Now we have another individual to be considered on the floor of the  Senate, Bill Wehrum. Bill Wehrum was nominated to head EPA's Office of  Air and Radiation. Bill Wehrum has made a career out of working for  powerful special interests and attacking any effort to make the air  cleaner. Is that a person suitable for this role of protecting the air  we breathe and making it better, someone who has sought to make it  worse?   During the nomination hearing, I put up a very simple chart. I wanted  to understand his thoughts about what was driving climate disruption. I  put up a chart showing what NASA data showed for the solar impact,  solar flares, and so forth, about which sometimes people say: Well,  maybe it is solar flares that are causing the warming of the planet.  NASA had data that showed a flat line on that and then a rising  temperature.   I said: Is there any sign of correlation between these two lines?   His response was: Well, what do you mean? It is correlation.   He didn't have any understanding of the basics of how to compare one  thing to another.   I put up another chart. The other chart showed all of the activities  that are considered to be ones that might contribute to global warming,  that are not manmade activities, things like the solar flares and  volcanic activity. Again, the NASA data showed a flat line and the  rising temperature.  [[Page S7123]]    I said: Does there appear to be any correlation between this flat  line and this rise in temperature?   He again said: I just don't understand the data. I can't really  comment on that.   Yet anyone with any basic ability to digest information would  recognize that there was no correlation. You didn't have two things  moving in the same direction.   Then I put up this chart right here. This chart shows that same  temperature, observe the black line, and then it shows the line for  rising carbon dioxide. I said: Well, are these things correlated?   Do you see any relationship between one line rising and the other  line rising?   Again, he refused to answer.   How is it that we can put someone into a position who cannot even  look at and comment on basic data, who has been a hired hand for the  fossil fuel industry, who has fought to make our air filthier and more  damaging to our health?   That is the nominee we have, a nominee who has sued on behalf of very  powerful interests--the EPA, 31 times--to try to degrade the controls  for things like mercury, which is a potent neurotoxin that damages the  brains of, particularly, our children. Why should we have somebody who  wants more mercury in our air in this position to consider air quality?  It, certainly, does not make any sense to me.   He did have a chance to serve in this position, in an acting  capacity, back in 2006. So he has been there before. He adopted  guidelines on mercury emissions that had entire passages lifted word  for word from information that had been provided by the industry. The  industry did not want to regulate the mercury, and he just took its  language and said that that is what we will do, that we will do what  industry says. He was not working for the American people. He was  working for the powerful and the privileged.   Then he told an EPA staffer ``not to undertake the normal scientific  and economic studies'' when crafting important rules. He instructed his  staff not to look at the scientific information when constructing  rules. What did he want them to look at? He wanted them to just take  the language from industry. That is certainly not protecting the public  interest. As the New York Times wrote, he has sought to ``elevate  corporate interests above those of the public.''   This is not a position in a company. This is not a position in a  corporation. This is a position of public trust. He has failed that  test. In fact, he has failed it so badly that, although he was  nominated in 2006 when there was a Republican majority in this Chamber,  his nomination was subsequently rejected by the Senate. Back then, we  had folks who really, actually cared on both sides of the aisle far  more about air quality. Now it seems like the enormous amount of  funding from the Koch brothers for campaigns across the country has  squelched any consideration from my colleagues about the quality of the  air or the quality of our water. This nomination is, certainly, a test  of that.   If my colleagues do care about the quality of our air, they will act  like their predecessors did back in 2006, and they will reject this  nomination. An individual who has betrayed the public trust should not  be confirmed to a position of public trust.   Thank you.                            ____________________
