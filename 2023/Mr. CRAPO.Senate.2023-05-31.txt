 Mr. President, with my colleague Senator Jim Risch  and Representative Mike Simpson, I congratulate Nathan Small, who is  retiring from serving as chairman of the Fort Hall Business Council,  the governing body of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes on the Fort Hall  Reservation.   Chairman Small has been an unwavering voice for his people for  roughly 40 years, leading in various roles for the Fort Hall Business  Council since the late 1980s. He has dedicated his life to protecting  the Tribes' rights under the 1868 Treaty of Fort Bridger and other  Federal laws and tirelessly worked to preserve the traditional ways of  life of the Shoshone-Bannock people. He is respected not only in Idaho  for his efforts to protect the rights of all Idaho Tribes but also on  the national level for his inspiring and effective advocacy in ensuring  the United States upholds its treaty and trust responsibilities to  Tribal governments.   We have been grateful for his steady leadership, especially while we  partnered with him and the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes on various efforts  over the years. Chairman Small's wealth of knowledge and experience was  pivotal to his advocacy on the Tribes' behalf. He is also a member of  the Shoshone-Bannock Tribal Bar Association and has been both a  prosecutor and public defender in Tribal court. He was instrumental in  opening the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes' first gaming operation and was  gaming manager from 1990 to 1998. He also served in the Tribes' Water  Resources Department in the Environmental Waste Program, advocating for  the protection of the Reservation's water and land. He is a founding  Board member and is Secretary of the Coalition of Large Tribes, which  advocates for the sovereign rights of Tribes.   Thank you, Chairman Small, for working with us to properly recognize  tribal sovereignty and the Federal Government's treaty and trust  obligations to Tribes. We hope that retirement will provide you more  time to spend enjoying the outdoors you love. We thank you for your  leadership and wish you all the best.                            ____________________
