 Madam President, it is Thursday, and it is my favorite  time  [[Page S4754]]  of the week. I get to come down to the Senate floor typically every  Thursday and talk about Alaskans who are doing something amazing for  their communities, their State, maybe even their country. Heck, this  one is kind of doing something for the world, whom I refer to as the  Alaskan of the Week. I love doing it.   We have a really special Alaskan of the Week this week whom I am  going to talk about, Lydia Jacoby--a very special 17-year-old who is  from Seward, AK. We are so excited about this.   Those of you who have been following our Alaskan of the Week speeches  might notice that this is the first new poster board we have had ever.  So this is the poster board of the Alaskan of the Week for Lydia  because we are so excited about her.   Before I talk about Lydia, I always like to say a little bit about  what is going on in Alaska.   A lot of people always ask about the light. They are curious about  the light in the summer, particularly as we just had our summer  solstice. If you want to come up and really see it, come on up. We are  open. We would love to have you--a trip of a lifetime. If you are  thinking about coming to Alaska, come to see it yourself this summer.  Every American should come on up, but I will give you a hint. On the  light that is happening right now, if you were in Seward, AK, where  Lydia is from, the Sun will rise at 4:33 a.m. and set at 11:26 p.m.,  with a loss of just 36 seconds from the summer solstice, which occurred  a few days ago. That is a lot of sunlight, and it doesn't really even  get dark when the Sun goes down. It does just for a little bit.   So it is a great time to be in the State. Come on up. It is a great  time to be in Alaska, and I can't wait to get home for the recess, our  Fourth of July--lots of Sun, lots of excitement.   There is particularly a lot of excitement around this young, intrepid  Alaskan, Lydia, who on Tuesday, in Omaha, NE, swam the second fastest  time in the world in the women's 100-meter breaststroke finals in the  Olympic trials. She is the second fastest breaststroker in the world,  and she is only 17. This cinched her spot to represent the United  States in the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. This is an incredible and--I  will admit it--a rather unlikely story that we are all so proud of in  Alaska.   With regard to the Olympics, Alaskans typically punch way above our  weight. In the Winter Olympics, we really, really punch above our  weight, with many, many Alaskans making the Olympic team for the Winter  Olympics every 4 years. We have done well in the Summer Olympics as  well. Olympic veteran, rugby player Alev Kelter, from Eagle River, will  be competing this year. Shortly, will we will be learning if Allie  Ostrander, who is a really amazing young woman, steeplechase champion  and another incredible athlete, will be in the Olympics this year. We  will learn soon. But we have never sent a swimmer to the Olympics. You  don't always equate Alaska and swimming. She will be the first, and  Alaskans across the State are cheering on Lydia. So let me tell you a  little bit about this remarkable young woman.   Her parents, Leslie and Richard, are both boat camp captains. Leslie  is the educational coordinator for the Marine Science Explorer Program  at the Kenai Fjords Tours. Rich is a maritime instructor at the Alaska  Vocational Technical Center, what we call AVTEC.   By the way, a little aside: AVTEC does great work. I have really  enjoyed my visits there.   So, Rich, keep up the great job there.   He is also a guy for Arctic and Antarctic trips.   So that is Mom and Dad. They moved to Alaska when Lydia was 9 years  old. Richard came to the State in 1992 when he was fresh out of  college, and like so many, they fell in love with the State and stayed.  They raised their daughter, as I mentioned, in the town of Seward, AK.  There are a little under 3,000 people there, and it is just an hour  south of Anchorage. It is nestled between Resurrection Bay and soaring  mountains. Its motto is ``Alaska starts here.''   I love Seward, AK. I get there as much as I can. I am going to be  there in a couple of weeks, actually. It is known for stunning  landscapes, a strong, generous community, and amazing people. So if you  are visiting Alaska, you have to go to Seward.   Leslie and Richard signed Lydia up for swim classes when she was just  a toddler. She joined the swim club when she was 6 years old. When she  was 10, she was selected for the Alaska Swim Zone Team. State  qualifying meets allowed her to go on trips. In between all of this,  she was a musician, learning to play the guitar. She played at folk  festivals. She was also in theater and in track--an all-around great  athlete and an all-around great young woman.   As she excelled at swimming, her parents continued to be, in their  words, ``surprised and amazed.'' Obviously, she has a deeply  competitive streak, but you would not know it when you meet her. Her  parents were surprised. ``In the right setting, that streak can really  be turned on,'' Rich said. When she has a lousy race, she just shrugs  it off. Her dad remembered one of her first swim meets when, halfway  across the pool, she inhaled some water. She jumped out and didn't want  to get back in. Well, she is back in. As her dad said, she has come a  long way.   One of her coaches, Solomon D'Amico, describes her as ``kind, quiet,  confident.'' He says she has an ``intense fire,'' and when she sets her  mind to something, like the Olympics, she goes for it.   Now, neither of her parents pushed her too hard--they wanted the  drive to come from her, not them--but it certainly did come from her.   Solomon, her coach, is a former marine and athlete. Alaska is full of  intense runs--marathons, ultra-marathons--but one of the most  challenging is in Seward, AK. It is called the annual Mount Marathon  Race, the Fourth of July, in Seward, a grueling 1.5-mile climb almost  straight up and straight back down Mount Marathon. He has run this 24  years in a row. That is tough--Solomon, her coach.   Solomon really didn't know much about swimming when he started  coaching the small Seward swim team. In fact, Seward, AK, doesn't even  have an Olympic-size swimming pool, but they all worked hard. He  encouraged them to be the best that they could be--to enjoy life but to  also lift weights. Strength, Solomon said, is needed to excel in  swimming, particularly at the breaststroke.   Lydia took to the weight rooms. She swims between 5 to 7 days a week,  1-hour to 90-minute sessions. She lifts weights about 3 hours a week.  And as Solomon has said, ``You want . . . athletes to be more process  than outcome driven.''   Lydia fell in love with all the hard work. No one was ever going to  give her a hard time if she missed a practice or a session, but every  single opportunity she had to swim, she would be there.   Well, on Sunday, Lydia will head to Hawaii to train with Team USA.  Then, a few weeks later, she will head to Tokyo.   Now, because of COVID restrictions, unfortunately, her parents won't  be there to watch in person. Her father said: ``It's a [bit of a] weird  thing to send your kid across the world. But she's an experienced  traveler and there are great people involved with USA swimming.''   ``We are over the moon proud of her,'' her dad said.   So are we. We are so proud of you, Lydia. You are a role model for so  many aspiring swimmers, not just across Alaska but across the country.  So thank you for representing Alaska and our Nation so well.   Good luck in the Olympics. Congratulations on your success and  congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week.                            ____________________     Madam President, as my colleague from Oklahoma Senator  Lankford just gave a wonderful speech on the Fourth of July, we are all  focused on heading home for the Fourth of July, celebrating freedom,  celebrating our independence, celebrating liberty.   And we all know that that freedom is not free. There is a saying at  the Korean War Memorial, etched in stone, that says those very words:  ``Freedom is not free.''   The sacrifices of our military are something that all of us are going  to be thinking about over the course of the Fourth of July week,  weekend, as we  [[Page S4755]]  celebrate and commemorate American liberty, American independence, and  American freedom.   Our military has helped us provide that, both here at home but also,  importantly, abroad.   I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation--Senate  delegation with two of my Senate colleagues, Senator Coons and Senator  Duckworth, a couple weeks ago to Korea--South Korea and Taiwan.   And it doesn't matter where you are from in America, whether you are  a Democrat or a Republican, when you go overseas and you go to  countries like that, countries and places that literally exist because  of the sacrifice of the American military, it makes you humble, and it  makes you proud.   South Korea and Taiwan--vibrant economics, vibrant democracies. And  if you know the history, those two places wouldn't be that way if it  weren't for the sacrifice, literally, of tens of thousands of  Americans.   It is no exaggeration to say--whether it is in those places or in  places at home or in Europe or in Asia--that the United States has been  one of the most powerful forces for liberating humankind from  oppression and tyranny than any other force in the world.   Think about it. Hundreds of millions of people across the world and  in our own country, over the decades, have been liberated by men and  women wearing the uniform of the United States.   As we contemplate the Fourth of July week, weekend, that is something  every American can take pride in and should take pride in.   But as we all know, freedom is not free. Many of us think that  defending our Nation should be our priority No. 1 as part of our job in  the U.S. Senate. Budgets are a reflection of an administration's values  and priorities.   And if you look at this budget--this is the $6 trillion blowout  budget of the Biden administration, where up here you have every single  Federal Agency with double-digit--20-percent increases, 40-percent  increases, 15-percent increases across the board.   The two Agencies charged with the national security of our Nation,  the Department of Defense and Homeland Security, in terms of priorities  for this administration, are dead last.   Actually, if you adjust the budgets for inflation, these are cuts-- almost 3 percent cut in our military budgets and probably close to 4 to  5 percent for Homeland Security.   Budgets reflect values of administrations and priorities, and this  administration, right now, is prioritizing our military and our  national defense dead last.   We had the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff in front of the Armed Services Committee last week, and I  showed them this chart, and I asked them: How can you tell the troops  that you lead that this administration prioritizes our military and  national defense over other missions of the Federal Government?   They couldn't give a really good answer because there is no good  answer. If you look at this chart, if you look at the Biden  administration's budget, they are prioritized at the bottom.   This is a battle of ideas, and when we come back from the Fourth of  July recess, we are going to have this battle. I know I have  colleagues, Democrats and Republicans--I have spoken to many on both  sides of the aisle--who fundamentally disagree with this--fundamentally  disagree with this.   You might remember last summer we had a debate when Senator Sanders  brought forth his defund the Pentagon amendment. That is what he called  it. At the height of defunding the police, we had Senators saying we  are going to now defund the Pentagon--15 percent across-the-board cuts  to the military. That is what Senator Sanders wanted.   By the way, Senator Schumer was a cosponsor of that.   And now they are in charge here, the majority leader, the chairman of  the Budget Committee, and in many ways they are getting what they  wanted--almost 3 percent cut to our military.   I guarantee it is not what the American people want; it is not what  my constituents want; and I don't think it is what the vast majority of  U.S. Senators want.    So we are going to battle this. We are going to battle this, and I am  going to ask my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work  with me to reject this. We need to reject this. We shouldn't prioritize  our military dead last, which is what the Biden administration and,  unfortunately, some of my colleagues here are doing.   I would like to end by just noting that tomorrow is actually another  anniversary. We were talking about the Fourth of July, but June 25 is  the 71st anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean war, which was June  25, 1950.   Unfortunately, not enough Americans, in my view, have a lot of  knowledge of the Korean war. It is even called the forgotten war. I  don't think it should be called the forgotten war. It should be called  the noble war because Americans went to a place they didn't even know  to defend freedom, which they did after a hard, difficult, violent  struggle.   But in the summer of 1950, we lost thousands and thousands of young  Americans, young American soldiers, young American servicemen. Why?   Because they were not prepared to fight. We went from 1945, having  probably the most formidable military in the history of the world, to 5  years later--because of defense cuts, because of lack of leadership by  civilian and military leaders in the United States--a military that  could not fight, a military where we lost thousands of young American  soldiers because they weren't ready because budgets had been gutted.   We can never allow that to happen again, and as we head into the  Fourth of July weekend to celebrate the Fourth of July and our hard- fought freedoms and liberty, we need to look at this budget, come back  here and say to the President and others: We are not--we are not going  to prioritize the national security of our Nation last.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like recognize an  important  [[Page S4769]]  member of my staff, my former director of national security policy,  Jason Suslavich. I, along with the rest of my team was saddened to have  Jason leave our office this February.   While born in Winchester, MA, Jason was quick to embrace the Alaskan  spirit. Up north, Jason traded his beach walks for hikes and his golf  clubs for a fishing rod. Like a true Alaskan, he loved his wild Alaska  seafood and overall good cooking and could talk for hours about his  favorite dishes at his favorite restaurants throughout the State. One  of his favorites was the osso bucco at Orso--and could speak tirelessly  about it. And did.   In high school, Jason was the all-State wrestling champion and was  inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. His dedication and  tenacity expanded beyond the wrestling mat into his academics. At John  Hopkins University, Jason majored in international studies, which he  has applied throughout his career.   Jason's work in Alaska politics began over a decade ago in  Congressman Don Young's office. As the Congressman's legislative  assistant, Jason laid the foundation for his career in the Senate,  building productive coalitions and facilitating bipartisan  collaboration.   One year into my first term. Jason joined our office. At this time, I  was still learning the ropes in the Senate. His work ethic, experience,  and dependability made my life a lot easier and made him an  irreplaceable asset to my team.   Jason was good-natured, a team player, and a legendary prankster.  From day-to-day tricks to years-long plots, Jason was committed to the  craft of mischief--just ask his nemesis, Mike Anderson.   Jason's contributions to our office--and to the State of Alaska,  particularly building on our three pillars of military might--were  enormous. His leadership lives on with Team Sullivan. He is greatly  missed.   If this past year has taught us anything, it is the importance of  trusting our intuition. After 13 years working for Alaska s delegation,  Jason has decided to chart a new journey--working in the aerospace  sector. He has loved space since he was a child. In this next chapter,  Jason can dedicate time to his great passions: space exploration, the  strength of our Nation, the Boston Red Sox, and most importantly, his  beautiful and brilliant wife Sarah.   Jason may not be working in my office, but he will always have a home  in the Last Frontier. His dedication to the State has forever  solidified him as a welcome friend and honorary Alaskan.   Please join me in wishing Jason much success and happiness in the  future.
