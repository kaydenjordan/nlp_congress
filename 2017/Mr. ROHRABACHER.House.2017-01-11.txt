 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise Senator Jeff  Sessions, President-elect Trump's nominee for Attorney General. Senator  Sessions, I am praising him today for his inspiring testimony before  the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday. During his confirmation  hearings, Senator Sessions was questioned on a wide variety of issues  that will be under his purview as our Attorney General. Included in the  numerous topics covered were questions about his intentions to enforce  Federal law as it pertains to marijuana policy.   Senator Sessions is a patriot. He is a constitutionalist. He is a man  of the highest moral integrity, and I have complete confidence that if  confirmed as Attorney General, he will faithfully enforce our laws--not  just those he agrees with, but all the laws duly enacted by Congress.   As it pertains to marijuana policy, Senator Sessions promised to do  the same, to follow the law. During his exchanges on that topic of  medical marijuana policy, being questioned by both Senators Leahy and  Lee, Senator Sessions stated his intention to follow Federal law. At  one point he indicated that if Congress no longer desired to make  possession and distribution of marijuana an illegal act, ``Congress  should pass a law to change the rules.''   At this time, I feel compelled to point out that Federal law has been  changed and currently prohibits the Department of Justice from spending  appropriated funds to prosecute individuals who are acting in  compliance with their State's medical marijuana laws. In fact, a  provision has been in the law since December 2014, when Congress passed  and President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Further Continuing  Appropriations Act. The act included a provision passed on the floor of  the House as an amendment earlier that year by a vote of 219-189. The  following year, a similar provision was passed by a wider margin of  242-186. That provision, offered by myself and cosponsored by my  colleague, Sam Farr, restricts the Federal Government from superseding  State law when it comes to the use of medical marijuana. This law will  remain in effect through April 28 of this year, although I expect with  the House and the Senate, both on record on this, that this provision  will be renewed. I am especially confident of that when realizing that  President-elect Trump is on the record, as he stated in the last  campaign, that this issue should be left to the States. Thus, I am  confident that this legal provision, which says that the Federal  Government shall not supersede State law when it comes to medical  marijuana, will be renewed.   Importantly, in August of last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals ruled in U.S. v. McIntosh that Federal funds cannot be used to  prosecute those in compliance with their State's medical marijuana  laws. This provision will be part of American law as long as it is  renewed and Congress makes it part of the law. I am confident that if  Congress does that, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, my friend, a person  I admire greatly, will abide by the provisions and, thus, respect State  medical marijuana laws, as dictated by Congress and enforced by the  judiciary.   As he rightfully pointed out in his testimony yesterday, Senator  Sessions said it will be his duty to see to it that the laws under his  purview as Attorney General are faithfully executed, and this includes  the Rohrabacher-Farr limitations that no funding shall be used to  prosecute those throughout our country who are in compliance with our  States' medical marijuana laws.   All of this comes down to a constitutional theory and a  constitutional commitment to what we call the 10th Amendment, and that  is the States have a right to make determinations in all of those areas  that the Federal Government should not be involved in. This should  definitely be left to the States.                            ____________________
