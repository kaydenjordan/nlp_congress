He devoted 50 years of his life to serving, as he  called them, the folks back home. He won his first election to the  local school board in 1970 at the age of 21.   He served in local and county government positions and in the  Illinois State Senate. For the last 16 years, Larry was county  executive for Will County, the fourth largest county in my State of  Illinois and one of the fastest growing.   Larry Walsh was as good at retail politics as anybody I have ever  seen. He loved politics and he loved people and it showed. People loved  him back. Democrats, Republicans, farmers, city folk--they all loved  Larry.   He was one of the longest serving county executives in Will County  history. When he announced last August that he would not run for a  fifth term as executive because the cancer he was battling for 5 years  was gaining the upper hand, there was hardly a dry eye in the room.  Everyone with whom he had worked was saddened by that announcement.   He said at that press conference: ``I've been a very blessed man and  a very lucky man.''   From where I am sitting, I think the really lucky ones were Larry's  folks back home. Also lucky were those who worked with him and called  him a friend. I am honored to count myself among them.   Lawrence Michael Walsh, born on a farm in Elwood, IL, about 10 miles  outside of Joliet. He was the second of eight children. His parents  were farmers, as were his grandparents and great-grandparents. He  carried on that family tradition. Farming was in his blood.   He won his first election to the school board about 3 weeks before  his first child was born. Three years later, he was elected to the  local board of supervisors. He was elected to the Will County board in  1974 and again in 1992.   From 1997, until the year 2005, Larry served in the Illinois State  Senate in Springfield. His Senate district--the 43rd--included most of  Will County, parts of Kankakee and Iroquois Counties.   There were cities, suburbs, and farms. In Springfield, he sat in the  back row of the chamber. He became good friends of another senator who  sat in the seat right next to him.   To some, it was an amazingly odd couple to see the two of them, Larry  the farmer and conservative Democrat and his seatmate, a very liberal,  left-leaning lawyer from Hyde Park in the city of Chicago.   Both men had an ability that is all too rare in today's brand of  politics. They could see beyond labels. They were both passionate about  building coalitions and finding common ground, and they both liked a  good game of poker. So they became good friends.   In 2004, when his friend decided to run for the U.S. Senate, Larry  Walsh was the first Senator to endorse him. Larry took his seatmate to  meet the farmers and other folks in small towns in Will and Kankakee  Iroquois counties.   Four years later, that seatmate of his was elected President of the  United States, and Larry Walsh was right here in Washington to see  Barack Obama inaugurated as the leader of our great Nation.   Larry Walsh was a fine and decent man. He was thoughtful and witty,  loyal and trustworthy. He seemed to radiate joy, and his joy would fill  a room. He was grounded in reality and modest. He had a big booming  voice--you couldn't miss it--and you sure as heck could not miss his  laugh, and there were plenty of them.   His friends included a President, Cabinet members and Governors and  men and women who swept the floors in his offices.   In 2007, Will County Democrats created a new award to honor those  working to promote progress and the common good. They named the award  after the man who exemplified those qualities--the Larry Walsh Lifetime  Achievement Award.   Well, fittingly, the first recipient of the Larry Walsh Lifetime  Achievement Award was Larry Walsh. I laughed  [[Page S2795]]  about that so many times and never let him forget it. Every time he  visited my office, I would remind him that he was the first recipient  of the Larry Walsh Award.   Larry's admirers transcended party labels. George Pearson, chairman  of the Will County Republican Party, told a reporter that Larry  ``greeted me each time we met with a handshake, a smile and a pat on  the shoulder. You would never have known we were on opposite sides of  the political aisle, and that is what made Larry popular with Will  County residents.''   The other thing that made Larry Walsh so popular with the people of  his county was that he was just incredibly good at his job.   As county executive, Larry worked hard to professionalize and  modernize county government and make it more responsive. He built a  strong financial foundation for this great county, which improved its  bond rating and enabled him to lead the largest capital improvement  program in the history of the county. The county built new roads and  bridges, a new public safety complex, new county health facilities, and  a new courthouse scheduled to open in October.   In the Illinois State Senate, he was instrumental in, among others  things, developing the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Elwood; the  redevelopment of the Joliet Arsenal into a modern intermodal freight  terminal, the CenterPoint Intermodal Center; and the designation of the  Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie--the first national tallgrass  prairie in the United States.   There was a time when we thought it was the end of the world for Will  County when Joliet Arsenal was given up by the Federal Government, but  thanks to Larry Walsh and his buddy George Sangmeister and many others,  it became a showpiece for the rest of the United States to see how this  piece of Federal real estate had a bright, bright future.   Larry was most proud of his family. My wife Loretta and I offer our  deepest condolences to Irene, Larry's wife of 50 years, and the love of  his life. I called her on the phone just the other day when Larry  passed, and we talked about the rough period toward the end of his  life, but we knew it was coming. Today, we look back on it as a moment  of trial that he endured until that moment when he left and left behind  not only that love of his life Irene but their daughter Sarah, their  five sons, Larry Jr. and Shawn--both of whom followed dad into public  service--Frank, Matthew, and Brian and 20 grandkids. He was so proud of  every single one of them.   Because of the pandemic, the sendoff for Larry is going to be much  smaller than it would have been in Will County. There will be  visitation from 2 to 8 on Thursday, followed by a private funeral mass  on Friday, and local folks are expected to line the route from the  church to the cemetery.   A couple of final thoughts about my friend Larry: He was a bridge  builder. He had inexhaustible patience when it came to searching for  common ground in order to make government work and solve big problems.  Don't we need more leaders like him today?   Larry loved life. Every Christmas season, for years, the local  theater company in Joliet put on a stage production of that classic  movie ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' The show was always broadcast on a  local radio station, and for many years, right up to this last  Christmas, Larry Walsh played the part of Clarence. You will remember  Clarence at the end of the movie. He was the guardian angel. Clarence  was always hoping to earn his wings. Clarence was assigned to watch  over George Bailey, who is so despondent one Christmas Eve he is  thinking about jumping off a bridge. Clarence the guardian angel's  assignment was to get George to change his mind.   Clarence did that by showing George how much the people in his  hometown would have missed had George not been part of their lives.  Clarence tells George:         Strange, isn't it? Each man's life touches so many other       lives. When he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't       he?    Many of us are feeling an awful hole today with the passing of Larry  Walsh--this good man and devoted public servant.   Even though we can't schedule the kind of Irish wake that Larry so  richly deserved, there is something we can do.   Besides his family, his faith, his community and public service,  there was something that Larry was also fond of. After a hard day of  work, Larry was known to enjoy a Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. In his honor,  if you are so inclined, may we raise a PBR to Larry and a life well  lived, and may we resolve to fill the hole he has left by following his  uncommon example                           Criminal Justice System    Mr. President, this past weekend, I went back to Illinois and visited  with two different groups--one on Friday, another on Saturday. They  were young African Americans on the South Side of Chicago and in my  hometown of Springfield.   I wanted to sit down with these young people, some just barely high  school students, who had been engaged in protests and demonstrations in  their hometowns and ask them what it was about, what it meant to them.  I wanted to hear it firsthand.   They talked about the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and how  it changed the conversation about justice in America, and it moved them  to stand up and speak up.   I am proud to say that those I met with have engaged in peaceful  demonstrations consistent with American values and our Constitution.   I am proud of them because there were no distractions. They were  focused on Black Lives Matter and true justice in America.   When we met, I asked questions of some of them. I wanted to know a  little bit more about them and their lives and what brought them to  this moment.   I asked each of them about the conversation--you know, that  conversation when young people are called in by their parents and  warned about the perils and challenges of being Black in America.   One young woman remembered her mother cautioning her to always ask  for a receipt with every purchase to prove, if ever challenged, that  the item had not been shoplifted. Many talked about hairstyles and  clothing that they learned to be dangerous in the eyes of some White  Americans.   They were even warned about the danger of any contact with the police  and how their tone of voice and every move had to be carefully  considered--every one of them.   Every one of them remembered the first time they were called the  ``N'' word.   That graphic video of the last moments of George Floyd's life, when  he was pleading ``I can't breathe'' and the cold stare of the  policeman, with his knee on George Floyd's neck, ignoring the pleas for  mercy--those images touched the conscience of America and the world,  and these young people were touched by it.   They know and we all know, sadly, that what happened to George Floyd  was not an exception.   Since 2015, the Washington Post has been following the number of  people shot and killed by police. Through 2019, the total number has  hovered near 1,000 annually. Ninety-four percent of the victims were  armed.   The Post reports:         The number of black and unarmed people fatally shot by       police has declined since 2015, but whether armed or not,       black people are shot and killed at a disproportionately       higher rate than white people.    They note in their newspaper this morning the death rate by race in  unarmed shootings was 7.3 percent for Whites, 10.7 percent for  Hispanics, and 30.3 percent for Blacks.   The anger and pain that we have seen on the streets in recent days is  a reflection of generations of trauma. People are fed up with racism  that has led to this injustice, and many of these young people leading  this protest are determined not to live in its shadow any longer.   There are hundreds of thousands of police officers in our Nation.  Most will never use their firearms. Many who do must make split-second,  life-or-death decisions. I know many of them personally. I believe the  ones I know are professional and humane.   If we are honest, we know that within their ranks are police officers  who do not have the training or temperament to be entrusted with the  authority and power they have been given. We need an honest  conversation with police chiefs and law enforcement leaders  [[Page S2796]]  on inherent bias, use of force, training and accountability for unjust  actions.   Prosecutors and judges need to join us in the pursuit of real  justice, and legislators like myself need to undo the damage of a  criminal justice system fraught with racial disparity.   The Obama Task Force on 21st Century Policing released a report in  2015 to strengthen community policing and restore trust between law  enforcement and the communities they serve. The Trump administration  shelved this effort in 2017. It is time to take it off the shelf.   This week, I join Senators Booker and Harris in cosponsoring the  Justice in Policing Act of 2020--a comprehensive approach to bring  accountability to policing, change methods and practices, and build  trust. It draws the line on odious police practices and sets goals and  standards for recruitment, training, and retraining.   Even that is not enough. Justice in America requires more than  improving law enforcement. We cannot put racism behind us until we  invest in opportunities for quality education, medical care that meets  the highest standards, jobs with livable wages, opportunities, and safe  affordable housing.    The young people I met with want an America that is more just. Let  them lead us into a future where we can all breathe more easily.   I held hearings on race in America when I was chairman of the  Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Rights--one in December of  2014. The hearing was held just a month after the death of Tamir Rice,  a 12-year-old boy shot and killed by a police officer in Cleveland  while he played with a toy gun.   I said then, and, sadly, I must repeat today, when unarmed African- American men and boys are killed in our streets, there is much work to  be done to find justice in America.   This followed a hearing I had held the previous year where we heard  heartbreaking testimony from Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon  Martin, and Lucy McBath, the mother of Jordan Davis. Lucy has been  elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Georgia since.   Both of these innocent young Black men were gunned down by violent  White vigilantes.   Now we again grieve the lives of two Black men and a Black woman-- lives cut far too short in incidents of inexplicable and inexcusable  violence--Ahmaud Arbery out for a jog; Breonna Taylor at home in her  bedroom; and George Floyd on a curbside in Minneapolis.   Once again, those gut-wrenching words ``I can't breathe'' bring tears  to our eyes. How many more names of Black men, women, and children will  we cry out in protest before things change? We need to have an honest  American conversation with law enforcement officers about training,  inherent bias, use of force, and consequences for wrongdoing. We need  to prohibit police misconduct that is discriminatory and deadly. We  must recruit and train the next generation of law enforcement to  protect and serve everyone in America. We need to invest in social  services instead of expecting law enforcement to intervene in crisis  situations that they are not equipped to deal with.   This will require us--Senators, other legislators--to continue to  undo the damage of a criminal justice system that is unfair, in many  respects--most importantly, require those of us with privilege and  power to step back and listen to African Americans affected by  pervasive, systemic racism.   What can we do? A good place to start is President Obama's task  force. As I mentioned earlier, it was that administration's response to  deal with community policing and trust in the community. It was shelved  by the Trump administration, and I think it would be a good start--a  bipartisan start--for the Trump administration to bring it down from  the shelf and start a conversation.   We have an important role to play right here in Congress.  Unfortunately, since Republicans took the Senate majority in January  2015, the Senate Judiciary Committee has rarely addressed issues of  racism in our Nation.   The last hearing on policing in the Judiciary Committee was actually  5 years ago--November 2015--chaired by the junior Senator from Texas.  It was entitled ``The War on Police: How the Federal Government  Undermines State and Local Law Enforcement.'' It was a thinly veiled  attack on the efforts of the Obama administration's Civil Rights  Division.   The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Lindsey Graham, has  announced the Senate will hold a hearing on police misconduct next  week. I was glad to hear it. I hope it is not just one and done. We  need multiple hearings--long overdue.   It is critical that we also hear from Attorney General William Barr.  We need to know whether the Justice Department will revive the efforts  of the Obama administration to address police misconduct, and we need  answers about what happened at Lafayette Square last week--right  outside the White House, when the Attorney General reportedly ordered  Federal law enforcement to clear peaceful demonstrators. They used  rubber bullets and some form of gas. The Attorney General insists it  wasn't tear gas, but I have seen it, and it looks like some sort of a  gas spray designed to push the demonstrators away.   Hearings aren't enough. We need to do something the Senate rarely  does anymore--pass a law. How about that? We need legislation on this  subject, not lamentation.   I am proud to join Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris in  introducing this Justice in Policing Act. Our bill includes the End  Racial Profiling Act--legislation I have cosponsored for many years,  finally prohibiting the scourge of racial profiling.   In 2012, I held a hearing on this bill to end racial profiling. This  was the only hearing that the Senate has held on racial profiling in 20  years.   Our bill would ban choke holds--like the one that killed George  Floyd. It will ban no-knock warrants--like the one that led to the  death of Breonna Taylor.    In 2014, many Americans were shocked to see tanks rolling through the  streets of Ferguson, MO. Shortly afterward, I held a hearing in the  same subcommittee where we heard compelling testimony about the  shocking reality that local police departments all over the country are  armed to the teeth with billions of dollars of military surplus  equipment.   Our bill will limit the transfer of military-grade equipment to State  and local police so the weapons of war do not become commonplace in the  streets of America.   The Justice in Policing Act also requires the use of dashboard  cameras and body cameras for Federal officers, State, and local law  enforcement.   Our bill establishes a National Police Misconduct Registry to prevent  officers who have engaged in misconduct from simply moving to another  department without accountability. It will ensure that individuals  whose constitutional rights are violated by police officers can recover  in court.   After the Civil War, the Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1871  to ensure that any person acting in official capacity who deprives  another of a constitutional or legal right can be held liable in court.  However, judges have strictly limited the use of this statue to recover  damages for police misconduct by creating what is known as qualified  immunity for police officers.   The Justice in Policing Act will end this. This is a doctrine created  by judges and never approved by Congress.   I call on Senator McConnell to do more than just join in speeches  about George Floyd. I call on him to bring the Justice in Policing Act  to the floor of the Senate as soon as possible.   Wouldn't it be amazing, with all the protestations and all of the  statements made by all of the people in the streets, by representatives  in this administration from the Department of Justice who came before  our committee today, and each and every one standing up and saying they  are concerned about George Floyd, if we in the U.S. Senate actually  considered a bill on the subject--actually considered passing a law on  this matter?   We owe it not just to the Senate, we owe it to George Floyd, Breonna  Taylor, to Ahmaud Arbery, and all of the Black and Brown lives we have  lost in these brutal acts of racial injustice.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3924         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
