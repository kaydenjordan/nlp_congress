 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, Democrats in  Washington continue to urge the President to reopen the government, end  the crisis of his own making, and get Federal employees back to work.   Despite this unfortunate situation dragging on, we can celebrate good  news out of Richmond, Virginia. Wednesday marked the first day of  Virginia's State legislative session. And on day 1, a Senate committee  passed a resolution to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.   Thirty-seven States have voted to ratify the ERA since it passed  Congress in 1972, two in the last 2 years. Thirty-eight States must  ratify a constitutional amendment, and Virginia could get it across the  finish line.   I am thrilled to witness this energy to enshrine women's equality in  the Constitution where it belongs. I hope my colleagues will join me in  supporting this incredible State effort, in Virginia and elsewhere, to  amend the Constitution to finally ensure equality for all women and men  in this country.                            ____________________
