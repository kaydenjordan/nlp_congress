 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado, Mr. Buck,  for yielding to me. I am grateful for his leadership as a conservative.  It has been my honor to serve with him this past year. I appreciate him  sharing some time with me tonight as I share several important stories.    Mr. Speaker, these are stories of real people, not just some people  who are distant to us. These are people that we know, people just like  this.   Mr. Speaker, one early January morning in 2015, a young man named  Grant Ronnebeck began the graveyard shift at a QuikTrip convenience  store in my district. After his parents divorce, Grant took the  initiative to find a job working at this convenience store  [[Page H8432]]  in Mesa, Arizona, to help his family pay the bills. He was only 21  years old. He had his entire life ahead of him.   Just before 4 a.m., an angry customer walked in, demanded a pack of  cigarettes, and dumped a handful of change on the store counter. Grant  started to count the money, but he saw the customer pull a gun out and  point it directly at his head.   Grant tried to immediately hand over the cigarettes in a desperate  attempt to save his life, but it was too late. The customer shot Grant  in the face in cold blood, took the cigarettes, and casually walked out  of the store.   Grant's father describes him as being his buddy from the minute he  was born and a person that brightened everybody. He did not leave the  store alive that night.   The customer's name was Apolinar Altamirano. He was an illegal alien  with a long criminal record, including violent crimes. He was held in  Federal custody, but then released while he awaited deportation  proceedings. Our government let Grant down when they allowed Grant's  killer to walk out of custody and onto our streets.   Altamirano should have remained in custody until he was deported, but  he was set free, and Grant was killed due to the government's failure  to hold this violent criminal in custody until deported.   Sadly, Grant's story is not unique. Many Americans are aware of  another tragic incident, the case of Kate Steinle. Kate was 32 years  old. She was walking along a San Francisco pier when an illegal alien  shot and killed her. This illegal alien had just been released from  prison again. He should have been held until deportation, but he, in  fact, had been deported many times previously.                                time  1845    Even then, he was set free, only to kill Kate Steinle.   In 2014, Mesa, Arizona, Police Officer Brandon Mendoza was killed in  a wrong-way crash by an illegal alien who was driving under the  influence of drugs and alcohol.   And in January 2016, Sarah Root was murdered by an illegal alien who  was drunk and drag racing in Omaha, Nebraska.   In each of these cases, Grant and Brandon, I am privileged to know  their parents, Steve Ronnebeck and Mary Ann Mendoza. These are fierce  advocates who tirelessly work to make sure these types of tragedies  never happen to another family. I am grateful for their efforts, and I  believe that we are making significant headway to stop these types of  catch and release programs that allow criminals to remain on our  streets.   In June of this year, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3003,  the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law,  tandemly. These bills would end the policies that contributed to the  tragic deaths of Grant, Kate, Brandon, and Sarah.   I was pleased to coauthor the first bill, which included my  legislation, Grant's Law. Grant's Law is named in memory of Grant  Ronnebeck.   All Americans can agree that someone who is criminally violent should  not be released back on to the streets. Yet, for years, the Obama  administration's policies failed to protect Americans by allowing  criminally violent illegal aliens to roam our streets and  neighborhoods.   These types of tragedies are preventable when the Federal Government  enacts and enforces the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Law.  Congress has begun to take meaningful action to bring these tragedies  to an end, starting with the two bills we passed in June.   Chairman Bob Goodlatte showed leadership and commitment to ensure  these important bills received swift consideration. These two bills, if  enacted and enforced, would protect innocent Americans to prevent  future tragedies like those of Grant, Kate, Brandon, and Sarah.   When the bills passed out of the House, I hoped these bills would  receive a swift vote in the Senate. That has not happened. I am still  hoping for this vote to take place. I call upon the leadership of the  Senate to put these bills up for a floor vote.   We owe it to our constituents to put arcane tradition aside and to  pass policies that will protect them. Yet, even in a Republican- controlled Senate, we cannot receive an up-or-down vote on these  important immigration enforcement bills.   Why is this?   Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe the answer lies in the fatally flawed  60-vote rule. It is more commonly known as the filibuster, but the  Senate's tradition is preventing consideration of nearly all  legislation passed from the House.   For example, look at our current situation. Since January, the House  has passed over 300 bills, including the two immigration and  enforcement bills I have just discussed. These bills will most likely  languish until the end of the term, in large part, due to the  filibuster rule.   So what can be done about this irresponsible inaction? Well, the  Senate can change the rule. Indeed, the Senate must change the rule.   Many people do not realize that the 60-vote requirement is not even  in the United States Constitution. It dates back to 1917, when the  Senate agreed that debate could be cut off with a two-thirds majority  vote. Decades later, when deciding a two-thirds vote was found to be  too difficult to achieve, the Senate reduced the number of required  votes to three-fifths, or 60 of the current 100 Senators.   The filibuster is a tradition, barely a century old, less than half  the age of the U.S. Constitution.   There is a place for rules and traditions, but not when they obstruct  the will of American people. Is it honorable for the United States  Senate to have a gentleman's agreement to keep bills from being voted  on, or to dilute our representation in the United States Senate?   Americans would rather that Congress pass just and reasonable laws  than to preserve extraconstitutional, institutional traditions.  Americans want our borders secure and our immigration laws to be  enforced.   Congress is running out of time to keep its promises to the American  people. We promised to ensure that what happened to Kate, Grant,  Brandon, and Sarah would not happen again. The House has done its duty.  It is time for the Senate to do its duty.   There are no excuses to allow these bills to die in the Senate. I  encourage my friends in the Senate to eliminate the 60-vote rule and to  consider the two immigration enforcement bills that the House passed in  June. We must not allow inaction to be the enemy of our sworn  responsibilities as representatives of the American people.   Again, I thank my friend from Colorado. I appreciate the opportunity  to say what has been on my mind for some time.
