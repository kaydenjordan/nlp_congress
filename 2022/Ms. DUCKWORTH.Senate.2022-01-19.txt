 Mr. President, I can't think of a more important thing  to be debating here in these Chambers than the right to vote. We can't  even get to that. We can't even get to that because of the use of the  filibuster to prevent us from having a vote, a discussion, on the  Voting Rights Act.   In America, the path toward justice has always, always been  intertwined with the right to vote. Progress and enfranchisement have  always been braided together.   Billy clubs, whips, barbed wire, wrapped tubing--that is what awaited  John Lewis at the end of that Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma because it  has never been easy--it has never been easy--to fight for  enfranchisement or to fight for the right to vote. There has always  been a price to pay by those who focus on justice.   Shouted slurs, explosions of tear gas, pained screams, and the crack  of clubs against bone--those were the sounds that filled the air as  Lewis and hundreds of his fellow Americans tried to march forward as  they tried to bring their country forward one step at a time.   Most of us in this room know of those mothers and fathers of the  civil rights movement, what they did for us that day. They raised their  voice on that bridge so that fellow Americans could raise their voices  at the ballot box. Tragically, we also know that many in this Chamber  today appear unwilling to do their part to protect the rights those  heroes fought for.   More than a half century ago, in this very building, Senators from  both sides of the aisle came together to pass the Voting Rights Act, a  bill designed to protect Black Americans--to protect all Americans-- from the kind of racial discrimination that was so common in State-run  elections at that time.   Of course, it is not possible to list out all the changes that have  taken  [[Page S323]]  place since that moment. More and more civil rights advocates stood up  and sat in. More and more Americans marched through and then laid down  in the streets. And the moral arc of the universe that Dr. Martin  Luther King spoke of bent a little more toward justice with every hard- earned right they secured and every fight that they won.   But, sadly, damningly, one other change stands out to me as I speak  here today. More than 50 years after the Voting Rights Act became law,  we can no longer say that a bipartisan majority of the Senate is  willing to protect the most basic tenet of our democracy. Heck, we  don't even have all of the Senators in the room to discuss this. Every  American's right to make their voice heard is so critically important  to our democracy. We can't say this because Senate Republicans have  spent the past year blocking every Democratic attempt to even begin  debate on strengthening voter legislation.   Even as Republicans in States around the country pass more and more  restrictive voter suppression laws aimed at silencing the voice of the  people, we still struggle and beg to have this debate, and they will  not vote to allow us to do so.   Republicans in Georgia made it illegal to peremptorily mail out  absentee mail out absentee ballots to registered voters, a law that  hurts all groups that rely on voting by mail, from communities of color  to Americans living with disabilities.   It also hurts military voters currently serving in harm's way  overseas. I myself voted by mail when I was serving our country in  Iraq. After all, I was a little busy flying combat missions, so I don't  know if I would have had the chance to request an absentee ballot 15  days before the election if my unit had not assisted in that effort.  Not every unit may do that. And so not having their ballots mailed to  them would make it immeasurably harder for our troops to vote wherever  they may be serving.   I can't understand why Republicans would want to make it harder for  brave Americans, defending our democracy abroad, to participate in it,  but that is what they are doing.   And I can't understand how my Republican colleagues can sit here  today and ask paid staffers and pages to bring them water, at exactly  the temperature they like, with or without ice, sparkling or not  sparkling, as they make their voices heard on the Senate floor and then  say nothing--nothing--to stop a law that makes it illegal to give water  to Americans waiting hours in line at polling stations as they seek to  simply have their voices heard at the ballot box.   Listen, my five-times great-grandfathers, who were likely indentured  servants without the right to vote, didn't fight in the Revolutionary  War and earn that right to vote just so people claiming to be the  leaders of our generation could chip away at the fundamental idea that  founded this Nation: that everyone is equal.   And my buddies and I and Senator Cotton didn't sign up to defend our  democracy in war zones thousands of miles away only to watch it crumble  at the hands of powerful people more focused on their own self- interests than in the foundational component of this extraordinary  experiment that we call America; that everyone, regardless of social  status, wealth, skin color, sex, has a right to vote.   Page after page in our Nation's history is marred by bigotry, tainted  by intolerance, by injustice, but through every chapter--however dark  the night--some brave Americans have willed that there would be light.   That march forward has always been to expand access to the polls, not  to decrease it--expanded access for those who didn't own land, for  Black Americans after the Civil War, for women, for all Americans.   In World War II, Black Americans fought overseas for the same country  that forced their families to sit at segregated lunch counters back  home. Then they came home and were forced to guess how many jelly beans  were in a jar before they, themselves, could vote in a country that  they had fought for.   Asian Americans fought to end slavery in the Civil War, sacrificed to  preserve this Union, and then had their earned citizenship stripped  away. Decades later, their grandsons fought in Europe even as their  loved ones were interred in camps on American soil. And we march  forward, and we march on, and we expand the right to the ballot box.   In the sixties, White Americans hopped on buses and risked their  lives Freedom Riding through the South so those with darker skin could  walk into the ballot box without fear of billy clubs.   And Americans of all backgrounds have packed their rucks, laced up  their boots, and gone to war in places like Iraq, lost their lives in  places like Afghanistan, to defend the most American belief: that we  all have a voice and we all have the right to use it, including at the  polls, because voting to elect one's own government is the core of that  right.   I am not asking anyone to do anything nearly as difficult as putting  on a uniform and going to war or crossing a bridge and being met with  billy clubs. I am not asking anybody to do anything that difficult  today. I am not asking my Republican colleagues to risk their lives on  a bus or a bridge, in the heat of the American South or under the  scorching Sun of a desert in the Middle East. All I am asking for is  the bare minimum. All I am begging them to do is merely to not sit in  silence in the face of grave injustice, to not let being partisan keep  them from being a patriot.   For the sake of all who have sacrificed for this Nation, I, at least,  refuse to remain silent. That is why I am voting for these bills. That  is why I am trying to claw back some of the protections that  Republicans have spent the last year trying to erode on the back of the  Big Lie, including expanded voter purges, increased barriers for voters  with disabilities, and harsher voter ID requirements.   That is why I am asking my colleagues who claim to represent the  party of Lincoln, as a junior Senator from the ``Land of Lincoln,'' I  ask you to act in a way that will further the cause of justice. That is  why I am working to restore the Voting Rights Act, to expand early  voting and vote-by-mail, to limit special interest money in politics,  and to actually try to protect underserved communities and our  servicemembers' rights to vote--because not only can our country do  better, we have done better. Back when we passed the Voting Rights Act  all those decades ago, not only can our Chamber do more, we have done  more, including the 16 Republicans who are still in the Senate today  who have previously voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.   And we owe more to those heroes who fought these fights before us,  those trailblazers who marched those bridges while those in power broke  their bones, whose skulls were cracked, whose blood was shed, yet whose  will never bent, whose determination never wavered, those heroes who  never let what was hard deter them from doing what was right. We owe it  to each of them--and to those whose rights are at risk today--to pass  this bill.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore.
