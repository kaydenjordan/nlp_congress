 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, first I want to thank the majority leader  for speaking about the agreement that the House and Senate came to on  the appropriations bills, the spending bills. We may not agree on  emphasis and what the most important things are, but we certainly agree  that it was a good effort that moved things forward, and I was proud to  be part of it.
