 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman, who has distinguished  himself in law enforcement since he has been here.   As the co-chair of the Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus and an  original sponsor of H.R. 2228, I rise today in strong support of the  Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act, and I want to join with  so many of the organizations that are supporting this: the Fraternal  Order of Police, the National Association of Police Officers, the Major  County Sheriffs of America, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Association, the National District Attorneys Association, and the  Sergeants Benevolent Association.   I was proud to have worked with my co-chair, David Reichert, and  Representatives Susan Brooks, Val Demings, and Doug Collins on this  important piece of legislation for the law enforcement community.   We all agree that the brave men and women in law enforcement put  themselves in difficult--if not dangerous and sometimes life- threatening, situations every day.                                time  1745    We teach officers how to handle every different situation, whether it  is a domestic dispute, whether it is a hostage dispute, or any other;  but we need to think about the officer who comes away from that  particular experience with himself; that is about it. He goes home to  his family.   It is absolutely critical we provide our law enforcement officers  with all the resources they need to effectively do their job. I have  consistently fought for new equipment and advanced technology to  provide physical protection for law enforcement when they are on duty.  However, we must also ensure law enforcement has the resources and  support and training to address mental health issues as well.   The stresses on law enforcement have continued to grow in recent  years. This can have a big impact on officers' physical and mental  well-being; that is why officer mental wellness needs to be a priority  from the day of hire to the day of retire. We know too many officers  struggle with depression, suicidal thoughts, post-traumatic stress  disorder.   As co-chair of the Traumatic Brain Injury Task Force in the Congress  of the United States, myself and Dr. Collins, who was the Republican  from Pennsylvania, started out 20 years ago; we could fit the number of  people in a telephone booth. We just about knew what we were talking  about, and that has changed how we approach our military forces on the  field.    According to the Badge of Life, a group that studies  post-traumatic stress disorder among police, we have heard tonight of  how many suicides we are talking about. Tragically, many police  officers with PTSD are not even aware they have the problem. Often they  remain on their beat, doing the job without help or support.   By discussing the importance of improving an officer's mental health,  we can reduce the stigma surrounding mental health issues in the law  enforcement community. I think that this bill will bolster the  connection between local mental health professionals and law  enforcement. I urge passage, and, hopefully, the Senate will do it  justice.
