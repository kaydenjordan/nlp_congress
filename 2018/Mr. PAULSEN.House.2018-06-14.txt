 Mr. Speaker, we know the opioid epidemic has,  unfortunately, been tearing apart communities all across our entire  country. I want to share a story in particular that is similar to the  heartbreak and heartache we have heard from others today.   Keegan: Keegan Duffy was 30 years old when he died in January of last  year after an accidental overdose. He had just received his master's  degree, had a promising career in computer science, was an avid  outdoorsman, and volunteered a lot of his time to helping the poor.   His addiction started like so many others. He was prescribed 120  pills after suffering chronic back pain. After that first pill,  unfortunately, he was hooked. Despite almost a dozen attempts to break  free of his addiction in rehabilitation, he could never really quite do  it. Ultimately, he died of an overdose that came from fentanyl, a  synthetic drug made in Asia, bought online, and smuggled into the  United States.   Keegan's story was told to me personally by his mother. It was  heartbreaking.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a very loving tribute to Keegan  written by his mother and father, Dave and Jean Duffy.     Statement of Jean and Dave Duffy, Father of Keegan, June 14, 2018         Keegan was 30 years old when he passed away Jan 3, 2017 of       an accidental overdose of opioids. At the time of his death,       he was working as a successful computer professional, having       just graduated from Arizona State William Carey School of       Business with a Masters degree in Information Systems. He had       a natural talent for music and loved playing guitar.        He was an avid outdoorsman, golfer, boater, skier and       fisherman. He was also known for his huge heart, helping the       poor find resources, teaching people how to get back in       school, and giving free haircuts to homeless and needy.        Most of all he was a special son and brother to his parents       and two beautiful sisters. He is missed by all of us every       single day.        Keegan became addicted to Oxycodone after receiving 120       pills from a doctor for back pain, while an undergrad. He       said he was addicted after taking the very first pill. His       addiction became chronic progressive, despite his nearly       dozen attempts to get better in well known treatment       facilities, including 6 month stays.        Keegan often said, ``I can figure everything else out in       life, but I can't figure out how to end my cravings.''       Unfortunately, it's not something one can just figure out, as       we all know.        I called the drug task force and the police to report       several doctors, who were encouraging him to take massive       amounts of this drug as well as other highly addictive drugs.       For some of these doctors, this resulted in the loss of their       license to practice.        One of Keegan's sisters, Bridget, is in her final year of       Neuroscience in the U of Minnesota. She volunteers in homes       for addicts and also has a part time job supporting research       at the University, to find a vaccine to prevent opioid       addiction. She plans to continue her studies in medical       school.        Thank you so much for remembering Keegan.        Jean & Dave Duffy     Keegan's story is why this legislation is so important  and how it will save other lives.   International mail is often a very easy route that we have seen used  for smuggling or the importation of dangerous fentanyl here into the  United States. While private carriers have to submit advance electronic  data for any of their data about packages that come here into the  United States, the Postal Service has been exempt.   So we have a loophole. That loophole is being exploited by smugglers,  giving traffickers an easy opportunity to have fentanyl come into  America. The STOP Act closes that loophole.   It is supported on a bipartisan basis. It will make it harder and  much more difficult to smuggle in fentanyl-laced drugs that not only  murdered Keegan but, unfortunately, have inflicted pain through tragic  deaths in other countless families across our country and so that we  can save other American lives, Mr. Speaker.   I thank Mr. Bishop and Mr. Pascrell for their leadership on this  legislation. I look forward to seeing it passed later today, because we  are finding solutions to the opioid epidemic.
