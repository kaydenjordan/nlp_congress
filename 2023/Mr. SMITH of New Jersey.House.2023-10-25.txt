 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  chairman and the ranking member for this extraordinarily important  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, our great friend and ally Israel, with significant  assistance from the United States, continues to respond to the cowardly  Hamas invasion that includes Hamas' psychotic terrorist butchering of  innocent civilians, rape, hostage-taking, the beheading of babies, and  daily indiscriminate missile attacks that are reminiscent of Nazi buzz  bombs and V-2 rockets.   Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu has said in the past that he would  never allow a second Holocaust, nor should we.   Anti-Semitism is at the root of Hamas' violence against Israel and  every Jewish man, woman, and child. Israel's right to defend itself  from this brutal invasion is absolute.   Hamas' 1988 charter explicitly demands the absolute destruction of  the State of Israel and proclaims: ``Israel will exist and will  continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it. . . . ''   Article 7 of the Hamas charter demands the slaughter of all Jews and  says:         The Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks       and trees will cry out, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come       and kill him.    Article 13 explicitly rejects initiatives for peace and  reconciliation and states, ``Initiatives, and so-called peaceful  solutions and international conferences, are in contradiction to the  principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement.''   In its 2017 charter, Hamas reiterated its goal of wiping Israel off  the face of the Earth and said: ``There is no alternative to a fully  sovereign Palestinian State on the entire national Palestinian soil,  with Jerusalem as its capital.''   Like the Nazis before them, Hamas and its chief terrorism sponsor,  Iran, are committing genocide against the Jews.   The United States--and all people committed to human rights and the  rule of law--must stand with Israel. That means our support and prayers  and the weapons systems to defeat Hamas.
