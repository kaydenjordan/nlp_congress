 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. For months, House  Republicans have delayed action to fund CHIP and community health  centers. These programs are critical in our communities and cannot  survive without this funding.                                time  1315    They have always been bipartisan, but, unfortunately, the bill before  us today is not. Instead of working with us, Republicans have focused  on TrumpCare and sabotaged the ACA. Now they have put forward this bill  full of poison pills that will only further delay funding these  critical public health programs, and to turn what has been  traditionally a bipartisan process into a political game does a  disservice to families.   H.R. 3922 eliminates the ACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund  which helps people in my district and other districts get vaccines,  prevent diabetes, and combat heart disease. The reason we put the  preservation fund in the ACA in the first place was to reorient our  health system towards prevention, which ultimately saves money and  keeps people healthier.   We all want to ensure kids have the insurance that they need to  access affordable care, but slashing benefits that will in the long  term hurt the very children and families that CHIP and the community  health centers help, as this bill does, is the wrong way to go. Through  its cuts to the Prevention Fund, this legislation is another attempt by  Republicans to undermine the ACA.   Unfortunately, this is just one of many acts of sabotage that we have  seen over the last year from the Trump administration and congressional  Republicans.   On top of these attacks on the Affordable Care Act, H.R. 3922 creates  a false choice between helping seniors and helping kids. This  legislation makes changes to Medicare that will hurt all seniors'  benefits in the long term.   Democrats have offered solutions that would pay for funding CHIP and  community health centers in a way that doesn't rob Peter to pay Paul. I  support the substitute amendment offered by Ranking Member Pallone  which would do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I am extremely disappointed that the Republicans have  chosen this partisan path for programs that are so dear to our  communities, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3922 and  to support the Democratic substitute.
