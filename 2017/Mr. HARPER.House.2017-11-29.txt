 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 630) requiring each Member, officer, and employee  of the House of Representatives to complete a program of training in  workplace rights and responsibilities each session of each Congress,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 630         Resolved,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS PROVIDED TO HOUSE                     EMPLOYEES UNDER CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY                     ACT OF 1995.         The Committee on House Administration shall issue       regulations to provide that each employing office of the       House of Representatives shall post in a prominent location       in the office (including, in the case of the office of a       Member of the House or a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to       the Congress, a prominent location in each office in the       Member's congressional district) a statement of the rights       and protections provided to employees of the House of       Representatives under the Congressional Accountability Act of       1995, including the procedures available to employees of the       House under such Act for responding to and adjudicating       allegations of violations of such rights and protections.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on H. Res.  630.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this House resolution.  The resolution is one part of the Committee on House Administration's  comprehensive review of the laws, procedures, and resources concerning  workplace harassment in the House. A harassment-free policy and  workplace is vital in creating that culture that will require everyone  on Capitol Hill to work together effectively.   First and foremost, Mr. Speaker, there is no place for sexual  harassment in our society, and especially in Congress--period. I  believe as Members of Congress, we must hold ourselves to a higher  standard, a standard that demonstrates we are worthy of the trust  [[Page H9492]]  placed in us by our constituents and the American public.   There have been a number of accounts by current and former colleagues  and staff that suggest not every office is achieving this goal. That is  simply unacceptable.   This resolution will mandate that each Member, officer, employee,  intern, and fellow of the House of Representatives is fully aware of  the laws that apply to them and their right to a harassment-free  workplace under the Congressional Accountability Act.   The Committee on House Administration recently held a hearing as its  first step in its review. We heard from Members, House employment  counsel, and the Office of Compliance. There was a broad consensus that  mandatory training is a necessary step for the House to prevent and  eliminate harassment in the workplace.   It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, that Republicans and Democrats  have joined together to take this step, and I want to specifically  thank Representative Comstock and Representative Speier for their  leadership on this issue.   The resolution requires training and education to ensure that each  Member, officer, employee, intern--paid or unpaid--and fellow knows  their obligations and rights. Further, the resolution requires that  each congressional office post in a prominent place a notice describing  the rights and protections provided to House employees under the  Congressional Accountability Act. Both of these measures are regular  order in the private workplace, and the House should do nothing less.   The American people have entrusted each of their Representatives with  an enormous responsibility. Each Member is sent here to help make our  country better. The first place we should start is in our own Chamber.  Training on workplace rights and responsibilities will ensure that  those who are victims of harassment can obtain justice and work in that  harassment-free environment.   In Ronald Reagan's farewell address, he spoke of his vision of  America as the shining city on the Hill, one built on rocks stronger  than oceans, with everyone living in harmony and peace. We are not  perfect and we never will be, but I believe in that vision.   This resolution can be one important step to protect the members of  our Capitol Hill community and to demand that we have respect for each  and every person here in this workplace.   The resolution sets an important requirement that each Member,  officer, and employee, including interns and fellows, must undergo this  mandatory training or education every year.                                time  1430    For the current Congress, everyone must complete this training within  180 days of the start of the second session of January 3. Following  that, individuals will have to complete the training within 90 days of  the start of each session.   It is often said that the urgent gets in the way of the important on  Capitol Hill. Not today. This is an important issue, and today we will  vote to ensure that the entire House community receives the needed  training on how to ensure a harassment-free workplace.   This harassment-free environment should be afforded to every single  member of our community from that unpaid intern to the Speaker of the  House. Awareness, education, and training is a first step in the  prevention and elimination of sexual harassment, which has no place on  Capitol Hill. I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve  this goal.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), who is the vice chairman of the Committee  on House Administration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), who is the distinguished chair of the Committee  on Ethics.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a distinguished member of the Committee on  Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), who is also a distinguished member of the  Committee on House Administration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance). He is a distinguished member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a distinguished member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer), the chair of the House Republican Policy  Committee and a distinguished member of the Committee on Education and  the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Reed), a distinguished member of the Committee on Ways and  Means.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this House, this special place, should not be tarnished  any longer by the inexcusable behavior of some of our Members. The  standard needs to be high.   Mr. Speaker, I give a special thank-you to Speaker Paul Ryan and his  commitment that he has that we get this right. I thank Ranking Member  Brady for the way that we have been able to work together on this.  Certainly, Representatives Speier and Comstock have been invaluable in  this process as we go forward.   We have heard from so many Members today on the importance of this.  This is a resolution that is necessary and it is a product of a strong  bipartisan incorporation. This is something that is just the beginning,  as has been said today. We had a hearing on November 14, and we will  have another hearing on the Congressional Accountability Act on  December 7. But to have this resolution to make sure that our Members  and staff are educated to know their rights and responsibilities is a  critical first step.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
