 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize recently named  Macomb County Volunteer of the Year, eighth-grader Dylan Rheker.   Dylan, age 14, volunteers at the Village of East Harbor senior living  facility, at Francis A. Higgins Elementary School, at the Anna Mae  Burdi Early Childhood Center, as well as Selfridge Air National Guard  Base and the Roseville Community Schools.   However, what is also impressive, in addition to Dylan's giving  spirit, is his perseverance. You see, Dylan was born with  neurofibromatosis, a condition which causes tumors to form in his  brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Dylan was also diagnosed with cancer  and has been undergoing chemotherapy for the past 4 years.   None of this deters the straight-A student as he helps people across  the 10th Congressional District. In fact, Dylan recently set a school  volunteer hour record, with 236 hours of volunteer service last year.  When asked about his volunteerism, Dylan responds that he is ``happy to  help'' and ``always here if someone needs help.''   Dylan is an outstanding young man, and I am extremely proud of all  the work he does in our district to make the community a better place  to live and work. I wish him the best of luck in the future, and I hope  all of you will as well.      Recognizing Carla Villalvazo as Winner of 2018 Congressional Art                                Competition     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Carla  Villalvazo, a high school student from Eisenhower High School in Shelby  Township, Michigan. Carla is the winner of the 2018 Congressional Art  Competition for my district. Her artwork titled ``Forget Me Not'' is a  watercolor painting which will hang in the Cannon tunnel of the Capitol  for the next year.   Importantly, it is not only wonderful artwork, it talks about the  struggle the family has with a family member with Alzheimer's. It is  great artwork, but it also touches my heart and, I think, many others.   I also recognize second-place finisher Stefanie Frontera, also from  Eisenhower High School, and third-place finisher Christina Berels from  Cardinal Mooney High School. These students all submitted wonderful  pieces of art. The second- and third-place winners will hang in my  office.   I thank them all for their submission.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, as you may guess, I am a big fan of a  good candy bar.   In 1983, a candy bar cost 35 cents and had a cost of about 2 cents  worth of sugar. Thirty-five years later, I am still a fan of candy  bars. In 2018, that same candy bar costs $1.49--they are a little  slimmer--and the cost of sugar is still 2 cents.   United States retail sugar costs are the lowest in the world: 59  cents a pound compared to 71 cents on the open market. The sugar  program cost the taxpayers zero in the last 16 years.   Rather than message about alleged conservative amendments, let's  focus on addressing meaningful changes. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the  amendment.
