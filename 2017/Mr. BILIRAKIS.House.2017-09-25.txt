The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3819, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017.   H.R. 3819 would extend a number of authorities impacting veterans'  benefits, health, and homeless programs. Swift passage of this  legislation today would ensure that many programs that veterans, their  caregivers, dependents, and survivors rely on continue. We must  continue these programs.   Mr. Speaker, the programs include nursing home care, support services  for caregivers, transportation, child care assistance, adaptive sports  programs, and housing and home loan services, to name just a few. So  important. Again, these are not new programs, but they are so very  important to our true heroes.   The costs associated with them have been assumed in the House-passed  appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 and 2019 advance  appropriation.   One program that has been extended for just 5 additional months,  until January 6, 2018, is the assisted living pilot program for  veterans with traumatic brain injury. That short extension would allow  extra time for the VA to fully transition the veterans currently  participating in that program into other existing programs more  suitable for their ongoing support and rehabilitation.   H.R. 3819 would also make a number of technical corrections to the  Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017.   This bill was drafted by and has full bipartisan support of both the  majority and the minority Veterans' Affairs Committee members of the  House and the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  3819 today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), a true American hero and a combat veteran.  [[Page H7472]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), a true American hero and a combat veteran.  [[Page H7472]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), who is also a member of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for  his leadership and working in a bipartisan fashion always, and we  always put our veterans first, so I appreciate that very much.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 3819.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
