 Mr. President, I rise today to speak in defense of a dear  colleague of ours who is now the Attorney General of our Nation, Jeff  Sessions. He is my friend. More importantly, he is a former colleague  of this very body. He is a man of integrity. He is a man of principle.  I trust him, and I take him at his word.   Furthermore, he has repeatedly said just today that he will, in fact,  recuse himself if and when it becomes appropriate. In my opinion, it is  not appropriate right now, but if it ever were to become appropriate,  he has said, without hesitation, that he would.   I have really never witnessed anything quite like this in my brief  time here in the Senate. The last 2 years have been very interesting,  but never have I seen the hypocrisy that we see going on around this  one issue.   It is increasingly clear that the minority party is singularly  focused on sabotaging this new administration at every turn, and today  is no exception. They have exercised procedural rules in the Senate  time and again, beyond the intent of the Founders' design, in order to  stop President Trump from even getting his team in place--his very  Cabinet. Our President today, as we stand here in this well, cannot  have a staff meeting because he doesn't have all of his Cabinet members  in place.   As for the Cabinet members who have been confirmed, the minority  party seems equally fixated on finding any red herring they can  ultimately find to undermine the individual's character. We have  literally reached the point where Members of this body are slandering  former colleagues for having and taking the same opportunities afforded  to them.   This morning, my colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, tweeted  that she had never, ``EVER'' met with or taken a call from the Russian  Ambassador. But her own Twitter account proved that she has at least  twice in the last 4 years.   Thirty Members of this body, as a matter of fact, met with a Russian  Ambassador and Ambassadors from other nations in 2015 for a sales pitch  on President Obama's deal with Iran. Many of them, including the senior  Senator from Missouri, were open supporters at that time of candidates  in the President's race.   In the process of this hypocrisy, the minority party is prohibiting  us from taking action on legislation that would solve many of the  problems that have manifested themselves over the previous 8 years.   Make no mistake, Russia is a traditional rival whose actions pose a  definite threat to global security and even our own security here at  home. Their actions over the last 8 years have helped destabilize  Eastern Europe and the Middle East. It was the inaction and refusal to  lead of the past administration--a policy that the minority party  followed hook, line, and sinker--that created a power vacuum around the  world and allowed this Russian resurgence.   I have said this repeatedly, and I am going to continue to do so.  Until there is definite proof that Russians changed a single vote from  Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump, I will be focused on one thing; that  is, doing exactly what the American people sent us here to do. I  encourage my colleagues to do the same, which is to not engage in  political theater for the sake of partisan politics, but to work  together to get America back to work.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.                            Texas Independence Day
