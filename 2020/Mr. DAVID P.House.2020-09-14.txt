 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, we are here today with  the GOP Doctors Caucus for the next hour to discuss the COVID epidemic.   It is my distinct honor and privilege to be down here with my  colleagues for the first time in some time since the House has not been  in session for quite a few weeks.   Collectively on the floor tonight, there are over 200 years of  clinical experience with the GOP Doctors Caucus. I myself practiced 37  years before I retired and ran for Congress in 2008.   Tonight, I want to go over the timeline just briefly of the pandemic  that we currently are experiencing.   Remember, about 8\1/2\ months ago, we knew that there was a virus  that had spread from China, from Wuhan, China, to the U.S.   In that timeline, on January 9, the World Health Organization  announced that there was a pneumonia in Wuhan, China.   By January 20, three cities in the U.S. had already begun to limit  flights and to check passengers from flights that landed in Los Angeles  at LAX, at San Francisco, and at JFK International.   On January 21, the first confirmed case was a person who lived in  Wuhan but came back to the U.S.   By January 31 of this year, the President had stopped all flights  from China to the U.S. and then subsequently, as we all know, from  Europe to the U.S.   So, literally, from not knowing what this virus was in the first  month, what RNA sequence it was, we had limited the travel of this  virus.   Through the month of February, I became involved with the Diamond  Princess cruise ship. It turned out I had a very good friend on that  ship. It was docked with 3,500 people onboard. The average age of the  passengers on that ship was 75 years of age.   My friend is a physician. I talked to him on the phone.   I must give a shout-out to HHS, who really led the evacuation of that  ship, bringing all Americans back home, quarantining them. Not a single  American died, and I think we can take some pride in that.   I am a former U.S. Army officer. I served in the 2nd Infantry  Division in Korea. We were trained, and it was beaten in our heads, you  do not leave anyone behind.   I think a number that is left out is our U.S. State Department has  repatriated over 90,000 U.S. American citizens from overseas back home  to the U.S., where they can receive the care that they need.   We have recognized that we got the RNA sequence of the virus and  literally, within 6 weeks, began to approve treatments for this virus  we didn't know a lot about.   I want to say, in my 37 years--this December, I would have graduated  from medical school 50 years ago--I don't ever remember a time in my  life where we found a disease, an infectious disease, where within 8  months we had cut the mortality rate by over 40 percent. That is  literally unheard of.   It is a huge shout-out to the men and women who get up every day and  go into our hospitals--we all know them at home--and put their lives on  the line to treat us as patients and to take care of us. When given the  proper equipment, they are doing a phenomenal job on the front lines.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends and colleagues who are still  in practice every day for that.   We had an opportunity in May. Once we had realized that this had  ramped up and a lot of Americans had been affected by this, the White  House started something called Operation Warp Speed.   Literally, in the history of this country, I don't remember a time-- typically, when we have a vaccine, a treatment for a disease, there is  usually anywhere from 3 or 4 years to 10 or 15 years to get that  vaccine approved and get it to market.   What we want is a safe, effective vaccine like you would for polio.   As a child, I remember as a little boy when the polio vaccine came  out. Literally overnight in this country, we eliminated polio as a  risk. Many of my friends developed polio. They got it before the  vaccine was available. I was very fortunate and did not, as were many  children. We have essentially eliminated that from the Earth today.   We began Operation Warp Speed, which was to develop a vaccine. Well,  how is that going to happen? We kept hearing it would be done in about  a year. How can you safely do that in a year?   What usually happens in vaccine development is you sequence the RNA.  The virus, you sequence it. After that virus is sequenced, you send  your information over to the FDA, and they approve that you can begin  clinical phase 1 trials. Phase 1 trials are typically 45 or 50  patients.   You then get the information from the phase 1 trials back to the FDA,  the approval boards, and they give you permission to go to phase 2 and  then to phase 3 trials.   If all of that is successful, then you begin to manufacture the  vaccine and then deliver the vaccine to health departments, to doctors'  offices, to hospitals and pharmacies and so forth to use the vaccine,  just like we do for the flu.   What has happened this time is that all of these things have occurred  simultaneously. So the phase 1 trials, the FDA gets the information.  Phase 2 trials, they get the information. If it looks good, they can go  ahead with phase 3 trials. That is why right now we have three trials  in phase 3 trials in 8 months, which is unheard of, I can tell you.  These are tens of thousands of patients who are enrolled in these  trials.   Hopefully, by the end of this year, we will have a vaccine that is  both safe and effective to treat our people in this country, our ones  at most risk.   I am going to stop now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess). The  first person I would like to recognize tonight is my good friend, Dr.   Mike Burgess, a fellow OB/GYN doctor representing Texas' District 26.    He is a senior member of our GOP Doctors Caucus and has been active  in the caucus since it began. Dr. Burgess serves on the Energy and  Commerce Committee as a senior member.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Burgess is correct.  It is one thing to manufacture a very small amount of vaccine, and  vaccines are only one part of the prevention part.   We all know about washing our hands and face coverings, and the  American people are doing that. Certainly, I have traveled a lot, as we  all have, and I have seen great compliance in my home State of  Tennessee with this very deadly virus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), my  good friend, and he is that indeed. I have had the privilege of getting  to know Dr. Bucshon and his family. I have been to his district,  Indiana 8 in Evansville.   He has been here five terms, has served a little over 10 years as  U.S. Navy Reserve, and is a retired cardiothoracic surgeon.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I think you have to ask,  any time you put something like this, Operation Warp Speed, together  is: What is the goal? And the goal of that is to produce 300 million  doses of an effective, safe vaccine to protect the American people. And  also, it is to provide therapeutics and diagnostics along with that.   And this is under the umbrella of Health and Human Services; the FDA;  the CDC; the NIH; BARDA, which is the Biomedical Advanced Research and  [[Page H4375]]  Developmental Authority; and the Department of Defense. So it is a  multidepartment approach of the entire government and the private  sector. It is a private-public partnership to try to help defeat this  virus and put our American people back at ease and back at work.   Look, every day when I go home, they say: Dr. Roe, when are we going  to be able to get back to normal?   And yesterday was the first day I had attended an in-person church  service in 6 months, the longest time in my life I remember not being  in church, and people were so glad to be there and to have some  semblance of normalcy.   This morning I got up. As I drove back, I saw parents putting their  children on schoolbuses--something as simple as that, just to put your  child on a schoolbus. I saw a mother this morning hug her little boy,  and he jumps on with his mask on, jumps on the schoolbus ready to go to  school. I think people are craving that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), my  good friend, who is the vice chair of the Doctors Caucus, as Dr.  Bucshon is. He is a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve--I have to salute  him. I never made it past O-4--for over 20 years. He served in Iraq and  also served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and chaired the  Subcommittee on Health.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman  leaves, I know we had the opportunity, and we do about weekly, to be on  a phone conference call with Operation Warp Speed leaders. One of the  things that they asked us to do, and I do this here tonight, is to ask  more African Americans to sign up for the vaccine trials.                                time  2045    In one particular large trial there were only 5.5 percent I believe  African Americans in the trial, and they need to get that up.   So if you are out there, I am asking you to volunteer for this trial.  Certainly, we need that. I think they had enough Latinos and senior  citizens like myself, but I think that we do need that.   Mr. Speaker, you do need that. Basically, you need to study this as  you do the population.   I think Pfizer is going to increase their trial to the low 40,000s.  So it is a huge--just to let people know--that is a gigantic clinical  trial. It is placebo controlled. One group gets a saline, basically a  placebo, and the other group gets the vaccines. Then you check later.   By the way, all of these six vaccines, five of them will be two  shots; one, and then one 21 to 28 days later. One which  [[Page H4376]]  will be developed a little later on, I think into 2021, will be a  single shot.    ROE of Tennessee. How you decide who gets this vaccine  is basically you just look at who suffered the most from it.   Where has that been?   It has been your nursing homes and your long-term care facilities.   I want to give the VA a shout-out. I served as the ranking member on  the Veterans' Affairs Committee and chairman in the last Congress.   They have used the fourth mission of the VA to go out into many, many  nursing homes across this country and to train and bring people up to  speed about how to isolate patients so that it doesn't spread.   I remember one State veterans' nursing home in Massachusetts that  lost over 70 veterans--that is unbelievable--in one facility. So we are  getting much better. It is our elderly and long-term care facilities,  over 40 percent of the deaths have been in long-term care and nursing  homes.   Certainly, our healthcare workers and our first responders should be  the first ones when a safe and effective vaccine is created.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris). Dr.  Harris is the cochair of the Doctors Caucus. Dr.   Andy Harris is a  Navy veteran and very active Member who will have the reins next year.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to  Dr. Harris before he leaves, let's have a little discussion. The  Doctors Caucus can get down in the weeds sometimes, and I realize that  we do. But let's explain to people what herd immunity is.   What does it actually mean? You heard about this, and you hear all  these folks get on TV and the talking heads start talking about it.   What does that actually mean?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    ROE of Tennessee. Actually, we had a normal summer at  the Great Smoky Mountains National Park this year. We had 1.7 million  people come in July which was a record, I understand.   One of the things I want to also mention briefly while Dr. Dunn comes  up is: Should you wear a mask, or should you not wear a mask?   A mask is an inconvenience. I am standing here way away from anybody,  20 feet away from anybody, but the way a mask probably works is this-- these are not good enough to keep a virus from getting in. But if you  walk through a room with coronavirus and you walk through a room filled  with people, Mr. Speaker, you potentially will infect 2\1/2\ of those  people.   Why?   Because it is probably spread by droplets. So if I have this mask on  it prevents--if I sneeze or cough or whatever--a droplet from getting  out or certainly not spreading very far. That is why if you touch a  surface you want to wash your hands and cleanse the surface.   To give an example of how infectious measles is, if I have the  measles and I walk through that same room, I probably can infect as  many as 15 to 18 people. So it is aerosolized. It is like a pollen in  the air. That is how it is spread as opposed to just a droplet spread,  which means that the coronavirus is not spread nearly as easily as some  other viruses are.   I wore a mask for over 30 years in the operating room. If it turns  out it doesn't help all that much, then you have been inconvenienced.  If it helps, then you maybe have saved a life.   Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to introduce Dr. Dunn. My friend  is a U.S. Army veteran. I served with Dr. Dunn on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee. He is extremely active on that  [[Page H4377]]  committee. It has been a real pleasure to serve with Dr. Dunn in the  U.S. Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Dunn).    ROE of Tennessee. It has been. One of the things that  the CARES package did was--this is not Operation Warp Speed--but the  CARES package also provided the way we shift when seeing patients in  person through telehealth.   The VA, for instance, about 1 year ago did 70,000 or 80,000  telehealth visits a month for their PTSD treatments. That number went  to over 900,000 in May of this year. That is unbelievable when you can  do that. I think many practices now, including my own at home, have  used telehealth to see patients, and I myself have used telehealth  which saved me a many-hour drive one way or the other.   The pandemic is not all bad. We have learned some good things and  some things I think that are going to persist after we get through this  particular pandemic.   I also might add, this is not the first pandemic we have had. That is  why I know we were going to be fine. There was an H3N2 pandemic in  1968, a coronavirus pandemic, and we got through that as a country. We  have responded so much better this time with the therapeutics,  monoclonal antibodies antivirals, just the way we treat it.   Anticoagulation hasn't been mentioned. We know this is an  inflammatory response. It causes coagulation in the kidneys, the heart,  and the lungs. So we have learned that.   Hats off to our medical professionals who have gone out and  literally--it is unbelievable how fast they have upped their knowledge  of this.   I appreciate the gentleman's comments.                                time  2100    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce),  who I just introduced. He is double-boarded in internal medicine and  dermatology, is a relatively new representative from Pennsylvania 13th,  and has had 31 years in practice.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, next I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).  Dr. Buddy Carter is our only pharmacist--soon to be two--in the U.S.  Congress. We are glad to have Dr. Carter from Georgia One. He has been  an incredibly important member of the Doctor's Caucus in providing his  perspective because he has run a business for many, many years, has  seen patients for many, many years, and brings his perspective to our  caucus.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much  time I have remaining?    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, this should be about  people not politics.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), my good  friend, who is a dentist, who served both in the Army as an  artilleryman and in the United States Air Force as a dentist, and has  been a very active member of our caucus.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I might point out that I  have never seen a Republican or Democratic virus in my life. Just like  I have never seen a Republican or Democratic cancer. This just affects  people. The virus will be safe, it will be effective, and it will be  voluntary. It will be a person's decision, or their family's decision,  who actually receives the vaccine.  [[Page H4379]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Murphy), who I served with on the Committee on Education and Labor, my  good friend, and the newest member of the GOP's Doctor's Caucus.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for  being here tonight. I look forward to continuing this debate and this  discussion here on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time.                            ____________________
