 Madam President, I am pleased to announce that our  bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on defense spending and other  priorities have yielded a significant agreement.   I thank my friend the Democratic leader for joining me this afternoon  and for the productive discussions that have generated this proposal.   The compromise we have reached will ensure that, for the first time  in years, our Armed Forces will have more of the resources they need to  keep America safe. It will help us serve the veterans who bravely  served us, and it will ensure funding for important efforts such as  disaster relief, infrastructure, and building on our work to fight  opioid abuse and drug addiction. This bill is the product of extensive  negotiations among congressional leaders and the White House. No one  would suggest it is perfect, but we worked hard to find common ground  and stay focused on serving the American people.    First and foremost, this bipartisan agreement will unwind the  sequestration cuts that have hamstrung our Armed Forces and jeopardized  our national security. Secretary Mattis said: ``No enemy in the field  has done more harm to the . . . readiness of our military than  sequestration.''   For years, my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee, led  by Chairman John McCain, have spoken out about these damaging cuts. In  the face of continuing and emerging threats, these cuts have left us  unable to realize the potential of our missile defense capabilities.  They have whittled down our conventional forces, laying an undue burden  on forward-deployed personnel and their families. And they have shrunk  our fleet to its lowest ship count in nearly three decades. We haven't  asked our men and women in uniform to do less for our country. We have  just forced them to make do with less than they need. This agreement  changes that.   In addition, this bill will provide for our returning heroes. Too  often, underfunded, overcomplicated bureaucracies fail to deliver the  care our veterans deserve. The Trump administration and Congress-- thanks to the leadership of Chairman Isakson--have made important  progress for veterans in the past year. This agreement will expand on  those steps.   This agreement will also bolster our ongoing national struggle  against opioid addiction and substance abuse. It will fund new grants,  prevention programs, and law enforcement efforts in vulnerable  communities all across our country.   It also provides funding for disaster relief efforts. Last year,  powerful storms crippled Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and  damaged mainland communities from Florida to Texas. Thanks to the  efforts of Members such as Senators Cornyn, Cruz, Rubio, and others,  this bill will get more help on the way.   The agreement will clear the way for a new investment in our Nation's  infrastructure--a bipartisan priority shared by the President and  lawmakers of both parties.   This bill does not conclude the serious work that remains before  Congress. After we pass it, the Appropriations Committees will have 6  weeks to negotiate detailed appropriations and deliver full funding for  the remainder of fiscal year 2018, but this bill represents a  significant, bipartisan step forward. I urge every Senator to review  this legislation and join us in voting to advance it.   I particularly want to thank my friend the Democratic leader. I hope  we can build on this bipartisan momentum and make 2018 a year of  significant achievement for Congress, for our constituents, and for the  country that we all love.                                 Immigration    Now, on one final matter, as I have said publicly many times, our  upcoming debate on DACA, border security, and other issues will be a  process that is fair to all sides. The bill I move to, which will not  have underlying immigration text, will have an amendment process that  will ensure a level playing field at the outset. The amendment process  will be fair to all sides, allowing the sides to alternate proposals  for consideration and for votes. While I obviously cannot guarantee the  outcome, let alone supermajority support, I can ensure the process is  fair to all sides, and that is what I intend to do.
