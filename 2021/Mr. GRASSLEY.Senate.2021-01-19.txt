 I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute in  morning business.    Mr. President, last week, I started my annual tradition  of holding Q&A's with Iowans in all 99 counties. This is my 41st  consecutive year, and remember that only one meeting counts for the  tally. But I hold many Q&A's in more populous counties.   For example, I was in 10 counties last week: A snow plow manufacturer  in Manchester, IA, that employs over 300 Iowans and the Marshalltown  High School to hear what is on the minds of young people, because they  never come to my town meetings. I heard about the pandemic, the  Paycheck Protection Program, commodity prices, infrastructure, and high  drug prices.   I look forward to the next 89 county meetings to keep in touch with  my constituents.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, as the most senior Republican Senator  in the Republican majority, I have had the privilege to serve as Senate  President pro tempore in the 116th Congress. The last time a Senator  from Iowa served in this constitutional office was 100 years ago. For  the last 2 years, it has been my great honor each day to open the  business of the Senate, welcome Chaplain Barry C. Black to lead us in  opening prayer and recite the Pledge of Allegiance with my colleagues  and staff. It was a distinct honor to enroll bills with my signature  before they left Capitol Hill for the President's desk to be signed  into law.   Today, I pay tribute to a group of selfless professionals who was  assigned to serve as my security detail. As this body knows, the  President pro tempore serves in the Presidential line of succession and  receives 24-hour protection. Now, as most Americans might imagine, it  took some time to get accustomed to having a security detail following  my every step, around the clock, 365 days a year. These dedicated  professionals made the transition as seamless as possible. They served  with integrity, discretion, and professionalism. Some of them might not  have known the journey in store when they embarked 2 years ago on this  assignment. By journey, I refer of course to my heavy travel schedule.  For starters, I return nearly every weekend to Iowa and whenever the  Senate is not in session. And lest anyone imagine there is a nonstop  commercial flight between the Nation's Capital and my farm in Butler  County, I will disabuse anyone of that fairy tale.   Agents on my security detail became frequent fliers and intimately  familiar with the map of Iowa. My work schedule includes my annual 99  county meetings across the State. Last year, I finished my 40th  consecutive year holding meetings with Iowans in courthouses, schools,  factory floors, hospitals, and service clubs. Typically, Iowa weather  adds a bit of uncertainty to the schedule. Last year, the pandemic  opened a whole new can of worms. I want to thank my security detail for  doing an exceptional job these past 2 years. I can confirm none of the  agents indulges in a treat from Dairy Queen as much as I do.   My security detail also learned on day one of their assignment that I  am an early bird. I like to wake up early and get my morning jog in  before the sun crests the horizon. They learned every step of my route  in northern Virginia and the country gravel roads in Butler County, IA.  The agents showed an exemplary work ethic and respect for punctuality  which, as my staff and many Iowans who attend my meetings know, is very  important to me. I don't like to waste time or money, especially on the  taxpayer dime.   Today, I salute the following members of the U.S. Capitol Police  Dignitary Protection Division: Supervisory Agent David Rib, Agent Eric  Boggs, Agent Shane Powell, Agent John Brito, Agent Eric Love, Agent  Zachary Madera, Agent Daniel Murphy, Agent Arnold Pierre, Agent Luis  Pimentel, Agent Ryan Rayball, Agent Zachary Samson, Agent John Whittle,  Agent Joseph Larue, Agent Justin Godfrey, Agent Michael Bell, Agent  Caleb Horton, Agent Muhammed Khan, Agent Tobey Murray, Agent Robert  Schultz, Agent Travis Scott, Agent Richard Dahl, Agent Brandon Exum,  Agent Carlos Fonseca, Agent Louis Mannella, Agent Brooke Littlewood,  Agent Nicholas Koffarnus, Agent Wayland Massengill, Agent Jesse Cole,  Agent Todd Sindelar, Agent Cory Flere, Agent Gabriel Santos-Muniz, and  Agent Nicholas Wirth.   Barbara and I enjoyed teaching some of the agents about agriculture  at the Iowa State Fair. Together, we rooted for UNI Panthers wrestling,  basketball, and volleyball on many occasions. Many of them became fond  of Iowa. They discovered the meaning of ``Iowa Nice.'' Iowa will  welcome you back anytime for a visit.   Barbara and I have enjoyed getting to know you and for giving the  full measure of devotion to your job to keep me safe and sound. The  Capitol riots on January 6 revealed how seriously you take your oaths  of office and I sincerely thank you for putting yourselves in harm's  way on my behalf. We wish you and your families all the best in the  years ahead.   Speaking about the violent attacks that took place in the U.S.  Capitol, on the 6th of January, I also extend my appreciation to the  legion of Capitol Police officers who protect this sacred civic space.  They put their lives on the line every day to put the safety of others  before their own. They keep watch over 535 members of Congress, the  thousands of staffers who serve the American people here in the  legislative branch, and the millions of people and youth groups who  come every year to visit the U.S. Capitol. The riots serve as a stark  reminder never to take law enforcement for granted. We mourn the loss  of two Capitol Police officers--Officer Brian D. Sicknick and Officer  Howard Liebengood--who lost their lives this month. Barbara and I  continue to pray for them and the loved ones they leave behind.                            ____________________
