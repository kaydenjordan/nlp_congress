 Mr. Speaker, Americans want to know that  government officials don't have conflicts of interest swaying their  decisions.   For example, did they fundraise from an industry that they will  regulate? Might they take it easy on that industry as a result?   H.R. 1 requires high-level officials to disclose if they have  solicited or made political contributions to PACs, political  nonprofits, or industry trade associations. I thank Congressman Deutch  for authoring this provision.   My amendment expands this piece to cover chiefs of mission to ensure  that officials representing our country abroad, such as ambassadors,  are free from conflicts of interest, too. We should feel confident that  people entrusted to represent the United States are there not because  of political donations, but because they are the best person for the  job.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, the en  bloc, and H.R. 1.
