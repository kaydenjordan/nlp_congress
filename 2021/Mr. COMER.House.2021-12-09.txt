 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the bill the majority has titled the Protecting Our  Democracy Act does nothing to protect anything but the swamp.   Right now, the American people are trying to prepare for the holidays  with the highest inflation rate in 30 years. They are struggling to  keep their gas tanks full, put food on the table, and heat their homes.  They are worried about rising crime in their communities. They are  concerned their children have suffered while their classrooms were  closed but the borders are wide open to illegal immigrants and deadly  drugs.   Democrats are ignoring these real issues facing Americans today.  Instead, Democrats want to talk about former President Trump, even  though a Democrat has occupied the White House for nearly a year. This  is not what the American people want for Christmas.   The Democrats' playbook is about as predictable as a Hallmark  Christmas special. We have all seen this movie.   The bill before us today is based on political fiction, and it is the  latest attempt to resurrect Democrats' sham investigations of the past.   This bill unconstitutionally disrupts the separation of powers among  the branches of government by diminishing the executive branch and  ignoring the judicial branch.   For example, the legislation interferes with the President's pardon  power, a power completely vested with the President. But this bill  gives Congress access to sensitive White House deliberations and  communications about pardons. What legislative purpose does that serve?   Congress has no authority to evaluate the President's pardon power.  This bill also overrides the judicial branch by attaching partisan  definitions to constitutional language that the Supreme Court has  already spoken to. It would change the definition of an emolument to  fit failed Democrat legal theories and indulge certain Members' false  conspiracy theories--Members like, I don't know, Madam Speaker, Adam  Schiff.   Rewriting this technical constitutional term would keep any  businessperson who has conducted business outside the U.S. from running  for President. That would mean no Hunter Biden at the top of the ticket  in 2024.    Democrats appear to think the skill set for running a business would  not be helpful to the Federal Government. Maybe that is why Democrats'  only solution to any problem is to throw American taxpayer dollars at  it and not to engage in serious government reform efforts.   Democrats only want career politicians--or even better, career  bureaucrats--to be able to serve as elected officials. Similarly,  Democrats are determined to make the Federal Government run as  inefficiently as possible by allowing incompetent or dishonest Federal  employees to keep their jobs.   The so-called whistleblower protections in the bill are so expansive  that if a Federal employee, even a bad or ineffective one, claims they  are a whistleblower, they are almost immune from scrutiny.   The Committee on Oversight and Reform has great respect for  whistleblowers. We need them to conduct true oversight. They serve an  essential role in evaluating waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal  Government. But sometimes Federal employees attempt to claim they are  whistleblowers to shield themselves from scrutiny for poor performance.  We should not make it impossible to vet whistleblowers' claims and  their work.   Further, the policy in the Democrats' bill to entrench inspectors  general is another policy that reduces the efficiency of the Federal  Government and another example of the legislative branch intruding on  the operations of the executive branch.   Madam Speaker, it is Christmastime. Instead of fixing the many  problems created by President Biden, like the supply chain, energy,  border, and economic crises, Democrats have decided to take up a sham  bill and deliver a lump of coal to the American people.   Instead of spending time on Democrats' favorite obsession, President  Trump, we should instead take on the issues facing Americans today.

Madam Speaker, wow, I heard Donald Trump's name mentioned at least a  dozen times by my colleagues across the aisle. I am sincerely glad that  the Democrats spent so much time investigating the President for  wrongdoing. I am glad that they issued subpoenas investigating the  President for wrongdoing. I am very happy that, in all the  investigations conducted by the Intelligence Committee and Oversight  and Reform Committee, they did not find one ounce of wrongdoing  committed by President Trump.    I am also happy that they investigated President Trump's children. I  think that is fair game. I can promise the American people that very  soon there will be that type of oversight for the Biden administration  and the President's son, Hunter, who is in the news almost on a daily  basis for things that just don't add up. They just don't look good.  That oversight is coming. The American people can count on that.   Madam Speaker, after nearly a year in power, it is time for Democrats  to actually start governing and abandon their obsession with Donald  Trump.   H.R. 5314 is full of bad policy that diminishes the power of the  executive branch and entrenches Washington bureaucrats making law based  on false conspiracy theories of the bill's sponsor.   The bill has not proceeded through regular order and is a  Frankenstein's monster stitched together from various committees'  jurisdictions, while other whole portions have never undergone  committee review at all.   There has been no attempt to seriously vet these substantial changes,  [[Page H7592]]  minimal cooperation with the minority, and no apparent path for the  bill in the Senate.   In other words, Madam Speaker, H.R. 5314 is a messaging bill to  bolster the fundraising efforts of Democrat Members in preparation for  the 2022 midterms. The Democratic Party should try governing instead.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and oppose  this reckless legislation. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the amendments en bloc.   This protecting the swamp act is full of bad policy and disregards  regular order. H.R. 5314 is designed purely for Democrats to talk about  all of their failed conspiracy theories about the former President. In  fact, this bill looks more like a fundraising campaign than an effort  to provide legislative solutions.   My Democratic colleagues should be working with Republicans to  address and solve the problems President Biden and his administration  have created for the American people, not pushing through hyperpartisan  legislation.   While this en bloc package of amendments has several legitimate, good  ideas, there are too many that make this bad bill worse. While  commonsense proposals such as strengthening minority rights for  Oversight and Reform Committee members, Freedom of Information Act  reform, and an inspector general for the Office of Management and  Budget are perfectly reasonable solutions for the House to consider,  most of the amendments in this bloc make a very bad bill much worse.   Overall, these amendments entrench and slow down the Federal  bureaucracy, intrude on the executive branch's powers, and strip a duly  elected President of the ability to effectively manage the executive  branch.   I am not sure if Democrats' distrust of the executive branch is  because of their hatred for the former President or their lack of faith  in the current President. Either way, Republicans should not support  attempts to degrade the Office of the President.   The few good amendments in this bloc proposed by Republicans are  simply drowned out by bad policy. If Democrats were serious about  engaging with Republicans, then they should have worked with us through  the normal legislative process during which we could have effectively  vetted these measures in the committees of jurisdiction.   Americans are struggling with the highest inflation in 30 years,  worried about the safety of their communities, and eager to get their  children back to school. The majority is flatly ignoring the American  people to instead talk about former President Trump. These amendments  offered by Democrats in this package only move this bill further away  from addressing the immediate concerns of Americans.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who is the ranking member of the Education  and Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, they say this bill is not about President  Trump, but every speaker mentioned President Trump multiple times.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida  ( Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), who is the ranking member of the  House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the amendments en bloc.   In this package is my amendment, the IG Stability Act, which clearly  shows where we should be able to come together and pass bipartisan  inspector general reforms.   Inspectors general play a critical role in rooting out fraud, waste,  and abuse in the Federal Government. They help Congress, and especially  the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, in conducting oversight of  executive branch offices and Federal agencies.   Yet, just like in every profession, occasionally there have been  either poor performers or those who have acted outside their mandates.  With respect to poor performers, we had, in my opinion, a very poor  performing Election Assistance Commission IG, and she resigned after we  started calling for her to do her job. In those situations, the  President should have the flexibility to remove an inspector general.   The Democrats' proposal would dramatically limit the President's  authority to remove an inspector general for dereliction of duty or  undermining the policies of a duly elected President.   My amendment mirrors bipartisan language in the Senate which requires  a detailed rationale to be provided to Congress prior to the removal of  an IG. This ensures Congress has adequate oversight of the removal of  an IG without preventing a President from removing an IG who is  undermining them.   Further, my amendment would help remedy the ongoing concern about IG  vacancies, which has been a recurring problem in Republican and  Democrat administrations. My amendment requires the President to notify  Congress if they fail to fill a vacancy and provide a written  explanation with a target date for nomination.   This amendment ensures that the IG community is adequately staffed to  conduct nonpartisan oversight over Federal agencies.   This provision has already passed the House this year as part of the  bipartisan Inspector General Protection Act, H.R. 23. Yet, the  Democrats are now putting this commonsense, bipartisan amendment in an  en bloc designed to fail. Why? They are not interested in real reform;  they are just interested in messaging, messaging campaigns for the 2022  midterm elections, which by all accounts aren't looking very bright for  my friends across the aisle.   This amendment and Mr. Burgess' amendment should be accepted, not  shoved aside. I encourage support of  [[Page H7611]]  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, they say it is not about Donald Trump,  but every speaker on that side of the aisle spent a significant  percentage of their time talking about Donald Trump.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I must say that the GAO plays an important  role in the legislative branch, but with matters of national security,  we must ensure protocols are followed to prevent unauthorized  disclosures of national security information. With this amendment, it  is unclear whether those protocols are being met, creating a potential  national security risk.   Further, the House Intelligence Committee already has the authority  to task GAO, when necessary and appropriate, to conduct reviews of the  intelligence community and to ensure GAO receives appropriate  information from the intelligence community. The House Intelligence  Committee has done this several times in the past, making this  amendment moot.   Again, this is why we needed to go through regular order on the  various bills stitched together in the underlying bill. The committees  need to have an opportunity to vet bills, including amendments such as  these, before they come to the floor of the House. That is how we  ensure good bills are passed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, every time Chairman Schiff rises to speak on  a bill about intelligence and security and holding the President  accountable, I get excited, hoping that we are going to hear about that  evidence of collusion and all the other investigations that were  conducted in this House over the past year.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    I think everyone is aware of every bit of information that  you all have tried to peddle over the past 4 years.    I think we see every day. Facebook just announced that  Russia was trying to do a Facebook campaign in Ukraine, if I remember  reading that correctly.   Mr. Schiff, would you yield to a question from me?    Would you yield to a question?    I think it is great. Are you aware of President Biden's  son Hunter's art dealings?    Are you aware of the President's son's dealings in Congo  with the cobalt mine? Are you aware of the dealings in Ukraine?    I think that everyone has seen all the information, again,  that you all have peddled. I am curious if you would like to take a  wager on which President's child, which President's son, at the end of  the day, once we have the gavel, will be the greatest security risk to  our Nation, Hunter Biden or--    I reclaim my time. They spent a lot of time, a lot of  time, a lot of effort, a lot of tax dollars on trying to peddle a lot  of wrongdoing in the previous administration.   This bill is all about the previous administration. Every speaker on  their side of the aisle has mentioned Donald Trump's name numerous  times, every speaker. It is time for the majority party to focus on  governing and get over their obsession with Donald Trump.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
