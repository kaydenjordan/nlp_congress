 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Space for yielding me time.    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition  Authorization Act of 2017 provides bipartisan and bicameral guidance  for NASA as we usher in a new era of space exploration.   I support this bill and the direction it establishes for America's  space program. S. 442, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on  February 17, includes almost all of the policy provisions from the  House authorization bills that passed the House in the last Congress  with broad bipartisan support. In fact, it authorizes the House's  proposed fiscal year 2017 funding level of $19.5 billion.   This bill provides a balanced NASA portfolio across all of the  mission directorates. It maintains congressional direction for priority  near-term programs, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, the Space  Launch System, the Orion crew vehicle, the International Space Station,  and the Commercial Crew and Cargo Programs.   NASA's exploration projects are vulnerable to changes in the  political landscape. We must have a flexible space program, but not one  that is knocked off course. Successfully combining flexibility with  constancy of purpose requires thoughtful planning.   This bill directs NASA to create a roadmap for human exploration. An  exploration roadmap will help NASA inform Congress and the President,  as well as direct the future path and tempo of exploration for decades  to come.   This legislation also looks to the future of scientific exploration.  It provides support for NASA's Mars 2020 rover, the Wide Field Infrared  Survey Telescope, and a mission to Europa, Jupiter's icy moon that  possibly harbors the building blocks of life. It establishes that one  of NASA's fundamental objectives is ``the search for life's origin,  evolution, distribution, and future in the universe.''   Toward that end, this legislation directs the NASA Administrator to  develop both an exoplanet exploration strategy and an astrobiology  strategy within 18 months after the bill is signed into law. It also  directs the NASA Administrator to report on how the Administration can  expand collaborative partnerships for these scientific endeavors.   Just 2 weeks ago, NASA announced that it had confirmed the existence  of  [[Page H1570]]  seven planets around a nearby star, three of which are in the  ``habitable zone.'' This bill builds upon these awe-inspiring  discoveries and will help ``unlock the mysteries of space,'' as  President Trump said in his inaugural address.   Part of achieving success in space exploration is making sure that  NASA is not burdened with funding other agency missions. For example,  there are 17 agencies with responsibility for studying climate change,  but only 1 agency, NASA, is responsible for space exploration. This  bill directs the NASA Administrator to seek reimbursement whenever  responsibilities are transferred to NASA from another agency or when  NASA funds another agency's activities.   Finally, I would like to thank my colleague and Texas friend Dr.  Brian Babin, the chairman of the Space Subcommittee, for his work on  the TREAT Astronauts Act, which is included in this authorization.  Chairman Babin's legislation gives NASA the ability to care for our  astronauts and enhance our understanding of the effects of spaceflight  on the human body.   I would also like to thank the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee staff for their years of effort on this bill, especially the  Space Subcommittee director, Tom Hammond, who has worked diligently to  ensure that this bill became a reality. I also recognize the minority  staff who were essential to the process as well.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, from Investor's Business Daily:  ``The mainstream media's open hostility to President Trump may be  starting to backfire, according to the latest IBD/TIPP poll. The poll  found that 55 percent of the public says they have grown `weary from  the media's persistently negative coverage of President Trump.' A  roughly equal share, 54 percent, also believe that the news media `has  assumed the role of the opposition party, constantly opposing the  president and his policies at every turn.'''   ``The results are understandable, given the unusually hostile  relationship the press has with Trump.   ``A study by the nonpartisan group Media Tenor found that only 3  percent of network news stories in the first month of the Trump  administration could be described as positive.''   ``The poll found that 57 percent back Trump's plan to hire 10,000  more immigration agents; 58 percent support the deportation of illegal  immigrants charged with a crime, even if they haven't been convicted;  and 53 percent back Trump's call to withhold federal aid to `sanctuary  cities.'''   ``Meanwhile, 42 percent say Trump is providing strong leadership for  the country, which is higher than the 40 percent Obama got last  October.''                            ____________________
