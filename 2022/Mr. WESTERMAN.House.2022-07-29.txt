 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I am glad we are finally here on the floor today talking  about an issue that is important to our whole country. I appreciate the  gentleman from Colorado and his concerns about wildfires. I wish that  we could work together on actually solving these issues in a manner and  with policy that would actually do something.   I learned in engineering school that expending effort is not work.  For example, you can push on a boulder all day, but until something  moves, no work has been accomplished.   To put it another way, there is a saying that you should never  confuse motion with action, which is exactly what the legislation  before us today does. This bill is more than 550 pages yet does  absolutely nothing to prevent wildfires or significantly improve our  resiliency to drought.   This bill will actually make our wildfire crisis worse. Perhaps that  is why my Democrat colleagues named it the Wildfire Response Act,  instead of naming it the wildfire prevention act, which is what we  should be focusing on because we will have to respond to all the  wildfires that are going to happen anyway and the new ones that this  bill creates.   Here is a little bit of forestry 101. There are two ways to reduce  wildfire risk: thinning and controlled burning. This bill mentions  thinning zero times. Not once does it mention thinning, but it mentions  environmental justice 165 times. That should tell you what this bill is  really about.   Instead of streamlining environmental regulations and addressing  frivolous litigation, which delay vital forest management projects  across the country, this bill would add mountains of new red tape on  our Federal agencies that will grind their already glacial pace of  treatments to a complete halt.                                time  1145    It would throw out the Forest Service's 10-year strategy to reduce  hazardous fuels and make them completely redo this work less than 6  months after they started implementing their current strategy.   This makes you wonder if congressional Democrats disagree with the  work of the Biden administration or if they have found the  administration's work product is deficient and unreliable.   It would lock up 58 million acres of land into new roadless areas,  despite research showing that more than half of all fires, including  most of the largest fires on Western U.S. national forest lands, burn  primarily in roadless areas, areas where land use restrictions mean  that we can't thin and can't do management.   Instead, the bill would fund environmental volunteerism and provide  N-95 masks and smoke inhalation equipment for homes, which I am sure  will be of little comfort to people as their homes are burning to the  ground.   Democrats will tell you this legislation raises wildland firefighter  pay to $20 per hour. The only problem with that is that firefighters  already make at least $20 per hour, meaning this so-called raise is an  empty promise.   In the long term, the bill would write a check that it can't cash by  setting up this new minimum pay rate with no actual money to back it  up. The Forest Service has told us this means they would have to lay  off over 610 wildland firefighters. Let me say that again: The  Democrats' bill could result in the firing of more than 610 wildland  firefighters who are putting their lives on the line to protect  communities. This is a disgrace and will hurt our fire preparedness and  response.   As if that weren't enough, the bill would create new pay disparities  by leaving out 10,000 brave men and women fighting fires from receiving  new benefits. That is roughly 40 percent of the Federal firefighting  workforce.   Some of my Western colleagues will soon speak about the water  provisions in this bill, but I want to say that the bill misses the  mark on drought as well by proposing $4 billion in new authorizations  and has unlimited mandatory spending.   Once again, the other side of the aisle is passing on more debt to  our future generations, and we see what uncontrolled spending has done  to our economy with inflation, high energy prices, high food prices,  and, really, higher prices across the board.   According to conventional economics, we have had two quarters of  economic decline, and we are in a recession. Why would we want to put  more government funding and debt on our constituents? I do not  understand.   It would also devote some of these dollars to studies, research, and  environmental water restoration projects that will not provide any  water in the near term.   It picks winners and losers in water projects, ignoring the need for  expanded water storage reservoirs, the kind of infrastructure  investment that has made the West what it is today and is necessary to  ensure a drought-resilient future.   This bill offers a one-dimensional approach to solving the Western  drought that has impacted the entire country through decreased  agricultural production. Reservoirs operated by the Bureau of  Reclamation provide needed water to 10 million acres of farmland that  collectively grow 60 percent of the Nation's vegetables and one quarter  of our fresh fruit and nut crops.   By throwing money at an issue and not recognizing that regulatory  streamlining to expand water storage and efficiency of operations to  promote drought resiliency should be part of this equation, this bill  fails not only the West but everyone who buys food nationwide. Put  another way, this bill fails every American household. This is bad  policy and bad process.   Democrats cobbled together this 550-plus-page bill behind closed  doors, and not one wildfire provision was marked up in the Committee on  Natural Resources.   Republican Members made real attempts to provide alternatives and  additions to this bill. Dozens of regulatory streamlining amendments  that could have helped provide water or immediately prevented wildfires  were submitted to the Rules Committee by Republicans, only to be  ignored. Even the majority of bipartisan amendments were rejected.   This is an abomination of process, but it is nothing new that we are  seeing on this House floor. If you were here last night, you know that  a Senate NEPA streamlining bill was parachuted in at the last minute.  It was put on the suspension calendar.   I hope this bill passes during the next voting series, but we should  be doing NEPA revisions through hearings, through markups, and through  regular order. If it takes getting one dropped in on the suspension  calendar by the Senate, I guess we will have to take what we have got.  But it would be nice if we could actually debate these and come up with  more NEPA streamlining.   In the midst of historic drought conditions and what is on track to  be the most devastating wildfire season on record, we simply cannot  afford to confuse motion with action.   Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to reject this partisan package and, instead, work together on real  solutions to prevent wildfires.  [[Page H7421]]    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just want to point out those weren't my words. That was the  information we got from the U.S. Forest Service that said there is no  funding in this bill. If this bill passes without additional funding in  the future, they will have to lay off 610 wildland firefighters.   Maybe there is going to be a bill in the future to pour more money  into the Forest Service, but this bill doesn't do it.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson), the ranking member of the Committee on Agriculture.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I know there is a lot of talk about the IIJA and what a great bill it  was. It was the largest infrastructure bill passed in the history of  the world. It was so important that it never even went through a  committee here in the House. It came right to the House floor, and it  seems like all we are doing is fixing it. We have a suspension bill we  will be voting on later that fixes a problem that was in the IIJA.   I am confused why my colleague is pushing this bill that would undo  much of the core work in the IIJA, including the $170 million that  would go to his district under the current 10-year strategy.   I think it is another example of why we have to do regular order and  why we have to bring these bills to committee.                                time  1200    We want to solve these problems, but you have to have real solutions  to solve a problem. There are examples of how we can do bipartisan work  to fix forestry.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), who is working on bipartisan forestry legislation.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Chair, many of the water and power users in the  Colorado basin were not consulted on this $500 million Colorado River  provision and don't even know what it would be used for. That is  another reason why we should actually work on these issues in committee  and have a bipartisan markup.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Rosendale).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Obernolte).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Bentz).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Madam Chair, I know the distinguished gentleman, Mr.  Hoyer, has left the Chamber, but I did want to personally thank him for  putting the Senate NEPA streamlining bill on the suspension calendar  today. I hope we can work on more issues like that in the future.   Madam Chair, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Valadao).    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining on  both sides.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   A poet named Joyce Kilmer wrote his most famous poem called  ``Trees,'' and it begins with, ``I think that I shall never see a poem  as lovely as a tree.''   Trees and forests are poetic. They tug at our heartstrings. They  evoke emotion. And I sincerely appreciate the emotion that my  colleagues across the aisle have. I really believe we want to get to  the same place of having healthy trees and healthy forests.   It was that that motivated me to go to forestry school and study  forestry. Little did I know that I would have the honor and the huge  responsibility of standing on the floor of this august body and  speaking for the trees.   We want to do the right thing. We know how to do the right thing. We  know how to take care of these trees and take care of these forests.   Unfortunately, what is in this bill doesn't do that. What is in this  bill doesn't help the water situation. We should not pass this bill.   Let's work together, come up with real solutions, pass them out of  this House, and get them signed into law to help our forests, our  firefighters, and our drought conditions.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), I offer amendment No. 1.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.   Madam Chair, Leader McCarthy's amendment presents a commonsense  solution. As he knows all too well from his efforts resolving water  issues, communities in California and elsewhere in the West are running  out of water for families, farms, communities, and many other needs  thanks to natural and manmade drought.   This has a dramatic impact not only to those areas, but it negatively  impacts food production which affects every one of us. In the case of  some California communities, wells that are used to provide drinking  water have or will run dry.   This amendment seeks to provide some relief to rural communities  through the creation of a new grant program aimed at constructing new  wells and waterlines designed to deliver drinking water to these  communities. I thank Leader McCarthy for introducing this amendment and  for his longstanding leadership on bringing balance back to western  water policies.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's kind words  about the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Conway).    Madam Chair, this is a commonsense, good amendment  that the leader has offered. I urge its adoption, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to Schrier amendment No. 2 which  would fund additional research for post-fire weather assessments.   This amendment suffers from the same shortcomings as the underlying  package because it is overly focused on wildfire response rather than  even making an attempt at wildfire prevention.   We know what is causing catastrophic wildfires, and it is not a lack  of government agencies studying wildfires, tracking weather, and  producing additional reports. Our forests are burning now, and we need  to focus on real solutions; namely, accelerating, thinning, and  prescribed burning. Adding more duplicative bureaucracy and unnecessary  research will do nothing to stop our forests from going up in flames  year after year.   Madam Chair, the forests really don't care what we say in this body.  They are out there doing what Teddy Roosevelt said they do. They are  the lungs of the Earth. They breathe in the carbon dioxide and they  breathe out oxygen. We produce a lot of carbon dioxide in this Chamber,  but it is not doing anything to help our forests.                                time  1315    Frankly, it is unserious that, out of the dozens of substantive  wildfire amendments that were offered to the Rules Committee, this is  the only one that was made in order. The Rules Committee even rejected  bipartisan amendments such as the bipartisan Save Our Sequoias Act. We  have lost 20 percent of the world's giant sequoias in the last 2 years,  and perhaps the most famous giant sequoia grove, the Mariposa Grove in  Yosemite National Park, was on fire earlier this month.   What saved that grove? It wasn't weather assessments. It was  proactive treatments from land managers that we need to use as a model  across all 76 giant sequoia groves.   Unfortunately, the underlying bill and amendment before us would do  nothing to help protect our giant sequoias or move the needle on the  wildfire crisis at all.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, more and more of or forests are going up  in flames. More forests are being categorized as subject to  catastrophic wildfire.   We are losing this fight. We need a new game plan. We need work on  this in a bipartisan manner. There are a lot of areas that need to be  addressed, but this bill, and this amendment doesn't address those.   I urge opposition to the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment, even though I might not necessarily oppose it.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I support this amendment and appreciate the solution it  presents for a pressing problem. Currently, the Small Business  Administration only requires collateral for disaster loans if the loan  amount is above $25,000. This authority is set to sunset in November,  and the minimum amount will revert to $14,000. This amendment would  permanently lock in the amount at $25,000.   I thank the ranking member of the Select Committee on the Climate  Crisis, Garret Graves, for his leadership on disaster issues. His home  State of Louisiana has suffered through many disasters, and he has been  an unwavering champion for his constituents.   And it is a good thing he is leading on this issue. Affordable  disaster loans could be in high demand because the underlying bill does  nothing to protect the landscape, people, or property from devastating  wildfires. I would like to emphasize, the underlying bill would only  respond to wildfires, not work to prevent them.   Throughout this debate, my colleagues have tried to claim that this  is not the case and that their bill will actually support increased  forest management practices like thinning and prescribed burning.   But look no further than their own one-pager, which says derisively:  ``We can't simply cut our way out of wildfire risk.'' This should tell  you everything you need to know about how they feel about scientific  forest management.   The truth is that thinning is not only an essential tool to reduce  wildfire risk, but there is a scientific consensus that we must  increase thinning in our forests to turn the tide of this crisis.   The fact that this bill mentions thinning zero times is no mistake.  It is because Democrats refuse to agree with the scientific consensus  that both thinning and prescribed burning are essential tools to reduce  wildfire risk.    Affordable disaster loans provided by this amendment will also be  necessary because of the wildfires that will occur as a result of  throwing out the Forest Service's current 10-year strategy.   My colleagues have claimed that their bill would simply codify this  current 10-year strategy. They have also said that the infrastructure  bill made historic investments in that strategy and have funded its  initial projects.   This simply makes no sense. My colleagues think the infrastructure  bill is so nice that they want to pass it twice, but that is not how  any of this works. If we funded a project in the infrastructure bill,  we don't need to authorize funding for it here because that money has  already gone out the door.   And if the administration released a strategy 6 months ago and  started implementing it, they don't need this bill to codify it.   Truth be told, the plain reading of the text shows that the current  wildfire strategy is getting thrown out the window, and nothing in this  text codifies it or even mentions the projects currently happening.   Unfortunately, if this bill passes, a lot of small business owners  will be able to make good use of affordable disaster loans provided by  this amendment as they recover their businesses from the impacts of  catastrophic wildfire. The least we can do is help them with disaster  loans after these fires inevitably occur.   Madam Chair, I support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, again, I support the amendment. It is  going to be needed as these fires continue to rage, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
