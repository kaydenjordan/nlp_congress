 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  2954, the Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2021, which will make  various changes with respect to employer-sponsored retirement plans,  including providing for the automatic enrollment of employees in  certain plans and increasing the age at which participants are required  to begin receiving mandatory distributions.  [[Page H3950]]    This legislation expands opportunities for Americans to increase  their retirement savings, improves workers' long-term financial  wellbeing, and builds on the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement  Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019.   The purpose of this legislation is to expand automatic enrollment,  simplify many retirement plan rules, and strengthen small businesses'  ability to offer workplace retirement plans.   Among other things, H.R. 2954 would:   Expand automatic enrollment of workers in employer-sponsored  retirement saving plans.   Employees would be automatically enrolled in plans such as 401(k)s  and 403(b)s unless they opt out.   The initial automatic enrollment amount is at least 3 percent but no  more than 10 percent. And then each year that amount is increased by 1  percent until it reaches 10 percent.   The age at which seniors must take required minimum distributions  (RMDs) from their retirement savings accounts would be raised from 72  to 73. The bill subsequently would raise the age to 74 starting in 2029  and to 75 starting in 2032.   Reduce the penalty for failure to take RMDs to 25 percent from 50  percent. If this failure is corrected in a timely manner, as defined by  the bill, the penalty would be further reduced to 10 percent.   Increase the limits on so-called catch-up contributions for employees  ages 62 to 64. In 2021, these workers were allowed to contribute up to  $6,500 to their retirement savings plans beyond the otherwise  applicable limits. This bill would increase that amount to $10,000 and  index it to inflation.   The catch-up contribution limit for individual retirement accounts  would be indexed to inflation. Currently, savers ages 50 and up may  contribute an additional $1,000 annually to their IRAs, but that limit  isn't indexed to inflation.   Allow employers to match a worker's student loan payment by making an  equivalent contribution to that worker's retirement savings plan.   This provision is intended to help workers who can't afford to save  for retirement because of high student-loan debt, which causes them to  miss out on their employers' matching contributions to retirement  savings plans.   Today's workplace is more generationally diverse than ever.   Older employees are working longer, and millennials make up roughly a  third of the American workforce. This bill helps both older and younger  workers.   For younger workers, this can help jump start the saving process  earlier by making employer matches available for those who are also  paying off student loans.   For older workers nearing retirement, they would have more time to  save, due to the increased catch-up contribution limits and delayed  required minimum distributions (RMD).   By automatically enrolling every working person in a plan, with the  option to opt out, we begin to solve the biggest reasons people don't  save for retirement.   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the three biggest reasons people  do not save for retirement are: not having a plan at work (74 percent  of non-savers), being self-employed (14 percent) and not being included  in a workplace plan (12 percent).   These proposed changes are beneficial to Americans of all ages,  helping them reach their savings goals and provide more flexibility  upon retirement.   Though there are many paths to retirement, it's critical to be  financially prepared, especially as people are living longer.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R.  2954 because we need to ensure that every American can benefit from the  best retirement plan for them.    Madam Speaker, I rise to applaud two legislative  initiatives that passed this week. One in particular was the COVID-19  American History Project Act.   With over almost a million Americans who died from COVID-19, the  historic stories, the stories of tragedy and joy of the many  hardworking medical professionals, like those in my particular  congressional district, like Dr. Peter Hotez, who discovered an  unbelievable vaccine that is now being used in developing nations, Dr.  Joseph Varon, Dr. Joe Gathe, and many, many others; hospitals far and  wide; nurses and medical professionals, who had to take care of people  who were lying in hospital hallways; and families who lost one and two  and three and four. We must tell the COVID-19 story.   It is an American story. We must tell of the heroes. We must tell of  those we lost. We must say thank you.   But one thing we must do, as the chair of the bipartisan COVID-19  Task Force, we must never, never repeat this again. We must be  prepared, and we should be ready to save lives. There is nothing wrong  with testing and vaccinating.                            ____________________
