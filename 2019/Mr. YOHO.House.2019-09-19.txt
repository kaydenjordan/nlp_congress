 Madam Speaker, on September 30, 2019, northeast Florida  will help Winton Carter celebrate his 100th birthday.   The year Mr. Carter was born, World War I formally ended with the  Treaty of Versailles, alcohol was officially illegal with the formal  start of Prohibition, and Boston's Babe Ruth was traded to the New York  Yankees at the end of the season.   Even more amazing is the life Mr. Carter has led serving our country.   Mr. Carter received a Purple Heart after being wounded by shrapnel in  his thigh while under continuous fire, fighting the Japanese on the  island of Saipan in World War II. He was there for the famous raising  of the American flag on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. Mr. Carter  also later fought in the Korean war.   After 22 years in the military, he retired as a Marine master  sergeant and served a total of 40 years in government service, which  included recruiting future Marine heroes.   Mr. Carter is a widower, having celebrated 60 years of marriage to  his wife, Norma Jean. He is the father of two, and he loves to talk  about the Lord.   Therefore, it is on this day, September 19, that I proudly  acknowledge Mr. Winton W. Carter on the House floor, and I ask you to  join me in wishing him an early happy birthday.                  Observing National POW/MIA Recognition Day     Madam Speaker, I would like to take this time to honor  those who were prisoners of war and those who remain missing in action,  as well as their families, in observance of National POW/MIA  Recognition Day.   We are forever indebted to those who sacrificed everything so that we  may enjoy the freedoms granted to us by the Constitution.   ``You are not forgotten.'' This is a central phrase of National POW/ MIA Recognition Day. It is our job as a nation to stand behind those  who are currently serving, those who have served, and those who have  never returned from service who gave the ultimate sacrifice.   Through international relationships, many of those who have fallen  have been returned back to our country and to their families, and we  will continue to do the search and return our MIA soldiers. It is our  responsibility as a nation to never forget or quit searching for the  men and women who paid that ultimate price. We must continue to honor  them in the years to come.                    Honoring First Responder John Lankenau     Madam Speaker, I would like to take this time to honor one  of my constituents, John Lankenau.   As the anniversary of 9/11 just passed, we must always remember those  who we have lost and honor the heroes who sacrificed their lives for  others.   On September 11, 2001, Mr. Lankenau was assigned as a hazardous  material specialist in Albany, New York. On that tragic day, as the  second plane flew into the towers, Mr. Lankenau was requested to  respond to New York City to assist first responders at Ground Zero.   Upon arrival, Mr. Lankenau was requested by name to conduct the first  hazard surveys of Ground Zero. He worked until early morning, taking  air and soil samples on the wreckage site.   Mr. Lankenau remembered how dangerous it was, maneuvering through the  wreckage and fearing that there was a possibility that one of the  adjacent buildings could collapse, causing more fatalities.   He spent the next couple of weeks going back and forth from home,  continuing to assess the hazards and the conditions at Ground Zero.   It is my greatest pleasure to represent men like Mr. John Lankenau in  the United States Congress. I commend him and the rest of the first  responders on 9/11 for their character, their courage, and their  commitment to serving others. I thank them, these true heroes, for  their service.             Congratulating University of Florida on Its Ranking     Madam Speaker, I would like to highlight my alma mater, the  University of Florida, which I represent in Florida's District Three.   The University of Florida, under the guidance of its president, Dr.  Kent Fuchs, has again risen in the U.S. News and World Report rankings  to number seven among all public universities in the United States.  This is the third year in the row the University of Florida has  advanced in that ranking.   The University of Florida incorporates all health disciplines, is one  of the largest engineering schools in the country, and has a top-rated  veterinarian school, which I graduated from in 1983.    It is just one of the few schools in the Nation to have won major  sports team national championships and titles in football, basketball,  and baseball.   I guess that is why it is great to be a Florida Gator.   Madam Speaker, I would like to talk about another crisis that has not  been dealt with on this House floor, and that crisis is the immigration  crisis we have.   We hear a lot about the climate crisis. Crises are the things that  are happening right now that we must respond to. But so many of the  things that we face in Congress are issues that may be a crisis for  some along the border, or some who are being advanced by people coming  into the country illegally, but if Congress were to act, these crises  would go away.   There is time to deal with climate change, and there is time to deal  with the crisis on the border, but we must act.   I have a photo here from June 2014, when my colleagues on the other  side said there was a crisis, and it was under President Barack Obama.  This is still going on at the border. I look at these people, and they  look like people who want opportunity. They are coming to this country.   I have this other photo, and there are families, women, children,  husbands. They look like people who are wanting to come into this  country for opportunity.   Congress has failed, and it has not just failed this Nation, but it  failed these people in the policies that we don't have because of  political divide.   We talk about how we want to fix the crisis on climate change, but we  don't come together on that. We want to talk about the immigration  crisis, but we don't come together on it because it becomes a wedge and  a tool that people use in politics for the next election.   They say, well, they are against that, and that is why you have to  vote me back in.   That happens on immigration. That is why immigration doesn't get  fixed. I am convinced of that.                                time  1900    So we have proposed a guest worker program that will solve probably  about 90 percent, what our estimates are, of the people who are coming  across our southwest border.   I think we are all in agreement that the people coming across our  southwest border are not the rocket scientists; they are not the  engineers; they are not the health professionals. They are the people  who are working in the lower skills--agriculture, hospitality, and  construction--but yet they are so needed in this country because,  without them, this country won't work. We can't grow the fruits and  vegetables, and we can't build the buildings.   So what we have proposed is a guest worker program. If you would  picture a banner, Madam Speaker, ``Guest Worker Program.''   And understand, it is not immigration reform, because  ``immigration,'' if we use that word up here, they part.  [[Page H7825]]  This side blames the Republicans of wanting to deport everybody. On my  side, we will say this side wants to give everybody amnesty. Neither is  true. So they walk away and nothing gets done. We have seen this year  after year for 36 years.   So the banner bill will say, ``Guest Worker Program.'' It will have  three silos: One will be agriculture, which is the one I am heading;  one will have hospitality; and one will have construction.   I will talk about the agriculture program.   The way this works is it does three things: It creates a prescreened  pool before people come into the country, which is number one. Number  two is it addresses the people who are already here illegally. Number  three, it reforms the H-2A program, which is a temporary seasonal  program of 10 months, and it makes it stronger so it serves our  producers better, but it also protects the migrant worker.   This is something that should not be a partisan issue. This is  something that I have shared personally in this Chamber with over 50  Members of the House of Representatives in a bipartisan way; I have  shared it on the Senate side in a bipartisan way; and we have shared it  with outside industries around the country. In fact, I am getting calls  from people from Wisconsin, from Indiana, from Pennsylvania, and from  California who want this bill passed.   Basically, what this does, briefly, is, on the H-2A program, which is  a temporary worker visa program--for 10 months, it is supposed to be.  The way the program works now is somebody will come in on an H-2A  program for temporary work. They will get a waiver, and that waiver  will be for 1 year. Then they can get another waiver up to 3 years.   What we have seen is people just kind of fade off the grid, and they  wind up being in America illegally. They may have come in legally, but  then they transfer and become a person here illegally. Then they live  in the shadows, and they are afraid to come out for fear of  deportation.   The other thing is they come in on an H-2A visa currently, and they  may leave the agriculture permit that they came in on and work  construction and get hired by construction. Or they may go into another  field, and so the permit that allowed them to come in, they don't  honor.   So with our program, we tighten up the restrictions on H-2A. People  come in on a guest worker H-2A visa that dedicates them to the sector  of agriculture, and they are dedicated to be in that sector because  that is what they have agreed to come in on. They can stay up to 11  months is what we are proposing, then they go back home, and then they  can come back.   The other thing we do is the prescreening portion of this bill works  this way:   We will have a country-to-country agreement between, say, the country  of Honduras and the United States. It is a state-to-State Department  agreement. So, if a person from Honduras or anywhere in Central America  wants to come to the United States, they apply. They must be a minimum  of 18 years of age. They have to apply individually. If they are  married and the spouse wants to come in, that spouse applies, but they  have to be a minimum of 18, no children.   They apply. That information from the country they come from goes to  our State Department, and it would be basically passport information:  their name, their address, age, and things like that. Our DHS will take  that information. They will do a background check. Once they clear the  background check, that person who applied as an applicant, they are  permitted to come into the country, but only after a job is available.   When a person applies, they can apply to a sector. Maybe it is dairy;  maybe it is fruits and vegetables; or maybe it is a citrus program.  Once they get accepted into the country and a job is available, they  get issued what we call a GWIC card, which is short for ``guest worker  identification card,'' and it will look like any other kind of  identification. It will have smart card or smart chip technology. It  will have the individual's picture on it.   Once a person gets this card, they are permitted to be in the country  for a 5-year period of time. For 5 years they can stay in this country,  and they can renew 4\1/2\ years into the program. After that, they can  continually do that, provided they stay a person of good standing in  the Nation.   They can get a driver's license number. It will be a guest worker  driver's license number that has to be renewed every 5 years. It will  start off in the State they get approved in and when they pass the  test. But that will allow them to drive in the country legally.   It gives them a chance to come into the country legally, whether they  want to be a temporary worker or a 5-year, year-round worker.   We have a restriction in there that they have to commit to work 75  percent of the year in the agriculture sector, on the guest worker  program for agriculture. That person has taken on the responsibility  and commitment that they will work in ag, and ag only.   On both programs with the H-2A or the 5-year guest worker program,  that individual is automatically entered into the E-Verify system. So  when our employers take somebody out of the pool, they are  automatically using E-Verify.    That person, again, is free to travel the country. If they come in,  say they want to do citrus in Florida, that season is over usually by  mid-June. They can go to North Carolina and work with another crop, or  maybe the State of Washington or New York, and they can stay  indefinitely in the country for that 5-year period of time. But they  must work a minimum 75 percent of the year in the United States in  agriculture.   If they choose to leave agriculture and work in construction and they  get picked up or found out and they get hired illegally by a  contractor, what happens is they have broken the terms of their  agreement, and they will be deported for that.   That identification number will be a 15-digit identification number  with the initials ``AG'' at the end of it for agriculture. So that  person, when they are put into the E-Verify system, if they are hired  by an ag employer, those have to jibe. If that person tries to go to  construction, then his number won't work in a construction entity.   If an employer tries to hire somebody illegally who is permitted to  work in agriculture and they want to hire them in construction, then  they are subject to a $2,500 fine per person per incident.   This is something that we hear over and over again from our producers  and our contractors in the hospitality industry. They need a guest  worker program, and our goal for this was to create a reliable, a  predictable, and a certain workforce for the labor of this country.   The second part of the 5-year program is this: For the people who are  in the country illegally, they can apply to this program. What we have  done is we have moved ag labor from the Department of Labor to the  USDA.   So for that group of people who are in this country illegally, they  can apply to this program. The program will be run by the United States  Department of Agriculture, and they will run a program that says: For  this time period, if you are here illegally and you want to apply to  this program, then you can apply with the understanding that we are not  looking to deport you. We are looking to get you to a legal status in  this country for 5 years at a time.   While that person is applying, he is what we call the applicant.  During that process, they are protected from being deported. Background  checks will be run.   We realize that some people are going to have fender benders. They  may not have shown up for a court date or didn't return a library book.  We understand that, and they will be given due time to get right with  the law and clear up their past.   When they get accepted into the program, they become a participant.  During that time period as a participant, they are here for 5 years at  a time and can renew 4\1/2\ years into it. They get the GWIC card, and  they get the 15-digit identification number that dedicates them to work  in the ag center. They are not dedicated to a certain employer, and  they can renew 4\1/2\ years into it.   If they came in illegally with a family, their family is also  protected during that period of time when a background check is being  done. Once that  [[Page H7826]]  is cleared up, that family is protected for up to 5 years at a time.  Again, when they renew, that family is protected.   It is not a pathway to citizenship. If somebody wants to become a  citizen, then they apply for citizenship just like anybody else who  wants to become a citizen of our great Nation.   In this program, again, what we are looking for is to create a  reliable and predictable workforce for our agriculture sector, and it  gives the flexibility of the individual to move around the country to  fulfill the needs that migrant worker has.   We did a roundtable throughout the State of Florida over the August  recess. We stopped at 10 different areas in my State. Florida is a  large agriculture State. People think of it as beaches and palm trees,  but we are also the number one producer of sweet corn in the country,  number one in watermelons, number one in citrus in the Nation, and we  have over 300 specialty crops. So we are very heavily dependent on  migrant labor.   As we traveled around our State, we got a tremendous amount of  feedback from all the different sectors. We sat down with the migrant  help workforce.   I am a veterinarian by trade, and I worked with horses and cattle. I  have been around agriculture since I was 15. I have talked to the  migrant. I have talked to the people. I found out by asking them: Did  you come here legally or illegally?   They would tell you because we had a great relationship. They would  say: I came here illegally.   You can ask them: Do you want to become a citizen?   Some do, some don't. Most of them just want the opportunity to come  here and work.   When we were in south Florida going through talking to some of the  producers, they were saying people from Honduras can come here and work  a season, maybe 5 months. The amount of money they make in 5 months is  equivalent to 5 years in that nation.   I saw this as a way that we can fulfill the needs of our producers  and fulfill the needs of food security for this Nation but also fulfill  the needs of that worker who wants to come here for a better life, and  they have the opportunity to become a citizen if they go through the  normal channels.   The other thing this does, and I didn't mention this, is there is a  $2,500 fee for that 5-year permit, which breaks down to $500 a year.   For the person who came in illegally, the first time they apply and  get accepted into this program and become a participant, there will be  the $2,500 fee for the permit, but there will also be a $2,500 fine  because they have agreed that they have broken the law coming in. That  puts that argument to rest of, well, they broke our law. These people  realize that. They acknowledge it. They paid the fine, and we can move  forward.   I thought it was interesting, when we went down and did our tour  around the State, that the producers said: You know, it comes down to  this. This Nation will either import their food, or they are going to  import their labor.    This is a national security issue. I look at these workers--I have  worked with so many of these people over the course of the years, over  the last 30 years, and they are great people. My heart goes out to them  because I know they want a better future. I know they want to live an  American Dream--maybe not in this country, but maybe the Honduran  dream. If a person can work 5 months here and have the equivalent of 5  years' pay in their home country, it can change lives, and it will  develop an economy down there.   So what I ask our Members of Congress to do is get this information.  They can go to our website, yoho.house.gov. They can go to the  legislation tab and click on that. That will have a drop-down screen,  and there will be the ag guest worker program. We have two short videos  on that that explain this program. We have a 10-page white paper that  explains this program. We have a bill that is already written--it is  right at 110 pages--that we look to introduce.   This is not a solution to immigration. It is a solution to the  workforce challenges we have in this Nation in agriculture,  hospitality, and construction.   By doing this and coming to agreement on border security and  enforcing the laws already on the books and by giving people a legal  portal to come into this country legally--they are prescreened before  they come in--and by allowing people who are in this country illegally  to become legal, we have solved a big crisis that this body has been  unable to fulfill, and we honor the American people. It causes more  division in this Nation, more division in this House, and it just  grinds the wheels of progress for this Nation to an end.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
