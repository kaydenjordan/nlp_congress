 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate both the boys and girls high school basketball teams from  the Covenant School in Huntington, West Virginia.   The boys high school basketball team took home the national  championship in their division and finished their season with an 11- game winning streak.   The girls high school basketball team came in second place in their  division nationally.   Athletics play a huge role in ensuring that our next generation is  well-rounded, able to work as a team, and are equipped to tackle  challenges ahead.   I applaud the Covenant School for instilling these very important  values in our student athletes.   West Virginia is so proud of the Covenant School's basketball teams.                            ____________________
