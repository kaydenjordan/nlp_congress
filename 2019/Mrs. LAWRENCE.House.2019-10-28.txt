 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here and to have the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) sitting in that seat.   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Scott, and I want to  start by thanking our chairwoman, Maxine Waters, for bringing this  legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2423, the Women's  Suffrage Centennial Commemorative Coin Act introduced by my colleague,  Ms. Stefanik, and myself.   As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues  and the co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, I strongly support  this measure which honors the legacy of suffragists who played a vital  role in rallying support for the 19th Amendment to the Constitution of  the United States.   The suffragists began their organized fight for women's empowerment  in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York. They were tireless and never gave up  the fight. For 72 years, the women leaders lobbied, marched, picketed,  and protested for the right to the ballot.   More importantly, proceeds from the sales of these coins will support  the Smithsonian Institution's American Women's History Initiative for  the purpose of collecting, studying, and establishing programs  recognizing diverse perspectives on women's history and women who have  influenced the direction of this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I like to always remind people that women are 51 percent  of the population in this great country, and we are now 106 strong  Members of the U.S. House of Representatives.   I also want to note that, on May 21 of this year, the House  celebrated its 100th anniversary of the House passage of the 19th  Amendment with the passage of H.R. 354, legislation I introduced and  which was supported by all women Members of Congress. The Senate  followed 2 weeks later, in June, with the passage of the Senate  resolution.   Today, over 68 million women participate in elections, which would  not be possible without the suffragists who  [[Page H8509]]  never gave up the fight for equal rights. Because of their hard work,  glass ceilings were broken and progress prevailed.   Mr. Speaker, I know that the gentleman stands today recognizing that  women are so important to the lives of so many in this country and to  our strong government and democracy. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, there are so many facts that we need to  share about John Conyers, including the fact that in his 52 years in  office he represented Michigan's First Congressional District,  Michigan's 14th Congressional District, and Michigan's 13th  Congressional District. Also during his time in Congress he chaired the  House Oversight and Reform Committee and also the House Judiciary  Committee and served as dean of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) who is  my amazing colleague and who will have comments about the passing and  honoring of our colleague whom we all are mourning, John Conyers, who  impacted so many of us in this country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lewis.   Some other facts that people may not know about John Conyers: He  worked for the Lincoln auto factory and was a member of the UAW. He  became the director of education for UAW Local 900. He was the first  African American to chair the House Committee on the Judiciary. He also  sponsored the Racial Justice Act and the Police Accountability Act  during that time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K.  Davis), a Member of Congress who has fought many fights and has stood  up and knows the story of justice in our country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. That was  beautiful.   We continue in our effort to capture the life of a great man who  served in this House.   Again, another fact: Since 1989, John Conyers had introduced H.R. 40,  the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act.  This bill would establish a commission to examine the institution of  slavery in the United States. The legislation has now been taken up by  our colleague from Texas, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans),  my colleague who has shown to be a voice of reason, hard work, and  compassion in his service to Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for mentioning so  many of the accomplishments that John Conyers had.   I want to add to that his legislative record extends to introducing  the Medicare for All Act, legislation to establish a government- sponsored single-payer healthcare option to control costs.  Additionally, he championed the issues of reparations to establish a  commission that I had mentioned earlier.   He fought for justice that also extended to international issues. He  was an early leader in the anti-Vietnam war movement in addition to the  anti-Iraq war movement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), my  colleague and a hardworking freshman. It is hard to recognize that he  is a freshman.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to read a statement by the  Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson about the Congressman.   She said: I pay tribute to the life and legacy of a distinguished  public servant and colleague, John James Conyers Jr., who passed away  this weekend, and she asked that her colleagues join her in extending  sympathies to Congressman Conyers' wife, Monica; Conyers' sons, John  Conyers III and Carl Edward Conyers; and all whom he influenced over  the course of his life. May he rest in peace.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring forth my Michigan delegation  colleague. It is significant to note that Rashida Tlaib, Congresswoman  Tlaib, actually represents the seat from which John Conyers retired.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan, Rashida Tlaib.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman as we share the  amazing honor of representing the city of Detroit, a place that John  Conyers loved and gave his life to.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to also read from a statement from our  chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Karen Bass. Her statement  outlines his life and his history.   It also talks about how he fought apartheid and that he confronted  President Nixon about imposing sanctions against South Africa; and,  when it became clear that the President wouldn't act, he joined  Congressman Dellums in introducing legislation to that end and was even  arrested at a protest, in front, of South Africa.   He impacted so many people in his district and throughout the  country. America is a better country today because of the legislative  and advocacy work of Representative John Conyers Jr.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring forth a chair of this amazing  body--a chair, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and an  amazing leader, Congressman Scott.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those kind  words and informative message.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to bring forth a woman in our  Congress, the longest serving woman in Congress, Marcy Kaptur, who  served with the dean of Congress and would like to reflect.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Cohen) for his remarks.    Mr. Speaker, as I wrap up now in our tribute to John  Conyers, the dean, he was many things: He was a UAW labor member; he  was a military veteran; he was a fighter for voters' rights, for  healthcare, for reparations, for racial justice. He was a lover and  promoter of jazz.   But most of all, I stand here today, as a Member of Congress  representing Michigan's 14th District. He was Detroit. He was Motown.  He was a person whose thumbprint will remain throughout history as a  political voice, a leader, and a beloved man in the history of our city  and of metro Detroit.   I want to say to the family, we send all the love and respect; and to  say, in closing, John Conyers, rest in power.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 56 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, October 29, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
