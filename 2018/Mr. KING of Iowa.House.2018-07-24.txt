 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on July 24, 2018,  due to delayed travel on account of inclement weather. Had I been  present, I would have voted as follows: ``Yes'' on rollcall No. 368,  ``Yes'' on rollcall No. 369, ``Yes'' on rollcall No. 370, and ``Yes''  on rollcall No. 371.                            ____________________
