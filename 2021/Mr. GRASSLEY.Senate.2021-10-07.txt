 Mr. President, I would like to address the Senate  Judiciary majority's Trump investigation examining the period from  December 14, 2020 through January 3, 2021.   The majority released their report this morning; the minority  released our report this morning.   This truncated investigation doesn't support the long-running  Democratic narrative that Trump used the Justice Department to try to  overturn the 2020 election. And it is truncated because we don't have  all the records and this committee only interviewed three witnesses.   The available evidence shows that President Trump didn't use the  Department of Justice to subvert the 2020 election. For example, one  witness testified that President Trump had no impact--I repeat, no  impact; and the words ``no impact'' come from that witness--on what the  Department did to investigate election allegations.   In fact, the evidence shows that President Trump listened to his  advisers and to their recommendations, and that he followed those  recommendations.   The witnesses also testified that President Trump didn't fire anyone  at the Justice Department relating to the election.   Records from this investigation indicate that President Trump's focus  was on ``legitimate complaints and reports of crimes.''   Witnesses testified that President Trump's main focus was on making  the Department aware of the potential criminal allegations and to  ensure that the Department did its job. It wasn't President Trump  directing or ordering specific investigative steps. Witnesses also  testified that it wasn't unreasonable for President Trump to ask the  Department what it was doing to investigate election fraud and crime  allegations.   Now, with respect to the other core issues in the Democratic  narrative, the available evidence shows three facts.   Fact No. 1: President Trump rejected sending the letter drafted and  advocated by Assistant Attorney General Clark to various States to  contest the election.   Fact No. 2: President Trump rejected firing Attorney General Rosen.  Indeed, after Bill Barr submitted his resignation as Attorney General,  President Trump apparently considered Richard Donoghue as a  replacement, showing his displeasure with Rosen.   Third and final fact: President Trump accepted Acting Attorney  General Rosen's position that the Department not file a lawsuit against  the States with reported voter issues.   The Democrats' report makes much of the efforts by individual lawyers  to push the Department to take these steps, but the fact is, none of  these steps were taken because President Trump made the ultimate  decision not to take those steps. At each of these critical decision  points, the President asked his advisers for their candid views and  their candid recommendations, and the President followed them.   Now, ask yourself this: Where would we be now if President Biden  followed the advice and recommendations of his advisers regarding  Afghanistan? And we know what that advice was because we heard it last  week before the committees in the House and Senate by the generals who  were testifying.   Again, I am not sure why the committee is releasing transcripts and  an investigative report when the investigation doesn't seem to be  complete yet. I, as chairman of a committee, run investigations  differently. I collect records and run all the necessary interviews. I  gather the full set of facts.  [[Page S6963]]  Then and only then, I release the material publicly.   So far, the narrative the majority has been spinning here just isn't  borne out by the facts. So this advice from me: Don't take this  Senator's word for it; do as we have done on the Republican side. Read  the transcripts. I think you will come to the very same conclusions  that I have just stated.                   Tribute to Professor Lisa Schulte Moore    Mr. President, on a second point and a much shorter point, I would  like to recognize an outstanding professor at Iowa State University.  Professor Lisa Schulte Moore of Iowa State University is doing  important work on behalf of farmers and rural communities, and  eventually it affects all Americans.   Dr. Schulte Moore is a landscape ecologist and professor of natural  resource ecology and management. Additionally, she serves as associate  director of the Bioeconomy Institute at Iowa State University.   Dr. Schulte Moore was recently recognized as the 2021 MacArthur  Foundation Award recipient and the first-ever Iowa State MacArthur  Fellow. This award is known as the Genius Grant and is given to  individuals who have shown a dedication to their field through  creativity and originality.   Dr. Schulte Moore is a founder of the Prairie STRIPS conservation  program. Established in 2003 at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge  in Prairie City, IA, this program studied the effects of planting  prairie strips on farmland.   Before I continue, I just used the name Neal Smith--former  Congressman Neal Smith of Iowa, 36 years a Member of the House of  Representatives. He has been retired quite a while now. He just  celebrated, I think, his 100th birthday and is still active in the Des  Moines community.   Participants found that prairie strips can protect the quality of our  soil and water by reducing farm field soil loss by 95 percent. They  also reduce nitrogen and phosphorus runoff by up to 80 percent. Because  of the professor's work, prairie strips are used in 14 States on over  115,000 acres of cropland.   In addition to the $625,000 received through the MacArthur  Foundation, Dr. Schulte Moore was recently awarded a $10 million  Federal grant to turn biomass and manure into fuel. With this research,  the professor is looking for additional ways that farm waste can be  turned into renewable fuel and consequently not contribute to the  degradation of the environment.   Whether it is researching the next generation of biofuels or helping  farmers understand what conservation practices work best at their  farms, I am grateful that the MacArthur Foundation recognized Dr.  Schulte Moore. Her dedication and innovation encourage young people at  Iowa State University and beyond to become involved in agriculture.   The fact is, the United States has the safest and most abundant food  supply in the world thanks to the American farmer and through research  at institutions like Iowa State University.   Congratulations, Dr. Schulte Moore. Iowa State University and the  State of Iowa are lucky to have a professor like you.   I yield the floor.
