 Mr. President, I am here to speak in support of the  Congressional Review Act on the stream protection rule.   I want to say to those who participated in the last election--where  part of the discussion was the Federal Government knows all and needs  to be in your life and in your business life every day, and it knows  the best one-size-fits-all way--that help is on the way today. A lot of  the talk of the election is now going into action in the form of the  Congressional Review Act.   In particular, the stream protection rule was a last-minute power  grab that was aimed at giving more power to the Federal Government.   Now, at the onset, I would like to say this: I don't have any charts.  I don't have any pictures, but then I thought, you know what. Yes, I  do. I have a lot of pictures on my device here, which I will not open  up because it is against the rules and you will not be able to see  anyway. But in these pictures, you will see a picture of me fishing in  a beautiful stream in West Virginia, where trout is unlimited. You will  see me riding an ATV on a Hatfield-McCoy Trail, which is the old mining  trails and the old lumber trails in southern mine country in West  Virginia, where thousands of people come every year. You will see me  visiting a school or a business park that is built on the top of what  is a reclaimed mountaintop removal.   If you have ever been to West Virginia, they don't call us the  Mountain State for nothing. It is mountain after mountain after  mountain, difficult terrain, and in some ways it is very difficult to  have any kind of economic development.   So when the laws are enforced--the laws that we have now, in terms of  water protection and reclamation--after the mining is finished, we have  been able to have some economic development projects that have been to  the benefit of many communities there.  [[Page S568]]    So I have no charts. I live there. This is my home. I can drive 4  miles and be at a coal mine very easily, probably less than that.   I heard the argument about outdoor recreation, that people want to  have outdoor recreation. I just described three outdoor recreation  activities in my State, and the ranking member was talking about how  she fished in West Virginia and enjoyed it and had good luck, I hope.  Anyway, we have beautiful trout streams, but the outdoor recreator  doesn't want to see a coal mine. I would bet the outdoor recreator  doesn't want to see a nuclear plant, probably doesn't want to see a  windmill farm, probably doesn't want to see a natural gas plant because  when you are getting away to recreate, I don't know that anybody would  want that, but I can tell you what they do want.   They want the steel that is in their truck to get them there. They  want the electricity that they have to have when they go home at night  to cook their food or clean their clothes or all the different things  that electricity does.   There are tradeoffs to everything. Certainly coal has provided the  baseload of the industrial revolution for this country, and we still, I  think, have a great role to play.   There are estimates with this rule. The other thing is, it was said  that there were no rules in place until we had this rule. That is  absolutely false--absolutely false. This rule was rushed in. It was  worked on for 5 years, yes. It had 10 State regulators. Let me go back.   The regulation, under the Clean Water Act, is done by the States  through the EPA, in conjunction with State and Federal, with the EPA  overseeing what the States are doing to make sure they are meeting the  minimum standards.   So there are protections in place, and we welcome those protections.  Where we live, where everybody lives, we want that. Can we do better?  Absolutely, we can do better. We should always strive to do better.   This rule has been in the making for 5 years. Ten States came to this  table, 10 States which were most heavily impacted, to try to help the  Department of Interior develop this rule.   Our DEP Secretary Randy Huffman says that this proposed version of a  stream protection rule--and this is not a Republican-Democrat thing.  This is a Democratic Governor's DEP commissioner saying that it was  ``an unnecessary, uncalled for political gesture.'' He went on to say  that ``the combined administrative record developed throughout the  history of mining regulation under SMCRA is totally devoid of any  indication of a need for this radical rewrite of the regulations  governing the way coal is mined in America.''   Other States have made comments as well. We had the Ohio Chief of  Mineral Resources Management Lanny Erdos testify before our EPW  Committee. ``OSM has not provided for meaningful participation with the  cooperating or commenting agency States.''   Basically, these State regulators who were charged with the primacy  of putting forward the water standards in their States and overseeing  mining in their States were basically invited into the party and then  put in another room and not listened to. Then, eight of them walked  away. That has to tell you, this wasn't an even playing field and was  probably a very insincere effort to include everybody's opinions.   In Wyoming, Todd Parfitt said: ``The failure to engage cooperating  agencies throughout this process is reflected in the poor quality of  the proposed rule.''   We have heard a lot about the empathetic voices of the job losses:  60,000 miners since 2011, many of them in my State. Many of these men  and women who were making $80, $90,000 a year no longer have a job.  They are living in communities that are decimated.   Our State is $500 million in the hole. We are trying to transition.  We are trying to do the right thing, but rules like this that we are  about to overturn through the CRA process are such an overreach of  authority.   The EPA has already gotten slapped down by the Supreme Court for the  match rule. They put a stay on the Clean Power Plan. There are definite  questions as to the authorities that the past administration has put  forward.   United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts says: ``We are  especially concerned with the long-term negative impact this rule is  very likely to have on future longwall coal mining in the United States  and associated employment impacts on our miners.''   We have heard about mountaintop removal. There is a strong belief  that this will impact our underground mining as well. That is pretty  much--I wish I knew the exact percentage, but I would say well over 70  or 75 percent of the mining and maybe more than that.   I hosted Senate committee field hearings centered on energy jobs in  Beckley, Logan, and Morgantown. Bo Copley, a coal miner who lost his  job, talked about the impact regulatory policies were having on him,  his young family, his community, and his former colleagues.   We heard about the fact that the health and pension of our miners is  in deep trouble. I have been very much on board. Senator Manchin and I  have been working hard--along with Senator Portman, Senator Brown--with  those more affected regions to make sure the health care and pensions  of our miners are funded and that those miners know that the benefits  that were promised will be there for them and their families. The  promises made will be promises kept, but this downturn in the coal  industry heavily affects the ability for the pension funds to be  solvent and for the health benefits to be carried on. So there is a  direct correlation between the overregulation we have seen and the  effects in the health and pension funds.   The ranking member on the Energy Committee--and we just had a good  conversation. I will paraphrase what she said: Sometimes I think we are  sort of talking by one another. And I think maybe she is right in  certain respects, and she mentioned the effect of natural gas on the  coal industry. Yes, that has had an effect on the coal industry, but  this rule that was proposed, rushed in at the last minute by the  Department of Interior, would have an even more devastating effect than  the combination of regulations to this point, the combination of the  natural gas and market conditions.   So you ask: Oh, how rushed in was it if it was being worked on for 5  years?   Well, they didn't publish the rule until December 20, 2016, after the  election--the election in which overregulation was one of the key  factors that was discussed during the election and the effect on  economies and businesses and the ability for American workers to  continue to work hard and keep their jobs, but Americans rejected the  continuation of these policies.   So they published the rule on December 20, 2016, and then it was made  effective January 19, 2017.   What is January 19, 2017? It was the day before President Obama left  office. There is no irony there at all, I don't think.   I am here to say that Senator McConnell and I have put this forward.  It is one of the first ones that has come forward in terms of the  Congressional Review Act. Help is on the way, and the President will  sign this. He has said in his Statement of Administration Policy: ``The  administration is committed to reviving America's coal communities,  which have been hurting for too long.''   Again, I can tell you about it. I could probably show you pictures of  it. I live there. These are my friends. These are folks I see every  day. I see them in the grocery store. And we have seen the effects in  our region to the point of six of our counties are in deep, deep  depressions.   So I want to congratulate the House of Representatives for passing  this earlier today. I want to thank West Virginia Representatives David  McKinley, Evan Jenkins, and Alex Mooney for voting yes and getting a  strong vote. I would like to thank Leader McConnell for his leadership  on this and the 27 other cosponsors of this bill.   Lastly, I would like to say, we heard the Senator from Hawaii talk  about how this is really going to create jobs. Well, I found an article  from the Wall Street Journal on December 20, 2016, and I am going to  quote from it.         Interior's projections about the economic impact are       laughable. OSM reckons the rule would cost a mere 124 coal       mining jobs a year--    Whereas, other estimates are almost as much as one-third of the  jobs--   [[Page S569]]            but instead of visiting operating mines, the wizards at OSM       built their estimates on computer models. They even reported       a net gain in jobs--    And I think this is what the Senator from Hawaii was talking about--       as miners are replaced by workers implementing the rule.    Less mining but more workers--genius.   This reminds me a little bit of when we were talking about all of the  regulatory burdens of Dodd-Frank, which I am sure we will be getting  into in another CRA. I was on the Financial Services Committee over in  the House for a long time, and we learned, when Dodd-Frank went into  effect, within a year and a half, the largest growing profession was  bank auditors. So the government has created jobs for bank auditors to  put forward their rules. It sounds a lot like that is what OSM has done  with this rule.   I would just like to close with this. We are going to move forward  with this because it is important to our region. It is important to a  lot of working people. It will not and does not in any form or fashion  allow fowling of the water, fowling of our streams. There are  protections that are carried forth through our State regulators who  came to the table for this rule, who felt they were not being listened  to and, over the course of 5 years, all drifted out. I don't think they  were invited back. I am confident this will have an effect of saying:  America, you voted to unleash the American economy, to let our  regulators regulate, to let our clean water statutes move forward in  conjunction with State and Federal regulators, to let Americans know  that the Federal Government is not going to be reaching into every  aspect of your life and it is going to result in losing your job,  creating hopelessness, 72 teachers being laid off in my county last  month because we have lost people, real estate values going down, and  the loss of a valuable resource that leads to the strength and to the  viability and to the security because energy security is security for  our country, for our whole country.
