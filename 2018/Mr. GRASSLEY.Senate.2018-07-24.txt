 Mr. President, I want to bring my fellow Senators up to  date on a subject that was sparked by the remarks made this morning by  the minority leader. I also want to add some additional context that  the minority leader left out.   He spoke on the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.  Unfortunately, he didn't come to the floor to talk about the judge's  excellent qualifications, the judge's well-regarded temperament, or the  judge's judicial philosophy. He didn't come to the floor to announce  that he would finally extend to the judge the courtesy of a meeting,  which is customary in this body. He came to speak about what he thinks  will satisfy leftwing outside groups. He demanded that I sign a letter  that will put the American taxpayers on the hook for a Democratic  fishing expedition, and I am not going to do that.   I agree that we should have a thorough vetting process for the  nominee--and we will--and that we should review materials that will  reveal Judge Kavanaugh's legal thinking. That is our job. We are not  going to be a rubberstamp. Fortunately for us, we have immediate access  to the most valuable documents that are out there that will reveal  Judge Kavanaugh's legal thinking. We have access to the more than 300  opinions Judge Kavanaugh authored in his 12 years on the DC Circuit, as  well as to the hundreds more opinions he joined. In these opinions, he  addressed some of the most significant legal issues of the past decade  from the second most powerful court in the land.   This morning, the minority leader brought up a statement that I had  made in 2010 in connection with Justice Kagan's Supreme Court  nomination. At that time, this Senator was interested in reviewing  documents from her time in the Clinton administration.   What the minority leader neglected to mention was that, unlike Judge  Kavanaugh, Justice Kagan had not served as a judge before being  nominated to the Supreme Court. Besides the Federal Government service  she had had at the time she was nominated, she had been the dean of a  law school. Other than Kagan's materials that she had submitted as part  of the Senate Judiciary questionnaire for her nomination, her White  House Counsel's Office and Domestic Policy Council documents had been  some of the few categories of documents that could have shed light on  her legal thinking since she hadn't had any judicial writings, meaning  as a judge. Justice Kagan had written or joined a grand total of zero  judicial opinions before her nomination. For those of us on the Senate  Judiciary Committee to have carried out our constitutional advice and  consent responsibilities as Senators, we had needed to better  understand her legal thinking and potential jurisprudence.   Judge Kavanaugh, by contrast, has authored over 300 judicial opinions  in his 12 years on the bench. That is over 300. That doesn't include  the hundreds of other decisions in which he has joined an opinion or  some sort of order. When you add those to the mix, those are thousands  of pages of judicial writings that the American people have access to  at this exact moment. You don't have to wait to get this information  about Judge Kavanaugh. To the contrary, Justice Kagan, of course, had  zero pages of judicial opinions. This is in addition to the 6,168 pages  of records Judge Kavanaugh just included in his response to the Senate  Judiciary questionnaire, which we put on the website last weekend for  the whole public to view if it wants to know everything about Judge  Kavanaugh as a judge and about the things of which he spoke and wrote  documents about other than just his judicial opinions.   Despite the fact that Judge Kavanaugh's judicial record is much more  substantial than Justice Kagan's was, I agree that we should still ask  the White House for documents pertaining to Judge Kavanaugh's time in  the White House Counsel's Office. My Democratic colleagues say they  want the White House's records. I am pleased to let them know that in  the coming weeks, the Senate will receive what will likely be the  largest document production in history for a Supreme Court nomination.  I expect that the Senate could receive up to a million pages of  documents that will be related to Judge Kavanaugh's time in the White  House Counsel's Office. We will also see the White House's nomination  file for Judge Kavanaugh's 2006 nomination to the DC Circuit--where, as  I have told you, he now sits--along with records from Judge Kavanaugh's  time in the U.S. Office of the Independent Counsel. By comparison, we  received fewer than 180,000 pages for Justice Kagan's time in two White  House offices.   Let's recap. We have more than 300 of Judge Kavanaugh's actual  judicial opinions to Justice Kagan's zero. We could have up to five  times as many pages from his time in the White House as we received  from Justice Kagan's time, and we will have those documents despite the  fact that they are less necessary now than they were for Justice Kagan.  In short, there will be much more transparency in this Supreme Court  confirmation process than ever before.   I am ready now to send a letter to the National Archives to request  relevant White House Counsel documents. I would like to do this with  the ranking member, but unfortunately she has declined this request.  This is unfortunate. Both sides agree that the White House Counsel  documents are relevant. I would like to get them over here as quickly  as possible so we can begin reviewing them.   Yet, as I noted, the Democratic leadership has already decided to  oppose  [[Page S5250]]  Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation. They would like to slow down the  process as much as possible. I think that explains why the ranking  member will not sign a letter that requests documents both sides want.   I have heard that some of my Democratic colleagues would like to  request all of Judge Kavanaugh's records from his time as White House  Staff Secretary, but these documents are both the least relevant to  Judge Kavanaugh's legal thinking and the most sensitive to the  executive branch. The Staff Secretary is the in-box and out-box of the  Oval Office. Passing through the Staff Secretary's office is a wide  range of communications that request things like flying the flag at  half-mast to somehow including daily lunch menus, to draft speeches, to  sensitive national security papers.   The Staff Secretary's primary charge is not to provide his own  substantive work product; the Staff Secretary makes sure that the  President sees memos and policy papers that have been produced by other  offices in the White House. It is a very important job. It requires  someone who is smart, someone who is hard-working, and someone who is  talented.   The documents that passed through Judge Kavanaugh's office while he  was Staff Secretary are not particularly relevant to his legal thinking  or for the consideration of whether he should be on the Supreme Court.  It is like saying, in a sense, that the Senate Secretary--someone who  has a very difficult and demanding job--is responsible for all of the  positions taken by each of the Senate offices. It is absurd.   The Senate should focus its efforts on reviewing his tens of  thousands of pages of judicial opinions and other legal writings. Not  only would a broad review of Staff Secretary documents be a waste of  time, but it would also be a waste of taxpayers' money.   Moreover, Staff Secretary documents contain some of the most  sensitive information and advice that went directly to President Bush  from a range of policy advisers.   Back in 2010, both Democrats and Republicans agreed that Justice  Kagan, because of the sensitivity of the documents, shouldn't produce  internal communications while she was Solicitor General.   If we are going to talk about a Kagan standard, then we need to talk  about taking sensitive communications off the table. That is what all  sides had agreed to in 2010 and what I will insist on now.   I appreciate the minority leader's efforts to ensure some  transparency and thoroughness, but let's get right down to brass tacks:  I don't think the minority leader actually wants to read the millions  of pages that crossed Judge Kavanaugh's desk way back in 2004 and for  probably the 3 years he held the position of Staff Secretary.   The minority leader said he will fight this nomination with  everything he has, which proves what I have been talking about, and his  request proves that he is willing to do that because this bloated  document request is part of that fight. This is not about anything  other than obstruction--to bury us under millions and millions of pages  of paper so we cannot have a confirmation vote on Judge Kavanaugh this  year.   Liberal, dark money outside groups want to drag this confirmation out  just as far as they can--till the end of time. I will not let them.  This confirmation process should focus on Judge Kavanaugh's  qualifications, not become a taxpayer-funded fishing expedition.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay  tribute to an outstanding businessman and citizen John G. Deery, Sr.,  of Cedar Falls, IA. Mr. Deery passed away recently at the age of 88. He  leaves behind a close-knit and loving family--his beloved wife,  Marlene; his two sons, John and Dan, both of Cedar Falls, IA; and a  host of children and great-grandchildren, nieces and nephews.   A veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, John was an active parishioner of  St. Patrick Catholic Church and a respected civic and business leader  who left his mark throughout Cedar Valley. Following his military  service--1948/ 1951--and startup ventures in the Quad Cities and  Wisconsin, John purchased a Buick dealership in the late 1960s in Cedar  Falls. This Wisconsin native became an Iowa transplant and never looked  back. From then on, he and his family business paved a road to  prosperity by winning the business of generations of satisfied  customers.   A look back through the rearview mirror shows a life well lived. He  was a member of the Cedar Falls AMVETS Post 49, Iowa Auto Dealers  Association, Knights of Columbus, and a founding father of Community  National Bank.   The patriarch of the family, John carved out his slice of the  American dream. After opening the Buick dealership, the business  eventually grew into a series of enterprises, eventually employing a  workforce of more than 200 people. For six decades, he owned the Deery  Automotive Group, encompassing John Deery Motors, Dan Deery Motors, and  Deery Brothers Collision Center that provided livelihoods for  generations of local families and a trusted place to buy and repair the  family car.   After turning the reins of the automobile business over to the next  generation, John launched yet another successful enterprise in real  estate development. An active octogenarian, John didn't let any grass  grow underneath his feet and continued looking for ways to make his  community a better place to live. A decade ago, he was nominated for  the Waterloo Courier's inaugural Eight Over Eighty Award.   The residents of Cedar Valley have benefited from John and Marlene's  generous commitment to giving back their time, talent, and treasure. A  number of nonprofit agencies and community organizations have benefited  from their philanthropic pursuits, including my alma mater, the  University of Northern Iowa, the Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office,  the Cedar Falls and Waterloo police departments, St. Patrick Catholic  Church and School, and El Kahir Shrine.   Today I pay my respects to this American veteran, successful Iowan,  and civic leader. John Deery, Sr., steered a steady and honorable  journey on the road of life and he will be greatly missed by those who  loved him the most.                            ____________________
