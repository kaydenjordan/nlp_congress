 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  strong support for the Department of Veterans Affairs Contracting  Preference Consistency Act and the AbilityOne program.   This vital bill corrects an error made in previous law to ensure  thousands of blind and visually impaired Americans, many of whom are  veterans, are able to keep their jobs.   Bosma Enterprises in my district, which has served Indiana for over  100 years, serves blind and visually impaired Hoosiers by giving them  meaningful work. These Hoosiers want to work. They want to be self- sufficient. They want to contribute to their community. Many  contributed to their country through their military service, which  actually is where they sustained injuries causing their blindness or  visual impairment.   But Bosma relies on contracts with the VA through the AbilityOne  program to be able to provide those good jobs to Hoosiers. Sadly,  changes in VA policy and a series of court rulings threaten the  viability of this productive partnership.   With this important bill, Bosma and many other AbilityOne employers  like it around the country will continue to provide meaningful work to  those Americans.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and I urge the  Senate to adopt and take it up.                            ____________________
