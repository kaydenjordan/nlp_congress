 Madam President, I rise today in support of the  nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice on the  U.S. Supreme Court. I have had the privilege of serving in this body  for nearly three decades now.   In that time, I have participated in the confirmation hearings of 10  Supreme Court Justices and hundreds of nominees to our Federal circuit  and district courts. I have carefully scrutinized Judge Jackson's  record and listened very closely to her testimony. In my view, Judge  Jackson is both well qualified and extremely prepared to take on the  important role of serving on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Judge Jackson is a graduate of both Harvard University and Harvard  Law School, a former Supreme Court clerk, a former Federal public  defender, and a former U.S. Sentencing Commissioner. On top of that,  Judge Jackson has served as a federal judge for nearly a decade.   Judge Jackson would be the first Federal public defender to sit on  the Supreme Court and the first Justice since Thurgood Marshall with  significant experience representing low-income defendants in criminal  cases. As a former public defender, Judge Jackson truly understands the  power of our constitutional rights, including the Sixth Amendment right  to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right to due process. Judge Jackson  would also join Justice Sotomayor as the only former Federal district  court judges serving on the Supreme Court.   What has impressed me most about Judge Jackson does not appear on her  resume. That is Judge Jackson's steadfast commitment to the fair and  impartial application of the law, her deep knowledge of the U.S.  Constitution, and her remarkable judicial temperament. These qualities  were demonstrated in her testimony before the Judiciary Committee  earlier this month. They were also shown in the letters and testimony  of the many people--of all ideological viewpoints--who have supported  Judge Jackson's nomination.   First, Judge Jackson's respect for the law and the Constitution are  clear from the nearly 600 legal opinions she has drafted as a Federal  judge. Her legal opinions are clear and detailed. As she explained  during her confirmation hearings, Judge Jackson carefully and fairly  applies the law to the specific facts of each case. And Judge Jackson  takes the time to explain why she reached each decision. In my view, it  is important that the decisions of the Supreme Court are accessible to  the American people. Judge Jackson's approach to judicial decision- making will help to ensure transparency in her judging and help to  restore the public's confidence in the decisions of the Supreme Court.   Second, Judge Jackson clearly has deep legal knowledge. During her  more than 20 hours of testimony before the Judiciary Committee, she  spoke with skill on a wide range of topics. She addressed legal issues  of all kinds, including separation of powers, the First Amendment,  administrative law, criminal sentencing, and much more. I believe Judge  Jackson has the knowledge and expertise to decide the most difficult  and pressing legal issues facing this Nation.   Finally, during her hearings, Judge Jackson also showed that she has  a remarkable temperament. Lawyers and judges who have worked with her,  or appeared before her, have confirmed that Judge Jackson brings this  temperament with her in all aspects of her work. They have told the  Senate that she is as collegial, calm, and steadfast as she appeared to  be during her hearings.   For example, Judge Thomas Griffith testified in support of Judge  Jackson's nomination and focused on her character and temperament, in  addition to her exceptional qualifications. Judge Griffith is a retired  judge of the D.C. Circuit and was appointed to the bench by President  George W. Bush. Judge Griffith said that Judge Jackson has modeled the  ideal qualities of a judge, including diligence, carefulness, high  character, deep legal knowledge, and broad experience.   Witnesses from the American Bar Association also testified about  Judge Jackson's sterling reputation for integrity. Those witnesses  interviewed lawyers and judges who have known and worked with Judge  Jackson at various points over the course of her career. And, in those  interviews, lawyers and judges who were familiar with Judge Jackson  uniformly praised her character. They called her ``first rate,''  ``impeccable,'' and ``beyond reproach.'' One comment said: ``You write  the word `integrity,' and then you put her initials next to it.''  [[Page S1976]]    The American Bar Association's interviews also revealed that  prosecutors and defense attorneys alike regard Judge Jackson as fair,  balanced, and unbiased. She is precisely the kind of Justice we need on  the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson is plainly up to the task of  faithfully interpreting our Constitution and our laws and fairly  applying the law in each and every case.   Judge Jackson laid out in simple terms the three-part methodology she  uses in each case to ensure that her decisions are informed by the  arguments of the parties, the facts, and the law, and not by any  personal views she may hold. Judge Jackson's thoughtful methodology  shows that she appreciates how important it is for judges to approach  each and every case with an open mind and to avoid both actual and  perceived conflicts of interest.   I believe Judge Jackson is an extraordinary person. Her rich family  history in law enforcement and her background as a Federal public  defender, a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a trial judge,  and an appellate judge will benefit our Supreme Court.   It will be my great pleasure to vote to confirm Judge Jackson to be  an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. And I hope that my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle will do the same.                            ____________________
