 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for this time to talk  about something that is rather important. Something we did today was to  pass a horrendous tax cut that doesn't meet this fundamental goal.   Really, whenever we legislate here, we really ought to keep in mind  our values: What is the purpose? What are we trying to accomplish? What  is the goal? What is the human value that we are trying to put in  place?   I often use this because it is here in Washington at the FDR  Memorial. It is on the marble there: ``The test of our progress is not  whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much.''   Let me read that again, Franklin Delano Roosevelt: ``The test of our  progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have  much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''   I want to use this as my compass, my guiding light on where we need  to go. So this afternoon, this House of Representatives, by a vote of,  I think, just over 200 voted to enact a tax law that goes in exactly  the opposite direction of what FDR would say is our value, our goal.   Here it is. The Speaker of the House came here to bring down the  gavel to announce the vote that he was so proud to have.   Eighty percent of the individual tax cuts don't go to the poor, don't  go to the middle class. They go to the top 1 percent.   How does that fit with what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said to the  American Nation during the height of the Great Depression?   No. You may as well take Franklin Delano Roosevelt's words, turn them  on their head, because this House didn't follow the edict, didn't  follow the value, but did exactly the opposite: gave away, to the top 1  percent, even greater wealth.   How could that be? Why would they do that? Why would they do that?   Well, I don't know why they would do it, but they surely did it. And  in addition to that, not just the wealthy 1 percent, the wealthy 10  percent, why don't you add American corporations to that who are awash  in cash? $2.5 trillion in the bank accounts of American corporations,  and they don't know how to spend it to create jobs in the United  States.    Instead, the Republicans, today, decided they needed $1.43 billion  additional cash as a result of the tax cut that no Democrats, not a  one, but every Republican voted for, $1.43 billion--the number is from  the Joint Committee on Taxation--of new after-tax revenue to American  corporations.   And what do you suppose they are going to do with that? Create jobs  in the United States? Expand their manufacturing? No. Or higher wages  for their workers? No.   I will tell you what they intend to do with it. This is it. The  corporate tax giveaway will give Wells Fargo an 18 percent earnings  increase.   How do they intend to spend it? Hint: Not on jobs.   In his own words, Tim Sloan, CEO of Wells Fargo, December 2017--I  think that is this month--said: ``Is it our goal to increase return to  shareholders and do we have an excess amount of capital? The answer . .  . is yes. So our expectation should be that we will continue to  increase our dividend and our share buybacks next year and the year  after that and the year after that.''   All right, Mr. Sloan. You can thank the Republicans, because when you  buy back your shares, when you increase your dividends, guess what. The  stock price goes up, and we know that your compensation is based on  stock price. Are you going to use that extra money for loans to small  businesses? to farmers? No, you are not. You are not going to make more  loans.   This is replicated across the American corporate culture. This is not  unique. This new after-tax bonus that the Republicans are giving to  American corporations is going to be used for the benefit of the  wealthy. So you can add, if you will, to the tax cuts that are coming  as a result of the reduction in the top income tax bracket for  individuals from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, you can add to it, but, by  the way, their investment portfolio is going to go up also.   This tax program is an abomination, and it is going to hurt every  American over time.   I am joined here tonight by my colleagues who are probably as riled  up about this as I am. I am not sure which one of them came in first.   I yield to the gentleman from the State of Oregon, Peter DeFazio, my  colleague.  [[Page H10235]]         I thank the ranking member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee for making a very clear case on how we might  better spend our money.   I yield to the gentleman from the great State of California (Mr.  McNerney), my colleague and neighbor.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's final sentence was  ``rushed through.'' There has not been one substantive hearing in  either House. There has been a markup hearing, but that is not a  substantive hearing.   No Democratic amendments have been accepted. Not one economist has  been called to testify--not one accountant, not one tax lawyer. No  hearings whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline) to share with us his perspective.    Mr. Speaker, did I hear Mr. Cicilline correctly that  the action taken here on the floor is not dispositive, but has to be  modified in the Senate and brought back because they screwed up?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cicilline for bringing to our  attention some key elements here: The deficit issue, which we will  discuss a little longer today. Also, the issue of really growing  American jobs: growing wages, growing the future, and creating a better  future for American workers. I know that has been the gentleman's  passion and his work. We will go through all of those things in the day  ahead.   This bill may very well become law, but I would surely like to see  exactly how the President is going to do with this. I suspect this  passthrough business in which he has 500 passthrough corporations--he  is not an active investor. He will make out very, very well, and the  working men and women of the middle class are going to lose.   I am just looking at this. This is the distribution tables from the  Joint Committee on Taxation, December 18, 2017. Income category, a  distribution of individual income tax side of the proposal. 2019, a  small $127 million reduction for everybody making less than $10,000. In  2021, they are actually paying higher taxes. So the very, very bottom,  in just 3 years, they are going to pay higher taxes.   I notice that my friend from North Carolina has joined us, and I  thank him so very much for joining us. I know he has a few things on  his mind, as do Mr. Cicilline and I.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price)  to share with us his views on what has happened today and where we are  going.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, oh, absolutely. And I  would say, also, that maybe it is an oligarch, and maybe we are  creating one of those Russian oligarch societies here in which a few  who are well connected to this President are going to do very, very  well.   We are not talking about the Russia thing here today, but it gives me  some pause to think: Why are they working so hard to end the Mueller  investigation? But that is another subject for another day.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, we don't need to  guess what they are going to do. The Speaker of the House of  Representatives, Mr. Ryan, has said very clearly that next year will be  step two. They will take on what he calls the social safety net: Social  Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps. That is where the cuts  are going to come. This is not our words. These are the words of the  leadership of this House of Representatives, the words of the Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Price of North Carolina so  very much. His thoughtful discussion of this is much appreciated.   He mentioned the deficit issue. $1.5 trillion does not include the  interest on the $1.5 trillion. So if you were to add the interest to  the $1.5 trillion, it would actually probably be over $2 trillion to  $2.3 trillion that this will cost. The actual reduction in revenues,  $1.5 trillion, interest on top of that another $600 billion or so, so  we are looking at something really serious here.   I would like to go through some of the numbers.   I looked at this. This is not something that is off 10 years from  now. This is now.   In 2019, the structural deficit that is already in place, without  even talking about this additional burden of increased deficit, the  underlying structural deficit in 2019 is right around $600 billion.  This tax bill will add maybe $250 billion to $300 billion of additional  debt in 2019. So we are going to get very close to $1 trillion of  deficit in 2019.   And, by the way, the military budget is increased by about, I think  it is over $50 billion. That is not paid for, so that is additional  debt. That is going to be here on the floor tomorrow or the next day.   In addition to that, there is this ongoing effort to deal with the  hurricanes, fires, and so forth. That is another $120 billion that is  not paid for.   So if you take $120 billion, you take $50 billion, and you take the  $250 billion to $300 billion in the tax bill and you add that to the  $600 billion that exists to begin with, in 2019, it will be over $1  trillion of new debt. And I will guarantee that the exodus, the  migration of the deficit hawks from Washington, D.C., during December  of 2017 will reverse in the warmer weather, coming back next year. And  those deficit hawks will come back, they will come back to Congress,  and they will go right after the programs that FDR talked about: those  who have the least.   Our colleague, Mr. DeFazio, from the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee talked about what we could do if we had the  money in infrastructure or if we had that billion dollars; 15,000  people would be employed. But we won't--we won't--have an  infrastructure program, and they will be back here.                                time  1815    They will be back here to make cuts in the social safety net, as the  Speaker has already said he intends to do. Medicaid, $800 billion to $1  trillion reduction in Medicaid over the next decade.   Who are the beneficiaries of Medicaid?   We think they are the people on welfare. Well, yes, but some 60  percent of Medicaid recipients are seniors, seniors in nursing homes  and long-term care facilities.   I thank Mr. Price very much for joining us.   I think I am going to stop for just a moment and turn to my colleague  from the great State of Maryland. If the gentleman would care to join  us, I yield to Mr. Raskin for his remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Raskin so very much for his  remarks. The voice of Maryland is strong and powerful and quite  correct. Mr. Raskin spoke of income inequality.   The wealthy in America, the top 1 percent, own as much wealth as the  bottom 90 percent?    Mr. Speaker, this bill would seem to further the  skewing of wealth to the wealthy.    Mr. Speaker, that is interesting. Perhaps the House of  Lords is in our future.   I was just thinking, as Mr. Raskin was talking, of an old comic book  that used to be popular. It was one of the Donald Duck comic books, and  I remember it was Uncle Scrooge McDuck. I guess, in his treasury, he  was playing with the dollars, throwing the coins up into the air. I am  wondering if that is what we are really into here.   The superwealthy are just accumulating more and more wealth. For the  benefit of the economy? Not really. It doesn't trickle down. There is  absolutely no evidence that it does. In fact, there is plenty of  historic economic evidence that trickle down doesn't work, but pushing  up from the bottom would. We could have had a tax bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Well, if their tax bill is for their donors, we have a  pretty good idea who the beneficiaries of the tax bill are. So the  donors are the plutocrats, the superwealthy. It is Wall Street. Very  much it is Wall Street because this is really about raising the stock  price.   I think Mr. Raskin may not have been here when I put this up, but I  am going to do it one more time. It has been clear that before the  1980s, 50 percent, maybe 55 percent, 60 percent of the after-tax income  of corporations went into creating a bigger corporation, into  manufacturing jobs, plant equipment, hiring more people, paying better  wages.    Beginning in the mid-1980s or so, that began to shift so that, today,  exactly the opposite occurs. Maybe 70, 80 percent of the after-tax  profits now go into buying back stock, increasing the stock price,  higher dividends.   Case in point: the corporate tax giveaway in this bill, which is  actually--I said earlier it was $1.4 trillion reduction in corporate  taxes over the next decade. It is actually $1.3 trillion. My apologies  for being incorrect.   $1.3 trillion reduction in corporate taxes. For a company like Wells  Fargo, a rather major bank, the corporate tax giveaway will give Wells  Fargo an 18 percent earnings increase.   How does Wells Fargo intend to spend it?   Not on jobs.   Here is what the CEO of Wells Fargo, Mr. Tim Sloan, said in December  of 2017. That is this month. He said: ``Is it our goal to increase  return to shareholders, and do we have an excess amount of capital? The  answer to both is `yes.' So our expectation should be that we will  continue to increase our  [[Page H10240]]  dividend and our share buybacks next year and the year after that and  the year after that.''   So where are the jobs?   May I cite one other example. Lowering the corporate tax rate was  said to be an incentive for corporations to invest. Well, here is one  of the great American corporations.   Are they investing?   I think not. They are buying back stock.   AT&T, another major American corporation, effectively reduced its tax  rate to 8 percent over the last decade. So they are paying not 21  percent, as this bill would require. They are paying 8 percent.   Did they create jobs?   No. During that same period of time, they laid off 80,000 workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Raskin, if he would like to make a few  closing remarks, and then I will wrap up.                                time  1830     Mr. Speaker, they could be raising wages. I yield to  the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, from their own mouth comes from the truth  of what Mr. Raskin said. They have said it very clearly, they need to  do this for their contributors.   Who are their contributors? Well, the wealthy, the superwealthy, and  the rest.   Mr. Speaker, I think we are going to wrap it up here. I want to thank  Mr. Raskin for his participation. I want to thank my colleagues who  came to the floor tonight to express their dismay at what has happened.   Now, because the bill was rushed through without any public hearings,  there were errors in the bill that require that the Senate take the  approved conference committee report and modify it, which I suppose  means there has to be yet another conference committee, modify it,  remove the errors that are in conflict with the Senate rules, and send  it back here. Presumably, that will be done tomorrow.   Maybe now, as we bring to the attention of the American public the  way in which this tax bill is harmful to the economy, harmful to the  American middle class, and will result in 83 million Americans  immediately paying higher taxes, and over the period of time, everybody  that is less than $100,000, maybe $150,000, will be paying higher  taxes, but the wealthy and the corporations will go on and have their  lower taxes for many, many years to come, all of that hopefully will  begin to sink in on the American public, and they will rise up in  indignation and call a halt to what is a major rip-off of the American  Treasury and America's future.   So we will continue to talk about this in the days ahead, and those  who have voted for this are going to be held responsible and  accountable as the days and the months go by.   Keep in mind that the Texas Two-Step is very much in play, and that,  in the days ahead, in the next year, as the weather warms, the returned  migration of the deficit hawks will take place, and they will go after  Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, education, children's health, and  other programs that men and women of America rely upon, and perhaps  many, many more.   We will be fighting this fight for many months to come.   Mr. Speaker, keeping in mind the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,  I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
