 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate this year's  college football national championship team, the Georgia Bulldogs.   For the first time since 1980, the Bulldogs are bringing the college  football national championship trophy back to Athens, Georgia, after  beating the Alabama Crimson Tide by a score of 33-18 this past Monday.   I could not be more proud of the Dawgs for showing all of us the true  definition of heart, of character, and of dedication.   After losing to the Crimson Tide in the SEC championship game a few  weeks back, the Bulldogs worked, they prepared, they practiced with  intense focus in order to come back and win the national championship.   This team really gave us everything they had. They put it all on the  field, and I am humbled to represent the University of Georgia and the  10th Congressional District of Georgia.   The Dawg spirit never ceases to amaze me. I want to extend sincere  congratulations to the entire team, to Coach Kirby Smart and his  coaching staff, and to the entire Dawg Nation.   Go Dawgs. Congratulations. It has been a great season.                            ____________________
