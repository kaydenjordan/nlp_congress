 Mr. Speaker, I am going to follow up on the prior  speaker. I rise in support of National Foster Care Month. This month,  we renew our commitment to ensuring that the 420,000 youth who are in  our Nation's foster care system have a caring family and the  opportunities they deserve.   I am proud to be a member of the Foster Youth Caucus, which is  devoted to highlighting the efforts of all those involved with  improving our Nation's foster care system.   I also rise to celebrate Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day.  Today, more than 100 former foster youth from across the country are in  D.C., paired with Members of Congress as we conduct the Nation's  business.   I am privileged to host Shantell House and Jeremiah McWright from  California. Shantell is currently a student at Mills College and is  passionate about current and former foster youth. Jeremiah joins me  from San Diego, where he is studying public policy and has the  potential to become a great business leader, or even a politician.   It gives me great pleasure to welcome Shantell and Jeremiah, along  with all of the participants of the Congressional Youth Shadow Day, to  our Nation's capital.                            ____________________
