 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Billy Raymond, a  letter carrier in my hometown.   In October, Francis Raymond, better known as Billy, will celebrate 30  years of carrying mail along the same postal route.   Billy is well known to residents on his longtime Delaware County  route and vice versa. Billy knows the names of the kids and dogs on his  route, and he greets them on his rounds.  [[Page H658]]    Four years ago, Billy was honored as a member of the prestigious  Million Mile Club. That club celebrates postal workers who have safely  driven over 1 million miles or served the Postal Service for more than  30 years.   The United States Postal Service plays a critical role for our  country, connecting family, friends, businesses, and government  agencies across the Nation, and Billy Raymond is a critical part of  that connection in Pennsylvania's Fifth District.   February 4 is Thank a Letter Carrier Day, so I want to thank Billy  Raymond for his dedication and to extend a broader thank-you to all the  hardworking postal workers serving at the 60 post offices across my  district.                            ____________________
