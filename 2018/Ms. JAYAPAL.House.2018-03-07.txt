 Mr. Speaker, today is the 53rd anniversary of Bloody  Sunday. This is the day that our incredible colleague, Congressman   John Lewis, and Dr. Martin Luther King led 600 marchers from Selma to  Montgomery. They didn't get very far. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they  were viciously attacked by Alabama State Troopers wielding clubs and  were beaten and left bloodied.   Last weekend, I had the incredible honor of joining Congressman  John  Lewis and a bipartisan group of Members in a pilgrimage to Montgomery,  Birmingham, Selma, and Memphis. I had many epiphanies on that trip, but  perhaps two were most profound. First, that determined and disciplined  nonviolent resistance works. Back then, 53 years ago, it led to the  passage of the Voting Rights Act. And, second, that we in this body  have a critical responsibility to ensure that we move forward and not  backward on voting rights.   Our trip was amazing. One of the best experiences of my life,  actually. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will  join next year. We heard incredible stories of abiding love, even for  adversaries that had left people without much dignity. Newer activists  of all ages are reimagining these same nonviolent methods for the world  that we are in today.   Today, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the assassination of  the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King on April 4, let us recommit  ourselves to restoring and strengthening the Voting Rights Act and  making sure that we continue to protect these critical rights in our  country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Raskin for his  leadership on the Progressive Caucus and for his leadership on the  Judiciary Committee. Nobody understands the Constitution better than a  constitutional law professor.   I appreciate you bringing the reality of the situation to us. Nobody  is talking about trying to take guns away from everybody. We are  talking about making sure that we have safety with anybody who owns a  gun and that we have the ability to check any of the dangerous contexts  for which guns can be used. We have a responsibility, really, to  protect our country, to protect our young people, and to do something  for all of the families that have been affected by gun violence.   In addition to all of the things that he mentioned, we need to  consider gun violence as a public health crisis. That is what it is.  And when we look around at the millions of people who are dying from  gun violence, you think about this, and you think about the way in  which we treated vehicle fatalities as a public health crisis and we  instituted laws around seatbelts, and the way we thought about smoking  as a public health crisis and we instituted laws around smoking. But,  in order to do that, we had to first do research into those areas and  figure out what were the best ways for us to move forward as a country  in preventing those kinds of fatalities that are preventable.   Unfortunately, what happened in this country is that Congressman  Dickey, some time ago, passed an amendment called the Dickey amendment.  While it didn't explicitly prohibit research into gun violence, it all  but did that.   There have now been many, many calls to repeal the Dickey amendment.  Interestingly, Congressman Dickey passed away last year, last April.  Before he died, in 2012, he actually came out on the record and said  that he wished he hadn't been so reactionary, that he wished he hadn't  passed that amendment, because he realized that it did lead to a  chilling effect on research into gun safety. The way that it did that  is, when they passed the amendment, it essentially said that no Federal  funds should be used for advocacy, but, at the same time, the amount of  funds that were used for research were cut by exactly that amount.   So this is not about advocacy; this is about how do we protect our  country, how do we treat this as what it is: a public health crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to say that I am really proud of my home State  of Washington. Just yesterday, we became the latest State to ban bump  stocks. And we also had a senate committee pass a bill to mandate that  people purchasing rifles go through the same background checks required  for pistol purchases and that we increase the legal age to buy rifles  to 21.   So, in less than a month, my home State has finally advanced  meaningful proposals to prevent gun violence. I wish I could say that  we were doing that here in Congress. I truly believe that there are  Members on both sides of the aisle who would like to pass sensible gun  safety regulations and legislation.   Unfortunately, I feel like we are being held hostage not by the  reasons that we all came to Congress to get sensible things done that  protect our constituencies, but by lobbying interests in the National  Rifle Association; and every time there is a small movement towards  progress, somehow they come in and, essentially, squash those efforts.   In October of last year, Congress stood by after 58 people were  killed and over 500 injured at a music festival in Las Vegas. One of my  constituent's, Zach Elmore, sister was shot. Luckily, she was one of  the lucky ones who survived the shooting.   I read a letter on the floor that Zach had read to me--it was an  incredibly moving letter--about his deep anger and frustration at  Congress for not protecting his sister and millions like her, those who  were not as lucky as she was.   In November, Congress failed to act, after 26 people were killed and  20 injured at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas; and then a few  weeks ago, on Valentine's Day, as we all know, 14 students and 3  teachers were killed, and 15 injured, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School in Florida.   Already, in 2018 alone, there have been 2,581 deaths because of gun  violence, including those precious lives that were lost at Parkland;  105 of those deaths were children ages 11 and under.   Let me just say that one more time: 105 of the 2,581 deaths, this  year alone, were children ages 11 and under.   As Members of Congress, we need to make sure our kids are safe.   I am so grateful to the energy and the commitment and the passion and  the smarts and the organizing strength of the Parkland students,  because, as you say, they were not first graders who couldn't organize  for themselves. They are students who are soon going to be voters. And  they understand that they can't vote right now, but they also  understand that they do have a voice, their parents' vote, and they can  make sure that people across the country understand that we have a  responsibility to them, to our children, to the people across the  country who are afraid of sending their kids to school.   That should be our number one priority is keeping our kids safe. Our  kids should be able to walk into schools knowing that they can fully  focus on learning. Our parents shouldn't have to wonder whether their  kids will come home from school.   My heart goes out to the families that lost someone in the Parkland  shooting and all of the shootings across the country. I am proud to  stand alongside incredible young people who wasted no time to demand  action and justice for their friends and teachers. They are determined,  they are brave, they are unafraid, and they are depending on us to pass  meaningful legislation to end gun violence.   One of the interesting things that I heard them say when I met with  them is: We are not looking for the whole package. We just want to see  steps along the way that show us that it is possible for us, on a  bipartisan basis, to make some progress on this critical issue, to make  sure that no child, no parent, no community, ever again, has to  experience the unspeakable tragedy of another school shooting.   I am tired of seeing men, women, and children die because the gun  lobby puts profit over people. That is not, as Mr. Raskin so eloquently  said, what our Founders intended by the right to bear arms. Support for  stricter measures to prevent gun violence is at an all-time  [[Page H1471]]  high, on a bipartisan basis. Eighty-seven percent of gun owners and 74  percent of NRA members support commonsense solutions like criminal  background checks.   I have a plea for gun owners across the country. My husband used to  be a hunter. We had guns at home. And I understand the need for people  to have guns for recreational purposes, to ensure their own safety. But  this is not about that. It is not about taking guns away from people,  who legitimately exercise responsible behavior. It is about making sure  that we have the protections in place so that no more children, no more  people die.                                time  1715    So here is my plea for gun owners: urge the NRA to represent your  views, show them that you mean business, maybe even consider  terminating your NRA membership if the organization continues to  advocate against these kinds of sensible gun reforms.   Here in Congress, I hope that we act now. I really truly believe--and  I have talked to some of my Republican colleagues who also want to do  something about this. They don't want to be hamstrung. They want to  move legislation forward, but not by attaching legislation that  actually loosens gun restrictions into legislation that helps us.   We need just one or two pieces of commonsense gun reform legislation  so that we can show these young people that we are responding to their  pleas: no more shootings in schools, no more shootings in places of  worship, no more shootings in our streets, no more mass shootings,  period.   Let's show these students and students at schools across the country  that we are not afraid to protect them. Let's show them that we can  choose our country over the gun lobby. Let's stand with our kids. Let's  pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I join Mr. Raskin in hoping that in the Judiciary  Committee, which is the committee of record for this issue, that we can  at least have some hearings on this.   What is so problematic about having a hearing on public health  research into gun violence? What is so problematic about having a  hearing on multiple pieces of legislation that have bipartisan support?  Isn't that what we are supposed to do? I know that is why I came here.   I am a first term Member, and I know our speaker is as well, and I  believe that we have much more in common than we do that divides us.   We don't have to necessarily tackle every piece of this, but let's  make some substantial progress forward together, and let's show our  students that we will protect them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman again for his leadership.
