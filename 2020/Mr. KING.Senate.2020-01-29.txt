 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question for both sets of  counsel, which I send to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator King is for both counsel  for the President and House managers:         President Trump's former chief of staff, General John Kelly       has reportedly said, ``I believe John Bolton'' and suggests       Bolton should testify, saying, ``If there are people that       could contribute to this, either innocence or guilt, I think       they should be heard.'' Do you agree with General Kelly that       they should be heard?    I think, counsel for the President, it is your turn to go first.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the  Senate, this was a bit of a topic that I discussed yesterday, and that  was the information that came out of the New York Times piece about  what is purportedly in a book by Ambassador Bolton.   Now, as I said, the idea that a manuscript is not in the book--there  is not a quote from the manuscript in the book; this is a perception of  what the statement might be. There have been very forceful statements,  not just from the President but from the Attorney General. The  Department of Justice stated that while the Department of Justice has  not reviewed Mr. Bolton's manuscript, the New York Times account of  this conversation grossly mischaracterizes what Attorney General Barr  and Mr. Bolton discussed.   [[Page S660]]  There was no discussion of his getting any personal favors or undue  influence for the investigation, nor did Attorney General Barr state  that the President's conversations with foreign leaders were improper.  So again, that goes to some of the allegations that were in the  article.    The Vice President said the same thing. He said: In every  conversation with the President and Vice President, in preparation for  our trip to Poland, the President consistently expressed his  frustration that the United States was bearing the lion's share of  responsibility.   There is also an interview that Ambassador Bolton had given, I think  in August, about the conversation, where he said it was a perfectly  appropriate conversation. I think that information is publicly  available now.   So again, to move that into a change in proceeding, so to speak, I  think is not correct. The evidence that has already been presented, an  accusation that if you get into witnesses, and I will do this very  briefly--if we get down the road on the witness issues, let's be clear,  it should not be--I certainly can't dictate to this body--it should  certainly not be, though, that the House managers get John Bolton, and  the President's lawyers get no witnesses. We would expect that if they  are going to get witnesses, we will get witnesses, and those witnesses  would then--but all of that, just to be clear, changes the nature and  scope of the proceedings. They didn't ask for it before.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S660, January 29, 2020, first column, the following  appears:  Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Maine.    Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question for the House managers  I will send to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator King's question for the House managers reads as follows:         Mr. Rudolph Giuliani was in Ukraine exclusively on a       political errand--by his own admission--so doesn't the       President's mention of Giuliani by name in the July 25th call       conclusively establish the real purpose of the call?    Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, Mr.  Giuliani played a key role in President Trump's monthslong scheme to  pressure Ukraine to announce political investigations to benefit the  President's reelection campaign. Remarkably, the President's defense is  wrapping themselves in Rudy Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine while  trying to minimize his role.   There is overwhelming evidence--not just testimony but texts, call  records, and other corroborating documents--establishing Mr. Giuliani's  key role in executing the President's pressure campaign beginning in  early spring 2019 with a smear campaign against Ambassador Yovanovitch  and then throughout the summer. Everyone knew that Rudy Giuliani was  the gatekeeper to the President on Ukraine.   On May 10, Mr. Giuliani canceled the trip to Ukraine, during which he  planned to dig up dirt on former Vice President Biden and on a  discredited conspiracy theory after his plans became public. He  admitted: ``We're not meddling in an election, we're meddling in an  investigation.'' He explained that someone can say it is improper, and  this isn't--``[Someone] could say it's improper. And this isn't foreign  policy--I'm asking them to do an investigation that they're already  doing and that other people are telling them to stop.'' He was talking  about the investigations of the Bidens.   During a May 10 appearance on FOX News, Giuliani also said that he  canceled his trip because there are enemies of Trump's around President  Zelensky.   Mr. Giuliani's associate Lev Parnas produced a set of documents to  the House Intelligence Committee that included a letter--and I believe  we have slide 50 here--Mr. Giuliani sent to President-elect Zelensky  during this time period. In the letter dated May 10, Mr. Giuliani  informed Zelensky that he represented President Trump as a private  citizen, not as President of the United States.   He also requested a meeting with President Zelensky on May 13 and 14,  along with Victoria Toensing, in his ``capacity as personal counsel to  President Trump and with his knowledge and consent.''   Mr. Giuliani confirmed President Trump's knowledge of actions with  regard to Ukraine, stating: ``He . . . knows what I'm doing, sure, as  his lawyer.'' He added:         My only client is the president of the United States. He's       the one I have an obligation to report to, tell him what       happened.    President Trump repeatedly instructed senior American and Ukrainian  officials to talk to Rudy, demonstrating that Mr. Giuliani was a key  player in the corrupt scheme.   In the May 23 Oval Office meeting to discuss Ukraine policy,  President Trump directed his handpicked three amigos to talk to Rudy.  In response, Ambassador Sondland testified: ``Secretary Perry,  Ambassador Volker and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine  matters at the express direction of the President of the United  States.''   After two explosive White House meetings on July 10 in which  Ambassador Sondland explicitly conveyed the President's demand for  political investigations to Ukrainian officials, top Ukrainian aide  Andriy Yermak texted Ambassador Volker: ``I feel that the key for many  things is Rudy.''   And what was Rudy asking? Investigations of two American citizens-- not corruption in general; investigations. In fact, he wasn't even  asking for an investigation; he was just asking for an announcement of  an investigation so that American citizens--the Bidens--could be  smeared.   On the July 25 call with President Zelensky, President Trump  mentioned Rudy Giuliani by name no less than four times and informed  Zelensky that Rudy very much knows what is happening. He told President  Zelensky: ``Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man.'' He added, ``Rudy  very much knows what is happening.''   In August, Mr. Giuliani met with a top Ukrainian aide and conveyed  that Ukraine must issue a public statement announcing investigations.   Ambassador Sondland and Volker then worked closely with Giuliani and  the Ukrainians to ensure that the planned statement would meet Mr.  Giuliani's demands. Specifically, Mr. Giuliani insisted that the  statement include specific references to Burisma and the 2016 election  and Biden.    Throughout this process, Sondland stated that he knew that they  needed the approval of Giuliani for the press statement and that they  knew Giuliani represented the interest of the President.   Rudy Giuliani admitted on live television to pressuring Ukraine to  look into Joe Biden--not into corruption; into Joe Biden.   In September 2019, Chris Cuomo asked Giuliani: ``So you did ask  Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?''   In response, Giuliani insisted: ``Of course I did.''  [[Page S684]]    Mr. Giuliani insisted that Ukraine look at an American citizen on  behalf of his client, President Trump.   Finally, during the pendency of the impeachment proceedings, Mr.  Giuliani has not ceased in his efforts to dig up dirt to benefit the  President.   In December, he again traveled to Ukraine to meet with Ukrainian  officials, which he described as a secret assignment, and after which,  the President reportedly called him immediately upon landing and asked,  ``What did you get?'' to which Mr. Giuliani responded, ``More than you  can imagine.''   It is worth noting that in Ms. Raskin's presentation about Giuliani-- --   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Manager NADLER.--he repeated requests for investigations into  Biden, not into corruption.
