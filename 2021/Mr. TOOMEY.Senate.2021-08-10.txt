 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  notice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention related to  an eviction moratorium be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:      DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention      Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions in Communities With           Substantial or High Transmission of COVID-19 To Prevent           the Further Spread of COVID-19        AGENCY: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),       Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).        ACTION: Agency Order.        SUMMARY: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human       Services (HHS) announces a new Order under Section 361 of the       Public Health Service Act to temporarily halt residential       evictions in communities with substantial or high       transmission of COVID-19 to prevent the further spread of       COVID-19.        DATES: This Order is effective August 3, 2021 through       October 3, 2021.        FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tiffany Brown, Deputy       Chief of Staff, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,       1600 Clifton Road NE, MS H21-10, Atlanta, GA 30329. Phone:       404-639-7000. Email: [emailÂ protected].        SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:      Background        On September 4, 2020, the CDC Director issued an Order       temporarily halting evictions in the United States for the       reasons described therein. That Order was set to expire on       December 31, 2020, subject to further extension,       modification, or rescission. Section 502 of Title V, Division       N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the       Order until January 31, 2021, and approved the Order as an       exercise of the CDC's authority under Section 361 of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 264). With the extension       of the Order, Congress also provided $25 billion for       emergency rental assistance for the payment of rent and       rental arrears. Congress later provided an additional $21.55       billion in emergency rental assistance when it passed the       American Rescue Plan. The Order was extended multiple times       due to the changing public health landscape and expired on       July 31, 2021 after what was intended to be the final       extension. Absent an unexpected change in the trajectory of       the pandemic, CDC did not plan to extend the Order further.        Following the recent surge in cases brought forth by the       highly transmissible Delta variant, the CDC Director now       issues a new Order temporarily halting evictions for persons       in counties or U.S. territories experiencing substantial or       high rates of transmission, for the reasons described herein.       It is more limited in scope than prior orders, intended to       target specific areas of the country where cases are rapidly       increasing, which likely would be exacerbated by mass       evictions.        Accordingly, subject to the limitations listed in the new       Order, a landlord, owner of a residential property, or person       with a legal right to pursue eviction or possessory action,       shall not evict any covered person from any residential       property in any county or U.S. territory while the county or       territory is experiencing substantial or high levels of       community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2. This Order will       expire on October 3, 2021, but is subject to further       extension, modification, or rescission based on public health       circumstances.        A copy of the Order is provided below. A copy of the signed       Order and Declaration form can be found at https:// www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-eviction- declaration.html.      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of           Health and Human Services      Order Under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42           U.S.C. 264) and 42 Code of Federal Regulations 70.2      Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions in Communities With           Substantial or High Levels of Community Transmission of           COVID-19 To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19      Summary        The U.S. Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) is issuing a       new order temporarily halting evictions in counties with       heightened levels of community transmission in order to       respond to recent, unexpected developments in the trajectory       of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the rise of the Delta  [[Page S6263]]       variant. It is intended to target specific areas of the       country where cases are rapidly increasing, which likely       would be exacerbated by mass evictions. Accordingly, subject       to the limitations under ``Applicability,'' a landlord, owner       of a residential property, or other person with a legal right       to pursue eviction or possessory action, shall not evict any       covered person from any residential property in any county or       U.S. territory while the county or territory is experiencing       substantial or high levels of community transmission of SARS-      CoV-2.      Definitions        ``Available government assistance'' means any governmental       rental or housing payment benefits available to the       individual or any household member.        ``Available housing'' means any available, unoccupied       residential property, or other space for occupancy in any       seasonal or temporary housing, that would not violate       federal, state, or local occupancy standards and that would       not result in an overall increase of housing cost to such       individual.        ``Covered person'' means any tenant, lessee, or resident of       a residential property who provides to their landlord, the       owner of the residential property, or other person with a       legal right to pursue eviction or a possessory action, a       declaration under penalty of perjury indicating that:        (1) The individual has used best efforts to obtain all       available governmental assistance for rent or housing;        (2) The individual either (i) earned no more than $99,000       (or $198,000 if filing jointly) in Calendar Year 2020 or       expects to earn no more than $99,000 in annual income for       Calendar Year 2021 (or no more than $198,000 if filing a       joint tax return), (ii) was not required to report any income       in 2020 to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or (iii)       received an Economic Impact Payment (stimulus check).        (3) The individual is unable to pay the full rent or make a       full housing payment due to substantial loss of household       income, loss of compensable hours of work or wages, a lay-      off, or extraordinary out-of-pocket medical expenses;        (4) The individual is using best efforts to make timely       partial rent payments that are as close to the full rent       payment as the individual's circumstances may permit, taking       into account other nondiscretionary expenses;        (5) Eviction would likely render the individual homeless--      or force the individual to move into and reside in close       quarters in a new congregate or shared living setting--      because the individual has no other available housing       options; and        (6) The individual resides in a U.S. county experiencing       substantial or high rates of community transmission levels of       SARS-CoV-2 as defined by CDC.        ``Evict'' and ``Eviction'' means any action by a landlord,       owner of a residential property, or other person with a legal       right to pursue eviction or possessory action, to remove or       cause the removal of a covered person from a residential       property. This definition also does not prohibit foreclosure       on a home mortgage.        ``Residential property'' means any property leased for       residential purposes, including any house, building, mobile       home or land in a mobile home park, or similar dwelling       leased for residential purposes, but shall not include any       hotel, motel, or other guest house rented to a temporary       guest or seasonal tenant as defined under the laws of the       state, territorial, tribal, or local jurisdiction.        ``State'' shall have the same definition as under 42 CFR       70.1, meaning ``any of the 50 states, plus the District of       Columbia.''        ``U.S. territory'' shall have the same definition as under       42 CFR 70.1, meaning ``any territory (also known as       possessions) of the United States, including American Samoa,       Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Commonwealth of       Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.''      Statement of Intent        This Order shall be interpreted and implemented in a manner       as to achieve the following objectives:         Mitigating the spread of COVID-19 within crowded,       congregate or shared living settings, or through unsheltered       homelessness;         Mitigating the further spread of COVID-19 from one       state or territory into any other state or territory;         Mitigating the further spread of COVID-19 by       temporarily suspending the eviction of covered persons from       residential property for nonpayment of rent; and         Supporting response efforts to COVID-19 at the       federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal levels.      Background      COVID-19 in the United States        Since January 2020, the respiratory disease known as       ``COVID-19,'' caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2), has       spread globally, including cases reported in all fifty states       within the United States, plus the District of Columbia and       U.S. territories. As of August 3, 2021, there have been       almost 200 million cases of COVID-19 globally, resulting in       over 4,240,000 deaths. Almost 35,000,000 cases have been       identified in the United States, with new cases reported       daily, and almost 610,000 deaths have been attributed to the       disease. A renewed surge in cases in the United States began       in early July 2021; case counts rose from 19,000 cases on       July 1, 2021 to 103,000 cases on July 30, 2021. Forecasted       case counts predict that cases will continue to rise over the       next four weeks.        The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads very easily and       sustainably between people, particularly those who are in       close contact with one another (within about 6 feet, but       occasionally over longer distances), mainly through       respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs,       sneezes, or talks. Individuals without symptoms can also       spread the virus. Among adults, the risk for severe illness       from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at       highest risk. Severe illness means that persons with COVID-19       may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator       to help them breathe, and may be fatal. People of any age       with certain underlying medical conditions (e.g., cancer,       obesity, serious heart conditions, or diabetes) are at       increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.        New variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally, several       of which have been identified as variants of concern,       including the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants. These       variants of concern have evidence of an increase in       transmissibility, which may lead to higher incidence.        Currently, the Delta variant is the predominant SARS-CoV-2       strain circulating in the United States, estimated to account       for over 82% of cases as of July 17, 2021. The Delta variant       has demonstrated increased levels of transmissibility       compared to other variants. Furthermore, early evidence       suggests that people who are vaccinated and become infected       with the Delta variant may transmit the virus to others.        Transmission of the Delta variant has led to accelerated       community transmission in the United States. CDC recommends       assessing the level of community transmission using, at a       minimum, two metrics: new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons       in the last 7 days and percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2       diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests in the last 7       days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission       values as low, moderate, substantial, or high. As of August       1, 2021, over 80% of the U.S. counties were classified as       experiencing substantial or high levels of community       transmission. In areas of substantial or high transmission,       CDC recommends community leaders encourage vaccination and       universal masking in indoor public spaces in addition to       other layered prevention strategies to prevent further       spread.        COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available in the United       States, and vaccination is recommended for all people 12       years of age and older. Three COVID-19 vaccines are currently       authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for       emergency use: Two mRNA vaccines and one viral vector       vaccine, each of which has been determined to be safe and       effective against COVID-19. As of July 28, 2021, over 163       million people in the United States (57.6% of the population       12 years or older) have been fully vaccinated and over 189       million people in the United States (66.8% of the       population 12 years or older) have received at least one       dose. Changes in vaccine uptake and the extreme       transmissibility of the Delta variant have resulted in       rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, primarily and       disproportionately affecting the unvaccinated population.        The COVID-19 vaccination effort has a slower rate of       penetration among the populations most likely to experience       eviction. In combination with the continued underlying COVID-      19 spread, and the overlapping factors described above, this       creates considerable risk for rapid transmission of COVID-19       in high-risk settings.        In the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria--like       quarantine, isolation, and social distancing--can be an       effective public health measure utilized to prevent the       spread of communicable disease. Eviction moratoria facilitate       self-isolation and self-quarantine by people who become ill       or who are at risk of transmitting COVID-19.        Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic       Security (CARES) Act (Pub. L. 116-136) to aid individuals and       businesses adversely affected by COVID-19 in March 2020.       Section 4024 of the CARES Act provided a 120-day moratorium       on eviction filings as well as other protections for tenants       in certain rental properties with federal assistance or       federally related mortgage financing. These protections       helped alleviate the public health consequences of tenant       displacement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act       eviction moratorium expired on July 24, 2020. The protections       in the CARES Act supplemented temporary eviction moratoria       and rent freezes implemented by governors and other local       officials using emergency powers.        Researchers estimated that this temporary federal       moratorium provided relief to over one-quarter a material       portion of the nation's roughly 43 million renters. The CARES       act also provided funding streams for emergency rental       assistance; surveys estimate that this assistance became       available to the public through rental assistance programs by       July 2020.        The Federal moratorium provided by the CARES Act, however,       did not reach all renters. Many renters who fell outside the       scope of the Federal moratorium were instead protected under       state and local moratoria. In early March 2021, the Census       Household Pulse Survey estimated that 6.4 million households       were behind on rent and just under half fear imminent       eviction. In 2016, research showed that there were 3.6       million eviction filings and 1.5 million eviction judgments       over the span of a whole year, meaning that the pandemic       would cause a wave of  [[Page S6264]]       evictions on a scale that would be unprecedented in modern       times. A large portion of those who are evicted may move into       close quarters in shared housing or, as discussed below,       become homeless, thus becoming at higher risk of COVID-19.        On September 4, 2020, the CDC Director issued an Order       temporarily halting evictions in the United States for the       reasons described therein. That Order was set to expire on       December 31, 2020, subject to further extension,       modification, or rescission. Section 502 of Title V, Division       N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the       Order until January 31, 2021, and approved the Order as an       exercise of the CDC's authority under Section 361 of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 264). With the extension       of the Order, Congress also provided $25 billion for       emergency rental assistance for the payment of rent and       rental arrears. Congress later provided an additional $21.55       billion in emergency rental assistance when it passed the       American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The Order was extended       multiple times due to the changing public health landscape       and expired on July 31, 2021 after what was intended to be       the final extension. Absent an unexpected change in the       trajectory of the pandemic, CDC did not plan to extend the       Order further.        Following the recent surge in cases brought forth by the       highly transmissible Delta variant, the CDC Director now       issues a new Order temporarily halting evictions for persons       in counties experiencing substantial or high rates of       transmission, for the reasons described herein. This Order       will expire on October 3, 2021, but is subject to further       extension, modification, or rescission based on public health       circumstances.        Researchers estimate that, in 2020, Federal, state, and       local eviction moratoria led to over 1.5 million fewer       evictions filings than the previous year. Additional research       shows that, despite the CDC eviction moratorium leading to an       estimated 50% decrease in eviction filings compared to the       historical average, there have still been over 450,000       eviction filings during the pandemic just within       approximately 31 cities and six states with more readily       available data. This data covers approximately 1 in 4 renter       households in the country, suggesting high demand and       likelihood of mass evictions nationwide.      Eviction, Crowding, and Interstate Transmission of COVID-19        By February 10, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury       had paid all of the $25 billion made available by the       Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 to states, territories,       localities and tribes for the purpose of providing emergency       rental assistance to eligible households in their       jurisdictions. Additionally, as directed in the Act, Treasury       has also made available 40 percent--more than $8.6 billion--      of the additional funding to states, territories and       localities for emergency rental assistance provided in the       American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. While some emergency rental       assistance programs were slow to open, every State program       had opened by early June. Based on data collected from       grantees, Treasury reports that over 85,000 renter households       received rental and utility assistance to support their       housing stability by the end of March and this number       increased to more than 100,000 in April, more than 156,000 in       May and over 290,000 in June. Though emergency rental       assistance has clearly started to reach increasing numbers of       families over recent months, state and local agencies have       hundreds of thousands of applications for assistance that       currently remain outstanding as programs accelerate their       activity. The level of assistance continued to increase in       June, with nearly 300,000 households served. Based on       analysis of grantee reporting, Treasury believes that the       monthly deployment of rental assistance by state and local       emergency rental assistance programs will continue to       increase from the significant deployment in June. In addition       to Emergency Rental Assistance, there are coordinated efforts       across Federal agencies to--in partnership with states and       localities--promote eviction prevention strategies.        Recent data from the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey       demonstrates that just under half of households behind on       rent believe that an eviction is likely in the next two       months. A surge in evictions could lead to the immediate and       significant movement of large numbers of persons from lower       density to higher density housing at a time in the United       States when the highly transmissible Delta variant is driving       COVID-19 cases at an unprecedented rate.        Evicted renters must move, which leads to multiple outcomes       that increase the risk of COVID-19 spread. Specifically, many       evicted renters move into close quarters in shared housing or       other congregate settings. These moves may require crossing       state borders. According to the 2017 Census Bureau American       Housing Survey, 32% of renters reported that they would move       in with friends or family members upon eviction, which would       introduce new household members and potentially increase       household crowding. Studies show that COVID-19 transmission       occurs readily within households. The secondary attack rate       in households has been estimated to be 17%, and household       contacts are estimated to be 6 times more likely to become       infected by an index case of COVID-19 than other close       contacts. A study of pregnant women in New York City showed       that women in large households (greater number of residents       per household) were three times as likely to test positive       for SARS-CoV-2 than those in smaller households, and those in       neighborhoods with greater household crowding (>1 resident       per room) were twice as likely to test positive. Throughout       the United States, counties with the highest proportion of       crowded households have experienced COVID-19 mortality rates       2.6 times those of counties with the lowest proportion of       crowded households.        Shared housing is not limited to friends and family. It       includes a broad range of settings, including transitional       housing and domestic violence and abuse shelters. Special       considerations exist for such housing because of the       challenges of maintaining social distance. Residents often       gather closely or use shared equipment, such as kitchen       appliances, laundry facilities, stairwells, and elevators.       Residents may have unique needs, such as disabilities,       chronic health conditions, cognitive decline, or limited       access to technology, and thus may find it more difficult to       take actions to protect themselves from COVID-19. CDC       recommends that shelters provide new residents with a clean       mask, keep them isolated from others, screen for symptoms at       entry, or arrange for medical evaluations as needed depending       on symptoms. Accordingly, an influx of new residents at       facilities that offer support services could potentially       overwhelm staff and, if recommendations are not followed,       lead to exposures.        Modeling studies and observational data from the pre-      vaccine phase of the COVID-19 pandemic comparing incidence       between states that implemented and lifted eviction moratoria       indicate that evictions substantially contribute to COVID-19       transmission. In mathematical models where eviction led       exclusively to sharing housing with friends or family,       lifting eviction moratoria led to a 30% increased risk of       contracting COVID-19 among people who were evicted and those       with whom they shared housing after eviction. Compared to a       scenario where no evictions occurred, the models also       predicted a 4%-40% increased risk of infection, even for       those who did not share housing, as a result of increased       overall transmission. The authors estimated that anywhere       from 1,000 to 100,000 excess cases per million population       could be attributable to evictions depending on the eviction       and infection rates.        An analysis of observational data from state-based eviction       moratoria in 43 states and the District of Columbia showed       significant increases in COVID-19 incidence and mortality       approximately 2-3 months after eviction moratoria were       lifted. Specifically, the authors compared the COVID-19       incidence and mortality rates in states that lifted their       moratoria with the rates in states that maintained their       moratoria. In these models, the authors accounted for time-      varying indicators of each state's test count as well as       major public-health interventions including lifting stay-at-      home orders, school closures, and mask mandates. After       adjusting for these other changes, they found that the       incidence of COVID-19 in states that lifted their moratoria       was 1.6 times that of states that did not at 10 weeks post-      lifting (95% CI 1.0, 2.3), a ratio that grew to 2.1 at 16       weeks (CI 1.1, 3.9). Similarly, they found that mortality in       states that lifted their moratoria was 1.6 times that of       states that did not at 7 weeks post-lifting (CI 1.2, 2.3), a       ratio that grew to 5.4 at 16 weeks (CI 3.1, 9.3). The       authors estimated that, nationally, over 433,000 cases of       COVID-19 and over 10,000 deaths could be attributed to       lifting state moratoria.        Although data are limited, available evidence suggests       evictions lead to interstate spread of COVID-19 in two ways.       First, an eviction may lead the evicted members of a       household to move across state lines. Of the 35 million       people in America who move each year, 15% move to a new       state. Second, even if a particular eviction, standing alone,       would not always result in interstate displacement, the       mass evictions that would occur in the absence of this       Order would inevitably increase the interstate spread of       COVID-19. This Order cannot effectively mitigate       interstate transmission of COVID-19 without covering       intrastate evictions (evictions occurring within the       boundaries of a state or territory), as the level of       spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulting from these evictions can       lead to SARS-CoV-2 transmission across state borders.        Moreover, intrastate spread facilitates interstate spread       in the context of communicable disease spread, given the       nature of infectious disease. In the aggregate, the mass-      scale evictions that will likely occur in the absence of this       Order in areas of substantial or high transmission will       inevitably increase interstate spread of COVID-19.      Eviction, Homelessness, and COVID-19 Transmission        Evicted individuals without access to support or other       assistance options may become homeless, including older       adults or those with underlying medical conditions, who are       more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19 than the       general population. In Seattle-King County, 5-15% of people       experiencing homelessness between 2018 and 2020 cited       eviction as the primary reason for becoming homeless.       Additionally, some individuals and families who are evicted       may originally stay with family or friends, but subsequently       seek homeless services. Data collection by an emergency       shelter in Columbus, Ohio, showed that 35.4% of families and       11.4% of single adults reported an eviction as the primary or       secondary reason for their seeking shelter.  [[Page S6265]]         Extensive outbreaks of COVID-19 have been identified in       homeless shelters. In Seattle, Washington, a network of three       related homeless shelters experienced an outbreak that led to       43 cases among residents and staff members. In Boston,       Massachusetts, universal COVID-19 testing at a single shelter       revealed 147 cases, representing 36% of shelter residents.       COVID-19 testing in a single shelter in San Francisco led to       the identification of 101 cases (67% of those tested). Data       from 634 universal diagnostic testing events at homeless       shelters in 21 states show an average of 6% positivity among       shelter clients. Data comparing the incidence or severity of       COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness directly to       the general population are limited. However, during the 15-      day period of the outbreak in Boston, MA, researchers       estimated a cumulative incidence of 46.3 cases of COVID-19       per 1000 persons experiencing homelessness, as compared to       1.9 cases per 1000 among Massachusetts adults (pre-print).        Among other things, CDC guidance recommends increasing       physical distance between beds in homeless shelters, which is       likely to decrease capacity, while community transmission of       COVID-19 is occurring. To adhere to this guidance, shelters       have limited the number of people served throughout the       United States. In many places, considerably fewer beds are       available to individuals who become homeless. Shelters that       do not adhere to the guidance, and operate at ordinary or       increased occupancy, are at greater risk for the types of       outbreaks described above.      Application of COVID-19 Prevention Strategies Based on           Community Transmission        CDC recommends strengthening or adding effective COVID-19       mitigation strategies in communities with considerable       transmission risk. As discussed above, CDC guidance specifies       that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, should wear       masks in indoor and public settings in communities       experiencing substantial or high rates of community       transmission. Similarly, CDC guidance for homeless shelters       recommends maintaining layered COVID-19 precautions as long       as community transmission is occurring and provides options       for scaling back precautions when community transmission is       low.        Eviction moratoria represent a COVID-19 transmission       prevention measure that can similarly be applied when the       epidemiological context is appropriate, for example in       communities with substantial or high transmission of COVID-      19. Prevention strategies like these should only be relaxed       or lifted after two weeks of continuous sustained improvement       in the level of community transmission. In areas with low or       no SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with testing capacity in place       to detect early introduction or increases in spread of the       virus, layered prevention strategies might be removed one at       a time while monitoring closely for any evidence that COVID-      19 cases are increasing. Decisions to add or remove       prevention strategies should be based on local data and       public health recommendations. The emergence of more       transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta, increases       the urgency for public health agencies and other       organizations to collaboratively monitor the status of the       pandemic in their communities and continue to apply layered       prevention strategies.      Persons at Higher Risk of Eviction May Also Be at Higher Risk           of Being Unvaccinated        Communities with high rates of eviction have been shown to       have lower coverage of COVID-19 vaccination--a focus for       current vaccination campaigns. A study in the spring of 2021       showed that counties with high social vulnerability (i.e.,       social and structural factors associated with adverse health       outcome inclusive of socioeconomic indicators related to risk       of eviction)had lower levels of COVID-19 vaccination.      CDC Eviction Moratorium        The Department of the Treasury has made funding available       to states, territories, localities, and Tribal governments,       which continue to distribute emergency rental assistance       funds that may help mitigate spikes in COVID-19 transmission       due to increases in evictions. Alongside other federal and       state efforts to prevent evictions, these funds are expected       to make a meaningful difference for hundreds of thousands of       people who are expected to receive the rental assistance.        On September 4, 2020, the CDC Director issued an Order       temporarily halting evictions in the United States for the       reasons described therein. That Order was set to expire on       December 31, 2020, subject to further extension,       modification, or rescission. Section 502 of Title V, Division       N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the       Order until January 31, 2021. With the extension of the       Order, Congress also provided $25 billion for emergency       rental assistance for the payment of rent and rental arrears.       Congress later provided an additional $21.55 billion in       emergency rental assistance when it passed the American       Rescue Plan.        On January 29, 2021, following an assessment of the ongoing       pandemic, the CDC Director renewed the Order until March 31,       2021. On March 28, the CDC Director renewed the Order until       June 30, 2021. On June 24, the CDC Director renewed the Order       until July 31, 2021 (July Order). The CDC Director indicated       that the July Order would be the final extension of the       nationwide eviction moratorium absent an unexpected change in       the trajectory of the pandemic. Unfortunately, the rise of       the Delta variant and corresponding rise in cases in numerous       counties in the United States have altered the trajectory of       the pandemic. As a result, CDC is issuing this narrower, more       targeted Order to temporarily halt evictions in the hardest       hit areas. Without this Order, evictions in these areas would       likely exacerbate the increase in cases. To the extent any       provision of this Order conflicts with prior Orders, this       Order is controlling.      Applicability        This Order applies in U.S. counties experiencing       substantial and high levels of community transmission levels       of SARS-CoV-2 as defined by CDC, as of August 3, 2021. If a       U.S. county that is not covered by this Order as of August 3,       2021 later experiences substantial or high levels of       community transmission while this Order is in effect, then       that county will become subject to this Order as of the date       the county begins experiencing substantial or high levels of       community transmission. If a U.S. county that is covered by       this Order no longer experiences substantial or high levels       of community transmission for 14 consecutive days, then this       Order will no longer apply in that county, unless and until       the county again experiences substantial or high levels of       community transmission while this Order is in effect.        This Order does not apply in any state, local, territorial,       or tribal area with a moratorium on residential evictions       that provides the same or greater level of public-health       protection than the requirements listed in this Order or to       the extent its application is prohibited by Federal court       order. In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 264(e), this Order does       not preclude state, local, territorial, and tribal       authorities from imposing additional requirements that       provide greater public-health protection and are more       restrictive than the requirements in this Order.        This Order is a temporary eviction moratorium to prevent       the further spread of COVID-19. This Order does not relieve       any individual of any obligation to pay rent, make a housing       payment, or comply with any other obligation that the       individual may have under a tenancy, lease, or similar       contract. Nothing in this Order precludes the charging or       collecting of fees, penalties, or interest as a result of the       failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely       basis, under the terms of any applicable contract.        Nothing in this Order precludes evictions based on a       tenant, lessee, or resident: (1) Engaging in criminal       activity while on the premises; (2) threatening the health or       safety of other residents; (3) damaging or posing an       immediate and significant risk of damage to property; (4)       violating any applicable building code, health ordinance, or       similar regulation relating to health and safety; or (5)       violating any other contractual obligation, other than the       timely payment of rent or similar housing-related payment       (including non-payment or late payment of fees, penalties, or       interest).        Any evictions for nonpayment of rent initiated prior to       issuance of this Order but not yet completed, are subject to       this Order. Any tenant, lessee, or resident of a residential       property who previously submitted a Declaration, still       qualifies as a ``Covered Person'' and is still present in a       rental unit is entitled to protections under this Order. Any       eviction that was completed before issuance of this Order       including from August 1 through August 3, 2021 is not subject       to this Order, as it does not operate retroactively.        Under this Order, covered persons may be evicted for       engaging in criminal activity while on the premises. But       covered persons may not be evicted on the sole basis that       they are alleged to have committed the crime of trespass (or       similar state-law offense) where the underlying activity is a       covered person remaining in a residential property for       nonpayment of rent. Permitting such evictions would result in       substantially more evictions overall, thus increasing the       risk of disease transmission as otherwise covered persons       move into congregate settings or experience homelessness.       This result would be contrary to the stated objectives of       this Order, and therefore would diminish their effectiveness.       Moreover, to the extent such criminal trespass laws are       invoked to establish criminal activity solely based on a       tenant, lessee, or resident of a residential property       remaining in a residential property despite the nonpayment of       rent, such invocation conflicts with this Order and is       preempted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 264(e).        Individuals who are confirmed to have, who have been       exposed to, or who might have COVID-19 and take reasonable       precautions to not spread the disease may not be evicted on       grounds that they may pose a health or safety threat to other       residents.        This Order is in effect through October 3, 2021, based on       the current and projected epidemiological context of SARS-      CoV-2 transmission throughout the United States. This       timeframe will allow the assessment of natural changes to       COVID-19 incidence, the influences of new variants,       additional distribution of emergency rental assistance funds,       and the expansion of COVID-19 vaccine uptake.      Declaration Forms        To qualify for the protections of this Order, a tenant,       lessee, or resident of a residential property must provide a       completed and signed copy of a declaration with the elements       listed in the definition of ``Covered person'' to their       landlord, owner of the residential property where they live,       or other person who has a right to have them evicted  [[Page S6266]]       or removed from where they live. To assist tenants and       landlords, the CDC created a standardized declaration form       that can be downloaded here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ 2019-ncov/downloads/declaration-form.pdf.        Tenants, lessees, and residents of residential property are       not obligated to use the CDC form. Any written document that       an eligible tenant, lessee, or resident of residential       property presents to their landlord will comply with this       Order, as long as it contains the required elements of       ``Covered person'' as described in this Order. In they meet       the elements of ``Covered person'' in other languages.        All declarations, regardless of form used, must be signed,       and must include a statement that the tenant, lessee, or       resident of a residential property understands that they       could be liable for perjury for any false or misleading       statements or omissions in the declaration. This Order does       not preclude a landlord challenging the truthfulness of a       tenant's, lessee's, or resident's declaration in court, as       permitted under state or local law.        In certain circumstances, such as individuals filing a       joint tax return, it may be appropriate for one member of the       residence to provide an executed declaration on behalf of the       other adult residents party to the lease, rental agreement,       or housing contract. The declaration may be signed and       transmitted either electronically or by hard copy.        As long as the information in a previously signed       declaration submitted under a previous order remains truthful       and accurate, covered persons do not need to submit a new       declaration under this Order. However, eligibility for       protection will be based on the terms of this Order.      Determination, Findings and Action        For the reasons described herein, I have determined based       on the information below that issuing a temporary halt in       evictions in counties experiencing substantial or high levels       of COVID-19 transmission constitutes a reasonably necessary       measure under 42 CFR 70.2 to prevent the further spread of       COVID-19 throughout the United States. I have further       determined that measures by states, localities, or       territories that do not meet or exceed these minimum       protections are insufficient to prevent the interstate spread       of COVID-19.        State and local jurisdictions continue to distribute       emergency rental assistance funds, provided by the Department       of Treasury, that will help avert a spate of evictions and       thus mitigate corresponding spikes in COVID-19 transmission.       Trends have dramatically worsened since June 2021 and       transmission is rapidly accelerating in the United States.        Congress has appropriated approximately $46 billion--of       which almost three-quarters is currently available to state       and local grantees--to help pay rent and rental arrears for       tenants who may otherwise be at high risk of eviction.       According to estimates based on the U.S. Census Household       Pulse Survey, approximately 6.9 million renter households       were behind on their rent in late June. At that time, about       4.6 million renter households were concerned that they could       not pay next month's rent. The successful delivery of those       funds by states and localities should greatly reduce the       incidence of eviction that would occur in the absence of that       support. However, many states and localities are still       ramping up the collection and processing of applications and       the delivery of assistance and putting in place other       eviction prevention strategies. It was only in the beginning       of June that all state-run emergency rental assistance       programs had opened for applications. If the moratorium is       not in place, a wave of evictions, on the order of hundreds       of thousands, could occur in late summer and early fall,       exacerbating the spread of COVID-19 among the significant       percentage of the population that remains unvaccinated. In       appropriating these emergency rental assistance funds,       Congress intended that the funding would work in concert with       the eviction moratorium, providing time for rental assistance       to reach eligible tenants and landlords to sustainably reduce       the threat of an eviction wave after an eviction moratorium       was no longer in effect. While the pace of assistance is       continuing to increase, without additional time for states       and localities to deliver this needed relief and engage in       other efforts to prevent evictions, a surge of evictions       would occur upon the conclusion of the national moratorium. A       surge in evictions would lead to immediate movement,       crowding, and increased stress on the homeless service       system. In combination with surging COVID-19 rates across the       country, and the overlapping factors described above, this       would create considerable risk for the rapid transmission of       COVID-19 in high-risk settings.        Based on the convergence of these issues, I have determined       that issuing a new Order temporarily halting evictions is       appropriate.        Accordingly, a landlord, owner of a residential property,       or other person with a legal right to pursue eviction or       possessory action shall not evict any covered person from any       residential property in any county or U.S. territory while       COVID-19 transmission is substantial or high and the relevant       state, county, locality, or territory has provided a level of       public-health protections below the requirements listed in       this Order.        This Order is not a rule within the meaning of the       Administrative Procedure Act (APA) but rather an emergency       action taken under the existing authority of 42 CFR 70.2. The       purpose of section 70.2, which was promulgated through       notice-and-comment rulemaking, is to enable CDC to take swift       steps to prevent contagion without having to seek a second       round of public comments and without a delay in effective       date.      Good Cause        In the event this Order qualifies as a rule under the APA,       there is good cause to dispense with prior public notice and       comment and a delay in effective date. See 5 U.S.C.       553(b)(B), (d)(3). Good cause exists, in sum, because the       public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and       the unpredictability of the trajectory of the pandemic make       it impracticable and contrary to the public health, and by       extension the public interest, to delay the issuance and       effective date of this Order.        I have determined that good cause exists because the public       health emergency caused by COVID-19 makes it impracticable       and contrary to the public health, and by extension the       public interest, to delay the issuance and effective date of       the Order. A delay in the effective date of the Order would       permit the occurrence of evictions--potentially on a mass       scale--that would have potentially significant public health       consequences. I conclude that the delay in the effective date       of the Order would defeat the purpose of the Order and       endanger the public health and, therefore, determine that       immediate action is necessary.        The rapidly changing nature of the pandemic requires not       only that CDC act swiftly, but also deftly to ensure that its       actions are commensurate with the threat. This necessarily       involves assessing evolving conditions that inform CDC's       determinations. Despite promising trends in the spring of       2021, the surge of cases spurred by the Delta variant has       confirmed that the fundamental public health threat--of the       risk of large numbers of residential evictions contributing       to the spread of COVID-19 throughout the United States--      continues to exist. Without this Order, there is every reason       to expect that evictions will increase dramatically at a time       when COVID-19 infections in the United States are increasing       sharply. It is imperative that public health authorities act       quickly to mitigate such an increase of evictions, which       could increase the likelihood of new spikes in SARS-CoV-2       transmission. Such mass evictions and the attendant public       health consequences would be very difficult to reverse.        For all of these reasons, I hereby conclude that immediate       action is again necessary and that notice-and-comment       rulemaking and a delay in effective date would be       impracticable and contrary to the public interest.      Miscellaneous        Similarly, if this Order qualifies as a rule under the APA,       the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has       determined that it would be an economically significant       regulatory action pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and a       major rule under Subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory       Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (the Congressional Review       Act or CRA), 5 U.S.C. 804(2). Thus, this action has been       reviewed by OIRA. CDC has determined that for the same       reasons given above, there would be good cause under the CRA       to make the requirements herein effective immediately. 5       U.S.C. 808(2).        If any provision of this Order, or the application of any       provision to any persons, entities, or circumstances, shall       be held invalid, the remainder of the provisions, or the       application of such provisions to any persons, entities, or       circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid,       shall remain valid and in effect.        This Order shall be enforced by federal authorities and       cooperating state and local authorities through the       provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571; 42 U.S.C. 243, 268, 271;       and 42 CFR 70.18. However, this Order has no effect on the       contractual obligations of renters to pay rent and shall not       preclude charging or collecting fees, penalties, or interest       as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing       payment on a timely basis, under the terms of any applicable       contract.      Criminal Penalties        Under 18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571; 42 U.S.C. 271; and 42 CFR       70.18, a person violating this Order may be subject to a fine       of no more than $100,000 or one year in jail, or both, if the       violation does not result in a death, or a fine of no more       than $250,000 or one year in jail, or both if the violation       results in a death, or as otherwise provided by law. An       organization violating this Order may be subject to a fine of       no more than $200,000 per event if the violation does not       result in a death or $500,000 per event if the violation       results in a death or as otherwise provided by law. The U.S.       Department of Justice may initiate criminal proceedings as       appropriate seeking imposition of these criminal penalties.      Notice to Cooperating State and Local Officials        Under 42 U.S.C. 243, the U.S. Department of Health and       Human Services is authorized to cooperate with and aid state       and local authorities in the enforcement of their quarantine       and other health regulations and to accept state and local       assistance in the enforcement of Federal quarantine rules and       regulations, including in the enforcement of this Order.      Notice of Available Federal Resources        While this Order to prevent eviction is effectuated to       protect the public health, the  [[Page S6267]]       states and units of local government are reminded that the       Federal Government has deployed unprecedented resources to       address the pandemic, including housing assistance.        The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the       Department of Agriculture, and the Department of the Treasury       have informed CDC that unprecedented emergency resources have       been appropriated through various Federal agencies that       assist renters and landlords during the pandemic, including       $46.55 billion to the Treasury through the Consolidated       Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan       (ARP). Furthermore, in 2020 44 states and 310 local       jurisdictions allocated about $3.9 billion toward emergency       rental assistance, largely from funds appropriated to HUD       from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security       (CARES). These three rounds of federal appropriations also       provided substantial resources for homeless services,       homeowner assistance, and supplemental stimulus and       unemployment benefits that low-income renters used to pay       rent.

Visit www.consumerfinance.gov/renthelp to access the       Rental Assistance Finder that connects renters and landlords       with the state and local programs that are distributing       billions of dollars in federal assistance. Relevant agencies       have informed CDC that forbearance policies for mortgages       backed by the federal government provide many landlords,       especially smaller landlords, with temporary relief as new       emergency rental assistance programs are deployed.        Treasury, HUD, and USDA grantees and program participants       play a critical role in prioritizing efforts to support this       goal. All communities should assess what resources have       already been allocated to prevent evictions and homelessness       through temporary rental assistance and homelessness       prevention, particularly to the most vulnerable households.        Treasury, HUD, and USDA stand at the ready to support       American communities in taking these steps to reduce the       spread of COVID-19 and maintain economic prosperity.        For program support, including technical assistance, please       visit www.hudexchange.info/programsupport. For further       information on HUD resources, tools, and guidance available       to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and local       officials are directed to visit https://www.hud.gov/  coronavirus. These tools include toolkits for Public Housing       Authorities and Housing Choice Voucher landlords related to       housing stability and eviction prevention, as well as similar       guidance for owners and renters in HUD-assisted multifamily       properties. Furthermore, tenants can visit       consumerfinance.gov/housing for up-to-date information on       rent relief options, protections, and key deadlines.
