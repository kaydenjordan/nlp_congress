 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete  my remarks before the 12:30 p.m. vote.    Madam President, 8 weeks ago today, the Senate passed  the CARES Act, an unprecedented $2.2 trillion package of legislation  aimed at providing relief as our country took steps to respond to the  threat of COVID-19.   Previously, we passed legislation to expand free access to testing  and paid leave, accelerate vaccines and treatments, and to support the  Federal agencies leading our pandemic response.   The CARES Act was designed to support the health of our citizens and  the economy. It included direct payments to American families, grants  to hospitals, and the Paycheck Protection Program--forgivable loans to  small businesses to keep their employees on the payroll. The program  was so successful that a month later, Congress approved the additional  $310 billion for PPP loans, $75 billion for hospitals, and $25 billion  for testing.   Georgia hospitals have received over $1.7 billion, including at least  $328 million for our rural businesses under the CARES Act.   I worked to include provisions in the CARES Act to expand rural  health and telehealth program. Our State has received more than  $800,000 from these programs. They are helping Georgians across our  State stay connected with their doctors from the safety of their own  homes.   In addition, our State and local governments have received $5.8  billion to help schools adjust to online learning, to provide  assistance for those who lost their jobs or homes, to keep our airports  running, and to help our communities respond and serve in this  challenging moment.   The action Congress took has helped to meet immediate challenges, but  it is clear the pandemic has caused significant human suffering and  staggering economic losses.   In the last 2 months, I have heard from hundreds suffering the  effects of this outbreak and the response: first responders, doctors,  and nurses on the frontline, small business owners and farmers who have  seen the viability of their businesses threatened, families who have  suffered job losses, children who are out of school, and food banks  that have seen an unprecedented surge in demand.   Before this pandemic, Americans were enjoying a thriving economy,  with the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. Under the leadership of  the Trump administration, more families were on their way to living the  American dream. Then, in late March, the day after the Senate passed  the CARES Act, we learned that a record 3.3 million workers had applied  for initial unemployment benefits in a single week. The total is now a  staggering 36.5 million Americans who filed initial jobless claims.  This is more than the combined populations of Georgia, Pennsylvania,  and Ohio.   In my State, more than one in three Georgians have lost their jobs.  Watching this unfold, despite the relief of the CARES Act, I recognize  that it is time to look beyond the immediate response and to focus on  our recovery. As a member of the President's Opening Up America Again  Congressional Group, I am putting my nearly three decades of experience  in building companies and creating jobs and opportunities to work for  Georgians. With my experience and the conversations I have had with  Georgians, I developed a U.S.A. Restoring and Igniting the Strength of  Our Economy plan--or U.S.A. Rise--to bring back our thriving economy.  The four pillars of the plan are Made in the U.S.A., Grown in the  U.S.A., Hiring in the U.S.A., and Families in the U.S.A. I started to  introduce legislative proposals based on this four-pillar framework  that incentivize companies to invest in America, to grow jobs, and to  help families.   I would like to highlight one of those pillars today, Families in the  U.S.A.   First, we mourn the loss of those to COVID-19. The toll of this has  devastated thousands of families. It is also clear that with economic  damage comes societal damage. Our country needed to take dramatic  actions to flatten the curve, but those steps meant most Americans were  confined to their homes. This meant work from home, school from home,  but also, in too many instances, lost jobs, isolation, depression,  suicide, and domestic, substance, and child abuse.   It is timely that May is Mental Health Awareness Month. In a recent  [[Page S2524]]  Atlanta Journal-Constitution op-ed, Eve Byrd and Jennifer Olsen of the  Cardinal Center wrote: ``Isolation is one of the cruelest components of  the outbreak.''   Last week, I spoke with the head of a mental health treatment  facility in Georgia. They are seeing a significant spike in those  reaching out for help. The waitlist is growing, and the demand for help  is rising rapidly. An emergency hotline run by the Substance Abuse and  Mental Services Administration in HHS saw a 1,000-percent increase in  calls in just 1 month. That was this April compared to last April.   I have spoken with local law enforcement officials who have seen a  serious spike in domestic abuse calls. The nationwide Crisis Text Line  has seen a 78-percent increase in texts related to domestic violence  across our country.   The millions of Americans who have lost their jobs or their  businesses are suffering.   Tiffany, a mother of three from College Park, GA, was furloughed from  her steady job stocking store shelves. She said: ``It is very  overwhelming when you have rent, when you have children to take care  of.'' When a parent loses their job, they lose much more. They lose  their ability to put food on the table, to pay rent, and the  uncertainty grows for children. It is vital to help families weather  this crisis.   We know that Americans who have a steady paycheck are more likely to  have stable, secure families, and children from stable families are  more likely to do well in school. That is why I have designed the USA  RISE Plan as an economic framework that takes the human cost of the  coronavirus into account. Helping families and job creation today will  allow parents to get back to work and reduce the fallout from this  pandemic from permanently impacting an entire generation.   Importantly, this does not mean we should expand the grip of the  Federal Government. An American Enterprise Institute report on  achieving the American dream, released just a few weeks ago, states:         The power of community has become all the more poignant as       we retreated more to isolated lives required by social       distancing. Oftentimes, local institutions and neighborhoods       have a greater influence on economic outcomes than what is       occurring at the Federal level.    Being in Washington working on behalf of our State, I see that local  impact firsthand. Often, these organizations are at the heart of our  communities. It is where people turn for help, for a sense of  belonging.   Churches and other nonprofits are doing amazing work during this very  difficult time. They have been providing childcare, meals, and other  support for family and children. For example, YMCAs are the largest  provider of childcare in Georgia. Many have stepped up to provide  childcare for essential workers. They are providing thousands of meals  each week to help out needy families.   That is why last week I introduced legislation, the Limiting Infant  Fatality and Empowering Nonprofit Organization Workforces Act, or LIFE  NOW Act. It allows larger nonprofits access to the Paycheck Protection  Program loans. These loans will help them keep their doors open and  continue to serve their communities while ensuring that no taxpayer  dollars go to abortion providers.   Yesterday, I introduced the Working Families Childcare Access Act.  This will give more working families more flexibility by allowing  parents to contribute more to their employer-sponsored dependent care  cafeteria flexible spending account, or FSA. If a family doesn't use  all their funds in 1 year, any leftover funds can be rolled over to the  following year. This will help families make plans for childcare as  they begin to go back to work.   I am continuing to work on additional legislation to provide families  with targeted relief--for example, a bill to codify the Trump  administration regulations to help Americans who recently lost their  jobs and their health insurance. The Trump administration expanded  short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans after President  Obama substantially restricted those plans just 2 months before he left  office. These plans had previously been available for nearly 20 years.  They are an affordable option for Americans who are in between jobs or  who have been laid off.   The dramatic economic numbers alone do not convey the full cost of  this pandemic--the futures impacted, the isolation, domestic abuse,  substance abuse, and suicide. As our country begins to look forward  amid the coronavirus pandemic, we must support job growth and families  to build strong futures.   In the coming weeks, I will introduce additional bills as part of the  USA RISE Plan aimed at incentivizing manufacturing in the United  States, helping our farmers and small business owners, and to ensure  that America is the best place in the world to do business.   While I continue to do all I can to fight COVID-19, I will also  continue to do all I can to help Georgia families and employers recover  and prosper.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
