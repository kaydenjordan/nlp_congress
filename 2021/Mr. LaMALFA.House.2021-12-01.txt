 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to announce tonight the  lighting of the Capitol Christmas tree on the west steps in just a few  minutes.   The tree each year is selected from a different national forest  around the country. This year the tree comes from the Six Rivers  National Forest in Northwest California, a four-county area I share  with Mr. Huffman from the Second District.   The marking of the lighting tonight indeed kicks off the Christmas  season here in Washington, D.C., here at the United States Capitol.   Forestry, of course, is a very important part of our life in northern  California and in the West, and positive forestry practices are  extremely important if we are ever going to control wildfire and not  harm the habitat and economies of our areas there.   I hope we can see in the lighting of the Capitol Christmas tree all  the good things that come with good forestry and the holiday season.   Merry Christmas.                            ____________________
