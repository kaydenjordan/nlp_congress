 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for organizing  this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Israel's 75th birthday and 75  years of the U.S.-Israel relationship.   The bipartisan alliance is vital to America's national security and  to our fight against terror, including the threat of Iran and its  proxies.   Last night, we witnessed the IDF neutralize dangerous PIJ in the Gaza  Strip. Day after day, as Israel is threatened, the Iron Dome stands  strong against those who seek to do its people harm, whether that is  Hamas or Hezbollah or Palestinian Jihad. I remain in steadfast support  of Israel's right to defend itself, because, as I said, Israel's  security is key to America's national security. It is the democracy in  the region.   Over 75 years, Israel has emerged as not only a beacon of democracy,  but also a leader of technologic, economic, and security, both in  Israel and, of course, in great support to the United States.   I have had the honor of visiting Israel many times and witnessed  firsthand the country's beauty and the people's resilience. It is a  homeland for Jews from around the world.   In my most recent trip, you can see and feel the palpable excitement  about the Abraham Accords as Israel continues to make history as it  normalizes with its Arab neighbors, expanding opportunities across the  region, security protection, economic opportunity.   Over the past month, I joined two Congressional delegations to Israel  with House leadership, showing Israel that our nations' strategic  relationship is both bipartisan and stronger than ever. Mazel Tov to  our most important Middle East ally, Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful to the gentleman for inviting me to  be here this evening.
