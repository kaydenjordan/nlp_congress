 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    First, Mr. President, a brief word on healthcare.  Senators Alexander and Murray continue to negotiate a bipartisan  package of legislation to stabilize our healthcare markets and lower  premiums, a process that began over the summer. From what I have heard,  they are down to a few final issues and are hopefully close to an  agreement that can be taken back to both of our caucuses. Congress  ought to show, through the work started by Senators Alexander and  Murray way back in July, that Congress can work in a bipartisan way on  healthcare, and we have no intention of going along with President  Trump's reckless sabotage of the Nation's healthcare law.   Last week, President Trump showed that he is willing to take a  wrecking ball to our Nation's healthcare for the sake of politics  without any regard to the people it would hurt: veterans, senior  citizens, kids, and folks struggling to afford insurance. President  Trump was so angry they couldn't repeal and replace, he instead said: I  am going to wreck the system. The problem is, it hurts millions of  innocent people all for pique and politics. He has shown he is willing  to put at risk the healthcare of millions of Americans. President  Trump's decision to end the cost-sharing program was an act of  impulsive malice with no benefit and no end.   This seems to be his MO. He throws red meat to his rightwing base,  whether it is on healthcare, immigration, Iran, or disaster aid. Then  he says to Congress: You fix it up. That is not the way to lead. That  is following. That is an act that exhibits no strength--no strength.   We want our President to be a strong leader. Every American does,  regardless of ideology, but when the President plays so many political  games that are not just harmless but that hurt people and then says to  Congress to clean it up, blaming Congress for the mess he created, it  doesn't work, it is not fair, it is not right, and it is the reason  that, except for his base, President Trump's numbers keep sliding. They  are flat now, and they are down below 40 percent. No President has had  such low numbers. By the way, it is not helping the Republican Party.  Numbers today show a record difference between whether people prefer  Democrats or Republicans, so I would urge him to stop these harmful,  almost malicious shenanigans and let us all work together for the good  of our country.   On healthcare, we in Congress should continue to shore up the  healthcare markets and lower premiums in a bipartisan way. We ought to  reject the path of President Trump's sabotage and destruction and  instead view a path of consensus and compromise. That is the way it has  to go. No side wins everything they want. That is not how the Founding  Fathers set up this country, otherwise we would be a dictatorship or a  country without checks and balances. We ought to work together to  improve our healthcare system, to lower costs for people, and to ensure  that more people have access to health coverage. We Democrats have been  pushing that for several months now.   I salute Senators Alexander and Murray for understanding that. They  have been in careful negotiations that represent the best first step  forward on healthcare. I hope we hear more from them on the status of  negotiations. I hope they can come to an agreement that includes  curtailing the sabotage I spoke of that the President is doing. I hope  Leader McConnell and I can support this bill together, and then maybe  even the House might pass it. The President has said, I think--we don't  know, it changes from day to day--but I think the most recent  pronouncement is that he might sign it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the GOP tax plan, as soon as today, we  will vote on the motion to proceed to the GOP budget resolution, which  includes instructions to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion, slash  Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and sets up, unfortunately for  everybody, the same destructive, partisan process on taxes that the GOP  used for healthcare called reconciliation. It says: We don't need you.  We are just going to rush it through with our votes. It didn't work on  healthcare. It is not going to work on this either.   Tax reform--if it is real reform--or even just tax cuts are very  complicated. If you don't have the center coming together, everyone can  pick it apart, and they are setting themselves up to do just that.   Although the Republican tax plan is little more than principles at  the moment--and we have talked a lot about these principles of the  Republican plan--it is so far away from what the American people want  because of the process they have decided to use. When you don't want  Democrats and use just Republicans, the people of the hard right--a  minority in the Republican Party probably--can push the debate so far  over because they say: We are not voting for this unless you do it our  way. So we have a bill that really is so out of touch and harmful to  all but the wealthiest Americans that it is hard to believe the  Republicans are putting it forward with a straight face.    It is going to be the first time, my friends, that Republicans in  Congress will vote to increase our Nation's deficit by $1.5 trillion,  which is spelled out as clear as day in the budget. I hope, given this  dramatic increase in the deficit, all of the Republican deficit hawks  are out of their nests for this one.   For the sake of ideological consistency, the same folks who decried  debt and deficit under President Obama ought to denounce them under  President Trump, but we haven't heard much of a peep from a whole lot  of Republicans on this side with a few notable, brave, and leaderlike  exceptions.   Here is what Representative Walker, a conservative Member of the  House, said, lamenting what was going on:         [The deficit is] a great talking point when you have an       administration that is Democrat-led. It's a little different       now that Republicans have both houses and the administration.       There's been less talk about it this year with a Republican-      led administration than there has been the last seven or       eight years.    Representative Walker is exactly accurate.  [[Page S6423]]    The Republican leader on May 16 told Bloomberg TV that tax reform  ``will have to be revenue neutral.'' These are his words. That is a  principle he has advanced for years.   We are not hearing much from Republicans about deficits now. Yet, I  repeat, this budget instructs the committees to increase the deficit by  $1.5 trillion. It will be difficult for many of my Republican friends  to say that they care about deficits and still vote for this budget.   The GOP budget resolution will also be the first time that my  Republican colleagues vote to slash Medicare. The budget spells out  over $400 billion in Medicare cuts, as well as over $1 trillion in  Medicaid cuts--even more than the healthcare bill, and probably the No.  1 reason for its demise was that huge slash to Medicaid.   So it is going to be difficult for my Republican friends and this  Republican Party to say that they want to protect Medicare and Medicaid  and still vote for this budget. Unfortunately, this will not be the  first time Republicans vote to advance a major piece of legislation-- changes to our Tax Code--through a hyperpartisan process known as  reconciliation. Reconciliation, as has just been documented in an  article--I believe it was in Politico, but in one of our leading  publications--was never intended for this type of purpose.   With this vote, though, Republicans are saying from the very outset  that they don't really want Democratic input on this bill because they  are setting up a process in which they don't really need Democratic  votes. It is honestly a shame. And just as the partisan reconciliation  process portended failure for the Republican healthcare bill, it is  likely to portend failure here as well.   It is difficult to pass major legislation in the Senate, as it should  be. That is what the Founding Fathers intended. That is the true  conservatism of our government: checks and balances, no rush. It is  even more difficult if you work only with the votes of one party. As I  said, that allows a small few, usually on the hard right, to dictate  what is in this bill.   My guess is that the vast majority of people here didn't want to vote  for Medicare and Medicaid cuts, but because they couldn't get enough  votes in the House to pass the budget without putting that in, because  maybe 30 or 40 Members there insisted on it, it is in there. It is not  going to serve you well. If anyone thinks it doesn't have real effect,  look at the PAYGO rules. This is not just the budget. PAYGO, after this  budget passes, would insist on slashes in Medicare, 4 percent. That is  the law; that is not a rule.   I hope that our colleagues will vote down this bill, and then I  promise you, just as we are doing on healthcare, we can come together  in a bipartisan way. That doesn't mean you get everything you like. It  probably means more of the tax cuts go to the middle class and fewer to  the wealthy, but there are lots of people on our side of the aisle who  want to see small business get a tax cut, who want to see money from  overseas come here and be used for jobs, and who want to see a middle- class tax break. We could come up with a bipartisan bill that would  make, for the first time in a long time, this body shine.   The Republican Congress, at least at the moment on the path it is on,  has abandoned the grand tradition of bipartisanship, working together,  which has made this Chamber great through the decades and centuries.   When Republicans need Democratic votes, they come to us. The  President and the leader have said: Come vote with us. Make it  bipartisan. That is not what bipartisanship is. You don't craft a bill  just within your party and then say: Voting with us is bipartisan.  Bipartisanship means you sit down together and you come out with a  proposal that a majority of both parties can support. They are not  doing that.   Republicans will spend the entire first year of this Congress trying  to pass their major agendas through reconciliation or similar vehicles,  first with CRAs, then healthcare, now taxes. The majority leader  himself said in a speech, ``Restoring the Senate,'' in 2014 that ``when  the Senate is allowed to work the way it was designed to, it arrives at  a result acceptable to people all along the political spectrum.'' But  if it's an ``assembly line for one party's partisan legislative  agenda,'' it creates ``instability and strife'' rather than ``good,  stable law.''   The American people want to see us work together. We may not always  succeed. It may not be easy, but we can try.   As I said--and I would say this to my colleagues--there are areas in  which we can agree on taxes: Lower middle-class taxes; don't raise  them. Give some relief to small business. Try to bring the money from  overseas and put it into infrastructure and job creation. We can work  together, but not in this process and not with this awful bill, which  favors the wealthy dramatically, raises taxes on the middle class,  hurts the deficit--increases the deficit dramatically--and is a  partisan process. I hope my Republican friends keep that in mind when  they vote today. If you vote this down, I promise you that we will come  together in a bipartisan way and work for something that actually could  pass, instead of what happened with healthcare. Try it. Try it.  Reconciliation--working with one party--failed miserably for you on  healthcare, and now we are coming together. Let's not repeat the same  mistake on taxes.              Office of National Drug Control Policy Nomination    Finally, Mr. President, I just heard that the nomination of  Representative Marino to lead the Office of National Drug Control  Policy has been withdrawn. That is the right decision. The fact that he  was nominated in the first place is evidence that the Trump  administration talks the talk but refuses to walk the walk. The bottom  line is that this Congressman supported President Trump but is the  wrong person for the job, and I am glad they saw it and withdrew.   I want to salute two of my colleagues who were way out in front on  this: Senator Manchin, whose State has been ravaged by opioids, and  Senator McCaskill, who has similar problems, particularly in rural  areas, but all over. Senator McCaskill has legislation that I think  would correct the kinds of ills we have seen in Representative Marino's  proposals, and I hope that in a bipartisan way we can support them.   The opioid crisis demands that the next drug czar be solely focused  on getting communities across the country the help they desperately  need, and we hope the administration nominates someone who fits that  bill so we can pass that nominee quickly and in a bipartisan way.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent all remaining  time be yielded back.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
