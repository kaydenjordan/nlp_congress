 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Harley- Davidson's 120th anniversary. I am honored to recognize this iconic  Wisconsin company and to commemorate this momentous milestone.   Though the style and swagger of Harley-Davidson motorcycles are now  known across the entire world, the origin story of these bikes humbly  began in a machine shop on Milwaukee's North Side in 1903. This was  where two young best friends, William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson,  first experimented with different prototypes for a motorized bicycle.  While their first model struggled to scale the hills of Milwaukee's  streets, Harley and Davidson understood the promise that their  invention held. Less than a year later, an updated prototype placed  fourth in a motorcycle race at State Fair Park.   As Harley-Davidson's business and production rapidly grew in the  following years, so did its place in American history. In 1907, the  company began selling its motorcycles to police departments, a  tradition that remains to this day. In 1917, the U.S. military adopted  Harley-Davidson motorcycles for military issue during the First World  War, purchasing over 20,000 units for the war effort. Bolstered by the  strong sense of resolve and innovation that we all associate with our  legacy American manufacturers, the company was able to survive the  Great Depression, leading to a historic partnership with the U.S. Army  during the Second World War.   Today, Harley-Davidson remains one of the largest motorcycle  manufacturers in the world and is famous for a loyal following that  spans the far reaches of the globe. While Harley-Davidson holds onto  its roots, it also looks to the future. The new Harley-Davidson  LiveWire electric motorcycle released in 2019 continues the company's  commitment to style, craftsmanship, and an unparalleled riding  experience.   Though everyone knows the look and sound of a Harley-Davidson bike  when they see one, the company has expanded their business with  merchandise that people from all backgrounds are desperate to get their  hands on. There are now Harley-Davidson dealerships in nearly 100  countries, but the company has kept true to its roots with its  headquarters located in Milwaukee. In 2008, the Harley-Davidson Museum  opened to the public, allowing fans to experience more than 100 years  of history up close. The museum remains a top tourist destination for  Milwaukee, reinforcing the shared identity between a great American  city and manufacturer.   What began as a motorcycle prototype stored in a Milwaukee family  backyard has become an unparalleled vehicle for adventure across the  open roads of the Earth. Yet beyond the roar of an engine or the  classic look of a motorcycle, Harley-Davidson has come to symbolize the  freedom we all know as Americans. On the 120th anniversary of this  American icon, I am proud to recognize the Harley-Davidson Motor  Company and look forward to many more years of success.                            ____________________
