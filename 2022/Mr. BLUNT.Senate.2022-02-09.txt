 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 5 minutes before the scheduled rollcall vote.    Madam President, there are really few jobs in the country  as difficult, as dangerous, and as demanding as the sacrifice of being  a law enforcement officer. I would suggest the one job that may  possibly be harder--and certainly in my view is as hard--is to be the  family member of a law enforcement officer, wondering all during that  working shift what might be happening to the person you care so much  about.   You know the challenges to these officers and their families--the  challenges they face today are intensified as local departments  struggle with the staffing shortages caused by record high departures  and difficulty filling the open positions they have got.   The Eastern Missouri Police Academy had around half as many recruits  join in 2021 as they had in 2020. In my hometown of Springfield, MO,  they have 40 vacancies right now they are trying to fill in the  department.   In January, the Columbia, MO, Police Department had around 20  vacancies in a force that its maximum size would be 187 or so people.   According to the St. Louis Post Dispatch in September, officer  departures in St. Louis City and St. Louis County spiked in 2021 and  were at a pace to be up to 60 percent higher in each of those  departments than they had been in the average year.   In the police force here, I was with Chief Manger yesterday, and he  pointed out that retirements and resignations were 50 percent higher  than they have been in recent years in 2021.   The new chief of police at the St. Louis County Police Force said: My  biggest priority is hiring and finding people who will do these jobs.   These staff shortages are unfortunate, but they are in so many ways  predictable of a movement that villainized enforcement for, I think,  political gain in many cases. Officers have been demoralized by the  ``defund the police'' crusade. They have been discouraged by  prosecutors who put dangerous criminals back on the street or even put  out a list of crimes that people will not be prosecuted for.   That is well beyond the standard of belief that most people would  have had, actually, until they heard it, my guess would be, that, no,  these are crimes that we are just not going to prosecute people for.   Police saw themselves, in many cases, forced out of the force because  of a vaccine mandate they didn't agree with, often going to smaller  forces that had less than 100 people.   All this is happening, really, against a backdrop of a crime wave  that is harming communities of all sizes all across the country.   When I talk to police chiefs, I hear concerns that a lot of good  candidates are deciding maybe law enforcement won't be the career that  they want to have. When I talk to the sworn officers that I see here  every day and I see at home, I hear many of them feel they just simply  have a job where they face danger but they don't get enough support  that they need to do the job that they need to do.   Police work has always been dangerous. We have always lost officers.  They have always been courageous in their willingness to stand up, but  last year was the deadliest year ever for law enforcement officers.  Four hundred fifty-eight officers died in the line of duty in 2021, 128  of them from gunshot wounds or fatalities from traffic.   You don't have to travel very far away from here, just down  Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial, to understand what it means to lose officers and  what it means to lose them in protection of the country. The marble  walls there bear the names of thousands of officers who have been  killed in the line of duty. Each corner of that memorial shows a lion  protecting its cubs.   We have always seen law enforcement as our protectors, not as those  we should somehow fear. It eats away at our society to say that we  appreciate law enforcement but we really don't want to do what is  necessary to support law enforcement.   I think there is no data that says one or more tweets that say  ``defund the police'' leads to two crimes or two muggings, but it  simply makes common sense that when police departments are understaffed  and undertrained, it increases the risk of violent crime on the  officers themselves and the communities they serve.   As the cochair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, one of my  priorities has been to ensure that law enforcement officers have the  support and resources they need to do the job they are asked to do and  do it as safely and effectively as they possibly can.   We certainty all can and I think would agree--I certainly would--that  there really should be zero tolerance for police misconduct. Taking the  oath to support and defend and then somehow not conducting yourself in  the right way, if you cross that line, you ought to be held  accountable.   We need to view people on the line as people who are there to defend  us, to serve us. We need to make this a profession that people want to  be part of, and if they are willing to be part of it, we have provided  them everything they need to be safely doing the hard work that they  are asked to do.   I yield the floor.                           Vote on Bush Nomination
