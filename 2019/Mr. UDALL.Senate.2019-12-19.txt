 Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Senator Johnny  Isakson from the great State of Georgia. I, like all of my colleagues  in the Senate, am saddened by his retirement. His departure leaves a  big hole in this Chamber that may never be truly filled.   Johnny is a Senator's Senator. He embodies the best qualities of a  public servant. He is smart, hard-working, determined, effective. He is  humble, not at all self-important, and never seeks attention for  himself. He has integrity. He is a man of his word.   He is known throughout the Senate as ready to reach across the aisle  to seek bipartisan solutions--one of the main reasons he is so  effective. As he put it during his farewell speech on the Senate floor,  ``I tell you, I am big on bipartisanship.'' Johnny encourages us to  take his lead and listen to and work with the other side. We all can  learn from his example.   Johnny is kind. His heart is big. He always has a smile or greeting  for the Senate custodians, Capitol police, cafeteria workers, Senate  pages. He always has the time to be kind to others.   Johnny is Georgian through and through and loves his State and its  people. He has served them for 45 years--in both State houses and both  Congressional Chambers--and is now Georgia's most senior elected  official. Johnny is as beloved by the people of his State as he is in  the Senate--and for good reason. He has worked to build Georgia's  economy, its rural communities, its international trade, its harbors,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and on and  on.   But Johnny is not only a champion for his State, he is a champion for  the Nation, and he gets things done for our country. Johnny's  legislative fingerprints are everywhere. From protecting workers'  pensions, to fighting childhood hunger, to increasing affordable  housing so families have a roof over their heads, to helping people  with disabilities, to making sure children with rare diseases get their  medications, to getting treatment for victims of the opioid crisis-- Johnny has been working for the American people because he cares deeply  and genuinely about humanity. It is not show for Johnny. You see what  you get. He is the real deal.   It is important to thank Johnny for his extraordinary work on behalf  of veterans. He is a veteran himself, having served 6 years in the  Georgia Air National Guard after college, and veterans have no stronger  champion than Johnny. As chair of the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee, he shepherded an amazing 57 bills through the Senate. He  helped extend the GI bill so that veterans aren't met with an arbitrary  cutoff to take advantage of their educational benefits. He made sure  veterans have access to community- and home-based health services. And  his signature VA Mission legislation ensures that healthcare for  veterans is more responsive and more effective.   As I said, Johnny's heart is big, and he welcomes all people. Atlanta  hosted the 1996 summer Olympics. Cobb County is a suburban county of  Atlanta and was set to host some preliminary Olympic events. But the  Cobb County Commission had passed an anti-gay, discriminatory  resolution. At that time, Johnny was a Cobb County Republican, serving  in the State senate. It might not have been the most popular position  in his county, but he urged the County Commission to rescind the  resolution.   One of Johnny's best friends is civil rights icon   John Lewis. On  February 25, 1996, Representative Lewis introduced Johnny as the newest  member of Georgia's congressional delegation, and on November 19, 2019,  he gave Johnny a warm farewell, explaining to the House that ``when  Johnny served in the House of Representatives, we always found a way to  come together, and we continued that tradition when he was elected to  the Senate. . . . We always found a way to get along and to do the good  work the people deserved. Time and time again, he stood with us, he  worked with us to uplift African Americans in the State of Georgia, to  recognize individuals like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Jackie  Robinson, natives of Georgia.'' At the end of the tribute,  Representative Lewis called Johnny his ``brother,'' and they gave each  other a long embrace.   During his farewell speech, Johnny said:         We still have some people in the United States of America       who will play the hate card. We have some politicians who       will dance around the issue of hate. They will not use the       buzz words, but they will get awful close to it. They did it       in Charlottesville. . . . We have to stand up to the evils of       society today. If we don't do it, nobody will.    Johnny has stood up for over four decades for what he believes in. We  will miss his honesty, his integrity, and his fine character. Jill and  I wish Johnny and Dianne, their three children, and eight grandchildren  the very best. Enjoy life. And we will do our best to follow your  example in the Senate.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of Mr.  Faisal Amin, who has been serving for the past 4 months as a detailee  on the staff of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.   Faisal is a senior attorney for the Budget and Appropriations Law  Group at the U.S. Government Accountability Office and joined the staff  in September of this year to fill in for a longtime staff member on  maternity leave.   Faisal has been heavily involved in the drafting, consideration, and  passage of the fiscal year 2020 Interior appropriations bill starting  from the first day of his assignment with the subcommittee. In just 4  months, he participated in almost all of the milestones of the  appropriations process: a committee markup, floor consideration, and  conference negotiations.   He ably represented Vice Chairman Leahy and me throughout the  process, handling the day-to-day responsibilities of overseeing the  budgets of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and related  agencies and working with other congressional offices, Agency staff,  nongovernmental organizations, and other stakeholders to ensure that  the priorities of Members of this Chamber on both sides of the aisle  were well represented.   Faisal did tremendous work, stepping in to handle complicated policy  and budgetary issues in an unusually expedited process. He is smart,  pragmatic, thoughtful, and strategic--creating an excellent rapport  with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle and serving as an  optimistic and positive presence on the subcommittee. I am grateful for  his time with us, and I know his colleagues on the subcommittee staff-- Rachael Taylor, Ryan Hunt and Melissa Zimmerman--feel the same way.   On behalf of Vice Chairman Leahy and the committee, I also extend our  gratitude to the Comptroller General, Mr. Gene Dodaro, and the staff of  the U.S. Government Accountability Office for sharing Faisal with us  during this critical time.   Congratulations, Faisal, for a job well done, and thank you for your  service to the United States Senate.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to recognize Mr. Gary Hartz, who is  retiring from his position at the Indian Health Service with 48 years  of distinguished Federal service to the Nation.   Mr. Hartz is especially deserving of this Chamber's recognition  because he has spent his entire career on a single and absolutely  critical goal-improving access to quality health care for American  Indians and Alaska Natives. In his current position, Mr. Hartz serves  as the Director of the Office of Environmental Health and Engineering,  overseeing the construction, maintenance, and operations of Tribal  health facilities, sanitation, and environmental health programs, a  position that he has performed for more than two decades after working  his way up through ranks of the office. An engineer by trade, Mr. Hartz  also served as a member of the Public Health Service Commissioned  Corps--retiring with the rank of rear admiral--and served briefly as  the agency's Deputy Director. He began his career in the field, working  as an engineer on projects in New Mexico and Alaska.   I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Mr. Hartz in  my roles as vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and  the ranking member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee  on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. He has worked  closely with me and my staff and testified before my committees, and I  can say from firsthand experience that he is one of the most  knowledgeable, dedicated, and pragmatic public servants at the Indian  Health Service, and his wisdom and experience will be deeply missed.   Finally, I want to thank him for all that he has done for my home  State of New Mexico. Mr. Hartz has been instrumental in working to  improve and replace Tribal health facilities, including working most  recently on plans to replace the Service's Albuquerque, Alamo, Pueblo  Pintado, and Gallup facilities. While we have more to do, I am  tremendously grateful for the work that he has done to improve access  to quality health care in Native communities across the State.   On behalf of the Nation, thank you for a job well done, Mr. Hartz. I  wish you all the best as you begin your next chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to recognize Ms. Delia Scott, who is  retiring next month with more than 40 years of distinguished Federal  service in the executive and legislative branches of government.   I have been lucky enough to work with Delia twice, both when I served  in the House of Representatives and in my current role as ranking  member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies.   Most recently, Delia has served as the Congressional Liaison Officer  at the National Gallery of Art, shaping the Gallery's relationship with  members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. I know  firsthand that Delia has been an effective advocate for the Gallery,  playing an essential role in shepherding its annual appropriations  through Congress and securing critical funding increases for operating  and infrastructure needs.   Beyond her role with the budget, Delia has made it her goal to  connect Members of the House and Senate with the world-class collection  at the Gallery so they are invested in its success. My wife, Jill, and  I are both grateful to have visited countless times to enjoy and learn  about significant paintings, sculpture, photographs, and other works  because of Delia's thoughtful invitations. The Gallery won't be the  same without her.   For all her impressive work at the Gallery, I also want to recognize  her enduring legacy of public service in other positions. Prior to her  current position, Delia served as the staff director for the House  Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies,  managing a $30-plus billion funding bill and working to secure funding  for natural resources, environmental protection, and Tribal and  cultural programs. She also worked as a professional staff member for  the committee and worked for more than two decades at the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency.   Delia has devoted her entire career to making sure that Federal  agencies and programs-from the arts to environmental protection to  foreign assistance-have operated smoothly and received ample funding to  benefit the people of this Nation. For that service we should all be  grateful.   I congratulate her on a job well done and an outstanding Federal  career, and I wish her and her husband, John, the very best as they  move on to the next chapter of their lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Werner Gellert survived the  Holocaust and never forgot that terrible injustice. Werner went on to  found a museum in Albuquerque dedicated not only to educating people  about the Holocaust but dedicated to stopping intolerance wherever it  is found.   Werner Gellert was born on June 14, 1926 in Breslau, Germany. During  November 9 and 10, 1938, Nazi paramilitary forces carried out a pogrom  throughout Germany demolishing and ransacking Jewish homes, businesses,  synagogues, schools, and hospitals. At that time, 267 synagogues in  Germany and surrounding areas and 7,000 Jewish businesses were  destroyed and over 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in  concentration camps. That pogrom was called Night of the Broken Glass,  or Kristallnacht, meaning ``Crystal Night,'' because of all the broken  glass scattered throughout the streets from the shattered windows of  Jewish buildings.   After the Night of the Broken Glass, Werner and his adopted parents  fled Germany for Shanghai, one of the only places in the world at that  time that accepted Jews unconditionally. However, the Japanese who were  occupying Shanghai became allied with the Germans, and, on February 18,  1943, they issued a proclamation establishing a restricted area where  ``stateless refugees'' must live and work. Werner and his family were  relocated to this restricted area, Hongkew, which became plagued with  disease and starvation. On one of his birthdays, Werner asked only for  a loaf of bread and jar of jam for himself, but he didn't get his wish.  During this period, he suffered through starvation, typhus, yellow  fever, and hepatitis, and he was brutalized by a bully and permanently  lost most of the sight in one of his eyes.   After the end of World War II, Werner remained in Shanghai, working  as a typewriter repairman for the U.S. Army. The Army recognized his  intelligence and linguistic skills--he spoke seven languages--and  recruited him into Army intelligence as a civilian consultant. He  worked undercover for the United States in China, Tibet, and the  Philippines.   The Chinese Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s  drove out Werner and his family, and they fortunately were able to  escape on the last boat out of Shanghai to the United States. They  relocated to Denver, where Werner attended Denver University and met  his future wife, Frances Silverman--known as ``Frankie''--to whom he  was married for 54 years, until her passing in 2007.   After a successful career in the savings and loan business in  California, Werner and Frankie retired to Albuquerque. Werner fervently  believed that education was the most effective weapon against hate and  intolerance. With that guiding principal in mind, in 2001, he and  Frankie founded the Albuquerque Holocaust and Intolerance Museum.   The museum is dedicated to educating the public through its  exhibitions on the horrors and injustices of hate--from the Holocaust,  to the African-American experience here in the United States to  genocide of minority peoples around the world. Its goal is to promote  ``upstanders,'' not bystanders: people who speak out and act to support  individuals, groups, or causes attacked or bullied. The museum is home  to the Library of Remembrance, a compilation of more than 4,500 books,  documents, and videos about the injustice of genocide, bullying, and  intolerance.   As long as he was able, well into his eighties, Werner spoke to  school groups at the museum and around the State teaching them about  his experience during the Holocaust and as a refugee in Shanghai.  Werner took his own terrible experience and set about to make a better,  more understanding, more tolerant world for others. While we lost  Werner on November 9, 2019, at age 93,  [[Page S7206]]  his commitment to ending genocide, intolerance, and bullying will live  on through the Albuquerque Holocaust and Intolerance Museum.                            ____________________
