 Madam President, the Lee amendment is an unnecessary  roadblock to this bipartisan deal, and it would interfere with the  delivery of essential government services in times of need.   If adopted, this amendment would prevent Agencies from exercising  their discretion and acting quickly in times of need, such as during a  national emergency or natural disaster. The government must be able to  provide essential services to the public. And it is important to  promote offsets and save taxpayer dollars. We understand that. But we  must also ensure that the American people receive the services they  need and protect our economy. That is why we must vote to quickly pass  this bipartisan bill without amendment to avoid a catastrophic default.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Lee amendment.                           Vote on Amendment No. 98    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the  amendment.
