 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning because yesterday the  Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization that we rely on  in this Chamber for truth, told us that the Senate healthcare bill--so- called healthcare bill--will throw 22 million Americans off of their  insurance. Two-thirds of those, 14 million, are Medicaid patients--the  poorest people in America, elderly people in nursing homes.   I don't have a voice in the Senate, Mr. Speaker, but if I did, I  would say: I understand how important it is to deliver on the promise  you have been making for 7 years to repeal ObamaCare. The Republican  base is demanding it, but it can't possibly be demanding the throwing  off of their healthcare 22 million Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I also don't have a voice in the oval office, but if I  did, I would ask this President, I would say: Sir, you promised to do  three things: you promised to increase coverage, to lower deductibles,  and to lower premiums for the American people.   I would say: Mr. President, this bill in the Senate does the exact  opposite of all three of those things.   So I would say: Mr. President, if you keep your word, stop this  Senate bill from passing.                            ____________________
