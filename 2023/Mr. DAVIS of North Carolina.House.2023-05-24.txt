 Mr. Speaker, I represent nearly 50,000  veterans across North Carolina's First Congressional District. North  Carolina ranks 10th in the Nation for veteran-owned small businesses.   During Small Business Week, I introduced a bipartisan package of  veterans' legislation to repay our veterans for their sacrifice and  selfless service.   The first, the Veterans Jobs Opportunity Act, introduced with  Congressman Zach Nunn of Iowa, provides veterans starting small  businesses with a 15 percent tax credit on the first $50,000 of startup  costs.   The second, the Coast Guard Combat-Injured Tax Fairness Act,  introduced with Congressman   Don Bacon of Nebraska, closes a loophole  in an existing law that failed to provide Coast Guard servicemembers  with the same tax benefits afforded to others.   Investing in our brave veterans while helping the communities that  need it most should be our highest priority.                            ____________________
