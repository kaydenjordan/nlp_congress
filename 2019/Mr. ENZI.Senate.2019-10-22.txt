 Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss legislation  approved by the House of Representatives that would leave taxpayers  holding the fiscal bag for a specific category of underfunded private  pension plans.   Throughout most of my professional life, from my days as an  accountant, to my service as the mayor of Gillette, WY, and in the  Wyoming Legislature, to my membership on the Senate's Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and then on the Committee on  Finance, I have worked on pension policy. This experience has taught me  many things about retirement security and the need for sound planning.   My concern with the House-passed bill is not just with its immediate  cost to the taxpayers but also with what it would mean down the road.  The bill would send the signal to private pension plans that regardless  of how underfunded they are or how risky their investments, the  taxpayers will be there to bail them out.   Pensions are an important source of retirement income for millions of  Americans, but many of the private sector's multiemployer pension plans  are seriously underfunded. These are plans that are sponsored by a  group of private employers as part of collective bargaining agreements  with their employees and are separate from the single employers' plans,  which are generally better funded.   According to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,  multiemployers' pension plans are underfunded by more than $637  billion. That is $637 billion that is underfunded. Out of the 1,247  multiemployer pension plans that we have information on, 1,235 are  underfunded. That would mean that 12 are not underfunded.   In July of this year, the House of Representatives passed the  Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act of 2019, which would bail  out some of the worst-funded multiemployer plans at the taxpayers'  expense. The bill would provide a combination of low-interest loans and  direct cash payments to the private sector's multiemployer plans that  are currently insolvent or are designated as ``critical and  declining.''   The official Congressional Budget Office's cost estimate of the bill  states it would increase deficits by $49 billion over the next 10  years, but, as a separate analysis points out, which I requested from  the budget office, the true cost and risk to taxpayers is actually much  higher.   First, the bill includes a handful of revenue provisions to help  offset its cost, but the House included these same provisions in a  separate bill it passed earlier this year. Without this $16 billion in  double-counted revenues, the bailout bill's price tag jumps to $65  billion over the next decade.   Second, the analysis projects that most pension plans would not fully  repay their loans without the grant assistance provided in this bill.  What that means is that these plan providers are going to use taxpayer  dollars to help repay loans made to them by taxpayers. That is quite a  deal.   Further, the budget office's analysis shows that even with these  taxpayer-provided grants, one-quarter of the plans receiving loans  under the House bill would become insolvent within the 30-year loan  period. CBO projects that most of the other plans would become  insolvent in the decade after they repay their loans. All of this begs  the question, then what?   Now, third, as I alluded to a moment ago, much of the bill's cost  doesn't show up in the first 10 years. When you consider the total  amount of new spending the bill authorizes over the next several  decades, along with the added interest costs we will have to pay, the  total cost would be more than $100 billion.   To add insult to injury, the House bill would not resolve the larger  multiemployer pension crisis. The bill would apply only to those that  are currently insolvent or critical and declining. It would not address  the many other plans that are treading water now but will face  insolvency in the future. You can bet that if this bill goes through,  those plans would be expecting their bailout when the time comes. What  a precedent.   All of this is setting up for additional bailouts in the future,  potentially putting taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions of  dollars.   Now, only about 12 percent of private sector workers participate in a  pension plan, and an even smaller number participate in these  multiemployer plans. This bill would put the vast majority of workers  who don't have their own pension plans on the hook for bailing out the  small percentage who do. That hardly seems fair.   Hard-working Americans overwhelmingly agree that we can't afford a  pension bailout. A recent poll shows that a majority of voters oppose a  taxpayer-funded bailout of unfunded union pension plans. This is  because voters know a bad deal when they see it.   Before I close, I am going to remind my colleagues that the Federal  Government already has its own unfunded promises that need addressing,  and these are programs that will affect the vast majority of Americans.  Trustees for Social Security estimate that Social Security's long-term  benefit promises exceed its dedicated tax revenues by almost $17  trillion, and Medicare's long-term spending is projected to exceed its  dedicated taxes and premiums by more than $40 trillion.   We need to work to find solutions to address the Federal Government's  own funding shortfalls for the vast majority of Americans and not bail  out underfunded private sector pension plans for the few.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider S. Amdt. 948 to H.R. 3055, the  Commerce, Justice, Science, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  Drug Administration, Interior, Environment, Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development  Appropriations Act, 2020. The Senate amendment provides appropriations  for spending within the jurisdiction of all the subcommittees in the  underlying bill except for the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  [[Page S5961]]  Agencies. The measure contains spending that qualifies for cap  adjustments under current law.   This measure includes $2,500 million in nonsecurity budget authority  that is designated as being for the periodic U.S. Census pursuant to  section 251 (b)(2)(G) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this budget  authority will result in $1,800 million in outlays in fiscal year 2020.   This measure also includes $2,250 million in nonsecurity  discretionary budget authority for wildfire suppression operations  pursuant to section 251 (b)(2)(F) of BBEDCA. This budget authority and  its associated outlays of $2,250 million qualify for an adjustment  under BBEDCA.   As such, I am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to  the Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised nonsecurity  budget authority by $4,750 million and outlays by $4,050 million in  fiscal year 2020. Further, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for  fiscal year 2020 by $4,750 million in budget authority and $4,050  million in outlays.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $s in millions                            2020 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,704,246     Outlays....................................                3,681,491 Adjustments:     Budget Authority...........................                    4,750     Outlays....................................                    4,050 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,708,996     Outlays....................................                3,685,541 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2020  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $s in millions                            2020 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget                        666,500      Authority.................................
