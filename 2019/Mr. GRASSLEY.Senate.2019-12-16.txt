 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute as in morning business.    Mr. President, I recently heard from an 81-year-old  Iowan who is battling cancer. She told me that one test cost more than  $12,700. That is almost an entire year's income for that lady. On top  of that, her medication is more than $4,700 a month. She is on Humana  and Medicare, but that is not enough for her to still afford her  medical bills.   Too many Americans share this Iowan's story. That is why we must pass  the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act, to finally help Americans  afford the critical medications they need.   The bill I just named is a bipartisan bill sponsored by this Senator  and Democratic Senator Wyden. It got voted out of committee 19 to 9  back in July.   We have the good fortune that the House of Representatives  understands that the pricing of prescription drugs is a major problem.  They passed a bill last week. I applaud them for taking up this issue.  It so happens that the bill they passed probably can't get anywhere  near 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, so I hope we will have an opportunity  to sit down with Speaker Pelosi and other House Members to see what we  can work out to do something about the high cost of prescription drugs  for the citizens of this country. Every Member of this body hears from  their constituents that they don't like the fantastic increase in  prices of drugs that occurs on a regular basis.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have long maintained that rape victims  shouldn't have to wait years for justice, and that is why I supported  the original version of the Debbie Smith Act when the Senate Judiciary  Committee originated it more than 15 years ago. I am delighted that we  last week reached a compromise enabling Congress to send another 5-year  reauthorization of the Debbie Smith Act to the President's desk this  year.   Congress has generously funded the program authorized by this statute  at roughly $100 million annually since its inception. Unfortunately,  however, we have seen repeated media reports that a backlog of untested  sexual assault evidence persists in many States, and the Justice  Department, which administers this formula grant program, has not done  enough to tackle persistent issues with the program's implementation.   These reports concerned me, and at a 2016 meeting of the Judiciary  Committee, I began voicing questions about whether rape victims were  truly the top priority under our DNA Capacity and Backlog Enhancement  Program. I also questioned whether additional oversight was needed. I  insisted at this time that transparency requirements be added to the  Justice for All Act reauthorization prior to its passage by the full  Senate. These changes, which I later offered as a floor amendment and  which the Senate accepted by voice vote in 2016, ensure that the  Justice Department collects and reports more data about how Federal  grant funds are being spent.   In 2017, I also called on a government watchdog agency to assess the  progress we have made in reducing backlogs of untested DNA evidence in  sexual assault kits since the enactment of the Debbie Smith Act grant  program. Last year, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I also  convened an oversight hearing to review Congress' billion-dollar  investment in the DNA backlog program, which makes Federal resources  available each year for crime laboratories across the country to  analyze untested DNA evidence collected from crime scenes and convicted  offenders.   The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, testified at last  year's congressional hearing that we still don't know with certainty  that this program is working. GAO explained--and this year reconfirmed  in the final report prepared by GAO at my request--that the Justice  Department has yet to articulate measurable program-wide goals for the  grant program authorized by the Debbie Smith Act, making it difficult  to assess and verify State grantees' performance. GAO raised similar  concerns in a 2013 report on this national program. GAO also suggested  the need for the Justice Department to implement additional steps to  prevent lobbying-related conflicts of interest.   This year, I developed additional proposed reforms in response to the  issues that GAO and others raised. I want to thank Penny Nance of  Concerned Women for America, who testified at my invitation at last  year's Judiciary Committee hearing, for suggesting certain changes to  ensure that the analysis of sexual assault evidence is accorded a  higher priority by grantees. This statutory reform is essential,  because most States impose a statutory deadline by which crimes of  sexual violence must be prosecuted. Changes suggested by her  organization, for which I have advocated since 2016, were incorporated  into the Debbie Smith Act reauthorization bill by the Senate sponsor,  Senator Cornyn, with my support. The House of Representatives also  accepted these changes this year.   Additional reforms I proposed to the program this year, based on  GAO's findings and suggestions, cleared the Judiciary Committee as an  amendment to the Debbie Smith Act during our committee's consideration  of the 2019 reauthorization. The full Senate later approved the  reauthorization, including these reforms, by voice vote, but the House  of Representatives declined to accept all of them. If enacted, the  changes opposed by the House would require both that the Justice  Department articulate measurable, program-wide goals and that the  National Institute of Justice take additional steps to prevent  lobbying-related conflicts of interest. They would not resolve every  issue with the DNA backlog program, but I believe their enactment would  substantially strengthen the program.   Because the House of Representatives dropped the GAO-backed reforms  that the Senate approved by voice vote, I imposed a hold on the other  Chamber's reauthorization measure this month. I then called on the  Attorney General to implement my proposed reforms through  administrative action. I thank the Attorney General for almost  immediately agreeing to do so. Rather than indefinitely hold up the  extension of the Debbie Smith Act, I lifted my hold on the bill last  week, and I will continue to conduct oversight to ensure that these  reforms are implemented as promised by the executive branch.   At this time, I want to thank Senator Cornyn for his efforts to  advance the 2019 reauthorization, which I cosponsored, and for  cosigning my December 2019 letter to the Attorney General.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter and Attorney  General's response be included in the Congressional Record. I am  hopeful that this bipartisan measure can be approved today by voice  vote and sent to President Trumps' desk this week for signature.                            ____________________
