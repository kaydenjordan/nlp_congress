 Madam President, we have reached the time of year when  the Senate has more important outstanding business than we have days to  complete it. Delivering for the American people will take focus,  dexterity, and genuine bipartisanship. On government funding, as I have  said for weeks, it is my hope that our committees' work will bear fruit  and a full-year funding package will come to the floor in both  Chambers.   I anticipate that the Senate will take up a 1-week extension this  week so the government does not close on December 11 and work can  continue through the end of next week.   The Nation needs our Democratic colleagues to resist the temptation  to play brinksmanship with long-settled policy issues or push poison- pill riders that they know would tank the process.   We also expect to receive and pass a conference report on the annual  Defense authorization. And we need to continue confirming nominees to  vacancies in the judiciary and the executive branch.   We Senators are no strangers to the end-of-year drama, but this time  the stakes are far higher. We are up against another, even steeper  surge in COVID-19 than we saw back in the spring. Workers and small  businesses are once again struggling to make ends meet as States and  localities step up precautions.   And while the latest news on the vaccine trials suggest that victory  over the virus may soon be within reach, our work in that area is far  from complete. As one recent article put it, ``State [and] local  officials plead for vaccine distribution funds.''   Our Nation's historic sprint to victory through vaccines seems poised  to succeed in record time, but the critical last step--hundreds of  millions of doses out to the American people--is still in front of us.  Congress cannot stay on the sidelines.   Yesterday, our colleague from Illinois, the Democratic whip, gave an  interview in which he named three examples of highly urgent matters  that need to be addressed for our Nation right now. This is the  Democratic whip of the U.S. Senate.    Here are the three things Senator Durbin mentioned as flashing red,  urgent priorities: ``The millions of people who are going to . . . lose  their unemployment insurance the day after Christmas''; ``the  businesses that are trying to decide . . . whether or not they can  continue''; and ``the [vaccine] logistics . . . to make sure that this  vaccine is on the road and vaccinating people across America as quickly  as possible.''   Those are the three things he mentioned. Those are the three urgent  issues he named as examples: extending unemployment insurance, helping  small businesses, and funding vaccine distribution.   Well, I do not question the sincerity of our colleague, who I believe  is engaged in these discussions in good faith. But these comments  illustrate perfectly a point that Republicans have been making for  weeks. These three urgent issues are issues where there is almost total  bipartisan consensus, no real disagreement whatsoever.   In fact, the framework for a small, targeted relief package that I  put forward last week--something Democrats quickly attacked--would have  resolved all three of those subjects. The targeted Republican framework  extends unemployment insurance programs that will otherwise expire; it  creates an entire second round of the Paycheck Protection Program for  the hardest hit small businesses; and it lays groundwork to distribute  the vaccines that appear to be on the horizon. Check, check, and check.   The Democratic whip is right to recognize these three subjects as  especially urgent because they are especially urgent. That is why  Republicans have been trying over and over to get them passed. That is  why Republicans have been saying for months that Speaker Pelosi and the  Democratic leader should let Congress get outcomes in all of the places  where we already agree rather than holding everything hostage over  their most controversial, partisan demands.   But month after month after month, it has been the Democratic leaders  who have said that no relief whatsoever can pass, no consensus items  can become law unless multiple controversial areas where we don't agree  are resolved to the Democrats' liking.   That is why the Democratic leader had every single Senate Democratic  vote to filibuster a targeted COVID-19 relief package back in September  and again in October. That bill would have taken care of small  businesses, unemployment insurance, and vaccine distribution months  ago. Senate Democrats blocked it.   I think, if the Senate Democratic leader would allow it, the three  things that the Democratic whip mentioned just yesterday--small  business aid, reupping unemployment aid, and setting up vaccine  distribution--would pass the Senate in a landslide.   A targeted compromise on the most urgent items would pass by a  massive bipartisan margin. We could easily put together a whole slew of  commonsense policies--including those three and other things, like  legal protections that universities and the American Council on  Education have been pleading for--bring it to the floor, and pass it.   Everyone knows why this hasn't happened. There is one reason the  Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader have spent months tying  the most bipartisan, most commonsense policies to their most  controversial requests and saying that the country can't get the former  unless they get the latter. Their strategy has been all or nothing, so  struggling Americans have, of course, gotten nothing.   Well, we are down to the wire. The light at the end of the tunnel is  in sight. Operation Warp Speed seems poised to deliver vaccines on a  historic, almost miraculous timetable. We have seen some hopeful signs  of engagement from our Democratic colleagues, but  [[Page S7228]]  we have no reason to think the underlying disagreements about policy  are going to evaporate overnight.   Republicans and Democrats do not need to resolve every one of our  differences to get badly needed relief out the door. We just need both  sides to finally do what Members of Congress do when they are serious  about wanting an outcome: Drop the all-or-nothing tactics; drop the  hostage-taking; and make law in the many places where we have common  ground. That is what the country is counting on. That is how we can do  right by the American people before Christmas. Let's get it done.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.

Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 914.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume  consideration of the Schwartz nomination.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that not  withstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the Senate vote on the motion  to invoke cloture on the Simington nomination at noon tomorrow. I  further ask that postcloture time with respect to the Schwartz and  Simington nominations expire at 4 p.m. tomorrow and the Senate vote on  confirmation of the nominations in the order listed. Finally, if any of  the nominations are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.  [[Page S7236]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, after more than seven decades, a  Kentucky family in Hancock County will finally lay their hero to rest.  Last year, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, DPAA, identified the  remains of Navy Fireman 2nd Class Martin Daymond Young. Soon, he will  be on his way home.   Stationed aboard the USS Oklahoma, Daymond was killed during the  Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. This Kentuckian, who would  have turned 100 this year, will be buried beside his twin sister in  Lewisport next May. Today, on the 79th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor  attacks, I would like to pay tribute to Daymond for his bravery and  sacrifice in defense of our Nation.   In June 1940, 3 months before President Franklin Roosevelt authorized  the first peacetime draft, Daymond volunteered for the Navy. He joined  millions of men and women of the ``greatest generation'' who signed up  to protect our country in uniform. According to Daymond's niece, he was  thrilled to be stationed in Hawaii.   On the morning of December 7, 1941, Daymond was aboard the Oklahoma,  which was moored at Ford Island. As the attack began, Japanese aerial  torpedoes pummeled the ship. Its port side tore open, forcing the  27,500-ton battleship to capsize and sink. It took Daymond and 428 of  his crewmates into the water below.   The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor killed more than 2,400 Americans  and launched the United States into the Second World War. Over the next  4 years, heroes were forged on the battlefield and at home as our  country defeated the forces of tyranny in defense of the American way  of life.   In the following years, the Navy attempted to identify the remains of  those killed on the Oklahoma. Unfortunately, the vast majority couldn't  be accounted for and were buried together in 46 plots at the National  Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, also known as the Punchbowl.   Then 5 years ago, the Pentagon contacted Daymond's family as they  exhumed the USS Oklahoma unknowns. The Navy used DNA samples to  identify Daymond's remains and give his family the opportunity for  proper burial in Kentucky. By order of our Governor, flags across the  Bluegrass State will fly at half staff on that day in honor of a true  American hero.   Today, over 1,300 Kentucky servicemembers remain unaccounted for by  the DPAA. We have never forgotten these patriots, and we will continue  searching to bring them home. I am grateful for the ongoing efforts of  the DPAA to bring closure to more families like Daymond's so their  loved ones can receive the tribute they earned.   On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I would like to send our sincere  condolences to Daymond's family and express our thanks for his brave  service to our Nation. We are proud this Kentucky hero is finally  coming home.   Mr. President, on Veterans Day, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer  published an article about Daymond Young's identification. I ask  unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           [From the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, Nov. 11, 2020]   Coming Home: Remains of WWII Veteran Daymond Young Will Be Buried in                            Lewisport Next Year                             (By Renee Beasley)         Layman Hawkins and his siblings grew up hearing one uncle's       name often.        But they never had the privilege of meeting Martin Daymond       Young because he died in 1941 at the age of 21.        Hawkins' mom--Young's twin sister--did everything in her       power to keep her brother's memory alive as long as she       lived.        At birth, Young and his twin sister shared the same       initials: MDY for Mary Daisy Young and Martin Daymond Young.        Everyone called them Daisy and Daymond.        If they were still alive, they would be 100 years old now.        ``(Young) was not a stranger to us,'' said Hawkins, 76, of       Lewisport. ``Mom talked about him all the time.''        Hawkins remembers a military photograph of his uncle always       hung in his mom's living room--like a badge of honor.        ``It's kinda like we knew him, but we didn't know him,''       Hawkins said. ``. . . His memory was with us all the time.''                                 pearl harbor         According to Navy records, Young, who grew up in the       Hancock County village of Dukes, filled out his application       to join the U.S. Navy on June 26, 1940. His application was       approved on Aug. 14 that year.        The Navy assigned Young, 21, a Fireman 2nd Class, to the       battleship USS Oklahoma, which was moored at Ford Island,       Pearl Harbor, on Dec. 7, 1941.        During the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor that day,       torpedoes pounded the Oklahoma, quickly capsizing it. Young       was among 429 crew members who perished aboard the       battleship.        After decades of being one of the Oklahoma's ``unknowns,''       the Navy identified Young's remains last year. He will be       laid to rest in Lewisport--beside his twin sister, Daisy       Young Hawkins--on May 15, 2021.        ``He was so excited about going to Hawaii,'' said Joyce       Nall of Owensboro.        Young was her uncle, too. She is Young's oldest living       relative and the only one with memories of him.        ``I was just a little girl when he went into the Navy,''       Nall said. ``I remember him being my big, handsome uncle.''        After reaching Hawaii aboard the Oklahoma, Young sent Nall       a little grass skirt as a gift.        Nall, 84, has held onto it all these years.                                the punchbowl         Between December 1941 and June 1944, Navy personnel       recovered the bodies of the Oklahoma's deceased crew. They       were interred in the Halawa and Nu'uanu cemeteries.        In 1947, the crew's remains were moved to the Central       Identification Laboratory at Schofield Barracks. Staff there       could only confirm the identities of 35 men at that time.        Later, the Oklahoma unknowns were buried in 46 plots at the       National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, known       as the Punchbowl, and they were classified as non-      recoverable.        In 2015, however, their remains were exhumed again for       analysis and possible identification.        Department of Defense personnel contacted Hawkins about a       year later, asking for the addresses of family members so the       military could collect DNA samples.        When Young's remains were identified last year, the family       had hoped to conduct his burial on May 11, which would have       been his 100th birthday. However, COVID-19 threw a wrench in       those plans. The family opted for a May 2021 date instead.        The military's identification process--even decades after       the bombing of Pearl Harbor--impresses Nall.        ``To me, it's amazing they have gone through this elaborate       process,'' she said.                                    burial         Gov. Andy Beshear recently sent Young's family a message,       saying he would request flags across the commonwealth to fly       at half staff on the day Young's remains are buried.        Also, Rolling Thunder motorcycle club, an advocacy group       that seeks accountability for prisoners of war and those       missing in action, notified the family that its members will       meet the airplane in Owensboro and escort Young's casket to       the Lewisport cemetery.        ``I appreciate the way everyone has treated us,'' Hawkins       said. ``To us, this is a big deal.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S.
