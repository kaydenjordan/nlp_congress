 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 53- year pastoral career of Dr. Jimmy E. Jackson, who is set to retire in  early June.   I first met Dr. Jackson 38 years ago in 1980. Over those 38 years, I  have grown to very much appreciate and admire all that Dr. Jackson has  done to improve the physical and spiritual lives of Tennessee Valley  residents.   Dr. Jackson has dedicated the last 40 years of his pastoral service  to the congregation of Whitesburg Baptist Church in Huntsville,  Alabama. My colleagues may recall when Dr. Jackson served as a guest  chaplain for the House of Representatives in April of 2015.  [[Page H3787]]    Dr. Jackson's walk with Christ began on October 26, 1968. That day,  Dr. Jackson made the solemn decision to accept Jesus Christ as his  Savior and devote his whole life to serving God.   Dr. Jackson has said that he ``knew about Jesus before October 1968,  but on that morning when I knew myself to be lost and turned to Jesus  Christ in faith, I was converted by the grace of God.''   Through 40 years at Whitesburg Baptist, Dr. Jackson has remained  committed to leading people in the Rocket City and Alabama to Christ  and has been integral in the spiritual life of the people of the  Tennessee Valley.   Under Dr. Jackson's leadership, Whitesburg Baptist Church has grown  to 7,100 members, making it one of the largest and most successful  churches in the Tennessee Valley.   In Matthew 28, verses 19 and 20, Jesus instructed his disciples to  ``therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the  name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and teaching  them to obey everything I have commanded you. . . . '' Dr. Jackson has  lived this Great Commission through his long pastoral career at  Whitesburg Baptist and in our community and the broader Christian  faith.   In addition to presiding over Whitesburg Baptist Church, Dr. Jackson  served in a number of distinguished capacities, including but not  limited to: the executive committee of the Alabama State Board of  Missions, the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention, a  trustee of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, and on the board  of regents of the University of Mobile.   I commend Dr. Jimmy Jackson on his exceptional career and service to  God. I wish Dr. Jackson many years of happiness as he begins this new  phase of life with his bride of nearly 58 years, Bobbi; his children;  his grandchildren; and his great-grandchildren.                            ____________________
