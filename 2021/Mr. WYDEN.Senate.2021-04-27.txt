 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the  distinguished career and retirement of Lori Housman after 20 years of  service at the Congressional Budget Office. Throughout her time at CBO,  Lori has been a cornerstone of the Medicare unit. Her expertise in  Medicare's payment policy for physicians, as well as her patience and  good humor, has been essential to the Congress as it has developed  legislation in this complicated area.   During her time in public service, Lori has worked on legislation  that dramatically changed how Medicare operates, including the  Affordable Care Act and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization  Act of 2015, commonly referred to as MACRA. Lori's tireless dedication  to providing the Congress with objective analysis embodies the best of  CBO's commitment to serving both sides of the aisle with expertise,  professionalism, and fairness. Her exemplary work in analyzing  legislation is matched by her warmth toward and genuine interest in  others, earning her the admiration of congressional staff. Her efforts  over the years have surely helped to make the Medicare Program better  for tens of millions of Americans.   To her colleagues, Lori is a constant source of knowledge, support,  and kindness. She has trained many groups of CBO analysts and managers  throughout her tenure, teaching them to think critically about how  legislation can be translated into analytical models and how to explain  how legislation can be clarified to better reflect the intent of the  Congress. In addition to her contributions to CBO's analytical work,  her colleagues at CBO congressional staff are grateful for her patience  and generous spirit, especially in extraordinary circumstances.   As chairman of the Finance Committee, I, along with Ranking Member  Crapo, thank Lori for her service, and we wish her a relaxing, well- deserved retirement with her husband Van on their boat, Pigs Flew.                            ____________________
