 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Chad Bauer of Missoula County for his commitment to  stewarding safe and ethical practices among the next generation of  Montana sportsmen and women.   Chad served as a volunteer with the Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks  Missoula branch for 20 years where he instructed over 1,000 Montanans  in hunter and bowhunter education classes. We know that Montana's  public lands and wildlife deserve the utmost respect, so ensuring  future sportsmen and women commit themselves to safety and conservation  is key. From proper firearm handling, administering bear spray,  crossing fences, responsible land use and fair-chase practices, Chad  wants to ensure that Montanans' ethics translate beyond their time  spent in hunter orange.   September in Montana means the official start of archery season. As  Montanans in every corner of the State are putting in long days in the  backcountry to fill their respective tags, Chad understands the  importance of being bear-aware when it comes to grizzlies. When Chad  served on the State of Montana's Grizzly Bear Advisory Council, he  applied his knowledge as a lifelong outdoorsmen to help make  recommendations that would allow for commonsense management of these  apex predators. I am glad to see Chad not only share his insight with  the council, but also with his students in hunter and bowhunter  education classes to ensure they could enjoy the great outdoors while  upholding best safety practices.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Chad Bauer for his enthusiasm  and dedication to equipping future Montana hunters with the skills and  knowledge needed to create treasured hunting memories of their own. I  am confident his 20 years as a volunteer instructor helped strengthen  the integrity of Montana's hunting heritage, and the skills and lessons  he has shared will not be forgotten. Thank you for encouraging our  youth to get out and experience all that Montana has to offer, Chad-- you make Montana proud.                            ____________________
