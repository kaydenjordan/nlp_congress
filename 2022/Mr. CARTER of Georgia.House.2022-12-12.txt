 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Christopher Raiford from Savannah, Georgia. Christopher is a shining  example of entrepreneurship in our district.   Recently, Christopher was recognized by Georgia's 40 Under 40 list,  alongside other rising stars who displayed an unparalleled degree of  business savvy and community leadership.   Raised in the State of Georgia, he earned his undergraduate degree  from the University of Georgia and his master's in business  administration from Saint Leo University.   He rose quickly through the ranks in the banking world, displaying a  level of skill and professionalism which would match those of his more  senior peers.   Throughout his career, he has always prioritized giving back to the  community. Since becoming the president of his local Exchange Club,  Raiford has raised more than $65,000 annually for child abuse  prevention awareness, child hunger, scholarships, and recognition of  military and public service providers.   In between running a community bank, engaging in philanthropic  endeavors, raising his three boys with his wife, Anza, and completing  his Ph.D., he still somehow finds the time to coach Little League  baseball.   At the young age of 39, Christopher Raiford has proven to be a man of  dizzying ambition, intellect, energy, and empathy. Truly, there is no  Georgian more deserving of their place on Georgia's 40 Under 40.                            ____________________
