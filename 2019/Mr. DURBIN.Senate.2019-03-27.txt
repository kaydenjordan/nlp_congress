 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about  the Dream Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that would give  immigrant students who grew up in the United States a chance to earn  their citizenship. This is not a new topic. It was 19 years ago that I  introduced the Dream Act. It hasn't become law yet, but it has inspired  a movement of thousands of young people across this country.   Back in the day when I introduced this bill and talked about the  Dreamers, people thought you were talking about a British rock group.  In this case, the Dreamers happened to be a group of people living in  America who were desperately trying to become part of America's future.  They came to the United States as children, infants, toddlers, and  kids. They are American in every way except for a piece of paper on  their immigration status. They have gone to our schools. They sit next  to us in church. They are the kids whom you see on the playground with  your own kids, but they are undocumented. Because they are  undocumented, they are subject to deportation at any moment in their  lives.   They end up going to school, but it is tougher for them. They don't  qualify for Pell grants or Federal loans. They have to find a way to  save the money or find a way to secure a scholarship that just might be  available to them, but it is rare. Most of the time it means a longer  period of time in college before they can finish, as they save up the  money. Ultimately, they are trained to become our teachers, our nurses,  our doctors, our engineers, and even our soldiers.   Yesterday I reintroduced the Dream Act. My cosponsor is Senator  Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and chairman of the  Senate Judiciary Committee. I want to thank Lindsey Graham for joining  me in this bipartisan effort. Bipartisanship is rare in this Chamber,  and on an issue of controversy, it is even rarer.   Senator Graham and I have a long history of working together because  we believe that Congress has an obligation to do the job we were  elected to do and pass legislation that solves problems. Senator Graham  and I were partners in the Gang of 8--four Democratic Senators and four  Republican Senators. That was the gang with the great John McCain,  Chuck Schumer, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake, Bob Menendez,  and Michael Bennet.   We wrote a comprehensive immigration reform bill a few years back in  2013. We brought it to the floor of the Senate. We covered virtually  every aspect of immigration law. Believe me, immigration law is a mess,  and it needed that kind of comprehensive approach. We brought it up to  a vote on the floor, and the vote was 68 to 32. It was a bipartisan  vote. After months of working on this bill, we couldn't have been  happier. We finally had a bipartisan bill to address the immigration  challenge in America.   The bill left here and went to the House of Representatives under a  Republican leadership, and it died. They wouldn't even consider it,  wouldn't debate it, and, certainly, wouldn't vote on it. Look at the  mess we have today in the United States because of our immigration  laws, and consider the possibility that 6 years ago we had finally  found a path that could lead us to a bipartisan solution. That path is  still there.   Part of that immigration law was the Dream Act, which we are  reintroducing. In 2010 I joined with Republican Senator Dick Lugar of  Indiana. We called on President Obama to use his authority as President  to protect these Dreamers from deportation. In other words, if we  couldn't pass the law, could the President do something to help protect  them?   President Barack Obama responded. He created a program called the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. Here is  what DACA said: We will give you, 2 years at a time, temporary legal  status to stay in the United States and not be deported and be able to  work in this country. If you want the temporary status that is  renewable every 2 years, you have to report to the government, go  through a comprehensive background investigation, pay a fee, and, then,  we will give you a chance to stay here, go to school and work, and not  be afraid of that knock on the door.    More than 800,000 Dreamers stepped forward. They came forward in an  extraordinary way. I can remember the first day when then-Congressman  Luis Gutierrez and I decided at Navy Pier in Chicago, which is a huge  gathering place, that we would have a sit-down for these young people  so they could fill out the forms and apply for DACA status. Initially,  we thought we were going to have 1,000. We didn't know what we would do  with it. Then, there were 2,000, and then 3,000, and it turned out that  families literally stood in line all night long for the chance to come  across that threshold to sit down with a volunteer and fill out their  form for DACA status. Mothers and fathers were in tears with their kids  thinking: At least my son or my daughter will have a chance not to be  deported and to be part of America. More than 800,000 of these Dreamers  came forward, and they received DACA protection because of President  Obama's Executive order. Forty-three thousand were in my State of  Illinois.  [[Page S2024]]    DACA has unleashed the full potential of these Dreamers, who are  contributing to our country in so many ways--teachers, soldiers,  engineers, and small business owners.   Then came the day with a new President--President Donald Trump. On  September 5, 2017, President Trump announced that he would repeal DACA  and the protections that it gave to these people. Hundreds of thousands  of Dreamers faced losing their work permits and, even worse, being  deported from the only country they had ever known and being sent back  to places they couldn't even remember.   When President Trump announced the repeal of DACA, he called on  Congress to legalize DACA. Since then, President Trump has rejected  every single bipartisan deal we offered him on the subject. I am not  giving up on the Dream Act, and I am not giving up on the Dreamers. You  would think that after all these years and all these young people,  people would be coming to the floor who are against the Dream Act and  against DACA, telling horrible stories about the young people who we  are talking about today. Strangely, that has never happened. I am sure  there is going to be somebody to disappoint me. That is human nature.  Overwhelmingly, these young people are just nothing short of amazing.   I have come to the floor of the Senate more than 100 times to tell  their stories because I think that is the best way for you to  understand why this issue is so important.   This is an amazing young woman. Her name is Karla Robles. Karla  Robles is the 116th Dreamer whose story I have told on the floor of the  Senate. She was brought to the United States from Mexico when she was 8  years old. She grew up in Chicago, where her mom and dad worked long  hours in a pizza restaurant. Karla's parents told her and her brothers  and sisters: No matter what happens, make sure to stay out of trouble  and study really hard. It will all pay off one day.   That is exactly what Karla did. When Karla started school in the  third grade, she didn't speak English, but she worked hard and quickly  became an excellent student. Karla wrote me a letter and she said:  ``Education has been an important part of my life and the teachers who  took the time to guide my family and me are a big reason I want to go  into this field.''   In the seventh grade, Karla received the American Legion Award--this  undocumented young girl--which was given to one boy and one girl in the  class who ``are deemed most worthy of the high qualities of citizenship  and of true Americanism.''   In high school, Karla Robles was a member of the National Honor  Society and the President's Club, and she was active in student  government.   She participated in a program called TRUST, where she agreed to  volunteer her personal time to mentor younger students. She was captain  and MVP of the varsity tennis team. She received her associate's degree  from Harper College. She is now a senior at Loyola University in  Chicago.   Here is a special word about Loyola University in Chicago. This is an  amazing campus that is doing its best to give people just like Karla a  chance in life. They have created something called Arrupe College,  which is a low cost approach to higher education for some of the  poorest families in Chicago, and they don't exclude kids who are  protected by DACA or are Dreamers. The Loyola medical school is one of  the few in the United States with open competition where DACA students  can apply. There are 32 medical students at Loyola in Chicago who are  undocumented. They are DACA Dreamers. They desperately want to be part  of America. Part of the agreement is if they go to medical school at  Loyola and borrow money to do it, they have to pay back a year of  service in an underserved area in the State of Illinois for the money  that they are receiving to go to school.   Back to Karla.   During college, she was on the National Honor Roll and the Dean's  List. She also volunteers with an outreach program for at-risk kids and  with AmeriCorps VISTA, and she founded a tutoring program for  elementary school students.   I know Karla a little better than I know some of the Dreamers because  she interned here in my Washington, DC, office last year. What does she  want to do at the end of this journey if she can stay in America? She  wants to be a teacher in the Chicago Public Schools. She wants to  pursue her master's degree and become a high school guidance counselor.   There are some people who look at this picture and say: This is not  an American citizen. Tell her to leave. I look at this picture and  think that we are lucky to have her, that this Nation of immigrants is  lucky to have this young woman who simply wants to give back to  America. That is all she is asking for--nothing special--just to let  her give back to this country.   So we have reintroduced the Dream Act. I hope my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle will come forward and join me and Senator Lindsey  Graham, my Republican cosponsor.   We think there are about 1.8 million young people who are eligible  for the Dream Act in the United States. They have never known another  country. In the mornings, when they walk into the classrooms in their  schools, they stand up and put their hands on their chests and pledge  allegiance to the only flag they have ever known. They were just kids  when they were brought here. Shouldn't we do the right thing in  America--this Nation of immigrants, this country of opportunity, this  bright city on the hill, this shining city on the hill?   Yes, we should.   For the Dreamers and for their moms and dads, we have to renew our  commitment that the next generation of Americans who will come from all  over the world will continue to make this one of the finest countries  on Earth.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 894         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism       Prevention Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) White supremacists and other far-right-wing extremists       are the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the       United States.        (2) On February 22, 2019, a Trump Administration United       States Department of Justice official wrote in a New York       Times op-ed that ``white supremacy and far-right extremism       are among the greatest domestic-security threats facing the       United States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law       enforcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has been       slow to respond. . . .Killings committed by individuals and       groups associated with far-right extremist groups have risen       significantly.''.        (3) An April 2017 Government Accountability Office report       on the significant, lethal threat posed by domestic violent       extremists explained that ``[s]ince September 12, 2001, the       number of fatalities caused by domestic violent extremists       has ranged from 1 to 49 in a given year.'' The report noted:       ``[F]atalities resulting from attacks by far right wing       violent extremists have exceeded those caused by radical       Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years, and were       the same in 3 of the years since September 12, 2001. Of the       85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since       September 12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist groups       were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical Islamist       violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27 percent).''.        (4) An unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin       from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department       of Homeland Security found that ``white supremacist extremism       poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that       White supremacists ``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26       attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic       extremist movement''.        (5) Fatal terrorist attacks by far-right-wing extremists       include--        (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in       Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a White supremacist shot and       killed 6 members of the gurdwara;        (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community       center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland       Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3       civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;        (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which       2 supporters of the far-right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot       and killed 2 police officers and a civilian;        (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME       Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a White       supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church;        (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned       Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an       anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and       2 civilians;        (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man       in New York City, allegedly committed by a White supremacist       who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of       killing black men'';        (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which       a White supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a       third after the men defended 2 young women whom the       individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech;  [[Page S2047]]         (H) the August 12, 2017, attack in Charlottesville,       Virginia, in which a White supremacist killed one and injured       nineteen after driving his car through a crowd of individuals       protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which former Attorney       General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the definition of       domestic terrorism in our statute.'';        (I) the July 2018 murder of an African-American woman from       Kansas City, Missouri, allegedly committed by a White       supremacist who reportedly bragged about being a member of       the Ku Klux Klan;        (J) the October 24, 2018, shooting in Jeffersontown,       Kentucky, in which a White man allegedly murdered 2 African       Americans at a grocery store after first attempting to enter       a church with a predominantly African-American congregation       during a service; and        (K) the October 27, 2018, mass shooting at the Tree of Life       Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in which a White       nationalist allegedly shot and killed 11 members of the       congregation.        (6) In November 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation       released its annual hate crime incident report, which found       that in 2017, hate crimes increased by approximately 17       percent, including a 23-percent increase in religion-based       hate crimes, an 18-percent increase in race-based crimes, and       a 5-percent increase in crimes directed against LGBT       individuals. The total number of reported hate crimes rose       for the third consecutive year. The previous year's report       found that in 2016, hate crimes increased by almost 5       percent, including a 19-percent rise in hate crimes against       American Muslims; additionally, of the hate crimes motivated       by religious bias in 2016, 53 percent were anti-Semitic.       Similarly, the report analyzing 2015 data found that hate       crimes increased by 6 percent that year. Much of the 2015       increase came from a 66-percent rise in attacks on American       Muslims and a 9-percent rise in attacks on American Jews. In       all three reports, race-based crimes were most numerous, and       those crimes most often targeted African Americans.        (7) On March 15, 2019, a White nationalist was arrested and       charged with murder after allegedly killing 50 Muslim       worshippers and injuring more than 40 in a massacre at the Al       Noor Mosque and Linwood Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.       The alleged shooter posted a hate-filled, xenophobic       manifesto that detailed his White nationalist ideology before       the massacre. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern labeled the       massacre a terrorist attack.        (8) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had       expressed anti-Muslim views was charged with murder for       allegedly killing 6 people and injuring 19 in a shooting       rampage at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada. It was the first-      ever mass shooting at a mosque in North America, and Prime       Minister Trudeau labeled it a terrorist attack.        (9) On February 15, 2019, Federal authorities arrested U.S.       Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Paul Hasson, who was       allegedly planning to kill a number of prominent journalists,       professors, judges, and ``leftists in general''. In court       filings, prosecutors described Lieutenant Hasson as a       ``domestic terrorist'' who in an email ``identified himself       as a White Nationalist for over 30 years and advocated for       `focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland.''.

A bill to provide for a permanent extension of the  enforcement instruction on supervision requirements for outpatient  therapeutic services in critical access and small rural hospitals; to  the Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 916         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mothers and Offspring       Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act'' or the ``MOMMA's       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Every year, across the United States, 4,000,000 women       give birth, about 700 women suffer fatal complications during       pregnancy, while giving birth or during the postpartum       period, and 70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-related       complications.        (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to       measure the overall health of a population. While the infant       mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest       point, the risk of death for women in the United States       during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is       higher than such risk in many other developed nations. The       estimated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births)       for the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC increased       from 18.8 percent in 2000 to 23.8 percent in 2014 to 26.6       percent in 2018. This estimated rate is on par with such rate       for underdeveloped nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.        (3) International studies estimate the 2015 maternal       mortality rate in the United States as 26.4 per 100,000 live       births, which is almost twice the 2015 World Health       Organization estimation of 14 per 100,000 live births.        (4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent of maternal       deaths in the United States are preventable.        (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically       for women by race and ethnicity. There are 12.7 deaths per       100,000 live births for White women, 43.5 deaths per 100,000       live births for African-American women, and 14.4 deaths per       100,000 live births for women of other ethnicities. While       maternal mortality disparately impacts African-American       women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race,       ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and       geography.        (6) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to       die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth compared       to non-Hispanic White women.        (7) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (6)       are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of       the business community, and providers across the obstetrical       continuum represented by organizations such as March of       Dimes; the Preeclampsia Foundation; the American College of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists; the Society for Maternal-      Fetal Medicine; the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric,       and Neonatal Nurses; the California Maternal Quality Care       Collaborative; Black Women's Health Imperative; the National       Birth Equity Collaborative; Black Mamas Matter Alliance;       EverThrive Illinois; the National Association of Certified       Professional Midwives; PCOS Challenge: The National       Polycystic Ovary Sundrome Association; and the American       College of Nurse Midwives.        (8) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions,       cardiomyopathy, infection, embolism, mental health       conditions, preeclampsia and eclampsia, polycystic ovary       syndrome, infection and sepsis, and anesthesia complications       are the predominant medical causes of maternal-related deaths       and complications. Most of these conditions are largely       preventable or manageable.        (9) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health.       Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can       significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and       spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some       evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during       pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes,       such as pre-eclampsia, pre-term birth, and low birth weight.       Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good       predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can       unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting       their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention       efforts should happen even before children are born, as a       matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during       pregnancy.        (10) The United States has not been able to submit a formal       maternal mortality rate to international data repositories       since 2007. Thus, no official maternal mortality rate exists       for the United States. There can be no maternal mortality       rate without streamlining maternal mortality-related data       from the State level and extrapolating such data to the       Federal level.        (11) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is       a State function rather than a Federal process. States report       all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary       basis, without standardization across States. While the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity       and system for collecting death-related data based on death       certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported by       States in an organized and standard format across States such       that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is able       to identify causes of maternal death and best practices for       the prevention of such death.        (12) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal       mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to       derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors       contributing to maternal deaths. While the addition of       pregnancy checkboxes on death certificates since 2003 have       likely improved States' abilities to identify pregnancy-      related deaths, they are not generally completed by       obstetrical providers or persons trained to recognize       pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital forms may be       missing information or may capture inconsistent data. Due to       varying maternal mortality-related analyses, lack of       reliability, and granularity in data, current maternal       mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the myriad       medical and socially determinant factors that contribute to       such high maternal mortality rates within the United States       compared to other developed nations. Lack of standardization       of data and data sharing across States and between Federal       entities, health networks, and research institutions keep the       Nation in the dark about ways to prevent maternal deaths.        (13) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the       Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell       surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to       identify long-lasting interventions.        (14) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that       maternal deaths be investigated at the State level first, and       that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data regarding       maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and       collection would be similar in operation and effect to the       National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential       Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom.       Such a maternal mortalities and morbidities registry and       surveillance system would help providers, academicians,       lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the       types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, pregnancy-      related or pregnancy-associated mortality and morbidity.        (15) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a       aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the       maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been       achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United       States has been estimated to have more than doubled between       2000 and 2014. Yet, because national data are not fully       available, the United States does not have an official       maternal mortality rate.        (16) Many States have struggled to establish or maintain       Maternal Mortality Review Committees (referred to in this       section as ``MMRC''). On the State level, MMRCs have lagged       because States have not had the resources to mount local       reviews. State-level reviews are necessary as only the State       departments of health have the authority to request medical       records, autopsy reports,  [[Page S2051]]       and police reports critical to the function of the MMRC.        (17) The United Kingdom regards maternal deaths as a health       systems failure and a national committee of obstetrics       experts review each maternal death or near-fatal childbirth       complication. Such committee also establishes the predominant       course of maternal-related deaths from conditions such as       preeclampsia. Consequently, the United Kingdom has been able       to reduce its incidence of preeclampsia to less than one in       10,000 women--its lowest rate since 1952.        (18) The United States has no comparable, coordinated       Federal process by which to review cases of maternal       mortality, systems failures, or best practices. Many States       have active MMRCs and leverage their work to impact maternal       wellness. For example, the State of California has worked       extensively with their State health departments, health and       hospital systems, and research collaborative organizations,       including the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative       and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, to       establish MMRCs, wherein such State has determined the most       prevalent causes of maternal mortality and recorded and       shared data with providers and researchers, who have       developed and implemented safety bundles and care protocols       related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, and the like.       In this way, the State of California has been able to       leverage its maternal mortality review board system, generate       data, and apply those data to effect changes in maternal       care-related protocol. To date, the State of California has       reduced its maternal mortality rate, which is now comparable       to the low rates of the United Kingdom.        (19) Hospitals and health systems across the United States       lack standardization of emergency obstetrical protocols       before, during, and after delivery. Consequently, many       providers are delayed in recognizing critical signs       indicating maternal distress that quickly escalate into fatal       or near-fatal incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an       obstetrical emergency that does not consider both clinical       and public health approaches falls woefully under the mark of       excellent care delivery. State-based maternal quality       collaborative organizations, such as the California Maternal       Quality Care Collaborative or entities participating in the       Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM), have formed       obstetrical protocols, tool kits, and other resources to       improve system care and response as they relate to maternal       complications and warning signs for such conditions as       maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and preeclampsia.        (20) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports       that nearly half of all maternal deaths occur in the       immediate postpartum period--the 42 days following a       pregnancy--whereas more than one-third of pregnancy-related       or pregnancy-associated deaths occur while a person is still       pregnant. Yet, for women eligible for the Medicaid program on       the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at the       end of the month on which the 60th postpartum day lands.        (21) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as       being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder,       or pervasive racism, can over-activate the body's stress-      response system. Known as toxic stress, the repetition of       high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm healthy       neurological development, which can have cascading physical       and mental health consequences, as documented in the Adverse       Childhood Experiences study of the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention.        (22) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown       the correlation between the stress associated with one's       race--the stress of racism--and one's birthing outcomes. The       stress of sex and race discrimination and institutional       racism has been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk       of maternal mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age,       maternal age, socioeconomic status, or individual-level       health risk factors, including poverty, limited access to       prenatal care, and poor physical and mental health (although       these are not nominal factors). African-American women remain       the most at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-      related causes of death. When it comes to preeclampsia, for       example, which is related to obesity, African-American women       of normal weight remain the most at risk of dying during the       perinatal period compared to non-African-American obese       women.        (23) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United       States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high       rates of African-American maternal mortality.        (24) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to       die from pregnancy or maternal-related distress than are       White women, yielding one of the greatest and most       disconcerting racial disparities in public health.        (25) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic       demographics, African-American women across the socioeconomic       spectrum experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to       racial and gender discrimination, contributing to higher       rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-weight       babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a risk-      factor for these aforementioned experiences. This cumulative       stress often extends across the life course and is situated       in everyday spaces where African-American women establish       livelihood. Structural barriers, lack of access to care, and       genetic predispositions to health vulnerabilities exacerbate       African-American women's likelihood to experience poor or       fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account for the       great disparity.        (26) African-American women are twice as likely to       experience postpartum depression, and disproportionately       higher rates of preeclampsia compared to White women.        (27) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems,       including in health care delivery systems between patients       and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for       pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health,       and dismissiveness. Research has demonstrated that patients       respond more warmly and adhere to medical treatment plans at       a higher degree with providers of the same race or ethnicity       or with providers with great ability to exercise empathy.       However, the provider pool is not primed with many people of       color, nor are providers (whether student-doctors in training       or licensed practitioners) consistently required to undergo       implicit bias, cultural competency, or empathy training on a       consistent, on-going basis.       SEC. 3. IMPROVING FEDERAL EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO PREVENTION                     OF MATERNAL MORTALITY.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 894         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism       Prevention Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) White supremacists and other far-right-wing extremists       are the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the       United States.        (2) On February 22, 2019, a Trump Administration United       States Department of Justice official wrote in a New York       Times op-ed that ``white supremacy and far-right extremism       are among the greatest domestic-security threats facing the       United States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law       enforcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has been       slow to respond. . . .Killings committed by individuals and       groups associated with far-right extremist groups have risen       significantly.''.        (3) An April 2017 Government Accountability Office report       on the significant, lethal threat posed by domestic violent       extremists explained that ``[s]ince September 12, 2001, the       number of fatalities caused by domestic violent extremists       has ranged from 1 to 49 in a given year.'' The report noted:       ``[F]atalities resulting from attacks by far right wing       violent extremists have exceeded those caused by radical       Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years, and were       the same in 3 of the years since September 12, 2001. Of the       85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since       September 12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist groups       were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical Islamist       violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27 percent).''.        (4) An unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin       from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department       of Homeland Security found that ``white supremacist extremism       poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that       White supremacists ``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26       attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic       extremist movement''.        (5) Fatal terrorist attacks by far-right-wing extremists       include--        (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in       Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a White supremacist shot and       killed 6 members of the gurdwara;        (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community       center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland       Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3       civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;        (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which       2 supporters of the far-right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot       and killed 2 police officers and a civilian;        (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME       Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a White       supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church;        (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned       Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an       anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and       2 civilians;        (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man       in New York City, allegedly committed by a White supremacist       who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of       killing black men'';        (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which       a White supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a       third after the men defended 2 young women whom the       individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech;  [[Page S2047]]         (H) the August 12, 2017, attack in Charlottesville,       Virginia, in which a White supremacist killed one and injured       nineteen after driving his car through a crowd of individuals       protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which former Attorney       General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the definition of       domestic terrorism in our statute.'';        (I) the July 2018 murder of an African-American woman from       Kansas City, Missouri, allegedly committed by a White       supremacist who reportedly bragged about being a member of       the Ku Klux Klan;        (J) the October 24, 2018, shooting in Jeffersontown,       Kentucky, in which a White man allegedly murdered 2 African       Americans at a grocery store after first attempting to enter       a church with a predominantly African-American congregation       during a service; and        (K) the October 27, 2018, mass shooting at the Tree of Life       Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in which a White       nationalist allegedly shot and killed 11 members of the       congregation.        (6) In November 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation       released its annual hate crime incident report, which found       that in 2017, hate crimes increased by approximately 17       percent, including a 23-percent increase in religion-based       hate crimes, an 18-percent increase in race-based crimes, and       a 5-percent increase in crimes directed against LGBT       individuals. The total number of reported hate crimes rose       for the third consecutive year. The previous year's report       found that in 2016, hate crimes increased by almost 5       percent, including a 19-percent rise in hate crimes against       American Muslims; additionally, of the hate crimes motivated       by religious bias in 2016, 53 percent were anti-Semitic.       Similarly, the report analyzing 2015 data found that hate       crimes increased by 6 percent that year. Much of the 2015       increase came from a 66-percent rise in attacks on American       Muslims and a 9-percent rise in attacks on American Jews. In       all three reports, race-based crimes were most numerous, and       those crimes most often targeted African Americans.        (7) On March 15, 2019, a White nationalist was arrested and       charged with murder after allegedly killing 50 Muslim       worshippers and injuring more than 40 in a massacre at the Al       Noor Mosque and Linwood Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.       The alleged shooter posted a hate-filled, xenophobic       manifesto that detailed his White nationalist ideology before       the massacre. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern labeled the       massacre a terrorist attack.        (8) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had       expressed anti-Muslim views was charged with murder for       allegedly killing 6 people and injuring 19 in a shooting       rampage at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada. It was the first-      ever mass shooting at a mosque in North America, and Prime       Minister Trudeau labeled it a terrorist attack.        (9) On February 15, 2019, Federal authorities arrested U.S.       Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Paul Hasson, who was       allegedly planning to kill a number of prominent journalists,       professors, judges, and ``leftists in general''. In court       filings, prosecutors described Lieutenant Hasson as a       ``domestic terrorist'' who in an email ``identified himself       as a White Nationalist for over 30 years and advocated for       `focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland.''.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 916         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mothers and Offspring       Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act'' or the ``MOMMA's       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Every year, across the United States, 4,000,000 women       give birth, about 700 women suffer fatal complications during       pregnancy, while giving birth or during the postpartum       period, and 70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-related       complications.        (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to       measure the overall health of a population. While the infant       mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest       point, the risk of death for women in the United States       during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is       higher than such risk in many other developed nations. The       estimated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births)       for the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC increased       from 18.8 percent in 2000 to 23.8 percent in 2014 to 26.6       percent in 2018. This estimated rate is on par with such rate       for underdeveloped nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.        (3) International studies estimate the 2015 maternal       mortality rate in the United States as 26.4 per 100,000 live       births, which is almost twice the 2015 World Health       Organization estimation of 14 per 100,000 live births.        (4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent of maternal       deaths in the United States are preventable.        (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically       for women by race and ethnicity. There are 12.7 deaths per       100,000 live births for White women, 43.5 deaths per 100,000       live births for African-American women, and 14.4 deaths per       100,000 live births for women of other ethnicities. While       maternal mortality disparately impacts African-American       women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race,       ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and       geography.        (6) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to       die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth compared       to non-Hispanic White women.        (7) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (6)       are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of       the business community, and providers across the obstetrical       continuum represented by organizations such as March of       Dimes; the Preeclampsia Foundation; the American College of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists; the Society for Maternal-      Fetal Medicine; the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric,       and Neonatal Nurses; the California Maternal Quality Care       Collaborative; Black Women's Health Imperative; the National       Birth Equity Collaborative; Black Mamas Matter Alliance;       EverThrive Illinois; the National Association of Certified       Professional Midwives; PCOS Challenge: The National       Polycystic Ovary Sundrome Association; and the American       College of Nurse Midwives.        (8) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions,       cardiomyopathy, infection, embolism, mental health       conditions, preeclampsia and eclampsia, polycystic ovary       syndrome, infection and sepsis, and anesthesia complications       are the predominant medical causes of maternal-related deaths       and complications. Most of these conditions are largely       preventable or manageable.        (9) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health.       Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can       significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and       spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some       evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during       pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes,       such as pre-eclampsia, pre-term birth, and low birth weight.       Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good       predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can       unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting       their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention       efforts should happen even before children are born, as a       matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during       pregnancy.        (10) The United States has not been able to submit a formal       maternal mortality rate to international data repositories       since 2007. Thus, no official maternal mortality rate exists       for the United States. There can be no maternal mortality       rate without streamlining maternal mortality-related data       from the State level and extrapolating such data to the       Federal level.        (11) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is       a State function rather than a Federal process. States report       all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary       basis, without standardization across States. While the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity       and system for collecting death-related data based on death       certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported by       States in an organized and standard format across States such       that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is able       to identify causes of maternal death and best practices for       the prevention of such death.        (12) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal       mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to       derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors       contributing to maternal deaths. While the addition of       pregnancy checkboxes on death certificates since 2003 have       likely improved States' abilities to identify pregnancy-      related deaths, they are not generally completed by       obstetrical providers or persons trained to recognize       pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital forms may be       missing information or may capture inconsistent data. Due to       varying maternal mortality-related analyses, lack of       reliability, and granularity in data, current maternal       mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the myriad       medical and socially determinant factors that contribute to       such high maternal mortality rates within the United States       compared to other developed nations. Lack of standardization       of data and data sharing across States and between Federal       entities, health networks, and research institutions keep the       Nation in the dark about ways to prevent maternal deaths.        (13) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the       Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell       surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to       identify long-lasting interventions.        (14) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that       maternal deaths be investigated at the State level first, and       that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data regarding       maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and       collection would be similar in operation and effect to the       National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential       Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom.       Such a maternal mortalities and morbidities registry and       surveillance system would help providers, academicians,       lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the       types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, pregnancy-      related or pregnancy-associated mortality and morbidity.        (15) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a       aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the       maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been       achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United       States has been estimated to have more than doubled between       2000 and 2014. Yet, because national data are not fully       available, the United States does not have an official       maternal mortality rate.        (16) Many States have struggled to establish or maintain       Maternal Mortality Review Committees (referred to in this       section as ``MMRC''). On the State level, MMRCs have lagged       because States have not had the resources to mount local       reviews. State-level reviews are necessary as only the State       departments of health have the authority to request medical       records, autopsy reports,  [[Page S2051]]       and police reports critical to the function of the MMRC.        (17) The United Kingdom regards maternal deaths as a health       systems failure and a national committee of obstetrics       experts review each maternal death or near-fatal childbirth       complication. Such committee also establishes the predominant       course of maternal-related deaths from conditions such as       preeclampsia. Consequently, the United Kingdom has been able       to reduce its incidence of preeclampsia to less than one in       10,000 women--its lowest rate since 1952.        (18) The United States has no comparable, coordinated       Federal process by which to review cases of maternal       mortality, systems failures, or best practices. Many States       have active MMRCs and leverage their work to impact maternal       wellness. For example, the State of California has worked       extensively with their State health departments, health and       hospital systems, and research collaborative organizations,       including the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative       and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, to       establish MMRCs, wherein such State has determined the most       prevalent causes of maternal mortality and recorded and       shared data with providers and researchers, who have       developed and implemented safety bundles and care protocols       related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, and the like.       In this way, the State of California has been able to       leverage its maternal mortality review board system, generate       data, and apply those data to effect changes in maternal       care-related protocol. To date, the State of California has       reduced its maternal mortality rate, which is now comparable       to the low rates of the United Kingdom.        (19) Hospitals and health systems across the United States       lack standardization of emergency obstetrical protocols       before, during, and after delivery. Consequently, many       providers are delayed in recognizing critical signs       indicating maternal distress that quickly escalate into fatal       or near-fatal incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an       obstetrical emergency that does not consider both clinical       and public health approaches falls woefully under the mark of       excellent care delivery. State-based maternal quality       collaborative organizations, such as the California Maternal       Quality Care Collaborative or entities participating in the       Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM), have formed       obstetrical protocols, tool kits, and other resources to       improve system care and response as they relate to maternal       complications and warning signs for such conditions as       maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and preeclampsia.        (20) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports       that nearly half of all maternal deaths occur in the       immediate postpartum period--the 42 days following a       pregnancy--whereas more than one-third of pregnancy-related       or pregnancy-associated deaths occur while a person is still       pregnant. Yet, for women eligible for the Medicaid program on       the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at the       end of the month on which the 60th postpartum day lands.        (21) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as       being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder,       or pervasive racism, can over-activate the body's stress-      response system. Known as toxic stress, the repetition of       high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm healthy       neurological development, which can have cascading physical       and mental health consequences, as documented in the Adverse       Childhood Experiences study of the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention.        (22) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown       the correlation between the stress associated with one's       race--the stress of racism--and one's birthing outcomes. The       stress of sex and race discrimination and institutional       racism has been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk       of maternal mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age,       maternal age, socioeconomic status, or individual-level       health risk factors, including poverty, limited access to       prenatal care, and poor physical and mental health (although       these are not nominal factors). African-American women remain       the most at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-      related causes of death. When it comes to preeclampsia, for       example, which is related to obesity, African-American women       of normal weight remain the most at risk of dying during the       perinatal period compared to non-African-American obese       women.        (23) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United       States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high       rates of African-American maternal mortality.        (24) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to       die from pregnancy or maternal-related distress than are       White women, yielding one of the greatest and most       disconcerting racial disparities in public health.        (25) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic       demographics, African-American women across the socioeconomic       spectrum experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to       racial and gender discrimination, contributing to higher       rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-weight       babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a risk-      factor for these aforementioned experiences. This cumulative       stress often extends across the life course and is situated       in everyday spaces where African-American women establish       livelihood. Structural barriers, lack of access to care, and       genetic predispositions to health vulnerabilities exacerbate       African-American women's likelihood to experience poor or       fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account for the       great disparity.        (26) African-American women are twice as likely to       experience postpartum depression, and disproportionately       higher rates of preeclampsia compared to White women.        (27) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems,       including in health care delivery systems between patients       and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for       pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health,       and dismissiveness. Research has demonstrated that patients       respond more warmly and adhere to medical treatment plans at       a higher degree with providers of the same race or ethnicity       or with providers with great ability to exercise empathy.       However, the provider pool is not primed with many people of       color, nor are providers (whether student-doctors in training       or licensed practitioners) consistently required to undergo       implicit bias, cultural competency, or empathy training on a       consistent, on-going basis.
