 Madam President, earlier today at the White House,  President Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and  the Foreign Ministers from the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to sign  the Abraham Accords.   These historic agreements began the process of normalizing  relationships between the two Gulf countries and the Jewish state.  After seven decades of isolation in the region, the Abraham Accords  signify Israel's existence is finally being accepted by Arab countries,  opening new prospects for greater economic, security, and cultural  cooperation that will benefit all--those in the region and all of us  around the world.   I commend President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and many others in this  administration for facilitating this historic agreement and advancing  the cause of peace and prosperity in the region. This came to many of  us as a surprise, but it is a welcome surprise. I am very pleased at  this development.   Over the past several years, the President and Secretary have  cultivated relationships in Jerusalem, Abu Dhabi, and Manama. And for  longer than that, Israel and Arab countries have cooperated on  important matters but behind closed doors. Capitalizing on a changing  Middle East, President Trump and his administration helped shepherd  these relationships into the open.   Today's signing is just a beginning for the three countries and the  region as a whole. More work, obviously, is to be done, and no  agreement can be easily accomplished. But my hope is that more Arab  countries will follow the path of publicly recognizing Israel. Eighteen  Arab states have yet to make this move, preventing relationships that  can benefit the entire region.   Israel's right to exist is unquestionable, and to refuse to recognize  this is to deny reality. I, along with so many other Members of this  Chamber, have worked to ensure Israel's security and prosperity. With  more days like today, we can hope for a region that is secure and  prosperous as well for all.   I use this opportunity to commend this accomplishment, and I hope  that we are able to bring more peace and stability to this region and  to the rest of the world.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Madam President, I now ask for a second reading, but in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 92, which was  received from the House.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  concurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 696, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, September 16; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day and morning business be closed; finally,  that following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session  and resume consideration of the Robinson nomination under the previous  order.    If there is no further business to come before the Senate,  I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:57 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, September 16, 2020, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
