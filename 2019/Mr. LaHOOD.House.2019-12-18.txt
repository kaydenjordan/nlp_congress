 Madam Speaker, I have said from the beginning of this  process, impeachment is and should be the nuclear option reserved for  the most treasonous activity and the most serious activity. Clearly,  that has not been met here.   As I reviewed the facts and evidence, as a former Federal  prosecutor--I have read the transcripts; I have watched the hearings; I  have read the whistleblower report--that has not been met here.   In addition, this process has lacked fairness, due process, and  transparency.   We shouldn't be here tonight doing this. This is a travesty.
