 Mr. Speaker, I am Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi  from the great Eighth District of Illinois. I have the honor of  representing the hardworking families of Chicago's west and northwest  suburbs.   Before I took the oath of office last week, I was the president of  small businesses in the Chicago area. As a small-business man, I stand  here to say that repealing without replacing the Affordable Care Act  would harm our economy and, with it, our working and middle class  families.   Across our Nation, repealing without replacing the Affordable Care  Act would destroy up to 3 million good-paying jobs and destroy $1.5  trillion in economic activity. Across Illinois, repealing without  replacing the ACA would cost upwards of 100,000 jobs; and in the Eighth  District alone, repealing without replacing the ACA would cost upwards  of 4,000 jobs.   Middle class families need good-paying jobs and affordable health  care. Repealing without replacing the ACA would, unfortunately, rob  them of both.                            ____________________
