 Mr. President, on September 27, 2019, Harris County lost  one of its finest when Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal's life was taken in the  line of duty. Pyara Dhaliwal, Deputy Dhaliwal's father, lost his hero.   That is exactly who Deputy Dhaliwal was, a hero. He was deeply  committed to his faith, his family, and to serving others with  compassion.   Moved by his Sikh faith, Deputy Dhaliwal was a trailblazer. When he  was first recruited by the sheriff's office, Deputy Dhaliwal petitioned  the office to allow him to wear his turban and beard while in uniform,  becoming the first to be allowed to do so.   Deputy Dhaliwal has left a profound legacy on the law enforcement  community. Since his death, the Houston Police Department and all eight  county constables have changed their policies to allow officers to wear  and carry articles of faith on duty. Deputy Dhaliwal's commitment to  his faith will inspire generations of Sikhs and other religious  minorities to serve in law enforcement and protect our communities.   Deputy Dhaliwal was also a dedicated husband, father, son, and  brother. His wife Harwinder Kaur Dhaliwal and their three beautiful  children Japdeep, Noordeep, and Pardeep and their family and friends  have dedicated their lives to ensuring his legacy endures.   We also remember Deputy Dhaliwal's commitment to love and peace, a  love and peace he showed not only while on duty, but to each person he  served.   When Hurricane Harvey decimated the Texas Gulf Coast, Deputy Dhaliwal  served meals to Houstonians who were left homeless. In the wake of  Hurricane Maria, he traveled to Puerto Rico to assist in the relief  efforts there. He also worked to deliver water and supplies to Punjab,  India, while the area was suffering from a severe drought.   Deputy Dhaliwal leaves behind an unmistakably beautiful legacy of a  life marked with faith, devotion, and service to others.   I am grateful my colleagues have moved to rename the U.S. Postal  Office  [[Page S7239]]  in Houston the ``Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building,''  to ensure Deputy Dhaliwal's selfless service and heroism is remembered.  This community and the entire State of Texas are better for having  known him.                            ____________________
