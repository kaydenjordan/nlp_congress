 Madam Speaker, I would like to first thank the chairman  and the working group for working together.   Trade can be a poverty buster. It is a powerful tool in the toolbox  by increasing the earning power of our communities and creating well- paying jobs.   Coming from the city of Philadelphia, which nearly has 25 percent  poverty, well-paying jobs are the difference between thriving and  surviving. Let me say that again: thriving and surviving. That is why  this is important.   Trade is especially beneficial to minority-owned businesses.  Minority-owned exporting businesses average three times more workers  and pay a wage premium of nearly $16,000 more.   That is why I thank the chairman and the staff in the working group,  because of their leadership. This really sends a message to the entire  world that we want free trade, but also fair trade.   It is especially important to understand that everybody doesn't get  everything they want. That is called negotiation.   Again, I stand here today, proudly, to say I am supporting this 100  percent.
