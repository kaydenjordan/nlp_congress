 Mr. Speaker, on a brighter, more positive, and nonpartisan  side this morning, it is an honor and a pleasure to recognize the  lifetime achievements of my longtime friend and a true patriotic  citizen, Judge Alli B. Majeed, who has just retired after 24 years of  service on the bench.   He was the longest serving county judge in the 18th Judicial Circuit.  That includes Florida's Brevard and Seminole Counties. Judge Majeed, or  A.B. as many of us know him, was born in the former British colony of  Guyana, South America, to parents who were descendants of indentured  servants from India.   Having grown up in a small village, his family didn't have much, and  they worked hard for what little they did have. A.B. cherished the  opportunity to attend and graduate from high school.   In 1969, he came to the United States on a student visa. He was Phi  Beta Kappa and graduated magna cum laude from Howard University here in  Washington, D.C. In 1975, A.B. graduated from the Catholic University  of America's Columbus Law School.   Alli became a U.S. citizen on November 16, 1979, and began his legal  career working as an attorney and supervisor at Community Legal  Services in Philadelphia, where he served the needy and indigent  clients. He went on to work as a criminal attorney, assistant public  defender, and assistant State attorney.   I knew A.B. before he was appointed as a county judge in 1993 by  then-Governor Lawton Chiles to fill a vacancy and was subsequently  reelected to new terms unopposed all but one time. Once on the bench,  Judge Majeed became known as a competent and respected judge.   He also became well known for his motivational and educational talks  about the importance of jury duty to groups of new jurors, many of whom  show up disenchanted about being selected to serve. As someone who has  been a juror and has heard his talk firsthand more than once, I can  promise you that it is extraordinary. No one in my pool of jurors  looked forward to being called for jury duty, but after Judge Majeed's  patriotic, uplifting, and inspiring lesson, everyone became  enthusiastic about the opportunity to serve.   ``We take an oath to obey, preserve, and protect the Constitution of  the United States of America,'' said Judge Majeed.   To the Majeed family, this oath is serious business. He has three  nephews who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces: Steve Majeed,  U.S. Navy; Rick Majeed, United States Air Force; and Omar Majeed,  United States Marines.   ``I love this country,'' he said. ``We believe deeply in it.''   In his letter of resignation to the chief justice of the State of  Florida, Judge Majeed penned these words: ``I am beholden to the United  States of America who opened her doors to me as a twenty two year old,  on a student visa. She allowed me to dream the impossible dream, then  showed me the way to make those dreams come true.   ``Serving the public, interacting with the Bar, and my many judicial  colleagues have left me with a sense of accomplishment beyond my  loftiest dreams.   ``As I tender my resignation my heart is filled with great joy of  twenty four years of judicial distance well run. With credit to  President Lincoln, I go forth from this place with malice towards none  and charity towards all.''   Judge Majeed was elected president of all of the county judges in the  State of Florida. He has dedicated much of his noncourtroom hours to  civic activities motivating and educating the public on the virtues of  the United States Constitution and our democratic Republic.   Alli Majeed is the father of three daughters and one son. His wife,  Yasmin Majeed, is very active in community and charitable causes  throughout our community. I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting  Judge Alli Majeed's achievements, his service to our community, and his  commitment to our country.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 75, line 3, strike ``and'' at the end.        Page 75, line 13, strike the period at the end and insert       ``; and''.        Page 75, insert after line 13 the following:        ``(D) a list of all influential scientific information       disseminated or expected to be disseminated by the agency       relating to the rule, including any peer review plans for the       information, including--        ``(i) the date the information or peer review was or is       expected to be received by the agency;        ``(ii) the date the information or peer review was       publically disclosed or is expected to be publically       disclosed, and, if that date is altered in subsequent       reports, a brief explanation for the change; and        ``(iii) the Internet address of the information or peer       review completed and disclosed or of where the information or       peer review will be found, once completed and disclosed.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Posey) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is about transparency and  accountability. I rise to urge my colleagues to support it.   When an agency decides to write a rule or revise an old one, they are  sometimes required to share technical or scientific information to  support their proposal. For many years, scientific research has relied  upon the peer review process to ensure quality, integrity, and  objectivity of published work. Peer review is when scientists open  their research to the scrutiny of other experts in their field in order  to receive feedback, criticism, and ensure their conclusions are sound.   Unfortunately, when peer reviews of information return unfavorable  comments or raise unforeseen issues with the quality of work, some  agencies have acted to silence or hide the critiques. This, of course,  is bad science, and it results in bad public policy.   A recent example of this abuse occurred during a highly technical  rulemaking proceeding in which an agency relied heavily upon a single  study that many criticized as profoundly inadequate. The agency  commissioned two peer reviews of the study, which were completed and  returned 2 weeks into the comment period for the public. However, after  both scholars submitted highly critical reviews that echoed the  concerns of the many commentators, sadly, the agency withheld the  release of their work to the public. When the agency finally did  release the information as required by law, it was on the Friday that  marked the very last day of the comment period as part of a massive  document dump that buried the negative reviews.   The political cherry-picking of scientific information and  manipulation of the public record harms both the quality of Federal  regulations as well as the overall integrity of the rulemaking  proceeding. When Federal agencies distribute scientific research  supporting a proposed rule, the public and those affected by it deserve  to be certain that the science is of the highest quality and have a due  process right to comment meaningfully on the rules the science intends  to support.   My amendment will help protect this basic principle of good  government and ensure fairness in Federal rulemaking by requiring that  the public be provided with a clear timeline for disclosure of any  influential scientific information. The amendment will also require  agencies to offer an explanation if they revise the anticipated public  release date of peer reviews. Simply put, the Federal agency will no  longer be able to shield from the public view the existence of  information that is central to evaluating a proposed rule.   We cannot continue to allow the Federal agencies to march toward a  predetermined outcome at the expense of sound science and policy. I  urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida has 2 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida has 2 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, most members of the public don't know what a  rule is. Rules are laws made by unelected and unaccountable  bureaucrats.   We collected 4 years' worth of Daily Registers in my office. Those  are executive orders, rules, proposed rules, changes to rules. I ask  people how big they think the stack is. I get answers 4 feet, 6 feet, 7  feet. Well, actually, in 4 years' time, the stack was 7 stacks over my  head--over 70 linear feet of laws made by unelectable, unaccountable  people.   The public thinks we make the laws. Most of the laws we don't make.  We allow unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to make the laws; and the  very least we can do to protect the public is ensure that we have  transparency and accountability for their procedures, and that is  exactly what this amendment does.   Mr. Chairman, before I close, I include in the Record a letter from a  leading policy research institution that highlights the need for  legislation like my amendment that will improve the public peer review  process in our Federal agencies.           Phoenix Center for Advanced Legal & Economic Public             Policy Studies,                                  Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.       Re Republic Peer Review.       Speaker Paul Ryan,      Washington, DC.      Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: As both of       you know first-hand, developing and implementing good public       policy is no easy task. The issues before regulatory agencies       are often complex and technical, and therefore resolution       benefits from input from the best minds both in and out of       government. Yet, simply because someone writes a lengthy       report on a particular topic does not automatically mean that       their analysis is valid. No presumption of scientific       legitimacy can be afforded when making good public policy.       Instead, if policymakers are going to rely on a particular       study, then that study deserves to be critiqued first via       public peer review in a dispassionate manner to see if the       prescriptions and findings hold up. This public peer review       is exceedingly important when deciding controversial matters,       particularly because reviewing courts are loath to second-      guess expert administrative agency's policy decisions--      choosing instead to limit themselves only to questions of       law. (See, e.g., USTelecom v. FCC, 825 F.3d 674, 697 (D.C.       Cir. 2016) (we do not ``inquire whether `some or many       economists would disapprove of the [agency's] approach'       because `we do not sit as a panel of referees on a       professional economics journal, but as a panel of generalist       judges obliged to defer to a reasonable judgment by an agency       acting pursuant to congressionally delegated authority.''))       As such, the peer review process allows the public to better       hold government to account and results in more informed       policymaking.        Unfortunately, while the Office of Management and Budget       mandates peer review, many administrative agencies do not       take the peer review process seriously. By way of example, I       am attaching an op-ed I wrote in The Hill last year       demonstrating how the Federal Communications Commission       flagrantly violated the public's due process rights by hiding       until the very last moments the highly-critical results of       the agency's peer review of an outside economic study which       the agency intended to be the foundational document to impose       price regulation for Business Data Services. By any account,       such behavior is not an example of ``good'' government.       Legislation to improve the public peer review process at       federal agencies is therefore both welcome and necessary.            Sincerely,                                                Lawrence J. Spiwak,      President, The Phoenix Center.                                   ____                        [From The Hill, July 7 , 2016]             The FCC's Lack of Respect for Due Process, Part II                          (By Lawrence J. Spiwak)         Since Tom Wheeler took over the chairmanship of the Federal       Communications Commission (FCC), we have seen one assault       after another on American's procedural due process rights. In       addition to the well-documented improprieties with the White       House during the Open Internet debate, Wheeler, among other       transgressions, has attempted to force nonprofits to reveal       their donors in strict violation of Supreme Court precedent,       hired advocates who had filed in significant FCC dockets as       an interested party to come into the commission to supervise       those very dockets, and attempted to hold a FCC ``town hall''       in which he had invited an outside party to participate and       comment on a yet-to-be-released item during the ``sunshine''       period.        Wheeler is now at it again, this time in the context of the       FCC's attempt to impose stringent price regulation for       ``business data services'' (BDS). Let's look at this shameful       timeline. Sometime last late last year, the FCC started       working on a new regulatory framework for BDS. At the heart       of the commission's new regulatory framework was an economic       appendix prepared by an outside expert, Marc Rysman of Boston       University.        On April 14, 2016, approximately two weeks before the FCC       was to vote on the formal ``Notice of Proposed Rulemaking''       containing its proposed BDS regulatory framework, the agency       requested outside peer review (as required by law) of the       Rysman Appendix from Andrew Sweeting of the University of       Maryland and Tommaso Valletti of Imperial College Business       School (U.K.). Sweeting responded on April 26, 2016 (12 days       after the peer review request); and Valletti responded on       April 28, 2016 (14 days after the peer review request).       Neither peer review was particularly kind to Rysman's       analysis.        On April 28, 2016, the FCC voted on its ``Notice of       Proposed Rulemaking'' to provide an aggressive new regulatory       paradigm for BDS (hereinafter ``BDS NPRM''). Due to editorial       privileges, however, the FCC did not formally release the BDS       NPRM until May 2, 2016. Although the commission had the       Sweetling and Valletti critiques in hand during the editorial       privilege window and could have incorporated them into the       final BDS NPRM, the FCC declined. In fact, the FCC made no       mention of either critique of the Rysman Appendix in its       final BDS NPRM, choosing instead to keep the existence of the       Sweeting and Valletti reviews secret from the public.        On June 28, 2016--almost two months to the day since the       BDS NPRM was first voted upon and the very date initial       comments were due the FCC finally made the existence of the       Sweeting and Valletti peer reviews public. Adding to the       commission's subterfuge, the agency chose the same day also:       (1) to perform a massive data dump into the record; (2) to       release an updated version of the Rysman Appendix; and (3) to       introduce three new staff studies (the same staff which are       charged with writing the final BDS rules) purporting to       address, and ultimately correct, the shortcomings of the       Rysman Appendix. In so doing, the FCC made sure that no one       could address either these data or studies in their initial       comments.        For those who care about the integrity of our government       institutions, the FCC's constant disregard for due process is       deeply troubling. As the D.C. Circuit recently wrote in       Association of American Railroads v. Department of       Transportation (2016):        No clause in our nation's Constitution has as ancient a       pedigree as the guarantee that ``[n]o person . . . shall be       deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of       law.'' U.S. CONST. amend. V. Its lineage reaches back to 1215       A.D.'s Magna Carta, which ensured that ``[n]o freeman shall       be . . . disseised of his . . . liberties, or . . . otherwise       destroyed . . . but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by       the law of the land.'' Magna Carta, ch. 29, in 1 E. Coke, The       Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 45       (1797). Since the Fifth Amendment's ratification, one theme       above all others has dominated the Supreme Court's       interpretation of the Due Process Clause: fairness. Id. at       27.        Now to be clear, as Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote in       Snyder v. Massachusetts (1934), while ``[d]ue process of law       requires that the proceedings shall be fair . . . fairness is       a relative, not an absolute, concept. It is fairness with       reference to particular conditions or particular results.''       That said, as the D.C. Circuit again affirmed just last month       in U.S. Telecom Association v. FCC, it remains black-letter       law that ``[u]nder the [Administrative Procedure Act], an       NPRM must `provide sufficient factual detail and rationale       for the rule to permit interested parties to comment       meaningfully.' ''        As the FCC has by any reasonable account deprived parties       with the opportunity to comment meaningfully upon the       fundamental economic analysis and data upon which it intends       to use to impose rate regulation for BDS, I think it is safe       to argue that under even the broadest light, the agency's       conduct in this case is a prima facie violation of procedural       due process.        What is the FCC so afraid of? Is it truly scared to have       substantive debate on the issues? Is the outcome so       predetermined that it has to resort to kangaroo court tactics       that would make North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proud?       Indeed, it is a bit ironic (if not outright hypocritical)       that while the FCC is doing everything it can to prevent       meaningful comments about a highly complex topic, the Obama       administration is doing everything in its power to create a       culture which encourages robo-comments which offer up nothing       substantive to the debate other than to promote ideological       sophistry from both sides of the political spectrum. And we       wonder why (rhetorically) the FCC is now regarded as an       ``economics-free zone,'' as an AT&T executive noted?        Given the D.C. Circuit's recent proclivity to grant the FCC       great deference, no matter how many liberties it may take,       restoring the rule of law at the FCC will ultimately fall       into the hands of Congress. Fortunately, the House Energy and       Commerce Committee has scheduled yet another oversight       hearing  [[Page H364]]       next week with all five members of the Commission in       attendance, where perhaps some sunlight can be used as a       disinfectant. I therefore encourage the Commerce Committee       members and staff--from both sides of the aisle--to do their       homework, come to the hearing prepared, and call Chairman       Wheeler out on the carpet.     As the letter states: ``No presumption of scientific  legitimacy can be afforded when making good public policy.''  Unfortunately, many administrative agencies make this assumption and do  not take seriously the peer review process. For that reason, I once  again urge my colleagues to support this good government proposal for  transparency and accountability that will help protect the integrity of  the Federal rulemaking process.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey).
