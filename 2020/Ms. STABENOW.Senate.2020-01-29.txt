 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I send a question to the  desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Stabenow asks the House managers:         Would the House Managers care to correct the record on any       falsehoods or mischaracterizations in the White House's       opening arguments?    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, thank you for  that question. We believe that the President's team has claimed  basically there were six facts that have not been met and will not  change and all six of those so-called facts are incorrect.   Let's be clear. On July 25--that is not the whole evidence before us,  even though it includes devastating evidence, the President's scheme.  President Trump's intent was made clear on the July 25 call, but we had  evidence of information before the meeting with Mr. Bolton, the text  message to Mr. Zelensky's people telling him he had to do the  investigations to get what he wanted. All of this evidence makes us  understand that phone call even more clearly.   Now, the President's team claimed that Mr. Zelensky and other  Ukrainians said they never felt pressured over investigations. Now, of  course, they didn't say that publicly. They were afraid of the Russians  finding out. But Zelensky said privately that he didn't want to be  involved in U.S. domestic politics. He resisted announcing the  investigations. He only relented and scheduled the CNN meeting after it  became clear that he was not going to receive the support that he  needed and that Congress had provided in our appropriations. That is  the definition of ``pressure.''   Now, Ukraine--the President's lawyers say--didn't know that Trump was  withholding the security assistance until it was public. Many witnesses  have contested that, including the open statement by Olena Zerkal, who  was then the Deputy Foreign Minister of Ukraine, that they knew about  the President's hold on security matters, and in the end, everyone  knew, it was public, and afterward, Ukraine did relent and scheduled  that testimony.   Fourth, they said no witnesses, said security was conditioned on the  investigations. Not so. There was Mulvaney, and we had other witnesses  talking about the shakedown for the security assistance. But the  important thing is, you can get a witness who talked to the President  firsthand about what the President thought he was doing.    Ultimately, of course, the funds--or at least some of them--were  released, but the White House meeting that the President promised three  different times still has not occurred, and we still don't have the  investigation of the Bidens.   Getting caught doesn't mitigate the wrongdoing. The President is  unrepentant, and we fear he will do it again.   The independent Government Accountability Office concluded that the  President violated Federal law when he withheld that aid. That  misconduct is still going on. All the aid has not yet been released.   Finally, I would just like to say that there has been some confusion,  I think. I am sure it is not intentional. But the President surely does  not need the permission of his staff about foreign policy. That  information is offered to you as evidence of what he thought he was  doing. He did not appear to be pursuing a policy agenda. From all of  the evidence, he appeared to be pursuing a corruption--a corruption of  our election that is upcoming; a high crime and misdemeanor that  requires conviction and removal.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
