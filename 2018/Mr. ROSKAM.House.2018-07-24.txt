 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1201) to amend section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of  1986 to provide an additional religious exemption from the individual  health coverage mandate, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1201         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Equitable Access to Care and       Health Act'' or the ``EACH Act''.  [[Page H7108]]            SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION FROM HEALTH COVERAGE                     RESPONSIBILITY REQUIREMENT.         (a) In General.--Section 5000A(d)(2)(A) of the Internal       Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:        ``(A) Religious conscience exemptions.--        ``(i) In general.--Such term shall not include any       individual for any month if such individual has in effect an       exemption under section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act which certifies that--         ``(I) such individual is a member of a recognized religious       sect or division thereof which is described in section       1402(g)(1), and is adherent of established tenets or       teachings of such sect or division as described in such       section; or        ``(II) such individual is a member of a religious sect or       division thereof which is not described in section       1402(g)(1), who relies solely on a religious method of       healing, and for whom the acceptance of medical health       services would be inconsistent with the religious beliefs of       the individual.         ``(ii) Special rules.--         ``(I) Medical health services defined.--For purposes of       this subparagraph, the term `medical health services' does       not include routine dental, vision and hearing services,       midwifery services, vaccinations, necessary medical services       provided to children, services required by law or by a third       party, and such other services as the Secretary of Health and       Human Services may provide in implementing section       1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care       Act.        ``(II) Attestation required.--Clause (i)(II) shall apply to       an individual for months in a taxable year only if the       information provided by the individual under section       1411(b)(5)(A) of such Act includes an attestation that the       individual has not received medical health services during       the preceding taxable year.''.         (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31,       2018.        (c) Construction.--Nothing in the amendment made by       subsection (a) shall preempt any State law requiring the       provision of medical treatment for children, especially those       who are seriously ill.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1201, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to see this bipartisan bill is getting a  vote today.   H.R. 1201, the EACH Act, or Equitable Access to Care and Health Act,  introduced by my colleague, Mr. Rodney Davis from Illinois, provides  commonsense relief from ObamaCare's mandate to purchase insurance from  those who object on religious grounds.   This bill extends the religious conscience exemption from ObamaCare's  individual mandate to those individuals who rely solely on a religious  method of healing. Receiving medical health services, as we  traditionally think of them, is inconsistent with the religious belief  of Christian Scientists.   This bill says that for people who choose not to use traditional  healthcare or services, they are fully exempted from the Affordable  Care Act's requirement to buy insurance. For Christian Scientists, if  they bought the insurance plan, they wouldn't use it anyway. If you  don't believe in something, why should the government force you to  participate.   In healthcare, so many of our choices have been restricted because of  the Affordable Care Act's domino effect across the entire healthcare  sector. The EACH Act takes a step in the right direction by restoring  freedom for people who had to face a dire decision of either violating  their conscience by purchasing ObamaCare or violating the law. This is  an unfair position that the law should not put them in, and I hope we  can finally resolve this by passing the EACH Act today.   We must come together to help those who have been hurt by this  intrusion into their lives. This bill has widespread bipartisan  support. In fact, the House passed a similar bill last Congress by  voice vote. Once more, passing the EACH Act will reduce the deficit by  $31 million.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the good news for my friend from California  is that tomorrow he will have an opportunity to vote on bills that will  lower the costs of healthcare with the health savings account agenda  that is forthcoming.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Smith), a longstanding advocate on behalf of Christian  Scientists, who has tried to bring rescue to them.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We hold conscience in this House tenderly. Our Founders were wise. In  the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights, the first freedom that they  articulated was our freedom to worship. What you are hearing today is a  bipartisan consensus that we value that, and we recognize the power of  conscience, the power of religious liberty, the power of being able to  worship as one pleases. That is something that Mr. Davis from Illinois  is advocating today, Mr. Thompson is supporting as well, along with the  longstanding work of Mr. Smith from Texas.   Passing this bill will give those who object to health insurance on  religious grounds the ability to opt out of the system that they don't  want to participate in, in its entirety. They won't have to face a  choice between violating their belief and violating the law anymore. I  urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1476) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit  individuals eligible for Indian Health Service assistance to qualify  for health savings accounts, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1476         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Health       Savings Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE                     ASSISTANCE NOT DISQUALIFIED FROM HEALTH SAVINGS                     ACCOUNTS.         (a) In General.--Section 223(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue       Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following       new subparagraph:        ``(D) Special rule for individuals eligible for assistance       under indian health service programs.--For purposes of       subparagraph (A)(ii), an individual shall not be treated as       covered under a health plan described in such subparagraph       merely because the individual receives hospital care or       medical services under a medical care program of the Indian       Health Service or of a tribal organization.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section       shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31,       2018.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1476, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to stand before you today as we consider H.R.  1476, the Native American Health Savings Improvement Act, a bipartisan  bill introduced by Mr. Moolenaar of Michigan, that makes commonsense  improvements to current rules surrounding health savings accounts and  those who get care through the Indian Health Service.   Generally, anyone covered solely by a high-deductible health plan  that meets certain requirements is allowed to make tax-free  contributions to a health savings account. But for certain individuals  who receive care through the Indian Health Service, this isn't the  case.   Under IRS guidance, an individual who has received medical services  at an Indian Health Service facility at any time during the previous 3  months is ineligible to make contributions to an HSA. This practice  could discourage those who rely on care delivered at an Indian Health  Service facility from participating in an HSA. This should be fixed so  that these enrollees can avail themselves to the benefits of Health  Savings Accounts.   High-deductible health plans and health savings accounts are critical  components of consumer-driven healthcare. Together, they empower  individuals and families to shop around. They unleash the power of  choice and competition that are so badly needed in healthcare to lower  costs and improve quality today. These are the elements we need to  encourage in the system, if we are going to start bending the cost  curve in the right direction, and if we want to lower barriers to these  types of accounts and encourage individuals who are otherwise eligible  not to forgo treatment at an Indian Health Service facility simply  because of confusion over when they might be able to resume  contributing to their HSA.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar).    Mr. Speaker, about 22 million Americans are covered by  high-deductible health plans with an HSA. These are options that are  increasingly popular across the spectrum because they lower premiums  and they are a vehicle to save for other healthcare expenses.   I think this is a good bill. It has been well articulated this  afternoon, particularly by the bill's sponsor and by Mr. Thompson, and  I urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 519) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  facilitate water leasing and water transfers to promote conservation  and efficiency, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 519         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Water and Agriculture Tax       Reform Act of 2018''.  [[Page H7111]]            SEC. 2. FACILITATE WATER LEASING AND WATER TRANSFERS TO                     PROMOTE CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY.         (a) In General.--Paragraph (12) of section 501(c) of the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end       the following new subparagraph:        ``(J) Treatment of mutual ditch irrigation companies.--        ``(i) In general.--In the case of a mutual ditch or       irrigation company or of a like organization to a mutual       ditch or irrigation company, subparagraph (A) shall be       applied without taking into account--         ``(I) any income received or accrued from the sale, lease,       or exchange of fee or other interests in real and personal       property, including interests in water (other than income       derived from the sale, lease, or transfer of water to       nonmembers outside the river basin or basins within which the       mutual ditch or irrigation company operates),        ``(II) any income received or accrued from the sale or       exchange of stock in a mutual ditch or irrigation company (or       in a like organization to a mutual ditch or irrigation       company) or contract rights for the delivery or use of water,       or        ``(III) any income received or accrued from the investment       of income described in subclause (I) or (II),       except that any income described in subclause (I), (II), or       (III) which is distributed or expended for expenses (other       than for operations, maintenance, and capital improvements)       of the mutual ditch or irrigation company or of the like       organization to a mutual ditch or irrigation company (as the       case may be) shall be treated as nonmember income in the year       in which it is distributed or expended. For purposes of the       preceding sentence, expenses (other than for operations,       maintenance, and capital improvements) include expenses for       the construction of conveyances designed to deliver water       outside of the system of the mutual ditch or irrigation       company or of the like organization.        ``(ii) Treatment of organizational governance.--In the case       of a mutual ditch or irrigation company or of a like       organization to a mutual ditch or irrigation company, where       State law provides that such a company or organization may be       organized in a manner that permits voting on a basis which is       pro rata to share ownership on corporate governance matters,       subparagraph (A) shall be applied without taking into account       whether its member shareholders have one vote on corporate       governance matters per share held in the corporation. Nothing       in this clause shall be construed to create any inference       about the requirements of this subsection for companies or       organizations not included in this clause.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31,       2018.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 519, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), and I ask unanimous consent  that he be allowed to control that time.
