 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  Oklahoma's efforts to bolster its economy and get its citizens back to  work.   There is no doubt the pandemic caused not only illness, but major  interruption in our daily lives. Millions became jobless through no  fault of their own and had to rely on additional Federal unemployment  assistance to survive.   But today the situation has changed, Mr. Speaker. We have a  rebounding economy and over 158 million Americans have received at  least one vaccine dose. With more than 8 million job openings  nationwide, the time has come to encourage Americans to get back to  work.   The continued expansion of Federal assistance is hampering this  promising economic recovery across the country and in my home State of  Oklahoma.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say Oklahoma is leading the country's  economic recovery by providing $1,200 signing bonuses beginning in  June, for individuals who go back to work and stay employed for six  continuous weeks. There are over 68,000 job postings in Oklahoma  currently, with 7,500 in Oklahoma City alone. These are good-paying  jobs across a variety of industries, including the energy and  manufacturing sectors. Hundreds of employers are offering competitive  wages and generous benefits.                            ____________________
