 Madam President, when I conclude my comments, I am going  to ask consent that I can allow Senator Van Hollen to speak, and then I  will speak after him for the purposes of a unanimous consent request.   There is no such thing as a good shutdown. I certainly was encouraged  [[Page S8010]]  to hear the progress we made about half an hour ago, when the majority  leader and the Democratic leader talked about discussions that are  taking place. We hope that later this evening we will have an agreement  that can pass the Senate and the House and be signed by the President.   I want to make this clear. Any government shutdown is unacceptable.  It costs the taxpayers money. It inconveniences the public, and it is  certainly not fair to our Federal workforce. This particular shutdown  would affect 800,000 of our employees, our Federal workforce. About  half would be asked to work but would not get a paycheck, and about  half would be furloughed without compensation.   I am very proud and Senator Van Hollen is very proud of the Federal  workforce that live in the State of Maryland, but my colleagues should  recognize that 85 percent of the Federal employees live and work  outside of the Washington, DC, area. This affects each one of our  States and people who are working in each one of our States.   I also wish to point out that over 30 percent of the Federal  workforce are veterans who have already served our country in uniform  and are now serving their country as public servants in the Federal  workforce.   Let me tell you what they are in for and the reason why we are going  to be asking a unanimous consent request. Without legislation being  enacted, the individuals who are going to be required to work will have  to work without getting paid, and then when government restarts, they  can get a paycheck for the work they have done. Those who are on  furlough would never receive any funds, even though it was not their  fault or responsibility that they couldn't work. Those who have leave  time would lose that leave time as a result of the government shutdown.   The legislation for which we are going to ask consent in a few  minutes would make it clear to these Federal workers that as soon as we  can after a shutdown--again, I hope there is not a shutdown, but if we  have a shutdown, as soon as the shutdown ends--the next available time,  our Federal workforce would receive their compensation. So they know  that at least they are going to get their salary when the government  reopens and that anxiety can be removed, because right now they don't  know if they are going to be able to get their compensation when the  government shutdown ends. They recognize that we will do the fair way  with their leave time so they don't lose their leave time.   When we have opened government in the past, when we have had  shutdowns, as part of the reopening process, we have included this type  of legislation. We don't know how long the shutdown would be, if we  have a shutdown, which I hope we don't have, but it would be in all of  our interests to tell our Federal workforce that we hope there is no  shutdown, but if there is, they will be paid at the first available  time when the government reopens. That is the purpose of this  legislation. I am pleased we have been able to clear it on both sides.  I wish to first yield through the Chair to my colleague from Maryland.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 290, S. 2274.    Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that the  bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor to Mr. Van Hollen.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I was honored to attend the ceremonies  in the Capitol Rotunda and at Washington National Cathedral for former  President George H.W. Bush. I first met President Bush when he was Vice  President and I was the speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates. He  visited Annapolis, and I presented him with a Maryland tie. He  immediately took off his tie, which he gave to me, and put on the  Maryland tie, which he wore with pride. He had a keen eye for detail,  for the little things. I had a book on a shelf in my office which was  still in the shrink-wrap packaging. He sent me a note--one of his  thousands of famous personal notes--gently ribbing me, writing, ``It's  good to see you are keeping up on your reading.''   I thing George H.W. Bush may have been the most qualified person ever  elected President, starting all the way back to his high school years  at Phillips Academy Andover, where he was president of the senior  class, secretary of the student council, a member of the editorial  board of the school newspaper, and captain of the varsity baseball and  soccer teams. He was one of the youngest aviators in the Navy at the  beginning of World War II and was barely 20 when his Grumman TBM  Avenger was hit by flak during an attack on Japanese installations on  Chichijima. He calmly delivered his payload, scoring several hits,  before flying as far away from the island as he could in a plane with  its engines on fire. He bailed out and ended up in an inflatable raft  for four hours before being rescued by the submarine USS Finback. He  flew 58 combat missions, for which he received the Distinguished Flying  Cross, three Air Medals, and the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to  the USS San Jacinto.   After his military service, he went to Yale University, graduating  with a bachelor of arts degree in economics in 2\1/2\ years. He was  president of his fraternity, captain of the Yale varsity baseball team,  and elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He could have stayed back east in  Connecticut, where his father Prescott would be elected to the U.S.  Senate in a special election in 1952, but George Bush moved to Texas  with his wife Barbara and their young son George W. Bush, where he  cofounded Zapata Petroleum Corporation. He was a successful businessman  when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1964, losing to the Democratic  incumbent, Ralph Yarborough. Two years later, however, he was elected  to the U.S. House of Representatives, and he won reelection in 1968.  The Seventh District was conservative, but George Bush voted for the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the Fair Housing Act, and he supported  birth control and a women's right to choose.   In 1970, then-President Richard Nixon prevailed on George Bush to run  for the U.S. Senate again. He did, but he lost again, this time to  Lloyd Bentsen. President Nixon nominated him to serve as U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations, and the Senate confirmed the  nomination unanimously. He served with distinction for 2 years. In  1973, he  [[Page S8013]]  became chairman of the Republican National Committee and survived  Watergate with his reputation and integrity intact. President Gerald  Ford appointed Bush to be chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in the  People's Republic of China. During the time he held this position, he  was instrumental in improving U.S.-China relations.   From January of 1976 to January of 1977, George Bush was Director of  Central Intelligence and incoming President Jimmy Carter considered  keeping Bush in the post. He left the Central Intelligence Agency and  became a part-time professor at Rice University's Jones School of  Business and a director at the prestigious Council on Foreign  Relations.   In 1980, George Bush ran for the Republican nomination for President,  ultimately yielding to Ronald Reagan, who then chose Bush as his  running mate. George Bush served as Vice President for 8 years and  then, in 1988, became the first incumbent Vice President to be elected  President in 152 years.   George Bush brought all of these qualifications and experiences to  the Oval Office. Now, he only served one term; he was defeated in his  bid for reelection in 1992. But many commentators have noted that he  may be the most successful one-term President in U.S. history. Indeed,  his accomplishments in 4 years compare favorably with the  accomplishments of many two-term Presidents. I think the key here is  that he knew how to reach across the aisle and forge bipartisan  compromises. I would like to highlight four.   The first is the Acid Rain Program that was included in the Clean Air  Act Amendments of 1990. The Acid Rain Program established a cap-and- trade regime to cut sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions. Cap- and-trade was originally a Republican idea to harness market forces for  environmental protection. Environmental groups and Democrats were wary,  initially, of the authorizations to emit SO2 and  NOX, known as allowances. They worried that a ``property  right'' in polluting was being established, but the program exceeded  everyone's expectation and is one of the most successful environmental  programs in history. When George W. Bush was President, the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, determined that the program has  had a benefit-to-cost ratio of 40-1. Our technical knowledge of the  best ways to structure cap-and-trade programs has grown exponentially  since 1990; sadly, the political will has atrophied. Even though  Republicans were the first to promote cap-and-trade, they have  essentially abandoned the idea now, but President Bush saw the  potential, and the enormous progress we have made in combatting acid  rain is part of his environmental legacy that will endure.   The second accomplishment is the Americans with Disabilities Act,  ADA, which our retiring colleague, Senator Hatch, championed with then- Senator Tom Harken from Iowa. President Bush signed ADA into law in  1990, and it became known as the Emancipation Proclamation for people  with disabilities. ADA literally changed the landscape of America by  requiring buildings and transportation to be wheelchair accessible, and  it required workplace accommodations for people with disabilities.  Nearly 30 years after President Bush signed ADA into law, the  improvements the ADA has made enjoy an 83 percent approval rating from  the American public. Making life, education, and work more accessible  to people with disabilities isn't just good for them; it is good for  all of us as we benefit from the fuller contributions they are now able  to make to society.   The third accomplishment, I am sure, was difficult for President  Bush, and it cost him Republican support in his bid to win reelection  in 1992: the 1990 budget deal he negotiated with Congress. At the 1988  Republican National Convention, he famously said, ``Read my lips: no  new taxes.'' While he was a Texan by choice, he never lost the  pragmatism characteristic of New Englanders. As a recession began to  fuel a rise in budget deficits, he realized that he needed to work with  a Congress controlled by Democrats and come up with a budget deal,  stating ``it is clear to me that both the size of the deficit problem  and the need for a package that can be enacted require all of the  following: entitlement and mandatory program reform, tax revenue  increases, growth incentives, discretionary spending reductions,  orderly reductions in defense expenditures, and budget process  reform.'' He understood that such a comprehensive framework is the only  way to reduce the deficit. Unfortunately, the Trump administration and  congressional Republicans still cling to the discredited notion of  ``supply-side'' economics, which President Bush famously called  ``voodoo economics,'' and our budget situation has become more and more  precarious. I doubt President Trump is capable of displaying President  Bush's pragmatism, deal-making ability, and willingness to sacrifice  personal popularity for the greater good.   His fourth accomplishment fell within his ``wheelhouse": foreign  policy and personal diplomacy. He prudently, successfully navigated the  fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Saddam  Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. He showed remarkable but characteristic  restraint when the Berlin Wall came down, and many historians credit  that restraint with preventing a backlash from hardliners in Eastern  Europe. Likewise, the relationship he carefully cultivated with Soviet  Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, including negotiating the Strategic Arms  Reduction Treaty, START, helped end the Cold War not with a bang, but  with a whimper.   Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Hussein invaded  Kuwait in 1990, President Bush carefully assembled a coalition that  consisted of our traditional allies but also the Soviet Union and, even  more crucially, other Arab nations to drive him out. He went to  Congress and received authorization for the use of military force when  it became clear that international diplomacy would not succeed in  dislodging Hussein. ``Operation Desert Storm'' was well-planned and  well-executed and succeeded in liberating Kuwait in less than 2 months.  While many people have argued that President Bush should have extended  the war to remove Hussein from power, he made it clear from the start  that was never his objective. He presciently argued that pursuing  Hussein into Iraq would destabilize the region and lead to a lengthy  military conflict. President Bush optimistically spoke of a ``New World  Order'' characterized by an era of historic cooperation between  nations. He helped to bring such order into existence. It seemed  durable at the time. Now, we realize that it needs more careful  attention and nurturing than we, perhaps, previously thought necessary.   All of these accomplishments and more cemented George H.W. Bush's  legacy. They alone would be impressive, but what became clear in the  outpouring of respect and affection that followed his death is the  acknowledgment of what a genuinely decent person he was. He was a  humble and self-deprecating man. He respected our important  institutions, and he respected people, including his opponents. He was  deeply religious. He embraced the principle of noblesse oblige: to whom  much is given, much more shall be required in return. As a result, he  lived his life as a servant. He was committed to his country and to his  beloved wife Barbara and his family, and to his friends. It seems he  had an inexhaustible desire and capacity for making new friends from  all walks of life, including former political adversaries such as the  man who defeated him in the 1992 election, Bill Clinton. When President  Bush spoke of his desire to see a ``kinder, gentler America,''--one  illumined by a thousand points of light, he was sincere.   Since President Bush has died, many commentators have said that he  represented a bygone era. I certainly hope not. If we are to continue  succeeding as a nation, his fundamental decency, pragmatism, kindness,  bravery, self-sacrifice, persistence, and optimism shine a bright light  on the path we should strive to follow. If we wish to honor President  Bush, we should reflect on his character and temperament and other  sterling qualities and seek to emulate them. He was a great man.  Perhaps even more important, he was a good man.                            ____________________
