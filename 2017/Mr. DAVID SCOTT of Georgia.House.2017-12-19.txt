 Mr. Speaker, as the Democratic lead on  this bill, it is very important for me to point out that I worked very  closely with Chairman Barney Frank and the Obama administration, both  of which admitted at the time that it was a mistake, a blunt  instrument, to be able to just put an arbitrary figure of $50 billion  and say they are a threat to our financial stability.   No. Our banking system deserves better than that. The American people  deserve better than that. It is not the amount of money that you have  got in your assets that caused the problem; it was what they were doing  that caused the exposure.   So we want to substitute the $50 billion to make sure that we have a  five-point test that the Feds will give that will be able to determine  if they are a threat to our security and then tailor a program of  advanced supervision that would prevent them from causing us this  problem.   It is a great bill. It is time we corrected it, and I ask all of my  colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to do the right thing for  the American people, and let's have a resounding ``yes'' vote for this  SIFI bill.
