 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr.  Peter Jensen, an AARP 2024 Purpose Prize honoree. This national honor  recognizes individuals who are using their life experience to make a  positive difference.   Seeing a problem with mental health care access for children, Dr.  Jensen founded the REACH Institute in 2006. This nonprofit organization  ensures effective and scientifically proven care reaches children and  their families. REACH trains primary care providers, therapists, and  other health professionals to diagnose and treat young patients.   As a result of this innovative way to connect providers and patients,  more than 6,000 pediatricians and physicians in all 50 States have been  trained to be ``first responders'' to children with mental health  needs.   Dr. Jensen's health challenges as a child shaped an interest in  psychology and inspired him to pursue a career in medicine. He earned a  medical degree from George Washington University School of Medicine and  has served in leading research and education roles including for Child  and Adolescent Research at the National Institute of Mental Health, the  Mayo Clinic, and a professor at Columbia University and the University  of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.   Arkansas is fortunate to have an exceptional, selfless leader like  Dr. Jensen who identified a problem and implemented a solution to  improve patient care and outcomes. His passion and commitment offer an  excellent example for others to follow.   I applaud AARP for recognizing Dr. Jensen's work to build a better  future. Dr. Jensen demonstrates what it truly means to go above and  beyond for others. I congratulate him on this well-deserved honor and  his positive impact. His remarkable achievements offer a model of  success that will help patients for generations to come.                            ____________________
