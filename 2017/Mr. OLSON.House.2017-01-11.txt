 Mr. Speaker, Texans know the difference between right and  wrong, between truth and lie.   The Democrats promised four things when they passed ObamaCare: number  one, you can keep your insurance; number two, you can keep your doctor;  number three, you have a better quality of care; and number four, that  care will come at a lower cost. Within weeks, we found out that all  four promises were being broken; all four were lies.   But don't take my word for it. Take the word of the constituent from  Texas 22, my boss Andrea Kulberg. Andrea writes:         I am a 42-year-old, legally blind, single parent in Sugar       Land, self-employed, working very hard to rear two great       kids, ages 15 and 13.        I have a master's degree in education and work extremely       hard to provide a stable, comfortable life for my kids. In       doing so, I have invested time and dollars into my own health       care because the kids need me to be healthy.        I lost my right eye a few years ago to complications from       ROP, too much oxygen at birth, and my left eye is severely       impaired with potential for complications that would need       immediate specialized care. I have different specialist       doctors for different issues related to each eye.        Additionally, I am a cancer survivor, renal cancer, RCC,       which also requires specialist follow-up. For these reasons       and others, I have spent time and efforts to get drivers to       take me to specialists for these specific positions.        Over the years, I have paid high healthcare premiums for       this, usually around $500 per month--that is crazy in       itself--for a PPO to allow me freedom to keep my existing       doctor. I paid these fees and sacrificed other luxuries in       life so I could get the care I needed with the doctors I       wanted. They are the best doctors in their respective fields,       and my trust in them is important with this type of care.        I don't have the PPO option now for my health care in 2016       through the ACA. The HMOs and EPOs being offered are not       being accepted by my doctors.        I am certain you have heard this as well, but I am writing       to you anyway because it has to be said that among these       needs of many others in similar situations as my own, my       remaining eyesight and renal function should never be less       important than anything in politics. And while I know that       there were many, many people in this same boat, for today,       while I write this letter, it is about my kids getting to       keep their mom and about me keeping the ability to see them       grow up.        I know PPOs won't suddenly appear on healthcare.gov because       I sent this email. I know this can't be immediately fixed.       But I write because it needs to be said; it needs to be       heard; it needs to be acted on.        I don't know the right actions that need to happen. I will       leave that to your area of expertise. But I know the way it       is now doesn't work.        In the past, I paid a lot and had my share of insurance       issues, but at least I could still choose my own doctor. At       least in a crisis, which I have had, I went straight to the       doctor who knew me and my history and could resolve it       without a referral and delay after delay.        HMOs might work for some, but not for those who don't want       one. Letters to a Congressman are supposed to be more formal,       but seriously, what country are we in?        I am not asking for a handout. I am asking for a reasonable       choice of a basic PPO, which I have paid for in the past and       am asking to have the option to pay for now.        I am not just writing to vent. I am asking for some sort of       solution through this train wreck of healthcare options or       lack thereof.        If President Obama thinks this is actually working, then he       is more blind than me. And that is as nice as I can be now.        Thanks for hearing me out and for looking for solutions       that impact real lives.        Respectfully, Andrea Kulberg.    Mr. Speaker, I don't care if you are a Democrat or Republican. Hear  Andrea's words--act. Let's rescue Andrea from ObamaCare and restore the  promises of quality of care, high quality of care, lower price, doctor  of choice.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, my friend knows the American people spoke on  November 8th. They gave our party control of the entire Congress and  the White House because of the job-killing, promise-breaking law known  as ObamaCare.    This was a repeal mission for almost 7 years, but now it has become a  rescue mission. It is to rescue Americans like Andrea from my home in  Texas in the 22nd Congressional District.   She wrote me this letter last week:   ``I'm a 42 year-old legally blind single parent in Sugar Land, self- employed working very hard to rear two great kids ages 15 and 13. I  have a master's degree in education and work extremely hard to provide  a stable, comfortable life for the kids. In doing so, I have invested  time and money into my own healthcare because the kids need me to be  healthy.   ``I lost my right eye a few years ago to complications from ROP (too  much oxygen at birth) and my left eye is severely impaired with  potential for complications that would need immediate specialized care.   ``I have different specialist doctors for different issues related to  each eye. Additionally, I am a kidney cancer survivor (RCC) which also  requires specialist follow-up. For those reasons, and others, I've  spent time and effort getting drivers to take me to specialists to  develop rapport, trust, and history with specific physicians.   ``They are the best doctors in their respected fields, and my trust  in them is important with this type of care.   ``I don't have the PPO option now for my healthcare in 2016 through  the ACA.

Andrea, we have a plan to help you up. It is called A Better Way. How  about this: Allow coverage across state lines, expand opportunities for  pooling, make coverage portable, Medicare laws reformed, and  preexisting condition protections.   That is a better way. That is what the American people deserve. We  will keep fighting for Andrea and people like her.
