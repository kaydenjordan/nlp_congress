 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Hawaii  for making these very important remarks today with respect to expanding  access to family planning.   And, Senator Hirono, let me also, while you are on the floor, tell  you how much I appreciate your leadership on the My Body, My Data Act.  I am thrilled to be, I believe, one of your sponsors here in the  Senate. It is hugely consequential, because we have known from even the  draft Alito opinion that women were going to have their personal data  weaponized against them.   I know you have a busy schedule, but I just wanted the body to know  how extraordinarily important this is, because when we look at  technology and, particularly, what technology can do today, what your  legislation does--with our colleague from the House, Congresswoman  Jacobs--is it gives us a chance to get back to the fundamental issue of  privacy rights. We are going to start looking more at the contractual  relationships between women and various companies because a lot of  those privacy policies aren't worth the paper they are written on.   I just want you to know I am so honored to be your cosponsor on a  very related piece of legislation. Your leadership has made a big  difference.    I just say to my colleague, sometimes it is a little  difficult to figure out where a piece of legislation is going. That is  not the case with your bill. My Body, My Data sums it up.   Again, thank you so much for your leadership.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 4550    Mr. President, I also want to briefly touch on the important  legislation that Senator Smith--my Pacific Northwest colleague--Senator  Murray, and Senator Warner have recently introduced. They have an  important proposal called the Expanding Access to Family Planning Act.  I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. This is another area where  Chair Murray and I work very closely together because a lot of these  issues can often involve Medicaid, for example. And I just so  appreciate my colleague bringing up her important bill with respect to  family planning.   The proposition behind this is pretty straightforward. The Supreme  Court overturned Roe against the will of the American people. States  are criminalizing abortion. Many women and girls are now being forced  to carry pregnancies to term and give birth. If they are going to stand  by this forced-birth agenda, then you better guarantee basic health for  women and families. That is really Senator Murray's challenge to Senate  Republicans. You can't be pro-life and pro-family if you are against  healthcare that saves lives and protects families.   The Murray legislation, with Senator Smith and Senator Warren--I am  pleased to be for it today--is centered on a significant increase in  what is known as title X funding, which goes to basic essential  services like HIV tests, contraception, treatment for infections, and  pregnancy counseling.   And one of those services is really so vitally important. I just want  to mention it, and that is cancer screenings. Cancer screenings are a  particularly important issue now that the Supreme Court has overturned  Roe. Over the last few weeks there have been a wave of these horrendous  stories, as Senator Murray knows better than anyone, about the chaos  this radical Supreme Court ruling has unleashed on women's healthcare-- drawn-out miscarriages, potentially fatal complications left untreated,  physicians unsure of what treatments they are legally allowed to  perform.   And we know one of the absolute nightmares for women living in  forced-birth States is getting pregnant and having cancer at exactly  the same time. And the question is: In a world where a miscarriage  could lead to criminal charges, how do you treat a pregnant woman with  cancer?   So we ought to think about that. And could getting chemo be a crime  in a forced-birth State, Senator Murray? In forced-birth States, how  many Americans are going to die because they waited too long to begin  treatment for breast cancer or cervical cancer or because they didn't  maybe get treated at all?   It is appalling that Americans are facing this kind of awful, I  think, unthinkable situation, all because six Republicans on the  Supreme Court threw 50 years of settled law on abortion rights into the  dustbin.   In the parlance of the Senate, Senator Murray, I yield to you. I  think your legislation is extraordinarily important.   Uh-oh. I have to reverse some parlance of the Senate and yield to  Senator Klobuchar, who also has been a champion of this issue. And I  just want the Senate to know, because we are in the Pacific Northwest,  we talk about these issues. People ought to make no mistake about it-- Senator Murray has put years and years into the cause of women's  health. And I really enjoy being junior partner in the whole effort and  look forward to her leadership.   And I yield to Senator Klobuchar.
