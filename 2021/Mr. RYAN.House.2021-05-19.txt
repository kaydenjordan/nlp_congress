 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York  and the other Republicans who are supporting this for their  bipartisanship.   To the other 90 percent of our friends on the other side of the  aisle, holy cow. Incoherence. No idea what you are talking about.   Benghazi, you guys chased the former Secretary of State all over the  country, spent millions of dollars. We have people scaling the Capitol,  hitting the Capitol Police with lead pipes across the head, and we  can't get bipartisanship.   What else has to happen in this country?   This is a slap in the face to every rank-and-file cop in the United  States.   If we are going to take on China, if we are going to rebuild the  country, if we are going to reverse climate change, we need two  political parties in this country that are both living in reality, and  you ain't one of them.
