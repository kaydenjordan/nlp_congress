 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, a proud descendant  of the enslaved people who made cotton king and America great; the  enslaved people who had a hand in the construction of this Capitol, who  had a hand in the construction of the White House; the enslaved people  who constructed roads and bridges across the length and breadth of this  country, who worked for more than 200 years without a payday. They made  the difference for what we call the United States of America on the  global scene at the time.   I am honored to be a descendant, and I am honored to say also that  this House, on July 27, took the historic step of according them  Slavery Remembrance Day, a day to remember their lives and commemorate  their accomplishments.   It is important that we do this because, for too long, we have  reviled the slaves and revered the enslavers. For too long, we have  placed them in such a position as to cause the people who are the very  descendants to be ashamed of who they were associated with, with  reference to their heritage.   I am proud that this House has taken this important historic step  with Slavery Remembrance Day, but I am also proud to say that at 2  o'clock tomorrow in Room 145A at the Washington Convention Center, we  will continue to talk about this piece of legislation that we passed,  H. Res. 517, the Original Slavery Remembrance Day Resolution.   We will talk about this. We will give a legislative update. The  Reverend Al Sharpton will be there, and he will give insightful  information on this very topic.   I am just proud that we no longer fear having those persons who made  this country great recognized by this Congress, and that had been the  case in the past.   I thank all the Members of the Congress, 218 of whom who voted for  this legislation. I thank the President, who recognized Slavery  Remembrance Day. I thank all of the leadership for allowing this  resolution to come to the floor.   I thank Ms. Elizabeth Warren, the Senator who supported it, and I  thank Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Hoyer was a man of his word, a person of his word.  He said this resolution would come to the floor for a vote. He  supported it, and it came to the floor for a vote.   I thank you for the courage that you showed, Mr. Hoyer, and the  judicious insight that you utilized to make sure that we had this  opportunity.   Tomorrow, we continue what I cannot finish today at the convention  center, 2 o'clock, Room 145A.                            ____________________
