 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Washington and the sheriff.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the men and women who  have paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect our communities.   In 2016, two brave Arizona officers died as they responded to calls:  David Van Glasser, Phoenix Police Department; and Darrin Reed, Show Low  Police Department, which is in my district. Both of those men left  behind family and loved ones.   As a former police officer and homicide investigator, National Police  Week has a special meaning to me. I have lost friends, partners,  brothers, and sisters in the line of duty. I have grieved with their  families during the most difficult times, and I have experienced  firsthand the real sacrifices they make.   Each of the 135 officers from across the country who died in the line  of duty in 2016 worked to keep our neighborhoods safe. While we can  never repay the debts we owe them and their families, we will forever  remember their service.   As we look to the future, it is important to highlight the work being  done in cities and towns across the country to not only better protect  our families, but also the lives of our law enforcement officers. In  Arizona, successful community policing programs in Flagstaff, Phoenix,  and countless other cities and towns have improved relationships.   I am proud to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle on the  House Law Enforcement Caucus. I look  [[Page H4303]]  forward to continuing the bipartisan work we are doing to identify and  solve the challenges facing our law enforcement community.
