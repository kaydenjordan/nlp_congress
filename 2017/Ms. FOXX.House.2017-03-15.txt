 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Theresa Bryant, who  is West Forsyth High School's 2016-2017 Teacher of the Year.   This first-generation college graduate, Kiwanis member, and Key Club  adviser has worked at West Forsyth in Clemmons since 2000, where she  teaches sophomore English and Shakespeare as an elective.   Theresa's proudest moment in the field of education is her role in  the creation of the Shakespeare elective class. After an educational  opportunity at the Globe Theatre in London, she worked with a colleague  to create an intensive curriculum covering eight plays. The class has  brought the words of the Bard to more than 4,000 students at West  Forsyth, as well as four other schools in the district.   Theresa is known for her dedication to her students and making her  lessons relevant to their different learning styles so everyone can  understand the material.   We are lucky to have a teacher of her caliber serving students in  North Carolina's Fifth District.                            ____________________
