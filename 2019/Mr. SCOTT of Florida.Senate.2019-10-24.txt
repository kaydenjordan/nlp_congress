 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the  crisis in Venezuela, a defining human rights issue of our time. Nicolas  Maduro is starving his own people, and innocent children are dying.  What is happening in Venezuela is pure genocide. With every day that  passes, the situation in Venezuela grows more dire.   I will not stand by and let Maduro continue terrorizing his people. I  will not let Democrats in Congress use the Venezuelan people as a  political prop. I will not allow the inaction to continue.   Americans have always stood up for freedom, and today is no  exception. That is why I am here again to ask unanimous consent to pass  my amendment to H.R. 549, granting temporary protective status for  Venezuelans fleeing Nicolas Maduro's oppressive regime. Even though  Senate Democrats blocked the same proposal last month, I refuse to give  up. I stand with the proud Venezuelans.   My proposal has the support of all Senate Republicans. I believe that  the President will sign this into law. It is the only solution that  stands a chance of becoming law. We have to act.   We also need to be responsible. The courts have, basically, made a  temporary program permanent, which is not sustainable. Despite what  some confused Democrats, including Speaker Pelosi may say, the ``T'' in  TPS actually does mean ``temporary.''   In addition to protecting Venezuelan people right now, my amendment  makes much needed reforms to our TPS program and returns the program to  its intended purpose. We want those seeking refuge from war and  oppressive regimes to have a safe haven in our country, but we need a  system that works and is truly temporary. We need to act now to save  the Venezuelan people.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate in  Spanish.    (English translation of the statement made in  Spanish is as follows:)   We need TPS now.   I stand with the people of Venezuela, and I will continue to fight  for freedom and democracy in Latin America.   It is time for Maduro and his thugs to leave power.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 549. I  ask unanimous consent that my amendment at the desk be agreed to, that  the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to  object, I appreciate the opportunity to work with my colleague from  Maryland, and I look forward to working with him again in the future.  It would be great if we could work together to try to figure out how to  provide temporary protected status for Venezuelans and also to fix the  program so it continues to work not just for Venezuelans but for people  all over the world.   The Democrats know their proposal cannot become law. It lacks support  in the Senate, which is why I proposed an amendment that has support  and that can actually become law immediately.   My amendment grants TPS to Venezuelans for 18 months. It requires  congressional approval for TPS extensions of no more than 18 months at  a time. My amendment limits the ability of illegal aliens who have no  connection to the TPS designation to benefit from TPS. It ensures that  human rights violators who are identified under the Magnitsky Act are  not eligible for TPS status. It includes provisions to distinguish that  TPS status does not count as an admission for purposes of the  Immigration and Nationality Act. Under my amendment, TPS recipients  cannot return to the TPS country during the period of designation.  Finally, the amendment requires that current TPS designations come up  for congressional review 2 years after the enactment of this amendment.   My amendment is the only way to help the Venezuelan people. It is the  only proposal that can become law. There is no path forward for the  Democrats' plan, and, unfortunately, they know it.   It is clear, now more than ever, that, unfortunately, the Democrats  don't want to get anything done on this issue. That is why they are  standing in our way. All Republican Senators have signed off on this.  Unfortunately, the Democrats have decided to use the Venezuelan  community as a political prop instead of working with us to find a  solution.   We cannot lose sight of the fact that Nicolas Maduro is killing his  citizens. It is a genocide. Who will we be if we turn our backs on a  genocide right here in our hemisphere? We cannot. We must help  Venezuelan families.   It is also time to reform TPS in this country. Temporary protected  status was never meant to be endless. It was meant to help families in  need. So let's get the program to work.   I look forward to working with my colleague from Maryland and with  all of my colleagues to help the families in Venezuela and to finally  create a long-term solution to TPS. I will not rest until we do.   My colleague Senator Rand Paul asked that I object to the Senate  Democrats' proposal. On behalf of Senator Paul, I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 197, S.  2065.

I know of no further debate on the resolutions.    I ask unanimous consent that the preambles be  agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m.,  Monday, October 28; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3055 under the  previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business  to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand  adjourned under the previous order.
