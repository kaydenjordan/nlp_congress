 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be on the floor tonight with  my colleagues on the Republican and Democrat side as we pay tribute and  honor to the great State of Illinois on the anniversary of our  bicentennial.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight with my colleagues in  recognition of our home, the great State of Illinois. It has been the  highest honor of my life to serve our State as a Member of Congress,  and I am sure it is for the other speakers that we will have here  tonight.   2018 represents something special for us and for every Illinoisan. It  is our 200th anniversary of statehood. It was December 3, 1818, that  Illinois was admitted into the United States. Today I wish to recognize  and honor all that Illinois has offered our great Nation.   Illinois' path to statehood began in the 17th century, with Europeans  first settling the territory that had been home to many Native American  Indian Tribes. The territory would exchange hands several times over  the following century, eventually ending up as part of the Northwest  Territory after the Revolutionary War. Only a few short years later,  Congress would finally agree on its borders and name Illinois the 21st  State in the Union.   At that time, I am sure few expected that the largely unsettled area  of land would go on to house the third largest city in our country with  over 2.7 million residents, or produce agriculture goods that would  feed people all over the globe. That these things came to pass is a  testament to the hard work and determination of the people of Illinois.   That is why the theme for this year's bicentennial celebration is  ``Born, Built, and Grown''--again, ``Born, Built, and Grown''--a chance  to highlight not just the many goods and services our State offers, but  also the many great Americans born and raised in Illinois, who have  gone on to shape the world we live in.    I am proud to represent Illinois' 18th Congressional District, a  district made up of 19 counties in central and west central Illinois,  including parts of Peoria; Bloomington-Normal; Springfield, our State  capital; Jacksonville; Quincy; Macomb; and all places in between. My  district borders Missouri and Iowa along the Mississippi River, on the  western part.   It is a district with no shortage of great accomplishments and  history. In fact, who knows where our entire Nation would be without  the leadership of one Abraham Lincoln, a lawyer from Springfield, who  represented nine of the counties in my current district. During his one  term in the United States House of Representatives, he served from 1847  to 1849. People forget that he was Congressman Abraham Lincoln before  he was President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln would spend most of his life  in Springfield, Illinois, as a lawyer; and also in Menard County,  working in the post office there. He would also take river boats down  the Sangamon River of the Illinois River, down to New Orleans.   Returning to Springfield to practice law in between his sole term in  the House and running for President in 1860, during his administration,  America would weather a bloody Civil War but come out having rooted out  the evil of slavery. While he would die in office, Lincoln's leadership  is why he continues to be named our greatest President. He earned the  nickname ``Honest Abe.'' Illinois would continue to play a role in the  abolishment of slavery when it became the first State to ratify the  13th Amendment in 1865. While he would die in office, Lincoln's  leadership is why he continues to be our greatest President today.   Over a century later, another man with ties to Illinois would be  sworn in as President: President Ronald Reagan from Illinois. He is the  only President who was born and raised in Illinois. President Reagan  would go on being the Governor of California--from the Governor of  California to the Presidency in 1981.   Born in Tampico, Illinois, Ronald Reagan spent his formative years  growing up in Illinois. His father was a traveling salesman. They lived  in Monmouth, in Galesburg, in Dixon, in Chicago for a short time, and  also in Tampico. Of course, Ronald Reagan got a scholarship to play  football at Eureka College in Woodford County, in my district. He was a  student there, played football, and graduated from there.   His time as President and Governor was defined by optimism and a  faith in the American spirit and a way of life, a faith that was  instilled during his formative years at Eureka and growing up in  Illinois. Like Lincoln, his leadership during tough times remains a  point of pride for not only Illinois, but for the entire Nation.   Outside of politics, our congressional district is home to other  famous Illinoisans who all called central Illinois home, including: the  venerable Archbishop Fulton Sheen of the Catholic faith, future Major  League Baseball Hall of Famer Jim Thome of Bartonville, two-time NBA  champion Shaun Livingston from Peoria, former Major League Baseball  manager and World Series champion Joe Girardi, and even the late  comedian Richard Pryor. Just imagine where America's sports and  entertainment industries would be without their talents.   Despite Chicago being our Nation's third largest city and serving as  a hub for many great industries, the largest sector of our economy  remains agriculture. Last year, Illinois was the sixth largest producer  of agriculture in the Nation, producing over $8 billion worth of  agriculture exports. Our district was no slouch, coming in as the  eighth largest congressional district in the country in terms of  agriculture production, proving once more that our State has some of  the most fertile farmland in the entire world. Illinois farmers  continue to grow soybeans, corn, and much more that keep America's  economy growing and plates all over the globe full.   My district also has the distinction that 96 percent of the pumpkins  produced in the world come from central Illinois, within a 100-mile  radius of Peoria, and we are proud of that. So the next time you have a  pumpkin latte or a pumpkin beer or pumpkin pie, it originated somewhere  in central Illinois.   Our State's ties to agriculture don't just end there, but they also  include several companies that are worldwide leaders in farming  equipment and Earth-moving products. Whether it is John Deere or  Caterpillar, just to name a few, they are known across the globe as  producers of the finest construction, farming, and Earth-moving  machines out there.   The Archer Daniels Midland Company, or ADM, is another Illinois  agriculture institution with strong ties to Illinois' 18th District.  Formerly headquartered in Decatur, the global agricultural giant is now  headquartered in Chicago, operating more than 270 plants and 420 crop  procurement facilities worldwide. This is where cereal grains and  oilseeds are produced.   So not only is Illinois leading the way in growing crops, but also in  turning them into products that show up in grocery stores across our  country and across the globe.   Finally, we cannot conclude without noting the presence of Forbes'  33rd ranked business in the country: State Farm Insurance in  Bloomington-Normal. The insurance giant has been providing insurance  coverage and financial services for 95 years and is headquartered in my  district in Bloomington, Illinois. Our ``local good neighbor,'' State  Farm, brings not only peace of mind to millions of Americans as they  buy or rent a home or an automobile, but they also assist in planning  for the future.   I couldn't be prouder to be here tonight with my colleagues. Those  are  [[Page H10170]]  some of the ways that Illinois' 18th District has contributed to the  State's story and how it will keep Illinois at the forefront of our  Nation and global economy.   Now I would like to recognize a number of my colleagues that are here  tonight. I yield to the gentleman from southern Illinois (Mr. Bost),  my colleague.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Bost for his comments here  tonight. I appreciate it very much.   Mr. Speaker, next I want to yield to and recognize the Congresswoman  from Matteson, Illinois, Robin Kelly, who we are so glad found her way  from New York to Bradley University as a student in Peoria, Illinois,  and has served our State well in the State legislature and throughout  government there. We are happy to have her here tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kelly very much for  those inspiring words about Illinois. I appreciate it very much.   Mr. Speaker, next I yield to Congressman Randy Hultgren from Plano.  Congressman Hultgren served in our Illinois State senate. He is a proud  Illinoisan, he serves our Nation very well. I yield to him now for a  few comments.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Hultgren for those  important words and comments about our great State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to and recognize Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, who  represents the 17th District of Illinois. We share Peoria, Illinois,  together in our district. Mrs. Bustos was born and raised in  Springfield, currently lives in the Quad Cities in East Moline. I yield  to the gentlewoman tonight for some comments.                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Bustos for her  valuable comments and advocacy for the State of Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to a colleague from Taylorville, Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis), somebody who serves a district just to the south of me.  We share Springfield together. He represents some of the best  institutions of higher learning in our State, and I am proud to share  many of the Lincoln sites with my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Davis for those  wonderful words regarding Illinois. I think we can agree there is  enough Lincoln history and heritage to go around to all of us. So I  thank the gentleman for his advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Deerfield, Illinois (Mr.  Schneider), who represents many of the northwest suburbs and part of  Cook County.                                time  2015     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Schneider for his very  complimentary words of his district and the State of Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, I next yield to the gentleman from the Illinois  delegation, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, one of our newest members  whose hometown is Schaumburg, Illinois, but his roots go downstate to  Peoria, Illinois. We are proud to have him as a Peorian. His parents  live in my district as constituents. He has hit the ground running here  in Congress and is proud of his Illinois roots both downstate and now  representing the suburbs of Chicago.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Krishnamoorthi for those  heartfelt words about Illinois. I appreciate those very, very much.   Mr. Speaker, next I yield to one of the deans of our delegation from  the city of Chicago, a strong advocate for our State and the city,  Congressman Danny Davis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Davis for those  wonderful words about the State of Illinois, its history, and the city  of Chicago and all his advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, as you can see, each of our districts has  played a role in not only shaping Illinois' history, but that of the  entire Nation and the whole world. Whether it is the business hub of  Chicago, the farmers downstate, or the many Main Street businesses in  every city, Illinois' influence can be seen every day no matter where  you are.   That is why our bicentennial theme of ``Born, Built, and Grown'' is  so appropriate. As 2018 begins and we continue to get closer to our  State's birthday on December 3, 2018, bicentennial events all across  Illinois will help us recognize the important people and products that  our State has to offer. For example, a bicentennial beer has already  been judged and selected, hailing from the Hand of Fate Brewing Company  in Petersburg, Illinois, within my congressional district.   I encourage everyone to check out the full list of events at  illinois200.com. I am sure I will be running into many of my colleagues  at several of them throughout the year as they happen across the State.   While Illinois' first 200 years have included both struggle and  success, our State should be a point of pride for all of us. I think we  heard that tonight. While we have accomplished so much, as my  colleagues and I have talked about here tonight, there remains much to  be done. Illinois remains on the path of prosperity, and the hard work  and determination that the people of Illinois are known for will surely  get us there.   Mr. Speaker, I will just close by wishing Illinois a happy early  birthday. We look forward to celebrating over the next year.   I am proud to be born and raised in the State of Illinois and that my  wife and I are raising our three boys in Illinois. We hope they stay  and prosper in Illinois, and we look forward to this next year of  celebration for 200 years of Illinois being in this great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
