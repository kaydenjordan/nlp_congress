 I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5.   Before I go into that, let me be clear. After listening to the leader  a minute ago, I thank all of the Federal employees who work so hard and  give so much and who are so often unseen, unnoticed, unappreciated, and  unapplauded.   I oppose this unnecessary and potentially dangerous legislation in  its entirety. However, I will focus my remarks on title V of this bill,  which is in the jurisdiction of the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee. Title V, also known as the ALERT Act, is an attack on agency  rulemaking, like the rest of this bill.   This title would prohibit the Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs from taking into account benefits when providing estimating  costs of proposed and final rules. That is not transparency. It is one  side of the story.   This bill would also prevent a rule from taking effect until certain  information is posted online for 6 months by the Administrator of the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The only exceptions to  this requirement would be if an agency exempts the rule from the notice  and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act or if the  President issues an executive order.   That is a 6-month delay in putting any rule in place no matter how  big or how small. Right now, there are rules pending to protect the  public from pipeline accidents involving hazardous liquids--those are  our constituents, by the way--and to protect the privacy of patients'  records. Again, those are our constituents. This bill would put an  arbitrary 6-month moratorium on rules like these.   The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, which is a coalition of over  150 labor, scientific, health and good government groups, sent a letter  on January 10, 2017, opposing H.R. 5 to all Members of the House of  Representatives.   That letter read in part:         The ALERT Act is designed to impede the government's       ability to implement critical new public health and safety       protections by adding a 6-month delay. This amounts to a 6-      month regulatory moratorium even after the often lengthy       period required for developing and finalizing these       regulations. Such delays could extend well beyond that       initial 6-month period should the OIRA Administrator fail to       post the required information in a timely manner.    The other titles of this bill are not any better and would impose so  many requirements on agencies that issuing regulations to protect  health and safety would be almost impossible.   I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 5.
