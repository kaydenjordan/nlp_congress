 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the  subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, today I rise to anchor the Congressional  Black Caucus' Special Order hour, and I thank our chairwoman,  Congresswoman Karen Bass, for her tremendous leadership in organizing  this effort.   Tonight, we are marking the 150th anniversary of the ratification of  the 15th Amendment, which prohibits the Federal Government and each  State from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's  race, color, or previous condition of servitude.   In the aftermath of the ratification of the 15th Amendment, well over  2,000 Black men were elected to local, State, and Federal offices, 16  of whom served in Congress. Those elected officials were able to stand  up for their communities and to work for the resources and protections  they needed.   Today, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus are continuing  their legacy. So tonight, we have a number of Members who will speak on  both the importance of the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment as  well as the present dangers that exist in this body and the issues that  we are continuing to address.   Today, we also received the President's budget. Every year, the  President's budget shows that he does not reflect the values or the  lives of the most vulnerable Americans or the success and security of  hardworking families across this country.   This year, I am proud to, again, stand with my colleagues on the  House Budget Committee under the guidance of Chairman   John Yarmuth to  work to protect the programs that the President is seeking to  destructively slash in his proposal.   Not only does his proposal threaten my constituents and their access  to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act programs that protect my  constituents with preexisting conditions, but it also hacks away at my  State's and all of our States' dollars for affordable housing and  nutrition assistance, just to name a few.   The White House proposes to cut spending by $4.6 trillion over a  decade. Medicaid will see a cut of about $900 billion in funding.  Medicare would see about $500 billion in cuts over that same period.  Funding for Federal disability programs, including Social Security  Disability Insurance, would be cut $63 billion. The Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would be cut by $182 billion  over 10 years as a result of the proposed strident work requirements  proposed by this administration.   This, after they gave themselves the biggest tax cut proposal enacted  by Congress in 2017, giving the top billionaires and big corporations  the greatest benefit from a $1.9 trillion tax cut.   We knew it then and it is now proving out today: those tax cuts are  being balanced on the backs of everyday Americans who are depending  upon this Congress to stand up and to fight for them.   So in the spirit of the 15th Amendment, we know that every voice  matters regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.  So today, my colleagues and I will raise both the commemoration of that  important amendment as well as speak truth to power as it pertains to  these horrendous budget cuts that are being proposed.    Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield to my colleague  from the great State of California. She definitely speaks for me and so  many other great Americans who are looking for strong advocates here in  the United States Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee),  my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from California  again for her tremendous leadership and for reminding us about the  history that brought us to this day, the fact that it was the 13th  Amendment that abolished slavery; that it was the 14th Amendment that  granted us citizenship and equal civil and legal rights to freedom; but  it was the 15th Amendment, which was the last of the Reconstruction  Amendments, which was designed to guarantee Black men the right to  vote.   As the gentlewoman rightly noted, Black women were a significant part  of that effort, despite the fact that they weren't included in those  initial rights until the 19th Amendment was passed. The fact is that we  have come so far and made so much progress with the Voting Rights Act  and know that this body, we passed H.R. 4, but we can't get agreement  with our colleagues on the other side and the colleagues in the Senate  to pass the Voting Rights Act.   Fifty-five years after the initial Voting Rights Act was passed, to  reauthorize that in this body shows just how much of a struggle we  have, whether it is with our voting rights, whether it is with legal  protections, or whether it is with the values that are reflected in the  budget that we are deliberating this week that the President will  submit.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for her words of  wisdom and know that, with the gentlewoman in this fight, we will  continue to make progress and people will be heard.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee), my colleague who serves on the Budget Committee, as  well as the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security Committee.   She has many roles in which she understands the impact of the budget,  the budget proposal that has been submitted by the President, which  makes tremendous cuts to vital social service and safety net programs,  as well as the threat and the assault that is on the  [[Page H1005]]  voting rights that we are speaking about tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee).    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for her  tremendous leadership and for bringing such concise points to both the  budget realities that we are faced with in this current budget proposal  by the administration, as well as what is at stake with the 150th  anniversary of the passage of the 15th Amendment.   The fact that so many people have worked so hard for prior  generations, we now, in this generation and those Members here in this  body who have been duly elected by our constituents, have a solemn  responsibility to respect that Amendment and the protections that come  with it.   Too many times in this body, we have had an opportunity for our  colleagues on the other side to work with us in a bipartisan manner to  pass the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Fortunately, the  House Democrats have moved it as part of the For the People Agenda. It  is sitting on Senator Mitch McConnell's desk. We are asking them to  take that bill up and to vote on it in honor of the passage of the 15th  Amendment and its 150th Anniversary.   I thank the gentlewoman for bringing that perspective to the floor  tonight. We are calling on all of our colleagues to work with us on  this important legislation, as well as H.R. 40 and the other measures  that the gentlewoman spoke about.   I thank the gentlewoman for her time tonight.   I now yield to a great leader in this body. She serves as the chair  of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. She is also a  member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   As the chair of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, she  is one of five chairs for the Congressional Black Caucus. That is a  tremendous accomplishment in its own right, but it reflects the legacy  on which we stand as Members of this body.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her strong  leadership, for sharing her perspective tonight, and for reminding us  about the reality of the poll tax, the literacy tests, and the  grandfather clauses that were once common mechanisms used to  disadvantage minority voters, particularly African American voters.   Tonight, Madam Speaker, again, we are recognizing the 150th  anniversary after the ratification of the 15th Amendment. Tremendous  gains were  [[Page H1008]]  made during that Reconstruction period, where well over 2,000 Black men  were elected to local, State, and Federal office, 16 of whom served in  Congress.   For instance, Hiram Rhodes Revels, the first African American Senator  representing Mississippi, was elected to Congress in 1870. Senator  Revels was sometimes called the 15th Amendment in flesh and blood.   Senator Revels and his colleagues were only part of the story. All  told, about 2,000 African Americans held public office at some level of  government during Reconstruction.   But, sadly, this happened in the face of literacy tests, poll taxes,  and grandfather clauses, once the most common mechanisms used for  disadvantaging minority voters.   After the end of Reconstruction, these amendments were rarely  enforced for nearly 100 years after their ratification. So even despite  the fact that these gains were made, they were not enforced. That is  why we need to have laws that are enforced, and we need to remind this  administration that they are not above the law and that they have to  follow the law and enforce the law.   Black families were separated from their White counterparts and  forced to use lesser facilities. They were maligned, tormented, and  treated without respect. Black children were forced to attend rundown  schools without the necessary books to succeed.   This rampant segregation thrived across the country until the Supreme  Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down the  inherently flawed concept of separate but equal. Sadly, we are still  trying to ensure that separate-but-equal concept no longer applies.   It is 150 years on from the ratification of the Black men's right to  vote, however, and we are still fighting to protect those rights in the  face of voter suppression efforts across this country.   Each election cycle, untold numbers of eligible Americans are  prevented from voting due to barriers in the voter registration process  and restrictions on casting ballots. Just since the 2010 elections, 24  States have implemented new restrictions on voting.   Alabama now requires a photo ID to cast a ballot.   Other States, such as Ohio and Georgia, have enacted use-it-or-lose- it laws, which strike voters from registration rolls if they have not  participated in an election within a prescribed period of time.   In Georgia, in 2018, 53,000 voter registrants, 70 percent of whom  were Black, were unable to vote because of minor misspellings or  missing hyphens on their registration forms.   That is why we must draw attention to the suppression of the Black  vote on this day that we honor the ratification of the 15th Amendment.  Our ancestors require it.   While today we mark the ratification of the 15th Amendment and the  Black men's right to vote as my colleague, Representative Barbara Lee,  indicated, we must also acknowledge that Black women were denied that  right for nearly another 100 years.   During the 19th and 20th centuries, Black women played an active role  in the struggle for universal suffrage. We will be recognizing the 100- year anniversary of the 19th Amendment this August, and it is important  that we remember that Black women attended political conventions at  their local churches where they planned strategies to gain the right to  vote.   In the late 1800s, Black women across the country worked for  churches, newspapers, secondary schools, and colleges, which gave them  a larger platform to promote their ideas. They participated in  political meetings and organized political societies.   In spite of their hard work, many people didn't listen to them. Black  men and White women usually led civil rights organizations and set the  agenda, and they often excluded Black women from their organizations  and activities.   In 1896, reformers like Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and Charlotte  Forten Grimke founded the National Association of Colored Women to  discuss ways of attaining women's rights and women's suffrage. Their  motto was: Lifting as We Climb.   In 1913, Ida B. Wells founded the Alpha Suffrage Club of Chicago, the  Nation's first Black women's club focused specifically on suffrage.  Seven years after the founding of the Alpha Suffrage Club, the 19th  Amendment was ratified.   The 19th Amendment technically granted women in the United States the  right vote, but Black women were excluded from those rights due to the  ever-present racism still pervading every corner of society in this  country at that time. It wasn't until the Voting Rights Act was passed  nearly a half-century later on August 6, 1965, that Black women were  officially allowed to exercise their right to vote--Madam Speaker,  1965.    Yet, Black women today are the strongest in our families. They are  strong in our communities, and they are strong civically. They  understand how much has been fought and has been sacrificed in order  for them to have that right.   So when I talk to young people and they ask me: Why should I vote?  Why does this matter? What do I have to lose?   We need to be reminded tonight that people had a lot to lose. Some  lost and some gave their very life, Members like our esteemed civil  rights icon   John Lewis gave blood so that we would have the right to  vote.   It is important for us to remember that right. That right is based on  this premise that the Federal Government and each State may not deny a  citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's race, color, or  previous condition of servitude.   That last piece I really want to underscore because the massive  incarceration that has occurred over the last few decades and the  number of formerly incarcerated citizens who still to this day in some  States do not have their right to vote, the 15th Amendment guarantees  them that right.   As we recognize this 150th anniversary, we need to challenge policies  like the one in Florida where the people of Florida decided to restore  those formerly incarcerated citizens and give them the ability to vote,  and then the Republicans in the legislature imposed a fee for them to  be able to vote. That is not what this says under the 15th Amendment.   Those in Georgia being denied the right to vote by having their name  stricken from the voting rolls, that is not what the protections under  the 15th Amendment provide for.   This is something that, to me, is very alarming because it speaks to  the very essence of who we are as a people and the democracy that we  uphold in this institution. So, tonight, I want to commend my  colleagues, the entire Congressional Black Caucus; our chairwoman,  Karen Bass; and every single Member who will stand with us to pass H.R.  4, which we have done out of this House to call on Senate Majority  Leader Mitch McConnell and to ask him to bring that bill to a vote, for  the President to sign it, to ensure that every single person's vote is  protected in this country and that we end these tactics where we are  intimidating people from participating in this process.   This goes to the civic engagement of this country. People should  participate by registering to vote. They should participate in the  Census, which is occurring this year. They should participate by making  sure their voice is heard at the ballot box every election.   Madam Speaker, again, I thank my colleagues for joining me for this  Special Order hour. As we commemorate the 150th anniversary of the 15th  Amendment, we remind ourselves what is at stake. As we deliberate on  the President's budget tomorrow and in the coming weeks, let us be  reminded of what is at stake.   I know for me and the people whom I represent in Nevada's Fourth  District, my job is to never forget where I come from, what I am  fighting for, or whom I am fighting for, and it is the people of my  district.   I am proud that Nevada was the first State of the 28 States to ratify  the 15th Amendment. We did so on March 1, 1869. We are battle born in  Nevada. We come from a strong history, and one of the things that we  will always do is protect the rights of our fellow citizens to have  their voice heard.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 12 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, February 11, 2020, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                                 ____________________
