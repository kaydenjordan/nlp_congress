 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the life and  legacy of Congressman John Lewis.   I first met John at a church event in Maryland 20 years ago in Anne  Arundel County when I was a candidate running for Congress. And John  was there to support me but also there to speak to a junior day event.   At that time, I first saw John speak and talk about his relationship  with Dr. Martin Luther King. He recounted many brutal beatings and  arrests that he endured during the height of the civil rights movement.  From that point on, I considered John a mentor.   I am fortunate to have served with many inspiring people, but John  stands out as one of the finest leaders I have ever known.   John encouraged us to get into good trouble, to make a difference.  Though not typically my style, I was proud to participate in a sit-in  on the House floor, led by John, to protest gun violence in 2016. He  told me that by sitting down, we were standing up for thousands of  Americans who have lost their lives in mass shootings after mass  shootings. And so I sat.   The best way to honor John's life and legacy is by continuing the  fight against gun violence, against police brutality, against veteran  disenfranchisement, against systemic racism.   We will carry the torch for you, John.
