 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Penn Manor  field hockey team on their 2017 State championship victory.   It was a remarkable season for these young women. The State  championship  [[Page H9720]]  victory capped off a perfect 28-0 season, and 23 of those victories  were shutouts. Mr. Speaker, they scored 148 goals and only allowed 5.  Leading scorers Gabby Bitts and Emma DeBerdine combined for 64 goals  and 54 assists.   But what is also special about this team is their combined GPA. It is  3.63. It speaks volumes about the team, but also about their coaches  and parents, because we know that success like this isn't achieved  alone. I couldn't be prouder to represent these young women, and I look  forward to the continued success of this program.   Congratulations to the Penn Manor field hockey team, the coaches,  their families, and the faculty, staff, and students that helped make  this championship possible.                            ____________________
