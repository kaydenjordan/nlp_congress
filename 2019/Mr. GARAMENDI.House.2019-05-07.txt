 Mr. Speaker, on April 30, the United States lost an  incredible leader, a Member of Congress, one of the first women to  serve on the New York Stock Exchange, and a good friend to many of us  from California, Ellen Tauscher.   She served here for more than a decade, became one of the ranking  members and chairwoman of the Armed Services subcommittees, and led  this Nation in an effort towards nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.   She left Congress to take on the task of Under Secretary at the  Department of State for that purpose and carried out that  extraordinarily important task as a member of the Obama administration  as Under Secretary of State.   We will miss her, and I will particularly miss her. When she left  Congress to join the State Department, she left an open seat. I had the  pleasure and privilege of following in her footsteps and becoming a  Member of Congress.   We mourn her, we miss her, and we call to an American people Ellen  Tauscher as an example of what an American can and should be.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, one of the things that occasionally  happens here on the floor of the House late at night, when most  everybody is doing something else, is an opportunity to hear what our  Republican colleagues want to talk about, and I must commend them.   I actually sat through a very fascinating discussion on the American  economy by Mr. Schweikert about jobs, about the development of the  workforce and the way it relates to Social Security.  [[Page H3470]]    Very, very interesting. And I just wish there were 433 or 434 others  that could have listened to what he had to say. And he very well  described a fascinating part of the American economy and how it might  relate to our future.   I am going to go into it in a few moments.   I had no idea that our colleague was going to pick up the short line  railroad issue, which is a big deal in my district. I have a very large  agriculture district in California, and the short line railroads are  critically important. And as we talk about infrastructure--yeah--we  really ought to be considering the first and the last mile. In other  words, the short line railroads and how they fit into this  transportation system that is so critically important to the American  economy.   Fascinating. I want to commend my Republican colleagues for bringing  all of that to the floor, and I am going to make a few comments about  it.   Let's start with Mr. Schweikert on the issue of Social Security and  growing the jobs.   He is absolutely correct. If we have a robust economy, if the men and  women of America are working, they will be paying into Social Security  insurance systems and the life, the viability, and the financial  integrity of the Social Security system will be improved.   One of the facts that Mr. Schweikert, my friend from Arizona, pointed  out is that, already with the economy as it is, we have extended, by 1  year, the financial viability of Social Security.   Now, think for a few moments. And my colleague didn't bring this up,  but if the minimum wage, either legally in law or in competition for  quality workers, were to increase, say, across the Nation to $15 an  hour, then that much more revenue would flow into the Social Security  system.   So as we think about these things and as he correctly pointed out,  high employment, very low unemployment, is a benefit to the viability  of Social Security, to say nothing of the viability of the individual  that is able to earn a living, to participate in whichever way they may  desire to engage in the economic activities of this Nation.   All very, very good points, and I really want to commend them for  that.   One issue that was discussed, but I don't think was fully explained,  is how do you prepare people.   Years and years ago in California, in the 1980s, I led a committee on  the future of the California economy. And we studied the California  economy, we studied the world economy, the history of the growth of the  California economy, which today remains the largest economy--I guess,  it is fifth largest economy in the world--and one of the most rapid- growing and one of the most advanced.   We said then that if a government--really, the people--of a society,  were to invest in education, and if you had the best educated workforce  in the world, you would have the best economy.   Now, California does not have the best education system at K through  12. Community college and the university systems, public and private,  are extraordinary, literally, the best in the world.   Now, if we were to add that same principle to the American economy,  then those men and women that are ill-prepared to enter a modern  workforce, could--in the K through 12 system, high school--begin their  preparation to enter into the workforce at a skilled level.   Maybe that skill is computer science, and all of that, or maybe it is  welding, or in the construction trades. Whatever it is, they would be  prepared.   And so as we look at the options that were discussed first by Mr.  Schweikert as he talked about the workforce, I would suggest that he  look at this issue of education. I know he mentioned it, but how do we  then fund it. And here is where we ought to have an interesting debate.   In December of 2017, my Republican colleagues and the President  decided that the way to grow the economy was to massively cut taxes,  and they did. Probably a trillion and a half dollars over the next 10  years--a massive, massive tax cut--that significantly reduced the  revenue to the Federal Government.   Choices were made in that process.   The choice that was made was to reduce taxes a little bit across the  board. Working men and women and families did receive a tax reduction.   In my view, it was very small, and certainly statistically--and by  the numbers--very, very small compared to the top 10 percent, the top 1  percent that received a massive tax cut. And American corporations saw  their tax rate fall from 35 percent down to 20 percent.   Now, that was supposed to create massive economic growth, and it  could be argued that we have had a good economy for the last year or  so. And my colleagues did put up some charts to support that argument;  however, we need to consider some of the underlying implications of  that.   First of all, who got the great bulk? 90 percent--I guess, about 80  percent--of that great tax reduction went to the superwealthy and the  corporations.                                time  2030    What did they do with it? Did they invest in the elements of economic  growth, education, research, capital outlay in businesses, and  transportation and infrastructure? Was that where the tax reductions  were invested? Well, no.   The corporations used the clear majority, in the 60 to 70 percent  range, of their reduced tax for stock buyback, which had the wonderful  effect of driving up the price of stock.   Who benefited from that? Was it the working men and women in the  shipyards or on the short-line railroads, or the teachers in education?  No. It was the top 10 percent who owned the stock.   Let's think this through. Now, nonetheless, the economy has grown,  and I would posit that one of the reasons the economy has grown is the  Keynesian economic theory. The Keynesian economic theory, developed in  the 1930s with the Great Depression, was that when the economy is slow  or depressed, government steps in with deficit spending. Government  supports the economy with deficit spending.   Guess what is happening today: massive deficit spending by the  government, tax reductions, $1.5 trillion gone this year, a $1 trillion  deficit for the Federal Government. By the facts, massive deficit  spending by the government, not in education, not in infrastructure,  but, rather, in the military and, interestingly enough, through the tax  policy so that the great benefit went to the top 10 percent.  Nonetheless, we have seen a stimulated economy, as Keynes suggested  would happen with deficit spending.   Mr. Schweikert correctly points out that we have not seen the  inflation, thankfully, and interest rates have remained low. I would  posit the reason for that is that we are still importing cheap products  from around the world, and despite the chaos here in Washington, D.C.,  the safest bet in the world is America. People are continuing to buy  American bonds and invest in America, bonds and debt, all of which has  kept the interest rates low.   Here is what I would suggest we look at, and there is a lot of  opportunity that exists. I was really enthusiastically listening to Mr.  Schweikert as he laid out his proposals and his description of the  economy and the labor force. I would suggest that we continue this  debate.   I spoke to the gentleman a few moments ago. I said: Let's get in a  colloquy back here. You can open with your discussion, and I will come  back with my side of it. I think we have some opportunity here to  really develop some decent policy.   Let's take investing. There is a lot of talk about infrastructure  investing. We are going to have to find the money for that. Can we do  it all on debt with deficit financing? I don't think so. I think there  is going to be some limit to that, so we need to talk about tax  revenue. We might want to go back and revisit the 2017 tax cut and who  benefited and what the opportunities might be to rearrange that  equation.   What would we invest in? Infrastructure. Now, if we are going to  invest in infrastructure, we already know we are short of skilled  labor. That brings us to education and labor force preparation. Is  there a role for the Federal Government here, together with the State  governments and businesses, to develop the workforce, to train the  workforce? The answer is absolutely yes.   We know how to do this. This has been done before during World War  II. As Mr. Schweikert pointed out correctly, the millennial women  joining  [[Page H3471]]  the labor force--guess who the millennial women were in 1942 and 1943?  Yes, they were Rosie the Riveter. Who trained them in the government  contracts to the shipbuilders, to the tank builders, to the truck  builders? There was money in those contracts to train the workforce.  The government, together with the private sector, trained the  workforce. The models are there.   We do have community colleges. We do have apprenticeship programs  with labor unions, labor-management apprenticeship programs. All of  those are there.   If we need a well-trained workforce, we don't need to reinvent it. It  is already available to us: labor-management apprenticeship programs  and the Federal Government providing incentives in the contracts for  shipbuilding.   I was talking to one of my Democratic colleagues about a shipyard  that was unable to have trained workers: welders, shipbuilders,  plumbers, pipefitters, and the like. The company was not investing in  the workforce, in the apprenticeship programs. That can be solved.   If we need to subsidize that through the contracts, do it. Set it  aside, make it a special part of it. Yes, you are going to build naval  ships, but, yes, you are also going to train workers. Here is how it  will be done. Here is the money to do it. We can do these things.   Education, research, fundamental investments, we need to pay  attention to making it in America. I have spent days and days here on  the floor in these Special Order hours talking about how we can do  that. I want to give you an example.   America today is exporting oil and natural gas. Ten years ago, we  used to be net importers. Now we are net exporters. That strategic  natural resource is going out to the world, largely to China, on ships.  Whose ships? This strategic national asset needs to be coupled with  another strategic national asset, which is the American maritime  industry.   Consider for a moment, if we were to require that a small percentage  of that oil and natural gas be on American-built ships with American  crews, American mariners, what would happen. One, 2, 3, percent, up to  5, 6, 7, 8 percent over the next decade, we would build 50 ships. In  the shipyards across America, we would employ American workers to build  those ships.   Is it possible? Absolutely, it is possible. Do you know what it  takes? It takes a very simple law requiring that, for the necessity of  America's national security, we be able to maintain our maritime  industry so that, should something happen, we will be able to transport  across the oceans of the world our military as needed, that we in our  shipyards maintain the workforce and the viability of the shipyards so  that they can build the necessary naval vessels.    Is it possible? All it takes is a law.   I recommend that we pay attention. I introduced this legislation last  year with my good friend, Senator Wicker from the Senate side, and we  are going to reintroduce it here in the next few days.   The Energizing American Shipbuilding Act will soon be on the floor of  the House and the Senate. I draw our attention to that because it  combines a necessary national security issue with jobs.   However, what I said a moment ago is critical. That is that, along  the way in this process, we must train workers starting in high school,  starting with the apprenticeship programs, making sure that the  shipyard businesses are in the business of training workers together  with community colleges and other apprenticeship programs. If we do  this, even if we need to subsidize that process, we will grow this  economy, and we will have high-paid, high-skilled workers.   Similarly, as we rebuild the American bridges, as we rebuild the  short-line railroads, as we rebuild the infrastructure of America,  whether it is in high-speed internet communications systems or in  highway transportation, river transportation, all the rest, we need to  keep in mind the training of the workforce.   I thank Mr. Schweikert for bringing to the attention of the floor  tonight this critical issue. There are so many things we can do  together. There are different ways of approaching this. But I know that  if we are willing to engage in a debate, an honest debate about growing  the American economy, about making sure that our task is for the  people, not the special interests but for the fundamental American  working men and women, we will be successful.   Again, we can do it through education, job training, research, make  it in America, and paying attention to our infrastructure.   If we are short 350,000 workers to fill the 350,000 jobs that are  open today, then it is incumbent upon this Congress to get at it.   I want to do one final thing. There is an infrastructure project in  California. It is an infrastructure project that has been discussed for  the last 30 years, and it is an infrastructure project that is  extraordinarily damaging.   California water is extremely complex. Basically, water flows from  northern California rivers into the great Sacramento-San Joaquin River  Delta, the largest inland estuary on the West Coast of the Western  Hemisphere, an extraordinary place, a place that I represent and a  place where I have lived for the last 40-some years.   It is an extraordinary part of America. It is now a national heritage  area.   It has been suggested over the last three decades that the water  systems of California need to circumvent the natural flow of water into  this estuary. Over this period of time, I have had the obligation to  fight those proposals.   First, it was the Peripheral Canal to take the water around the  delta. Then in the last decade, it has been the Twin Tunnels, two  massive tunnels that literally had the capacity to drain the Sacramento  River, to drain it dry. The river runs some 12,000 to 16,000 cubic feet  per second 6 months of the year. The tunnels were sized at 16,000 cubic  feet per second and, therefore, capable of literally drying the delta  and destroying the incredible ecosystem of the delta.   We fought. We fought the battle, and I commend our new Governor,  Governor Newsom, for stepping back and taking the time to rethink this  proposal called the California WaterFix, to rethink its impact on the  ecology and the environment of the delta. I thank him for taking  WaterFix and pushing it aside.   He said no, we are not going to pursue that. We are going to go back  and do the environmental analysis, not on two tunnels capable of drying  out the delta or drying out the Sacramento River, but, rather, look at  how this water problem in California can be solved without ecological  damage.   We will pursue this once again, and I know that it can be done.  Nearly 8 years ago, I proposed what I called a Water Plan for All  California. It laid out solutions, not that I developed, but that had  been developed by Californians in the water industry, in the  agricultural industry, in the urban as well as the agricultural water  systems.   Those proposals have been out there. We simply compiled them into a  program: conservation, storage, paying attention to the aquifers,  paying attention to the ecology of the fish and the environment, and  providing in the delta a solution built upon improving the transport of  water through the natural levees and through the natural sluices and  rivers while keeping in mind that water should not be exported when it  would damage the fish. All of that is possible. That law is now in  place; it is called the WIN legislation, water infrastructure.   Now, we can move forward with a new opportunity as we revisit a  solution that is both good for the environment, good for the delivery  of water to all Californians, and done in a way that does not set up an  existential danger, an existential system that could damage forever the  largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere.   We can do it. Just as the optimism that I heard from my Republican  colleagues in the first order hour here, I present an optimistic  opportunity. I am not yet joyful, but I am optimistic because I know  these solutions are there if we work together and if we keep our eye on  the prize for the people, for the American people, not just the  superwealthy, not just the major American corporations, but for mom and  pop, for Wall Street, for the men and women who are working in the  shipyards, working on the rails, and for those millennial women who are  entering the workforce and the millennial men who will be following  along.   I am optimistic, and I hope to be joyful.
