 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION      Australia--AIM-120C-7 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles         The Government of Australia has requested to buy up to 108       AIM-120C-7 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles       (AMRAAM); six (6) AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM Air Vehicles       Instrumented; and six (6) spare AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM guidance       sections. Also included are containers, weapon system support       equipment, support and test equipment, site survey,       transportation, repair and return warranties, spare and       repair parts, publications and technical data, maintenance,       personnel training, and training equipment, U.S. Government       and contractor representative engineering, logistics, and       technical support services, and other related elements of       logistics support. These items are in support of Australia's       purchase of the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile       System (NASAMS). The estimated total program cost is $240.5       million.        This sale will support the foreign policy and national       security of the United States by helping to improve the       security of a major ally that is an important force for       political stability and economic progress in the Western       Pacific. It is vital to the U.S. national interest to assist       our ally in developing and maintaining a strong and ready       self-defense capability.        This proposed sale is in support of the Australian Defence       Force (ADF) Project LAND 19 Phase 7B for acquisition of a       ground based air and missile defense capability. Australia       will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Raytheon Missile Systems,       Tucson, Arizona. There are no known offset arrangements       proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Australia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-12       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. AIM-120C Advance Medium Range Air-to-Air (AMRAAM) is a       radar guided missile featuring digital technology and micro-      miniature solid-state electronics. AMRAAM capabilities       include look-down/shoot-down, multiple launches against       multiple targets, resistance to electronic counter measures,       and interception of high flying and low flying and       maneuvering targets. AIM-120 Captive Air Training Missiles       are non-functioning, inert missile rounds used for armament       load training, and which also simulates the correct weight       and balance of live missiles during captive carry on training       sorties. The AIM-120C-7, as employed in the National Advanced       Surface-to-Air System (NASAMS), protects national assets from       imminent hostile air threats. The AMRAAM All Up Round is       classified CONFIDENTIAL, major components and subsystems       range from UNCLASSIFIED to CONFIDENTIAL, and technology data       and other documentation are classified up to SECRET.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Australia.                            ____________________
