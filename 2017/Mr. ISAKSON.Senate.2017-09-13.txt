 Mr. President, I rise for two purposes--principally, to  support this legislation and to thank Ranking Member Reed and Chairman  McCain and the other Members of the Senate for the contributions they  have made in the reauthorization of the National Defense Authorization  Act.   In particular, I want to thank our men and women in uniform, our  command and control, our military intelligence, our weather systems in  the military, for the tremendous aid they have provided to us in  Georgia, to the people of Florida, the people of Alabama, the people of  Texas, the people of Louisiana, and the people of Mississippi during  two tragic hurricanes that have taken place in the last weeks. We think  of our men and women in uniform every day for what they have sacrificed  for us to defend our country and to keep us safe, but sometimes we  forget all of the things they do to help us when we have times of  trouble. If there were ever times of trouble, Hurricane Harvey in Texas  and what happened in Florida with Hurricane Irma are certainly that.  Some of those assets are based in my State of Georgia, like the search  and rescue mission that works out of Moody Air Force Base in South  Georgia, which has been invaluable in rescue efforts in the State of  Florida.   So as I come to support the NDAA reauthorization, I come also to pay  tribute to our men and women in uniform for all they do for us in so  many ways, not just to keep us safe but also in seeing to it that, in  times of trouble, they are there for us.   I want to thank my Governor, Nathan Deal, for the advanced planning  they did to lead up to the recovery from the hurricane. In Georgia we  lost three lives, which is tragic. We are sorry for each one, and our  hearts go out to those families.   Preparation by our leader, Nathan Deal, and others in the State saw  to it that our reaction and our timeliness was excellent. I thank  Governor Deal for doing that, as well as Georgia  [[Page S5265]]  Emergency Management, in coordination with FEMA. Everywhere in Georgia  where we had danger, we also had response for our people and for our  State.   I also want to talk for a second about something called JSTARS.  JSTARS is an asset of our U.S. military and our intelligence agencies  and a capability that is second to none in the world. JSTARS stands for  Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System, or JSTARS, and it is  headquartered in Warner Robins, GA, at Robins Air Force Base.   In particular, since the Gulf war and everything that has happened in  the Middle East and ensued since then, it has been invaluable in  command and control capabilities on the ground. It is an intelligence  system that is unmatched by any other military of our adversaries in  the world.   We were informed a couple of years ago, when we started the effort to  recapitalize the JSTARS, that there may be some movement to move away  from JSTARS as a system to protect ourselves and have at our disposal  for risk reconnaissance and recovery and battle management and battle  control. I had a visit today, as a matter of fact, from the Secretary  of the Air Force, Heather Wilson, a great lady and former Member of the  House of Representatives, with whom I served, as well as an outstanding  soldier and an outstanding person serving as the Secretary of the Air  Force and part of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. She told me that the Air  Force was looking at different ways that they might deploy  recapitalization for JSTARS and other ways to deliver those services to  our military personnel, which sends a signal to me that our JSTARS may  be in trouble. The reasons for this are inexplicable when talking to  anybody who is talking about doing it and inexplicable to me as an  individual who knows that system well.   Our country and our soldiers and our warfighters have benefited  greatly on the ground and in the air from JSTARS surveillance  capabilities. It is an aging system, but it is a great system. It is a  system that has coordinated and delivered the coordinated messages that  we can get nowhere else. I would submit that, if the Air Force were to  decide that, rather than recapitalizing the existing JSTARS program, as  we have been working toward over the last few years, they go to an  alternative delivery system, it is probably giving up security for our  country, intel for our men and women on the ground, battlefield  coordination you cannot replace in any other way, and an asset that we  have taken for granted for far too long in this country.   So for Chairman McCain, whose service I appreciate, as well as his  commitment to NDAA, I come to the floor to say I am with you and I will  support you, but I want to make sure we do everything we can to ensure  that the JSTARS and the capabilities of that mission are recapitalized  and are there for our soldiers in the future and our military in the  future. For us to fail to do so, to my way of thinking, would be bad  for our soldiers, bad for our security, and bad for our country.   I thank Ranking Member Reed and Chairman McCain for the effort they  have put into this. I thank members of the committee for all the  efforts they have made.   I thank our men and women in uniform. I am glad we got a pay raise.  It is not as much as I would have liked to see, but I am glad we got  one. I am glad we are making a bigger investment in our military, but  no investment that we give in money can match the investment of spirit,  capabilities, and commitment of the men and women of the Armed Forces  of the United States of America. I commend them today, praise them for  their effort, and tell them: I am with you all the way.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my Defense  fellow, CPT Douglas Hill, be granted floor privileges for the remainder  of the legislative session today.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________
