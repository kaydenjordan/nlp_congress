 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the U.S. Senate has just done the right  thing. In a matter of hours, hopefully, the decision to fund the  government and to put people back to work will find its way to the  House of Representatives. I am sure that it will find a quick agreement  there, and tomorrow everyone will be back in place, and both the House  and the Senate can work aggressively between now and February 8 to make  sure that this doesn't happen again and that we bring permanency and  certainty to the funding.  [[Page S434]]    The vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and I were notified  when the House CR appeared that there was language in it that was  different than in the past. The language in section 148 of the CR is of  concern to the Intelligence Committee. Let me just read the language:         Sec. 148. Funds appropriated by the Department of Defense       Missile Defeat and Defense Enhancements Appropriation Act,       2018 (division B of Public Law 115-96) may be obligated and       expended notwithstanding section 504(a)(1) of the National       Security Act of 1947.    This language is troublesome for the committee because it would  authorize the intelligence community to spend funds ``notwithstanding''  the law that requires prior authorization by the Senate Intelligence  Committee or by the House Intelligence Committee.   The vice chairman and I were on the floor, I think, last week, and we  had a 65-to-34 vote to reauthorize the most significant intelligence  tool to keep America safe. In that debate, both Senator Warner and I  said to our opposition that we would do everything within the  committee's power to make sure we did aggressive, real-time oversight  over the entire intelligence community.   Sometimes that means that when we see there might be something we are  uncomfortable with, we alter the ability to access funds. In  congressional terms, we call it fencing off money. But we utilize the  tools as an authorizer to affect what, in fact, individuals within the  intelligence community can choose to do.   When you take away section 504 authorities that the committees have,  for the next 3 weeks we will have an inability to exercise, in our  estimation, the tools that we might need to keep our commitment to 34  individuals who still voted against us but, more importantly, to the  American people, for whom we would do everything to make sure our  intelligence communities act in a way that those educated and elected  in this body see fit. As a result, this language can erode the powers  of the authorizing committee. Effectively, the intelligence community  could expend funds as it sees fit without an authorization bill in  place and with no statutory direction indicating that an authorization  bill for 2018 is forthcoming.   Let me just say to my colleagues, a situation like this is untenable.  We have worked with our colleagues in HPSCI to develop language to  change this. I might say, we have had a couple of opportunities to do  it, and we should have done it literally when we changed the date of  the CR. When we changed the date from the original date, which I think  was the 16th, to the 8th of February, we should have inserted this new  language. But because there is a fight between appropriators and the  Intelligence Committee in the House, we weren't able to do that.   I have a feeling that Senator Warner and I are going to find there is  now a fight between the Intelligence Committee and the appropriators in  the U.S. Senate because, I fear, someone might object to the unanimous  consent request I will ask after Senator Warner speaks.   Let me read what the committee has come up with. This is bicameral.  The House Select Committee on Intelligence is in agreement. In section  148, it would say:         Funds appropriated by the Department of Defense Missile       Defeat and Defense Enhancements Appropriations Act, 2018       (division B of Public Law 115-96), for intelligence or       intelligence related activities are deemed to be specifically       authorized by Congress for purposes of section 504 of the       National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 414) during fiscal       year 2018 until the enactment of the Intelligence       Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018.    The vice chairman is a lawyer; I am not. I really rely upon the legal  counsel that we have within the committee to interpret U.S. law. It  really doesn't take a law degree to understand that there is a huge  difference between ignoring section 504, ``notwithstanding,'' and  applying section 504, which our change makes.   This isn't really a misinterpretation. This is a question of whether  you want to take section 504 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50  U.S.C. 414) and continue to let it apply or whether you are going to  provide the intelligence community a waiver that exempts them from  having to adhere to a part of U.S. Code.   The reason I wanted the opportunity to speak before we ask unanimous  consent is, I want my colleagues to understand that we take our  oversight role extremely seriously. We want to have every tool in our  basket that we can to give the American people the assurance that we  know exactly what is going on and that we are at least in agreement  that they proceed forward, not that they have free rein only because  they have been appropriated a pot of money because an executive request  was made. It would be no different under the Obama administration or  under the Trump administration. I would encourage my colleagues not to  object to it when I ask for the unanimous consent because that is what  we are here for.    With that, I yield to the vice chairman.    Mr. President, I thank the vice chairman of the committee.  There are over 30-plus professional staffers who staff both sides of  the Intelligence Committee. On each side, there is a staffer designated  for each of the intelligence agencies in this country. I would dare say  today they know their particular portfolio of intelligence agencies as  well as the employees who work inside that agency. They are experts.  They are tasked with that degree of knowledge. Layered on top of that  are 15 Members of the U.S. Senate whom the leadership on both sides  have asked to spend countless hours behind closed doors--as the vice  chairman said--typically in a bipartisan fashion to provide for every  Member and for the American people our certification that we agree with  what the intelligence community is doing; that it lives within the  letter of the law; that there is some congressional oversight on a  constant basis, in real-time, assuring Members and the American people  of that accuracy. Why would you take away the tools we have to actually  hold them accountable?   I know appropriators believe this hinders their ability to spend  money when we are in a continuing resolution  [[Page S435]]  period because of section 504. I am not sure I interpret it the same  way they do. Just because an executive branch has asked for a pot of  money, I have never considered that the committee couldn't go in,  because of a vehement disagreement with the way some of it is being  spent, and alter it. That altering means that on the part of 15 Members  we have a hesitancy as to how it is being done. If you neuter the  committee, you neuter our oversight.   Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that the Burr  amendment to amendment No. 1917, which is at the desk, be considered  and agreed to.    Mr. President, it is my hope that we will come to our  senses at some point in this process and that this waiver to U.S. Code  will, in fact, not be in place, but I will assure, on behalf of the  vice chairman and myself to all our Members, we will, to the best of  our ability, given the limitation that is placed on us, hold the  intelligence community accountable for everything they do and that we  will be much more active in the future relative to the appropriations  that find their way there if, in fact, they are not going to provide us  the tools to manage, in a constructive way, those things the agencies  choose to carry out.   If I didn't have the number of individuals in Members and in staff  who are experts, I probably wouldn't be as confident, but these folks  take it extremely seriously because we know what is at stake--the trust  we have with our Members and the trust we have with the American  people.   With that, Mr. President, I yield back but with great disappointment.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
