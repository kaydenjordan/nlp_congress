 Madam Speaker, the Constitution requires physical  presence to constitute a quorum.   By circumventing over 200 years of rules, the proxy voting  established by House Resolution 965 is unconstitutional.   For that reason, I object to the vote on the grounds that a physical  quorum is not present and I make a point of order that a quorum is not  present.
