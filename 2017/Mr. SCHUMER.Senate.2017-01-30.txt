 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon, like much of  America, angry and perturbed but in resolute opposition to the  President's Executive order issued on Friday. This Executive order was  mean-spirited and un-American. It made us less secure. It put our  troops in the field at increased risk. It was implemented in a way that  caused chaos and confusion across the country. It must be reversed  immediately. Let me give three reasons why.   First, it ought to be reversed because it will not make us safer, as  the President argues. It will make us less safe.   The President's Executive order targeted seven Muslim-majority  countries. Not one terrorist attack has been perpetrated on U.S. soil  by a refugee from one of these countries--not one. Moreover, it could  alienate and inflame the communities we need most in the fight against  terrorism.   As my friend Republican Senator John McCain noted, it could increase  the small number of lone wolves, which pose the greatest threat of  terrorism. Both the San Bernardino and Orlando attacks were done by  lone wolves, American citizens importuned by the evil ISIS. This rule  would have nothing to do with that.   As my friend John McCain has noted, it could increase the small  number of lone wolves, which pose the greatest threat of terrorism. As  both Senators McCain and Graham expressed yesterday, this order is a  valuable propaganda tool for ISIS. We saw that happen today. They  predicted it yesterday, McCain and Graham. It happened today. They want  nothing more than to paint the United States as a country at war with  all of Islam. This order feeds right into the perception ISIS and other  extremists want to create. The bottom line is, the policy will make us  less safe, not more safe.   Second, while there is no way to defend the order, it was poorly  constructed and even more poorly executed. The order was signed into  effect without the consultation of the Federal agencies that are  responsible for enforcing it: the Department of Justice, the Department  of Homeland Security, or the Department of State, and possibly others.   People across America saw utter chaos and confusion that resulted in  our airports over the weekend. The people in charge of implementing it  weren't even told about it. Folks were caught in detention at airports  around the country, young children separated from their mothers,  husbands from their wives, green card holders and legal residents being  denied the right to see an attorney. Some folks were pressured into  signing away their permanent legal status. We are looking into that  right now.   It raises serious doubts about the competence--the basic competence-- of the new administration when such an important order is so poorly  vetted and executed, just like some of their Cabinet nominations. Such  a far-reaching and impactful Executive order should have gotten extreme  vetting. Instead, it was rushed through without much thought or  deliberation. I could not disagree more with the intention behind the  order, but the haphazard and  [[Page S463]]  completely incompetent way in which it was implemented made matters  even worse.   Third, and most important of all, the order should be reversed  because it is un-American. We are a nation founded by the descendants  of asylum seekers, a nation that has been constantly invigorated,  replenished, and driven forward by immigrants, many millions of whom  came under duress, seeking a new birth of freedom in America. The  ability to find refuge from persecution, whether based on one's  religion or race or political views, goes to the very foundation of the  country, starting with the Pilgrims and Plymouth Rock. The Executive  order is antithetical to everything we are about.   President Trump seems to want people to believe that all immigrants  are terrorists or criminals, but when you meet immigrants, you see they  are not the face of terrorism; they are families just like ours.  Yesterday I met two. They were at my office. Mr. Hameed, an Iraqi  refugee, worked at a local university department in English literature  and, because he loved our country and what we were trying to do, he  chose to use his language skills to be a translator for American  soldiers in Iraq. He worked as a translator for the U.S. Army in Iraq  for 10 years. He endured death threats and harassment to himself and to  his family because he was helping us and our soldiers. So he began the  refugee process about 2 years ago.   He arrived on January 5. If Donald Trump had been inaugurated on  January 1 and enacted his order 6 weeks sooner, Mr. Hameed would have  had to stay in Iraq. His life would have been threatened for  cooperating with our military.   What kind of message does this send to the untold millions of people  just like Mr. Hameed throughout the Muslim world who today will be less  likely to work for and with our great country?   Then I met the Elias family. They were a different type. They have  four children. They arrived here a month ago. Their journey to the  United States began 5 years ago from war-torn Syria. After surviving  the brutal civil war, where suicide bombs had been blowing up in front  of their house, they were finally reunited with their family in the  Bronx. You see, the driving force that brought them here were two  American citizens, their grandparents. Mr. and Mrs. Elias came in  around 1970.   They are model Americans, the Eliases. I met them. I talked to them.  I enjoyed talking to them. Mr. Elias started out as a tailor, a skill  that is disappearing. We don't have too many tailors left in America.  He is an entrepreneur, like so many immigrants, and he started a small  business. He now refurbishes the interior of boats mainly on City  Island over there in the Bronx. I have been there. It is a beautiful  place.   Well, he wanted to bring his people, his kids and grandchildren, here  because their lives were threatened. They came again a month ago. I met  the little boy, a beautiful little boy, a red-headed Syrian refugee.   I said: What do you want to be when you grow up?   A policeman.   I asked the daughter: What do you want to be?   A doctor.   The Elias family and their young children are not a threat to  America; they are the promise of America, the same types of people, Mr.  President, as your ancestors and mine who came here seeking a better  life and working so hard for it.   It is my guess, if President Trump met these refugees, Mr. Hameed and  the Elias family, he wouldn't be so hard-hearted.   Our country has a grand and proud tradition of welcoming families  like these with open arms. America is at her best when she is a safe  harbor in a world of stormy seas.   I urge my Republican colleagues to help us overturn this wrongheaded,  counterproductive, dangerous, and un-American Executive order. So many  of you know it is wrong. I understand party loyalty. I do. But what  this order does is go against the grain that there are higher values at  stake.   Eleven of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have expressed  reservations already. I urge them and others to back up their words  with action. Let's repeal the order, then sit down and thoughtfully and  carefully construct a better way to keep our country safe from  terrorism.   President Obama toughened up vetting. If there is more vetting that  has to be done, we will be happy to look at it and work with you on it  but not something like this.   At 5:15 today, I will be asking unanimous consent to call for a vote  on a bill offered by my friend from California Senator Feinstein, the  ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, to overturn the order, and  I hope our Republican colleagues will join us.   As proponents of this legislation, we believe it shows strength.   Proponents of the order say it shows strength, but it is not true; it  is not true. Let me explain why. My middle name is Ellis; Charles Ellis  Schumer. I was named after my uncle Ellis, who was named for Ellis  Island. My daughter's middle name is Emma. We named her for the poet  Emma Lazarus, whose timeless words adorn the base of the Statue of  Liberty: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning  to breathe free.''   The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of our Nation. Around the world,  people recognize it, that mighty beacon that I can see from my home in  Brooklyn, and they know we are a nation whose might comes not only from  our great military but from our morality, whose leadership--our  country's leadership is demonstrated not by projecting a fear of  outsiders but by inspiring them in a hope for a better life here in  America. Our country is a country whose strength comes from its values,  and among them is a commitment to be that golden door that Emma Lazarus  spoke about, a shelter, a commitment to shelter the oppressed and the  persecuted.   Just as we faced down and defeated the threat of communism with our  values--a respect for the rule of law, for equality under the law, for  free markets and free societies--we must face down the twin threats of  terrorism and jihadism, not only with military strength, as important  as that is, but also with our values: religious freedom, tolerance,  decency.   Our greatest weapon will always be our values. That is what makes us  strong. They are ``a new colossus,'' as Emma Lazarus called it over 100  years ago.   The only way we will lose the war against terrorism is if we lose  ourselves and retreat from our values. Not only will this Executive  order embolden and inspire those around the globe who wish to do us  harm, it strikes against the very core of America, our values, our  greatest strength. We are better than this. So I will fight with every  fiber of my being until this Executive order is gone.                          National Security Council     Mr. President, on Friday, the President reshuffled the  National Security Council to remove permanent postings for the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence  and installed a permanent seat for White House Political Adviser Steve  Bannon. It is a disturbing and profound departure from past  administrations.   On the most sensitive matters of national security, the President  should be relying on the informed counsel of members of the military  and intelligence agencies, not political advisers who made their  careers promoting a White nationalist Web site.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the President's primary  military adviser, and his voice, along with that of the Director of  National Intelligence, are the only independent, apolitical voices.  President Trump's move to strip them of their seats is baffling. It  endangers our national security and is contrary to the spirit and  intent of the National Security Act.   This morning, Gen. Michael Hayden--I can't think of a more respected  general and intelligence leader. He has served bipartisanly, the  Clinton, Bush, Obama administrations. He said that the move--and these  are his words, not mine, General Hayden's--``puts ideology at the  center over the professional kind of information that the DNI and the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs bring to the party.''   That is a deeply disturbing thought. It reinforces this  administration's preference to propagate its own reality, rather than  grapple with the facts on the ground, and if that continues, America is  going to have real trouble.  [[Page S464]]    It is one thing when it comes to a dustup about the size of the  inauguration crowd; it is an entirely different story when it is the  most sensitive activities undertaken by our Nation's government.   Much like the Muslim ban, this decision was poorly thought out and  ill-conceived. It has put a filter on the information going to the  President and, like the Executive order, makes us less safe.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be yielded 5  minutes for myself and then 5 minutes for the Senator from Arkansas to  answer and perhaps object after I make motions.    Mr. President, I will speak and then make my two  motions, and then the Senator from Arkansas can speak and either object  or not, whatever he decides.   Mr. President, earlier I spoke at length on the President's Executive  order. I just want to repeat that this Executive order has made us less  safe, less secure, put our troops in the field at increased risk, and  was implemented in a way that has caused chaos and confusion across the  country. Most fundamentally of all, it is un-American. It flies in the  face of a grand American tradition of granting refuge to those fleeing  persecution, regardless of their race, religion, or political views. It  is dangerous. It is shameful. It is wrong. It must be reversed  immediately. And I know that many of my colleagues agree with me. They  know this is wrong. A dozen Republican Senators and counting, including  my good friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, have expressed serious  concern. One former Republican CIA Director said that it ``makes us  less safe than we were on Friday.''   So let's repeal the order and then sit down to discuss a smart,  thoughtful, effective way to counter terrorism. President Obama wanted  tougher vetting. Democrats are happy to look at proposals to that  effect but not this ineffective, un-American policy that will do more  to empower our enemies and inspire those around the globe who would do  us harm.   Now I am going to make a second unanimous consent request, and I will  do them seriatim, as the UC allowed.   The second request is, I ask unanimous consent that we delay the  confirmation vote on Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson until  these Executive orders are overturned and he commits to opposing them.   So far, this is the most important foreign policy order of the new  administration, and in the committee hearing for his nomination, Mr.  Tillerson appeared--he wasn't 100 percent certain--to roundly reject  the idea of a blanket travel ban just like the one President Trump  signed. He said: ``I don't support a blanket type of travel ban on  people coming to this country.'' He stressed in his opening statement  that moderate Muslims are going to be our greatest allies in the fight  against Islamic extremists. The implication was that he wouldn't  support a proposal that would in any way alienate and inflame them. He  said he didn't think it was helpful to suggest that Americans should be  afraid of Muslims. That would suggest he might be wary about a policy  that explicitly singles out seven majority-Muslim countries for  different treatment under U.S. policy.   Now, many of the comments Mr. Tillerson made to the committee are at  odds with the President's policy. So Democrats and Republicans alike  and the American people, most of all, deserve to know whether Mr.  Tillerson would implement this Executive order or not because it seems  to directly contradict comments he made under oath to a Senate  committee. Key allies around the world are wondering whether the  potential future Secretary of State supports this policy, and so are  the American people.   Here are some important questions: Did he have any involvement or  consultation in the construction or drafting of the Executive order?  How would he answer the outcries from countries around the world that  are asking that President Trump rethink this policy? Does he think it  would make us less safe? Does he think it would alienate moderate  Muslim communities in the United States and around the world? And does  he believe current green card holders should be subjected to another  round of scrutiny if they come back to the United States, even though  they have been vetted before?   We need these answers from President Trump's nominees, and Mr.  Tillerson's nomination is before the Senate right now, so it is  imperative that we know what he thinks before moving forward.   So, Mr. President, I am making two unanimous consent requests.   First, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Senator Feinstein's bill, S. 240, introduced  earlier today; that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided; and  that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be considered read  a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill;  finally, that there be no amendments, motions, or points of order in  order to the bill.    Thank you.    I have a second unanimous consent request.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on  Calendar No. 2, the nomination of Rex W. Tillerson for Secretary of  State, be postponed until Executive Order 137 is rescinded and Mr.  Tillerson has provided in writing to the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee information pertaining to his involvement in the development  of the Executive order, as well as a statement declaring whether or not  he agrees with the order.    Mr. President, so we have had a number, a large number  of eloquent speeches about the President's Executive order. While they  were going on, of course, we had a Monday night massacre. Sally Yates,  a person of great integrity, who follows the law, was fired by the  President. She was fired because she would not enact, pursue, the  Executive order on the belief that it was illegal, perhaps  unconstitutional.   It was a profile in courage. It was a brave act and the right act. I  hope the President and his people who are in the White House learned  something from this; first, that we are a nation under the rule of law.  You cannot just sit down, Twitter something out, and then think: OK.  Let's enact it. It is a complicated country. When you do something as  major as what the President proposed in his Executive order, you have  to think it through. You have to talk to people.   Sally Yates was the Acting Attorney General. Why wasn't she  consulted? Maybe they would have known what she felt and maybe they  would not have done what they did. Clearly, that lack of consultation  went up and down the line. Sally Yates is from a different  administration. General Kelly was President Trump's selection.   He learned of this Executive order when he got a phone call from the  White House while he saw it being announced on television. How can you  run a country like that? I am hearing from my constituents in New York.  There are hard-core Trump supporters. They are for him. But they are a  small minority of New Yorkers.   There are many progressive, liberal, and pro-immigrant people.  Obviously, they are horrified, but I would say this to the President  and his minions. There are a lot of people who voted for  [[Page S486]]  President Trump--not the hard core--and they are appalled by the simple  ineptitude of this administration. Substantively, even more important,  how can you run a country like this? How can you make a major order,  major doing, and not check it out with your Homeland Security  Secretary, with the Justice Department and the Attorney General?   I will say, if this continues, this country has big trouble. We  cannot have a Twitter Presidency. We cannot have a Presidency that  thinks: Oh, this sounds good. Let's just go do it and not think the  consequences through. Most of all, we cannot have a Presidency that  does not understand the beauty and depth of America, in this case when  it comes to immigrants.   We have been an amazing country. In the city in which I live there is  a big lady in the harbor with a torch. It is a beautiful symbol.  Americans revere it and admire it. The world reveres it and admires it.  Why? Because it says: America will be a place where people can take  refuge if they are persecuted religiously, politically, and then they  can build a great life for themselves.   That is a beautiful thing. That moral force of America helps us win  wars, helps us win support, helps us be the greatest country in the  world that everyone admires.   Of course, we need a strong military. Of course, we need a strong  economy. Praise God, America has had both through the decades, but we  also have been a moral beacon, ``God's noble experiment,'' as the  Founding Fathers called it. In those days, as now, we have welcomed  people from distant shores and said: Come be Americans.   Our President is trampling on that, to be honest with you. The idea  that immigrants are preponderantly criminals and preponderantly  terrorists is absurd. They are the future of America. In my State of  New York, 25 percent of the people are foreign born, probably as high  as 40 percent if you are either foreign born or had a parent foreign  born.   They are great New Yorkers. I was with a Syrian refugee this week. He  and his wife and his children had just come. His parents were American  citizens. They had come to America in 1970. The parents and Mr. Elias,  who lived in the Bronx, came here. He was a tailor. We don't have that  many fine tailors in America these days. It is a lost art. So people  who do it tend to be immigrants; mainly from Italy is my experience.   But he was a tailor from Syria. He then did what immigrants do in  America. He founded a little business. He reupholsters boats, a lot of  them in a place in the Bronx called City Island. He built a company. He  made America better. He is a Syrian immigrant.   His children and grandchildren were in danger. A suicide bomber had  even blown up himself in front of their home nearly killing them. They  just got in this month. Had Donald Trump's Executive order been in  effect several weeks earlier, they would not have been able to get  here. They might have perished. They might have been hurt.   Similarly, another guy I met is Mohammed. Mohammed knows English. He  was so impressed by America, by the lady with the torch, by our values,  by what we stand for, that he volunteered to be a translator for our  soldiers. He put his life in danger for doing that.   Then he began to get threats from the terrorists in Iraq. He is an  Iraqi. His wife was in danger. His children were in danger. He came  January 5. Again, had President Trump and his evil order--and that is  what it is, it is evil--gone into effect January 1, for all we know  Mohammed would have died for helping our soldiers.   Do we have to prevent terrorists from coming into America?  Absolutely.   The greatest source of terror are lone wolves. Americans, citizens-- ISIS gets its evil ideas in their heads, and they do terrorist things.   John McCain, my colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona who is an  expert on this stuff, said: This Executive order will encourage and  increase the number of lone wolves.   Here is another group that needs tightening, I would suggest to the  President and his minions: those available in the Visa Waiver Program.  If you are a country that has generally been friendly to us, there is  something called the Visa Waiver Program, which means you can come into  this country with very few questions asked, very little vetting.   Refugees are vetted for 2 years. That is why not a single refugee  from any of the countries that were proscribed by the President has  committed an act of terror here--not a single one.   I heard someone defending the President saying: Well, all these  people would have come in; the terrorists would have come in had they  done it slowly and announced a date.   Well, we have done it like this for 15, 20 years, and we haven't had  a single terrorist come in. What kind of absurdity is that?   Anyway, the Visa Waiver Program allows people from, say, France and  Belgium to come into this country with few questions asked. We have  seen French citizens, Belgian citizens do terrorism. They would be  allowed to come into this country to do it here. Why aren't we  tightening that up? That is what should be done.   So I am going to conclude. The evening is late.   Sally Yates was a profile in courage, a profile in courage. Maybe  some of her courage, her insight, and her wisdom would rub off on the  people in the White House. Maybe they will back off and repeal this  Executive order, and then we can work together and truly try to tighten  up the laws, the actions of the administration to prevent terrorists  from coming in.   This Executive order makes us less safe. It was poorly done in a  slipshod, quick way that foretells real trouble in the White House,  and, most of all, it has done more to tarnish the great American dream,  the great moral force of America that has, in part, made us the  greatest country in the world--in 1, 2 days, undoing the work of  generations.   Please, Mr. President, reconsider. Really think about this. Don't  just tweet. Don't just get mad. Don't just call names. Think about it.  Change it. Repeal it.   It is too far gone to change; we have to repeal it. And then maybe we  can work together on tightening up some of the areas that I have talked  about.   I see my friend from Arizona has come to the floor, and I will not  hold him up, so I yield the floor.                            ____________________
