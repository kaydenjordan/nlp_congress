 Mr. Speaker, we are one week away from the  open enrollment period--an opportunity for Americans to purchase health  insurance for 2018.   President Trump ended the cost sharing reduction--the CSR--payments,  which reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income working families.   A Congressional Budget Office analysis says ending these payments  would likely increase premiums by 20 percent next year and by 25  percent by 2020.   In the Senate, there is a bipartisan agreement, led by Senators  Alexander and Murray, to stabilize the marketplaces by funding the CSR  payments and increase resources for open enrollment outreach.   Last night, unfortunately, a couple of the Members in the majority  added partisan objectives to the bill, cutting mandates, which will  keep costs low, and adding anti-abortion restrictions to CSR payments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the majority to drop the poison pills and work  with Democrats to bring the Alexander-Murray bill to the floor as soon  as possible to stabilize markets and lower costs for American families.  The failure to fix the health reform will cause millions of Americans  to lose healthcare, and, that is, ``No Care TrumpCare.''                            ____________________
