 Mr. Speaker, during my 27 years in law enforcement, I  fought many threats to our families. But today, I have to say that I am  ashamed that our leaders now say that those families are the threat.   Families seeking asylum are not a threat. Toddlers and children at  the border are not a threat. Dreamers who are brought here as young  children, both of us know, are not a threat.   Mr. Speaker, I ask: Why is it so easy to reject those who we believe  are different from us? We will not allow this administration to make  America a country that only accepts the rich and well-connected. When  we know better, we are supposed to do better.   And so I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you are  right, let's stop playing politics. Let's do better and reject this  dangerous piece of legislation.
