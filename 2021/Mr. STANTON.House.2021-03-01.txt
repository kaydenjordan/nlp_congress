 Madam Speaker, last week, we mourned half a million  American lives lost to the coronavirus. Their absence in our  communities is difficult to comprehend.   Sadly, many are facing the reality that it has now been more than a  year without their loved ones. Tragically, many of them died alone,  without loved ones to say good-bye.   To honor and memorialize those lost and those impacted by the virus,  I introduced a resolution designating the first Monday in March as  COVID-19 Victims and Survivors Memorial Day. Commemorating this  memorial day is an important marker for all those affected across the  country and to help our country heal from this trauma.   In my home State, this day of recognition has been pushed by two  advocates who lost their fathers to COVID-19. Kristin Urquiza and Tara  Krebbs turned their grief into action and have mobilized more than 100  cities and multiple States to recognize today as a memorial day.   Long after our Nation moves beyond this ordeal, we will need to  collectively recognize all that we have lost and the trauma of what we  have experienced.   Together, we can overcome.                            ____________________
