 Madam Speaker, today this Chamber is pushing through  the most partisan, baseless Articles of Impeachment in our history.   House Democrats' hyperpartisan impeachment has been a sham since day  one, driven by those whose bitter rage against President Trump has  blinded their better judgment.   The fact is they resolved to overturn the results of the 2016  election the day President Trump won. Earlier this year, Speaker Pelosi  said: ``Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's  something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think  we should go down that path.''   None of those standards have been met--none.   The committee hearings were a scripted, substance-free, made-for-TV  show. They would be comedy if impeachment weren't so serious and grave.  Witnesses denied awareness of an impeachable offense. And because the  majority has failed to make the case for impeachment, there is no  bipartisanship.   Compelling? Overwhelming? Bipartisan? Speaker Pelosi has not met her  own criteria for impeachment, but here we are. Despite Democrats  testing and tweaking their impeachment message, the American people  have rejected it.   I will vote against this partisan impeachment sham. Let's get back to  the work that the American people sent us here to do on this sad day of  an impeachment charade.
