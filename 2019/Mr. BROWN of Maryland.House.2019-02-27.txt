 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 8. This  bill is long overdue. For too long, Congress has failed to end the  cycle of gun violence and death that too many families are now familiar  with.   In 2017 alone, 40,000 people died from gun violence. Congress did  nothing. Last year, five reporters at the Capital Gazette in my  district were murdered in cold blood in a mass shooting that took place  in their newsroom. Congress did nothing.   Gun violence is a crisis in our communities and a real national  emergency that will no longer be met with inaction.   For the first time since Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence  Prevention Act of 1994, we will pass a bill in pursuit of our effort to  protect our communities and end this scourge of gun violence.   The American people overwhelmingly want us to act. For the people, we  will pass universal background checks out of the House as our first  piece of comprehensive gun safety reform.   Mr. Chair, today is only the beginning.
