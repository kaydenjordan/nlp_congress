 Senator Lankford's amendment would eliminate the only  practical recourse for same-sex and interracial couples to protect  their marriages under the Respect for Marriage Act. It would create an  exemption far beyond current law for partnerships between government  and faith-based organizations, the latter of which continue to enjoy  robust religious liberty and conscience protections that remain intact  under the Respect for Marriage Act.   This amendment would upend a carefully negotiated, bipartisan  compromise that protects the interests of religious organizations and  individuals while affording the dignity of marriage recognition to  same-sex and interracial couples. I urge my colleagues to vote no.   I yield back.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6496     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the debate  be extended an additional minute so that I might recognize the leader  after my remarks.    Mr. President, I want to express, as did my colleague  Senator Collins, that there are many thanks to go around. I thank the  leader. I want to thank the original bill sponsors in the House and  Senate--Congressman Nadler and Senator Feinstein--and the team of  Senators Collins, Portman, Sinema, and Tillis for your unrelenting  commitment that has brought us to this final vote to pass the Respect  for Marriage Act.   I want to thank the advocates who have been fighting for marriage  equality for decades, and I want to recognize the millions of same-sex  and interracial couples who have truly made this moment possible by  living their true selves and changing the hearts and minds of people  around this country.   Many of these same-sex and interracial couples are fearful. They are  worried that the rights, responsibilities, and freedoms they enjoy  through civil marriage could be stripped away. Right now, the Senate  has the opportunity to put those fears to rest and give millions of  people in same-sex and interracial marriages the certainty, dignity,  and respect they need and deserve. By passing this bill, we are showing  that the American Government and people see them and respect them.   I encourage all my colleagues to vote yes on the Respect for Marriage  Act and move our country forward.   I yield to our leader.
