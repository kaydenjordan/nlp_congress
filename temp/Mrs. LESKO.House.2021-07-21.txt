 Madam Speaker, I want to talk about the border. I live in  a border State. I have been to the border a number of times. But last  week, I got to go to the border again in Nogales, Arizona. I can attest  firsthand that there is a crisis at our border.   I talked to Customs and Border Patrol agents and other officials, and  they all have said that this is the worst that they have seen it in  their entire career, and some of them have worked for 30 years for  Customs and Border Protection.   I went down in a tunnel with the CBP officers, and it smelled. There  was trash everywhere. And these Customs and Border Protection officers  have to monitor the tunnels for human trafficking, sex trafficking, and  drug trafficking.                                time  1645    At one of the ports of entry in Nogales, the Mariposa port of entry,  they have seized, in the first 12 days of July, 500,000 fentanyl pills.  Do you know how many people that can kill?   I call on the Biden administration to do something about the border  crisis. The policies that he has set forth are causing this problem.   I visited parts of the border fence where there are just big  openings, but the material is laying there right on the ground. We have  already paid for it. This is insanity. It is total insanity.   I also heard that the Biden administration wants to repeal title 42,  which is the one thing that is causing it from being more of a  disaster.   Madam Speaker, I ask Mr. Biden, Kamala Harris, Democrats, please help  us secure the border.
