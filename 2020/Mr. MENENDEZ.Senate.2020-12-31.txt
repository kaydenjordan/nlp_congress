 Mr. President, I rise with grave concern to speak about  the troubling political situation in Uganda in the runup to that  country's elections on January 14 and to call on President Museveni to  take immediate action to stop the country's downward political spiral.   Uganda has been an important if not critical security and  counterterrorism partner to the United States for well over a decade,  playing a prominent role in the African Union's Mission to Somalia and  hosting over 1.4 million refugees. Its leadership and influence in East  Africa and the African continent writ large is difficult to overstate.  However, these are troubling times in Uganda, and longstanding efforts  to advance its democracy are now in peril.   National elections in Uganda have not met internationally accepted  standards for free and fair polls since 1996, when they were held for  the first time after a long-running conflict that brought President  Museveni to power. For decades, Museveni's ruling National Resistance  Party, NRM, has leveraged access to and influence over  [[Page S7992]]  state resources and institutions to tilt the electoral balance in its  favor. These efforts are not new. Under President Museveni's  leadership, the NRM successfully moved to change the Ugandan  Constitution in 2005 to remove Presidential term limits and again in  and 2017 to lift age limits. These changes allow President Museveni,  who has been in power since 1986, to remain in office indefinitely. Not  only have Museveni and the NRM engineered a constitutional coup, they  have undertaken a campaign of political repression that has only become  worse since the last general elections. Ugandan authorities have  increasingly used coercive measures, including arbitrary arrests and  detentions, torture, extrajudicial killings, and intrusive surveillance  technology to intimidate and silence critics, place a strangle hold on  media, and stifle political opposition in the country.   Leading opposition figures have been targeted in brazen and shocking  ways. Members of Parliament have been arrested and detained on numerous  occasions, and there is strong evidence to support their claims of  being tortured by President Museveni's security forces while in  custody. Last week, prominent human rights attorney Nicholas Opiyo,  along with several other attorneys, was arrested in what appears to be  a blatant act of intimidation for their investigation into killings  that occurred as a result of the arrest of rival Presidential candidate  Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu in November. Just this past weekend, one of  Kyagulanyi's bodyguards was killed by security forces in a violent  confrontation that also saw two journalists injured. Imagine that  happening to any political candidate here in the United States to one  of our colleagues as they were out on the campaign trail this fall. We  should all be outraged by such acts.   To date there have been no meaningful investigations into these  incidents and no accountability for these abuses. The question we must  ask ourselves is, Why? Why has President Museveni failed to take swift  and decisive action to ensure the safety and security of members of the  Ugandan Parliament and other opposition figures, and bring those  responsible to justice? Is President Museveni protecting particular  individuals? Or perhaps direct responsibility for the violence against  the Uganda opposition lies even further up the chain of command?   Journalists and nongovernmental organizations have been under  pressure as well. Ugandan authorities continue to use a range of  restrictive and onerous administrative measures against NGOs, including  deregistration of more than 12,000 mostly local NGOs in November 2019.  Earlier this month, Ugandan authorities froze the bank accounts of some  NGOs, and in the past, the Museveni administration has denied entry and  deported some leaders of international NGOs in what were clear acts of  intimidation. Journalists working for foreign media outlets are now  required to reregister with Ugandan authorities or risk criminal  penalties, and some foreign journalists have also been deported from  the country.   Government has also attacked digital rights and academic freedoms.  Individuals with large social media followings are subject to onerous  administrative regulation. Burdensome taxes have been imposed on social  media users, and some individuals who have criticized the Museveni  administration on social media platforms have even been prosecuted.  Ugandan authorities have taken repeated action to suppress academic  freedom and intimidate students and faculty who have been critical of  the Museveni administration, including by firing and jailing professors  who criticize the regime.   In short, the longstanding effort to build democracy in Uganda is  under grave threat, and we must take action in support of those  defending political freedoms in the country. That is why I introduced  S. Res 807. It not only condemns the actions of the Museveni  administration, it calls on the Secretary of State and the heads of  relevant departments and agencies of the U.S. Government to undertake  three essential actions: first, to consider the imposition of targeted  sanctions and visa restrictions on actors involved in undermining  credible, transparent elections, and those who have perpetrated or  abetted human rights abuses; second, to work with African partners,  like-minded countries, and international institutions and organizations  to develop and implement strategies and actions to promote and defend  human, civil, and political rights and multiparty democracy in Uganda;  and third, to immediately conduct a review of U.S. assistance and  cooperation with Uganda for the purposes of reprioritizing such  assistance should neutral observers determine that the January 2021  polls do not meet internationally accepted standards for credible  elections.   If the outcome of the elections in Uganda does not reflect the will  of the people, I will be calling for the Biden administration to  reevaluate our relationship with the Museveni administration, and I  plan to pursue binding legislation in the 117th Congress that builds on  S Res 807. Uganda's stature and importance as a security partner should  not prevent the United States from speaking out in support of democracy  and taking action in support of those Ugandans fighting for democratic  freedoms.                            ____________________
