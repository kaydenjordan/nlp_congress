 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  AFSCME which states this bill would cause millions to lose their health  coverage and return to the days when even inadequate coverage was  unaffordable.                                                         AFSCME,                                                        May 3, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million working       and retiree members of the American Federation of State,       County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to       express our continuing opposition to the American Health Care       Act (AHCA), notwithstanding the addition of the Upton       amendment.        The harm that AHCA will impose on ordinary Americans is       breathtaking in scope. As the Congressional Budget Office has       detailed, 24 million will lose their health care coverage.       The Medicaid program will be cut by $839 billion and       restructured, ending the guarantee that the federal       government will fund a specified share of state Medicaid       costs. The bill makes coverage more expensive, especially for       lower-income families and older workers and it undermines the       financial strength of Medicare. And the MacArthur amendment       makes a very bad bill worse by allowing states to opt out of       Affordable Care Act protections that ensure that people with       pre-existing conditions will be able to obtain comprehensive,       affordable health care. Moreover, the MacArthur amendment       would allow insurance companies to re-impose caps on annual       and lifetime limits, even in employer-sponsored coverage,       putting the health care of those with catastrophic illnesses       or injuries at risk.        Under the Upton amendment, grants to states that could be       used for high-risk pools will be increased by 6% or $8       billion over five years. This is a paltry increase. Even the       conservative Mercatus Center described the increase as a       ``pittance.'' High-risk pools would still be grossly       underfunded, even if states put all of the $138 billion in       grant funding into them. We urge the Congress not to ignore       the previous experience with state high-risk pools. By       segregating those with pre-existing conditions into separate       coverage we know they will face higher premiums, benefit       exclusions, annual and lifetime limits on coverage and       waiting lists.        It is unacceptable that this bill eliminates $500 billion       in taxes on the wealthiest 2%, health insurers,       pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device makers, while       taking health care away from millions. Moreover, the bill       retains the 40% tax on high cost health plans, which will       undermine employer-sponsored insurance for working families       by hollowing out coverage and increasing out-of-pocket       expenses, although it delays the implementation for six       years.        The bottom line is that this bill would cause millions to       lose their health coverage. Most of those with pre-existing       conditions would return to the days when even inadequate       coverage was unaffordable. The bill would drive up costs for       those who are older and lower-income, shift costs to states,       fail to protect employer-sponsored coverage, weaken public       health and undermine the solvency of the Medicare trust fund       all the while providing tax cuts for the wealthy and well-      connected.        The priorities demonstrated by this bill are upside down.       We urge you to oppose this bill.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this bill. We all  should. Protecting ACA is the top issue for my constituents.  Constituents like Leslie Gauthier who, without the protections of the  ACA, would not have gotten the treatment for leukemia that she was  diagnosed just at the age of 22.   Leslie is now in remission thanks to ObamaCare. For Leslie, the ACA  protections like essential health benefits were a matter of life and  death. This Republican bill would destroy those patient protections.   Under the ACA in my district: a 5-percent drop in uninsured rates;  subsidies based on income and region and not on age; Medicaid Expansion  covering of 156,000 people will be lost.   The President promised not to cut Medicaid. This bill guts it by $880  billion. This bill is a gut punch to America. Pregnant women seeking  health care, kicked to the curb. Patients with preexisting conditions,  kicked to the curb. Senior citizens who will have to pay more for less,  kicked to curb. Over 24 million people, including 6.5 million Latinos,  kicked to the curb.   Mr. Speaker, we demand Republicans stop kicking to the curb  Americans. Stop this bill.
