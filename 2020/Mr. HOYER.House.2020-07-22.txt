 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the words of the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho). They were appropriate because the language we use  matters. The way we treat one another matters.   Mr. Yoho needed no apology for his passion about poverty and for the  downtrodden, but he ought to remember and acknowledge that the person  to whom he spoke so inappropriately was one of the strongest fighters  in this Congress for those with the least, those who are downtrodden,  those who are forgotten.   Mr. Speaker, the apology was appropriate. I hope that Mr. Yoho feels  that apology sincerely, and I hope all of us will take a lesson to  think before we speak so harshly to one another.   This country is a divided country. There are some of us who believe  that our Chief Executive uses harsh language and inappropriate language  directed at some of our citizens. We ought not to replicate that  conduct.   The apology was appropriate. I know that our colleague, Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez, appreciates that apology, but let us treat one another  with the respect and dignity each of us deserves not only as a Member  of this body, but as a human being.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it has been nearly 4 weeks since the House  passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Leader McConnell and  the Republican-led Senate, however, refuse to call it up for  consideration or a vote. Meanwhile, the problem of racial injustice is  not going away on its own.   For millions of Americans, this issue is deeply personal, having  experienced racial bias in our justice system firsthand. Most police  officers, Madam Speaker, are trying hard to do their job  [[Page H3624]]  professionally and serve their communities well, and there are so many  exemplary officers committed to addressing head-on the inherent bias  and the problems in the culture of policing that lead some to commit  acts of misconduct.   Still, millions of people live in fear simply because of the color of  their skin and because of the history of police misconduct against  African Americans in our country.   Madam Speaker, we must never accept this norm. Indeed, in his last  public appearance, John Lewis visited Black Lives Matter Plaza in  Washington and then encouraged Americans to stand up for social  justice. He said this: ``We must continue to be bold, brave,  courageous, push and pull till we redeem the soul of America and move  closer to a community at peace with itself.''   His wise words continue to inspire Americans to be courageous in  standing up, speaking out, and working to lift our country up to the  highest of our ideals.   In order to make sure that all voices are being heard in Congress and  in this national discourse, I launched a website to make it easier for  Americans to share their own stories, learn about the legislation we  passed, and share their thoughts on our bill. It is a platform for  people to contribute to this work of redeeming the soul of America, as  John Lewis urged us to do. That site is JusticeinPolicing.us.   Already, Madam Speaker, thousands of Americans from nearly every  State have visited the site, and many have shared their own wrenching  stories about why we need to pass this bill.   One woman in my district wrote about how, as the mother of 2 young  Black men, she worries every day about them encountering the police.  That should not be the case in America. That isn't good for families.  It isn't good for the police. It isn't good for our communities. And as  I said, it is not good for our country.   Another wrote about how her elderly parents were pulled over in  Oklahoma because the officer couldn't believe that her African-American  father was married to her White mother. Both were in their eighties.  That was just 3 years ago.   One person from Iowa posted about being a lifelong Republican who is  tired of her party's failure to tackle police misconduct and systemic  racism in our country. That person is right. And it is not Republicans  alone whom I am sure she is concerned with.   The Senate could act today on the George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act. The Senate ought to act today. But it is sitting on Leader  McConnell's desk or someplace else gathering dust while our site  continues to gather stories of real lives impacted by these injustices.   Madam Speaker, I hope Americans will continue to speak out and give  compelling and concrete examples of why action is necessary.   And I might say, we need to speak out on the extraordinarily good  actions that are taken by our law enforcement officers as well. We need  to be balanced. But we do not need to be balanced to the extent of  ignoring the carnage that has occurred because of the color of skin.  These stories need to be told.   In his very powerful New York Times column last month on the five  crises facing America at this moment in our history, the  extraordinarily insightful David Brooks wrote: ``All Americans, but  especially White Americans, are undergoing a rapid education on the  burdens African Americans carry every day. This education,'' he said,  ``is continuing, but already, public opinion is shifting with  astonishing speed.'' It is right that it does so.   The more we hear of the stories of personal experiences with systemic  bias, the better equipped we will be as a Nation to confront this  challenge together. As more people visit JusticeinPolicing.us to speak  up and support this bill, I will be sharing their names and stories  with this House and its Members, making sure that Members hear from  their constituents on this issue.   We are the people's House. We are the people's voice. We are the  protectors of democracy, yes, of our Constitution and our laws, but the  soul and character of our country are in our hands as well.   As long as people of color continue to face dangerous and deadly  systemic bias in our country, we will not stop pushing for the reforms  that are so sorely needed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I came in at the end of my friend from Louisiana's  discussion. I have great respect for Mr. Graves and I have great  respect for his concern, but, very frankly, the things he talks about  have been pending in the United States Senate for 60 days untended.   The leader of the Senate said the States can go bankrupt. The sense  of priority apparently does not exist there, and that is regrettable.   This legislation that I rise in support of is an important piece of  legislation. If, however, it displaced any of those priorities of which  the gentleman spoke, I would perhaps share his opinion. We are waiting  for some of those priorities to be attended to by the Senate, even if  they defeat them.   We have talked about healthcare. We have talked about equal rights.  We have talked about campaign finance reform. We have talked about  energy. We have talked about so many subjects that are pending silently  untended in the United States Senate. So the wringing of hands about  this legislation pressing out other priorities I think is not accurate.   It is accurate that this is an important piece of legislation that  will do much good. And I thank Chairman Grijalva on the Committee on  Natural Resources for steering the legislation before us through his  committee and working with the Senate to get it passed through that  body.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the ranking member for his concern about  the maintenance and upkeep of our parks. He and I have spoken about  that.   I would especially like to thank Representatives Cummings, Sherrill--  [[Page H3651]]  who just spoke before me--Congressman Cox, Congresswoman Torres Small,  Congresswoman Horn, and Congressman Golden for leading this legislation  in the House, along with my good friend  Mike Simpson from the State of  Idaho.   It should be noted that the bill before us today bears the name of  our dear and departed friend John Lewis, who understood that conserving  America's great outdoors and public spaces went part and parcel with  protecting the legacy of civil rights.   Mr. Speaker, he was, as you know, instrumental in protecting the  childhood home, neighborhoods, and church associated with Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr., in Atlanta--one of America's great leaders--as part  of our National Park System, using the Land and Water Conservation Fund  as a critical tool in that process.   The Ebenezer Baptist Church and its visitor center are among the many  sites in need of repair today. It was, of course, in Ebenezer in  Atlanta, in 1957, that a young John Lewis joined Dr. King and other  civil rights pioneers to create the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference. What an eerie and poignant coincidence the bill before us  is numbered 1957.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to think that John is still here with us,  guiding us forward in spirit to continue on the good work he started in  Congress some 30 years ago.   Last year, when we enacted a permanent reauthorization of the Land  and Water Conservation Fund--a great accomplishment of this Congress  and, yes, this President--we made it clear that doing so was only the  first of a two-step process.   The second step was making sure that the Land and Water Conservation  Fund is permanently paid for. That is what this bill does today, with  nearly $1 billion annually in mandatory spending to sustain the fund  and support critical Federal, State, and local conservation projects  across this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, not only that, but the bill creates a new fund that will  help address the maintenance backlog in protecting some of our most  iconic national parks. The impact of these investments will be felt not  only in tourism and improved public access to our public lands, but  also in a cleaner and healthier environment over the long term.    In my home State of Maryland, we have used the fund to protect some  of our most historic sites, protecting nature so that every American  might have the same opportunity to enjoy the sanctity of nature or  contact with our history.   I was personally proud to have worked to protect the watershed and  the viewshed of George Washington's Mount Vernon site permanently  through the creation of Piscataway Park on our side, Maryland's side,  of the river.   We also used the fund to protect the Patuxent Research Refuge  established to support wildlife research, Douglas Point in Nanjemoy,  and countless sites throughout the Chesapeake Bay region.   In all, Maryland has received, over the years, over $230 million from  the Land and Water Conservation Fund to preserve our State's most  treasured landscape and historic places.   Mr. Speaker, this bill before us passed the Senate on a strong  bipartisan vote 73-25--in other words, three-quarters of the United  States Senate--and I believe we will demonstrate, hopefully, similar  overwhelming support in the House later today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join in making this  critical investment in America's public lands that will conserve them  for the enjoyment of generations to come. I ask them to join me, as  well, in helping to secure the legacy of our friend   John Lewis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina,  the former Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, for yielding.   I am glad that I was on the floor to hear the remarks of the ranking  member, Mr. Davis. I am going to bring up a quote. I won't get it soon  enough to read right now, but I will read it.   David Brooks wrote a column in the New York Times and he said we were  facing five crises in America. One, of course, the pandemic.   He said the second crisis was the crisis of confronting racism and  the history of racism and slavery and segregation in our country.   The observation he made was that Americans, post-George Floyd, have  been riveted on the recognition of our past and the recognition of our  present, and how we need to improve the treatment and the reality of  equality in America.                                time  1445    I think Brooks' observation will be proved today on the floor, Mr.  Speaker, as we come together not in partisan  [[Page H3662]]  disagreement but in unity of purpose, recognizing that our conscience  and the conscience of America has also been pricked by the loss of John  Lewis, who all his life fought for equality.   Mr. Speaker, the Capitol Building is a sacred space for our American  democracy. It is where we write our laws, inaugurate our Presidents,  and say a somber farewell to great Americans who earned our respect,  like Dwight Eisenhower, other Presidents, and Rosa Parks.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot erase the difficult history and painful truth  that this temple to liberty was built using the labor of enslaved  people. But we can, Mr. Speaker, do everything in our power to ensure  that how we use the Capitol today reflects our commitment to equality  and justice for all.   For too long, we have greeted visitors from here and abroad with the  statues of those who denigrated these values by championing sedition,  slavery, segregation, and inequality.   As a Marylander, I have always been uncomfortable that the Old  Supreme Court Chamber prominently displays a bust of former Chief  Justice Roger Brooke Taney, who was from my district, as a matter of  fact, the county across the river from my house, Calvert County.   Taney, of course, was the son of slaveholders and the author of the  1857 Dred Scott ruling that upheld slavery and said that African  Americans could not be citizens. This was a man, Mr. Speaker, who, in  his zeal to protect the interests of slaveholders and uphold a system  of white supremacy, wrote an opinion that twisted the very meaning of  America's founding.   After quoting the Declaration of Independence, ``We hold these truths  to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,'' Taney wrote this:  ``The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the whole human  family, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day,''  meaning 1857, ``would be so understood.'' He went on to say: ``But it  is too clear for dispute that the enslaved African race were not  intended to be included and formed no part of the people who framed and  adopted this declaration.'' Of course, neither did women.   In short, Mr. Speaker, Taney argued that, in his day, in 1857, people  of African descent had come to be seen as human beings, but because our  Founders in 1776 did not view them as such, Black people could never  truly be citizens of the United States.   What he was saying, Mr. Speaker, was that Black lives did not matter.  And so, Mr. Speaker, when we hear that phrase today, that Black lives  matter, it is fundamental to what America is and has become.   Sadly, Roger Brooke Taney--respected in his time, the attorney  general of my State, the Attorney General of the United States, the  Acting Secretary of the Treasury--could not extricate himself from the  false premises of the past.   Abraham Lincoln was, as Mr. Davis pointed out, outraged at the  decision he wrote, arguably, as my friend the Justice said earlier  today, the worst case in the history of the Supreme Court of the United  States.   In short, Taney argued that people of African descent had come to be  seen as human beings, but because our Founders did not view them as  such, Black people could never truly be citizens of our country. Think  of that, the blindness and schizophrenia of 1787 repeated 80 years  later in 1857.   One of the great facets of America is that we can grow. We change,  and we can accommodate to better knowledge, better insight, and better  inclinations. The past, Taney argued, bound those in the present to  follow the errors of their forebears in perpetuity. Let us reject that  premise out of hand lest the more perfect Union will never be  attainable.   What he could not or would not accept is that the passage of time  allows us the space to grow as individuals, as States, and as a country  so that we may see our faults and correct them, not repeat them.   In Maryland, we have grappled with that difficult history of our  State with regard to slavery and the Civil War. While our State did not  secede from the Union, many Marylanders sympathized with slavery in the  South and fought for the Confederacy.   Mr. Speaker, I represent what was the largest slaveholding area of  the State of Maryland. We grew tobacco and some cotton, but mainly  tobacco. Early Maryland was built on the profits of slavery, and it  sent individuals like Taney to serve in America's earliest  institutions. Indeed, in his infamous decision, he drew on his home  State's ban of interracial marriage as justification for his views.   One of the ironies, Mr. Speaker, is that I was elected to the  Maryland State Senate in 1966, and one of my first votes in January  1967 as a Maryland State senator at the age of 27 was to vote to repeal  the miscegenation statutes in my State. Of course, the Supreme Court  had ruled on that before, but we still had not repealed it 110 years  after Dred Scott.   Maryland today, like other States where slavery and segregation had a  long history, is not the same place that it was when Taney wrote his  opinion, nor are these States today the same places they were when many  of the statues and busts of Confederates and segregationists were sent  here to our Capitol during a period of intense and racially charged  sectionalism.   In recent years, Maryland made the courageous and correct choice to  remove a statue of Taney from the grounds of the statehouse in  Annapolis. I strongly supported that decision, as did our Republican  Governor, Mr. Hogan, and our Democratic legislature.   Removing a statue--as my dear friend of over one-half century, Mr.  Clyburn, observed on this floor--does not erase history. That act by  itself will not make right what was so terribly wrong in the past. But  the statues we choose to set in places of honor are a reflection of the  present, not the past. They show our fellow American and foreign  visitors what our values are today.   Our decision to remove statues of seditionists, white supremacists,  Confederates, and segregationists and replace them with defenders of  justice and equality shows that, as a country, we are capable of  critical introspection and growth.    That is our strength. That is the glory of America: working toward a  more perfect Union.   That is why I introduced this bill along with Representative Lee,  Whip Clyburn, Chairwoman Bass, and Chairman Thompson, who sits in the  chair today. That itself is a historic demonstration of the change that  we have wrought. Not only could a Black man from Mississippi be a  Member of the Congress, but he can preside over the Congress. He  matters, and his life matters.   Taney was wrong because, in the 21st century, we must not be Roger  Brooke Taney's America anymore, nor can we be Jim Crow's.   Our bill removes the bust of Chief Justice Taney from the Old Supreme  Court Chamber and replaces it with a bust of Thurgood Marshall, a son  of Baltimore. The irony is the Taney statue was on the east front of  the Capitol, Mr. Speaker. If you turned around and went through the  Capitol 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years, if you went through about  500 feet and walked out on the west front, you walked into Thurgood  Marshall Memorial, as you would today. He was our first African- American Justice.   How appropriate it is that we honor him in place of Roger Brooke  Taney. Thurgood Marshall is the face of our Maryland in 2020, not Roger  Taney.   Second, our bill no longer allows States to display statues in the  Capitol of individuals who voluntarily served the Confederacy against  our Union during the Civil War.   Let me just say as an aside that none of us are perfect. Our Founders  weren't perfect, but what our Founders did was create a union. The  statues we are removing tried to destroy a union.   Third, there are three specific statues in the collection of  individuals who did not serve in the Confederacy but whose careers were  built on the perpetuation of White supremacy and segregation. Our bill  would require those statues to be removed and replaced as well, as my  friend, Jim Clyburn, said, not destroyed. We urge nobody to tear down  statues--to remove them, yes; to destroy them, no.   They do not reflect the diversity and inclusivity of our Nation  today, nor do they comport with our values as a nation that has reached  a greater understanding of the principles enshrined in the Declaration  of Independence, that all are created equal, and humankind,  [[Page H3663]]  Taney admitted in 1857, would have been the understanding of that  phrase. There are still, sadly, a lot of people in our country in 2020  who do not understand that our diversity is our strength or recognize  clearly that Black lives matter.   Taney forcefully argued they did not. He was willfully wrong. They  do, and they must. I believe that most Americans are deeply distressed  by racial injustice and want to see the progress of the civil rights  movement continue. They want our Nation and our democracy to grow,  mature, and become more perfect. Part of that process is making it  clear through our symbols and public displays of honor what our country  stands for and, as importantly, what it must never stand for again.   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join us not as an expression of partisan opinion but an expression of  America's values to our citizens and to the world that we do not  glorify racism, bigotry, and exclusion in the temple to liberty and in  the land of the free.   I hope our colleagues will join in making possible and making sure  that all Americans, no matter their race, can come to this Capitol and  know that they have an equal share in a government that is truly of the  people, by the people, and for the people.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Some in my generation remember the song ``Abraham, Martin and John.''  Then, of course, there was Bobby. All four were taken from us far too  early in their lives.   God blessed each of us, this institution, and this country by giving  to John Lewis health for eight decades. He used that health and  strength, mind and body, to serve his God, his faith, his country, and  his people.   I can say that John Lewis was my friend, but then again, we could all  say that John Lewis was our friend and be right in that claim because  John Lewis was a person who loved his fellow human beings.   So many of you have heard me refer to John Lewis as the most  Christlike person I have ever met. He was human, and he represented the  best of humanity and all the positive attributes that humanity can  summon. That is why you hear from both sides of the aisle, from all  ideologies, from people of different colors, different races, different  genders, different nationalities, and perhaps even different  languages--certainly, different languages--for he was not just an  American--though proud he was of that appellation--he was a citizen of  humanity.    Jim Clyburn said a little earlier today that we hear about Gandhi,  and we talk about Christian values, but no one we know has lived and  breathed who was those attributes, not that he believed in them or  talked about them, but he embodied the best attributes that are in us  all.   We have a short time because time is limited, and so many want to  speak because they were touched by John Lewis, because they were  inspired by John Lewis, and because they were motivated and uplifted by  John Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, how lucky we are to be able to say that John Lewis was  our friend. I knew John Lewis. John Lewis made a personal difference in  my life and the lives of millions of other people who may not even know  the name of John Lewis.                                time  2015    Mr. Speaker, if I had another hour or another day or another week, I  would not run out of good things to say about John Lewis. But his life  and his contributions need no elevation from me or any others, for his  life is a book of goodness, of courage, of commitment, of vision, and  of great accomplishment.   We sing the song ``God Bless America,'' and God blessed America and  the world with John Robert Lewis.   Thank you, Lord.
