 Mr. Speaker, this bill is not about addressing fraud. My  home State of Pennsylvania is already fighting fraud with the American  Rescue Plan funds that support new positions at American Job Centers.   This bill targets innocent workers who have no idea that their State  made mistakes in paying their unemployment benefits.   This bill targets innocent workers whose emergency benefits kept  their households afloat.   The bill targets innocent workers who went back to work as soon as  they could and often for lower pay.   I urge my colleagues to let States focus on real fraud and protect  innocent workers by voting against this bill.
