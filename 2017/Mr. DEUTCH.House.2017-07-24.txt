 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the important work of  the Paralysis Resource Center at the Christopher and Dana Reeve  Foundation.   Christopher Reeve put a face on spinal cord injury and had an  unrelenting drive to pursue the best research in the world. It was his  vision, it was his passion, and it was his brilliance that attracted  young scientists to take on the cause and advance the field of spinal  cord research.   And while his wife, Dana, was universally known as the model for  caregiving, her real legacy is the creation of the foundation's  Paralysis Resource Center that has reached so many of those living with  paralysis and their families with life-changing resources.   The President's budget eliminates all funding for the Paralysis  Resource Center and suggests that the program is duplicative.  Fortunately, my colleagues in the House appreciate the unique nature of  the work that the PRC does.   The PRC consists of a variety of services, communities, and programs,  including:   Information specialists trained to help anyone, from newly paralyzed  individuals and their family members to persons who have lived with  disabilities for quite some time, by providing individualized support  and information;   The Peer and Family Support Program, which builds peer-to-peer  connections to help individuals find support and resources among the  communities that best understand the day-to-day realities and long-term  challenges of individuals living with paralysis;   The Quality of Life Grants Program, which has awarded over 2,900  grants, totaling more than $22 million, to broaden the impact of  nonprofits across the country that foster community engagement and  involvement while promoting health and wellness for individuals living  with paralysis; and   The Military and Veterans Program, the MVP, which supports the unique  needs of current servicemembers and veterans regardless of when they  served or how their injury was obtained.   I urge my colleagues to reach out to the Paralysis Resource Center to  learn of the important work that they are doing for vulnerable  constituents in their districts. If you do, you can see that the PRC is  so much more than a line item in a budget. It is more than dollars and  cents. It is more than just another program.   The value of these programs can only be appreciated when you learn  the stories of the thousands of Americans that the PRC has helped with  their services. Tonight, I would like to tell some of those stories. It  is through these stories that we can see the amazing work of the  Paralysis Resource Center, the lasting legacy of Christopher and Dana  Reeve, and the bright future of so many who have been served through  the PRC's programs.   You will notice that, throughout these stories, you hear the same  names pop up again and again. That is because the PRC builds community  and it builds connections.   When a spinal cord injury leaves Americans with no place else to  turn, the PRC steps in to help guide the way; and, in return, many of  those who have benefited from PRC turn back and look to help others  with spinal cord injuries, to support their journey of recovery and  rehabilitation.   Mr. Speaker, in order to move forward and to tell these stories, I  would like to start by yielding to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Langevin), my friend, who will share some thoughts with us now.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Rhode Island,  Representative Langevin. I thank him for his leadership here in the  House on these important issues.   But just as you spoke about your friends Christopher and Dana Reeve  and talked specifically about how Christopher Reeve was not quiet and  introverted, that he was an inspiration to you, I think it is fair to  say, and I am comfortable actually speaking in this one instance on  behalf of my colleagues here in the House in saying that just as  Christopher Reeve was an incredible leader and an inspiration to you,  so, too, Representative Langevin, are you an inspiration to all of us  in the House. I thank you for participating tonight.    There are so many other stories to tell. Representative Langevin  shared some. I would like to share just a few others.   One is the story of Eric LeGrand. On October 16, 2010, Rutgers  University football star Eric LeGrand sustained a spinal cord injury at  his C3 and C4 vertebrae.   After a kickoff in the fourth quarter against Army, Eric sprinted  down the field and he made the tackle, but after the collision, he  stayed down on the field at MetLife Stadium. Eric was paralyzed from  the neck down, and doctors gave him a zero to 5 percent chance of  regaining neurologic function.   From the moment he was injured, the Paralysis Resource Center was by  Eric's side with a wealth of services and support. To conquer the  immediate challenges of paralysis, his mother, Karen LeGrand, spoke  regularly with the PRC's information specialists, who provided a  roadmap of the resources that helped Eric transition to the Kessler  Institute for Rehabilitation in West Orange, New Jersey. At that point,  Eric was already exceeding expectations for his recovery and was weaned  off of his ventilator and his feeding tube.   To help his family understand the long-term realities of a spinal  cord injury, Eric and Karen were put in touch with Alan Brown, a dear  friend of mine I will speak more about in a bit. Alan is a certified  peer mentor and staff  [[Page H6209]]  member of the Reeve Foundation, and he offered advice from his own  personal experience living with quadriplegia for over 25 years.   Eric was also enrolled in the Reeve Foundation's NeuroRecovery  Network, the NRN. The NRN is a growing network of rehabilitation  centers that develop and provide cutting-edge therapies, like Locomotor  Training.   Thanks to the NRN therapies and Eric's determination, he recovered  the ability to move his neck and his shoulders. He has also improved  trunk, cardiovascular, and pulmonary control.   His quality of life, well-being, and health have dramatically  improved through the efforts of the PRC.   To pay forward his gratitude and help others, Eric founded Team  LeGrand of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation to speed the  development of treatments for spinal cord injury. Since its inception  in September 2013, Team LeGrand has raised close to $1 million.   Karen LeGrand was also inspired by her experience with the PRC, and  became a certified peer mentor to offer guidance and support to parents  who have children living with paralysis.   Elizabeth Forst is someone else whose story we should focus on. An  avid traveler and diver, Elizabeth ``E.B.'' Forst's life changed in  2014 when a dive into a swimming pool resulted in a C4-C5 spinal cord  injury.   In the aftermath of her injury, Elizabeth's family struggled with how  to move forward and to ensure that Elizabeth could still live life to  the fullest.   Her older brother, Tracy, reached out to the Reeve Foundation to tap  into the constellation of programs and resources offered by the  Paralysis Resource Center. He spoke with information specialists to get  a better understanding of his sister's condition and how his family  could help her adapt physically, emotionally, and socially to living  with a spinal cord injury.   Tracy also regularly referred to the Reeve Foundation's website to  educate himself on life after paralysis from both Elizabeth's  perspective and his role as her family member and caregiver.   Thankful for the support she received from the Paralysis Resource  Center, Elizabeth became a trained and certified peer mentor to help  fellow paralysis community members find beauty and joy after a life- changing injury.   She has also resumed her passion for diving and traveling, as well as  blogging for the Reeve Foundation to share her tips for traveling with  a disability. E.B. has said she still has a lot of travel destinations  on her list, and the PRC is surrounding her with support to make sure  she can continue to travel the world.   Denna Laing is someone else we should think about tonight. On  December 31, 2015, Denna Laing, a standout hockey player for the NWHL  Boston Pride, was playing in the Women's Winter Classic at Gillette  Stadium when she crashed headfirst into the boards and sustained a  spinal cord injury at her C5 vertebra.   While she was in the hospital, the Reeve Foundation mobilized a  network of support through the Paralysis Resource Center to help her  family understand the short-term and the long-term challenges of living  with paralysis.   They spoke with information specialists who provided tailored  assistance on transitioning Denna from the hospital to acute care, and  then adjusting to life back in her community.   Denna and her family connected with certified peer mentors like Alan  Brown, who offered support and guidance based on their own personal  experiences.   She is currently building up her strength and working to improve her  health by participating in a comprehensive therapy regime at Journey  Forward in Canton, Massachusetts, which is part of the Reeve  Foundation's NeuroRecovery Network.                                time  2045    Denna recently tackled the Boston Marathon with help from former NHL  player Bobby Carpenter, who pushed her racing wheelchair to the finish  line.   Known for her vibrant personality, she credits the support she  received from the Reeve Foundation and paralysis community as the  reason that she keeps smiling. In her words: ``I know the best of my  life has yet to come.''   J.D. Bruning and Kelly Lamb are from Arkansas. After graduating from  the University of Arkansas, J.D. was enjoying the warm weather with his  friends when they decided to take a float trip on a local river. Near  the end of the float trip, J.D. dove into what he thought was deep  water, but it was too shallow, and he sustained a high-level spinal  cord injury.   Since that life-changing moment over 4 years ago, J.D. and his family  have tapped into the wealth of resources provided by the Reeve  Foundation Paralysis Resource Center to help J.D. live a full and  active life in his community.   Given the scarcity of resources for the paralysis community in  Arkansas, the PRC was critical in establishing the best possible care  for J.D. and helping to navigate the path forward for his family.   His girlfriend, Kelly Lamb, was so inspired by the Reeve Foundation's  programs and mission that she ran both the Chicago and New York City  Marathons in 2016, under the Team Reeve banner, and raised over $20,000  to accelerate innovative research.   Kelly has cited the Paralysis Resource Center as a lifeline for  thousands of families impacted by paralysis in the State of Arkansas  and across the Nation.   Sabrina Cohen is from Florida. Born and raised in Miami Beach,  Sabrina sustained a C3-5 spinal cord injury in 1992, when a teenager  driver, who promised to give Sabrina a ride to a party, started drag  racing and, unfortunately, slammed into a tree. She was 14 years old,  and her life was changed forever.   When Sabrina was first injured, there was no centralized resource to  learn how to live with paralysis or connect with fellow community  members.   When the Reeve Foundation Paralysis Resource Center was founded in  2002, it became and since remains a lifesaving resource for 5.4 million  Americans living with paralysis from spinal cord injury, ALS, MS, spina  bifida, stroke, and cerebral palsy.   However, physical barriers still existed in Sabrina's community as  there was no beach in the Miami Beach area that was accessible to  wheelchair users. Through the Sabrina Cohen Foundation, she applied for  a Reeve Foundation Quality of Life Grant to fund her dream of a fully  accessible beach and playground for the disabled, including seniors,  veterans, and children with special needs.   The Quality of Life Grants Program is funded through the Paralysis  Resource Center and awards financial support to nonprofits that foster  greater health, quality of life, community involvement, and  independence for individuals living with paralysis and their  caregivers.   She made the most of a Quality of Life Grant to establish Miami  Beach's first-ever dedicated public beach with improved wheelchair  access and outdoor adaptive fitness and watersport activities.   Finally, I would like to talk about two other people, both also from  Florida, and both good friends of mine.   Alan Brown, I mentioned earlier. He is a resident of Aventura,  Florida, who was injured in 1988, at the age of 20, when his neck was  crushed by an ocean wave while on vacation in the Caribbean. The  accident caused a C5-6 spinal cord injury and left Alan a quadriplegic  with no movement below his chest.   For nearly 30 years since the accident, Alan and his family have,  through the Alan T. Brown Foundation to Cure Paralysis, provided  support, education, and advocacy for the paralysis community.   Initially, the focus for the foundation was on finding a cure for  paralysis, a magic bullet that would help everyone living with  paralysis to walk again. But after years in a wheelchair, and the  difficult challenges to overall health and emotional well-being that  paralysis presents, he and his family decided to overhaul the mission  of the foundation.   Today, they focus on improving the lives of people living with  paralysis through peer mentoring, outreach, and fundraising to help  others with basic needs like wheelchairs and ongoing medical care. And  now, Alan and his foundation have partnered with the Reeve Foundation  to extend the reach and impact of his message to the paralysis  community.  [[Page H6210]]    Alan travels the country on behalf of the Reeve Foundation to  advocate, to increase awareness, and to make an impact on the quality  of life of other people living with paralysis and their families.   He currently serves as manager of public impact at the Christopher &  Dana Reeve Foundation, and in this role, he focuses on extending the  reach of the foundation's impact on the greater public, creating new  opportunities for partnership with peer organizations, increasing the  visibility of PRC and other Reeve Foundation programs, bolstering  fundraising efforts, and developing the national Peer & Family Support  Program.   I have been with Alan and been inspired by him on a regular basis,  close up, and the work that he does in the paralysis community and for  those who are experiencing paralysis firsthand. The work that he does  at those early moments is extraordinary.   Finally, Shawn Friedkin, who is from my community in south Florida.  In March of 1992, Shawn was injured in a motor vehicle accident 2 weeks  before his 27th birthday. He was married with one child, and he spent  much of the early years following his injury working to increase  medical research funding for spinal cord injuries.   For his efforts, he was invited to the White House to meet with  Hillary Clinton, then-First Lady, as part of her healthcare initiative.   Shawn testified before Congress on the need for an increase in  research funding. And based on his desire to help others in the  community, Shawn left his career in finance, where he worked as a hedge  fund manager, to create Stand Among Friends in 1997.    Stand Among Friends, based in Boca Raton, Florida, is a cross- disability advocacy organization. It is focused on helping people with  disabilities find employment through vocational training and adaptive  technology. It has provided services to more than 4,000 people and  helped over 1,000 people find employment. Shawn has grown the services  and mission to become one of the top disability service providers in  the State of Florida.   And each year, Shawn and the Stand Among Friends organization hosts  the ``emb(race).'' The emb(race) is a day of diversity awareness that  includes a half marathon, a 5K, and a family fun walk; and it is,  indeed, a way for all of us to embrace one another.   Shawn, as I said, is a dear friend and an inspiration in his  community and to all who know him.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank all of those who make  the Paralysis Resource Center at the Christopher & Dana Reeve  Foundation what it is today.   As you can see from these stories, the PRC comes in at a family's  most vulnerable moment. These are the most serious injuries and  illnesses one can imagine. They are life-changing, and they come in  with an immediate response to help guide families who are hurting to  help them create a positive vision of a new life and build a community  of support for Americans living with paralysis.   I would like to leave with the words of Christopher Reeve. He said:  ``I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to  persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.''   Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting the Paralysis Resource Center in their work to help empower  more American heroes in the fight against spinal cord injuries.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 54 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, July 25, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
