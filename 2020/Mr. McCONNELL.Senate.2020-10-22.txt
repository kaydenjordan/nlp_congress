 Madam President, yesterday evening the Directors of  National Intelligence and the FBI updated the public on foreign efforts  to influence our election and our government's work to prevent them.  They announced that Iran and Russia exploited voter information to send  misleading emails. This is just another reminder that multiple  different adversaries with multiple different objectives want to fuel  divisions among Americans and create chaos. Iran, China, Russia, and  other adversaries may have different goals, but they all share the same  primary objective of undermining America's confidence in our democracy,  and they are thrilled when their disinformation causes us to point  fingers at each other rather than at them.   The good news is that we have spent the last 4 years gearing up for  this. Unlike the Obama-Biden administration, on whose watch even  Democrats admit we were caught flatfooted, the Trump administration has  worked overtime with Congress and other actors to get us ready.  [[Page S6384]]    The White House has imposed harsh new sanctions on Russians who  interfered in 2016. The Department of Justice, Department of Homeland  Security, and the intelligence community have led efforts to strengthen  and coordinate our defenses. Here in the Senate, the Intelligence  Committee spent years studying what went wrong in 2016 and published a  1,300-plus-page report with recommendations.   In the last 2 years alone, we passed more than $800 million to fund  and support secure elections. The Iranian and Russian operations  described last night are being combatted by the Federal Government in  close coordination with State and local officials and the private  sector. Details are being shared with Congress and the public, as  appropriate.   This is precisely how the process should work. We are literally miles  ahead of where we were.   Even the Washington Democrats who spent years talking up the threats  to our election infrastructure are now admitting that we have made huge  strides. Just a few days ago, the junior Senator for Connecticut  admitted: ``We are going to have a free and fair election . . . because  we have spent significant money from the Federal Government, and  through States, to beef up protections of our voter lists and our  voting systems.''   It is a separate question whether Democrats' ability to express basic  patriotic confidence in our institutions should be so contingent on  whether their preferred candidate seems to be up in the polls. But,  regardless, that is the truth.   I will close with one point I keep making. The work of protecting our  democracy is not just the job of experts and government buildings. This  is also a duty that falls upon every one of us, every single citizen.  At this point, it is a patriotic duty for Americans to be educated  consumers of information.   Citizens who need information about voting should look to their local  official sources, and all of us on all sides should take a deep breath  and realize division, disinformation, and chaos are exactly what our  adversaries want. We are all in this together. All of us Americans are  in this together    Mr. President, I move to recess and ask for the yeas  and nays.    Mr. President, next month, our country will salute the  life and achievements of former Secretary of the Navy Paul Ignatius as  he celebrates his 100th birthday. I would like to join Paul's family  and friends in recognizing his years of leadership and service to our  country.   The son of Armenian immigrants, Paul completed his undergraduate  studies at the University of Southern California. There, he entered the  Phi Kappa Tau brotherhood, the same college fraternity I would later  join at the University of Louisville. Paul's achievements on campus  were just the beginning of his remarkable life.   Like so many other members of the Greatest Generation, Paul put his  life on hold to serve in uniform during World War II. He interrupted  his studies at Harvard Business School to enlist in the U.S. Navy and  was commissioned as a lieutenant. As an aviation ordnance officer, Paul  served aboard the escort aircraft carrier USS Manila Bay in the  Pacific.   Returning home after 4 years in the Navy, Paul completed his MBA at  Harvard and began a successful career in the private sector. However,  our country would call on him once again. When it did, Paul was ready  to answer.   In 1961, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara asked Paul to serve as  Assistant Secretary of the Army. He agreed and began 8 years of  prominent leadership in the Pentagon under both President John F.  Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson. Paul served in several  capacities, including Assistant Secretary of Defense for Installations  and Logistics. Finally, in 1967, Paul was chosen to lead the same Navy  he joined as a lieutenant more than two decades before.   Paul left the Pentagon and began new ventures in journalism,  philanthropy, and scholarship. He has earned several honors and awards  for the lasting impacts of his leadership. Last year, Paul received a  premier recognition for a Navy veteran and leader. He joined his  successor, Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer, at a commissioning  ceremony of the USS Paul Ignatius, an Arleigh-Burke class guided- missile destroyer.   So it is a privilege to join those paying tribute to Paul Ignatius'  lifetime of accomplishments for our Armed Forces and our Nation. As he  celebrates his 100th birthday, appropriately on Veterans Day, I wish  him the very best. On behalf of the Senate, I extend my sincere  gratitude for his service.                            ____________________
