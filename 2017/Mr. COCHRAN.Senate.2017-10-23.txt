 Madam President, I urge the Senate to approve the  disaster relief supplemental appropriations bill.   This bill will provide additional funding for response and recovery  operations in areas devastated by recent hurricanes.   The storms this year have been severe in both strength and number.  Communities in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands  are struggling to recover.   Both the Disaster Relief Fund and the National Flood Insurance  Program are depleted. They will soon run out of money for disaster  response and to pay flood insurance claims.   The supplemental funding in this bill will ensure that first  responders and Federal agencies have the necessary resources to  continue their important work.   This bill also includes funding in response to the deadly wildfires  that have ravaged western States. While these emergency funds are  needed now, I will continue working with my colleagues to find a better  way to fund wildfire suppression in the future.   This will not be the end of our efforts to respond to this year's  disasters. The Appropriations Committee will continue to work with the  administration and with the affected delegations to determine and  provide for additional recovery needs. I am committed to doing what is  necessary to get the job done.
