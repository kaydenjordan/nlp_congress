 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor and join my  colleague from Washington to support a woman's right to choose and to  make sure that we are making our voices heard loud and clear about the  discussion that is happening before the Supreme Court and why it is so  important to have the full reproductive health care choices for women  in the United States of America.   In 1973, the Supreme Court decided the Constitution protects a  woman's right to privacy and, thus, the choice to have a safe and legal  abortion without excessive government restrictions. And so now that  these cases are before the Court, it is important for our colleagues to  know that the majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade.   In my State in 1970, the people voted to legalize early abortions and  in 1991, by a vote of the people in an initiative process, we supported  that ``Every individual possesses a fundamental right to privacy with  respect to personal reproductive decisions,'' codifying Roe v. Wade  into State law. That was in 1991.   So it is concerning to people of the State of Washington to hear now  that these other States, once coming here to talk about just certain  restrictions, are now coming to talk about overturning Roe v. Wade.  Women should be allowed to have these fundamental rights dependent not  where they live, but to make sure that they have access. And my  colleague from Washington just expressed why it is so important for  women and families to have access to those full reproductive rights.   Women across the country for 50 years have come to rely on these  constitutional protections to make decisions for themselves, about  their reproduction, their families, and their bodies. That is why it is  important to realize that Roe is based on our privacy protections in  the Constitution. The Justices wisely understood that, that a woman's  right to choose was about privacy, a personal issue, a medical choice,  one in which the State had very limited roles subject to the highest  standards and scrutiny of the Court.   But some of my colleagues believe that it is their choice to make.  They believe they should decide for all women; they believe that they  should not make the decision for just themselves, but for other people  and for other people's family when to have a child. I know that in  Mississippi legislators have decided that rather than viability after  15 weeks, the State should take the choice away from women.   In Texas, the legislature decided that the choice should be taken  away at 6 weeks, typically long before a woman might know she is  pregnant. Why are these people who claim that they should be making  decisions for women across the country now supporting efforts to take  away these important rights. The Court in Casey said, ``The proper  focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a  restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.''   But let's look at what happened in Mississippi. In 2018, Mississippi  enacted a State law which banned abortion after 15 weeks. Notably,  there is no exception for rape or incest, and no exception for the  health of the mother. They say that is their government's choice. Well,  I asked them, where is the right of the mother and the individual?  Where is the right for that family to ask about the life of the mother.   To quote an amicus brief to the Court on behalf of over 500 public  health professionals, ``Any ban on pre-viability abortion such as  Mississippi, carries major public health implications, because it  forces a woman to carry pregnancies to term under adverse circumstances  marked by substantially greater increases to their health and that of  their families.'' Any ban, continuing to read from the quote, ``any ban  will disproportionately affect young women, women of color, low-income  women, and communities who are already vulnerable to elevated health  and social risks and reduce access to necessary health care.''   This is what we are talking about. A woman's right to choose. Her  family's right to choose. And people want to see these rights eroded. I  think that these are public health concerns that we all should be  concerned about. I think we should be concerned that a legislature  wanted to change these laws. In 2018, some in the State legislature may  have just had had the objective of narrowly undermining Roe. But now,  they recently are changing their position and are asking that Roe v  Wade be overturned.   So all of these are important decisions. As the Casey Court held,  overruling precedent would come ``at a cost of profound and unnecessary  damage.'' I couldn't agree more. Because of Roe and Casey, abortions  are safe and are available. Women are in control of their bodies.  Families can plan. These are important issues for every woman in  America. These are their choices. This decision, a very difficult  decision can be theirs and theirs alone. And that is why it is a matter  of choice.   So I hope our colleagues will be paying close attention to what is  happening at the Supreme Court. I guarantee you, the people of the  State of Washington are who as I said, codified Roe v. Wade into  statute by a vote of the people. The majority of Americans support Roe  v. Wade. And this is now a law that people are trying to overturn and  overturn our privacy constitutional rights.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Congressional Record.
