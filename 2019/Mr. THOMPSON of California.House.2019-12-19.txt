 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the USMCA implementing legislation.   As a member of the working group, I can tell you how far we have  come. The original agreement that was sent to Congress was a total  failure at protecting workers' rights, providing access to affordable  medicine, and protecting our environment. Further, it wasn't  enforceable.   The bill we have before us today is the result of tireless work from  Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Neal, and the working group members who  represented the diverse views of Congress.   With gains achieved through our negotiations, this trade deal will  set the standard for all future trade agreements. It is enforceable; it  protects workers; it helps address serious environmental issues; and it  protects access to affordable medicine.   Finally, I thank the staff, which worked tirelessly to get us to this  day. There were a lot of late nights and a lot of weekends sacrificed  to reach this deal. Specifically, I thank the Katherines, Katherine Tai  and Katherine Monge; the Trade Subcommittee staff, Alexandra Whittaker,  John Catalfamo, Julia Friedman, Kate Connor Linton, Katie White, and  Keigan Mull; and from my staff, my trade person, Jennifer Goedke.   I commend the Speaker, the chairman, and all the Members who worked  so hard to get us here. All of those good things that both sides have  been talking about today were not in the first draft that we got from  the White House. This is a good bill because we made it a good bill. I  ask everybody to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 772, I call up the bill (H.R. 5377) to amend the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the limitation on deduction of State and  local taxes, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert in the Record extraneous material on this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5377, the Restoring  Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act. This bill would temporarily  repeal the SALT cap in order to restore fairness in our tax code and  provide Congress time to develop more comprehensive tax reform.   The current cap on the State and local tax deduction reflects the  sloppy and cynical nature of the 2017 Republican tax bill. This bill  was hastily rammed through Congress in just 51 days without a hearing,  without an opportunity to hear from State and local governments, and  without an opportunity to hear from teachers or first responders.   Republicans decided from the beginning, from behind closed doors, to  include a cap on SALT deductions in order to help finance their tax  cuts for corporations and the rich.   In my home State, California, average SALT deductions are $20,448. A  total of 6.5 million California families, or 35.6 percent of tax  filers, claimed the deduction in 2017.   The double taxation of earnings people have already paid in State and  local taxes inhibit State and local governments' ability to fund even  the most vital of programs, including emergency services and public  education.   H.R. 5377 fixes this problem by restoring the longstanding tax  precedent that protects State and local governments' ability to raise  revenue to fund these services. And this fix doesn't add a single dime  to the deficit.   Furthermore, this bill provides tax relief to the middle-class public  servants left behind by the Republican tax bill by doubling the out-of- pocket deduction for teachers, classroom expenses, and creating a new  deduction for expenses for first responders. In 2017, 354,990 teachers  in California claimed the educator expense deduction, and they will all  get double under this bill.   The short-sightedness of the SALT cap had further consequences for  middle-class taxpayers in high-tax States: Capping the SALT deduction  diminished the incentive for middle-class taxpayers to claim tax  benefits that encourage homeownership and charitable deductions. By  limiting the SALT deduction and raising the standard deduction, fewer  middle-class taxpayers benefit from taking the mortgage interest  deduction and charitable giving deductions.   Homeownership is an important way for middle-class families to build  wealth. Eliminating incentives for charitable giving undermines local  charities that rely on donations from middle-class members of their  communities.   I think my colleagues from both sides of the aisle can agree that  these are the types of behavior we should be encouraging through our  tax code. This bill reverses the Republicans' actions to undercut these  middle-class benefits to finance tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.   Finally, this bill isn't about cutting taxes for high earners. This  bill is about tax fairness, ensuring that taxpayers are not double- taxed by being required to pay Federal income tax on earnings they pay  in State and local taxes and appeals to the core tenets of our  federalist system.   In the spirit of tax fairness, this bill is responsibly offset by  restoring the top marginal rate back to 39.6 percent for the highest  income bracket.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I just want to point out  that the irony of my friend's testimony today, my friend from Texas'  testimony, shouldn't be lost on any of us.   Remember, it was the Republicans that created this problem with their  tax bill. They did a tax bill that benefited corporations and the  wealthiest people in the country, and then to say that somehow they are  protecting regular folks is really laughable.   That tax cut cost us, in the debt, $2.3 trillion.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Jersey  (Ms. Sherrill).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. King), a great public servant and someone  who has partnered with us on a number of important issues.     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  pointing out that our bill is paid for, unlike the TCJA, and the pay- for comes from the wealthiest earners.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Larson), a great member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a leader and a very vocal  advocate of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  [[Page H12277]]  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a great member of our  Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins), a treasured member of the Ways  and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), a great member of our Ways  and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider), a great member of our Ways and  Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi), someone who has worked tirelessly  on this. You couldn't get out of his line of sight. No matter how early  I went to the gym, the gentleman would be waiting: ``We have got to do  SALT.''    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  New York an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  [[Page H12278]]  the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), a great member of our  committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo), a treasured member of the Ways  and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Casten).  [[Page H12279]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Porter).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an  additional 20 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I just want to remind the  gentleman that, although I appreciate that he wants to get rid of the  cap, you can't do it without paying for it. That is the same  irresponsible behavior that the Republicans employed in their tax bill,  and it cost us $2.3 trillion in our national debt.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the State of Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much  time I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the chair of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to  [[Page H12281]]  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I point out that their provision is temporary as well,  just not as temporary.   Madam Speaker, the National Association of Police Organizations in  their letter to us wrote: ``Our members are not just first responders;  they are also citizens of the communities in which they work.''   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from that  organization.               National Association of Police Organizations, Inc.                            Alexandria, Virginia, December 10, 2019.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady:        On behalf of the National Association of Police       Organizations (NAPO), representing over 241,000 sworn law       enforcement officers across the nation, I am writing to you       to express our full support for the Restoring Tax Fairness       for States and Localities Act.        Throughout this country, law enforcement officers go to       work every day with one goal in mind: to keep their       communities safe. In order to achieve this mission, they       receive support from the communities they serve, as public       safety budgets across the United States are largely drawn       from state and local property, sales, and income taxes--      essential investments that give our first responders the       tools they need to get the job done. The state and local tax       (SALT) deduction has helped support these vital investments       at the state and local level.        Our members are not just first responders; they are also       citizens of the communities in which they work. The fact is       that the capping of the SALT deduction is a significant tax       increase for many suburban homeowners, including law       enforcement officers. This puts them squarely in the range of       middle-class taxpayers that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Public       Law No. 115-97) was supposed to help. Instead, with the SALT       deduction capped at $10,000, many first responders are       finding themselves on the wrong end of a tax hike. We support       the two-year repeal of the cap and call on Congress to       permanently repeal it, for homeowners, for our communities,       and for the first responders who work every day to keep those       communities safe.        Further, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act hit law enforcement       officers with another tax increase when it eliminated their       ability to deduct work-related out-of-pockets expenses. Like       many public servants, law enforcement officers serve our       nation and our communities for modest wages and often have to       pay for mandatory and necessary equipment and training out-      of-pocket. These out-of-pocket costs are significant and a       financial burden on officers. NAPO supports the inclusion of       the Supporting America's First Responders Act, which would       reinstate deductions for certain, significant work-related       out-of-pocket expenses for first responders.        NAPO stands ready to support any efforts necessary to pass       this legislation.            Sincerely,                                           William J. Johnson, CAE,                                                Executive Director.    Madam Speaker, the fact is that capping  the SALT deduction is a significant tax increase for many suburban  homeowners, including law enforcement officers. This puts them squarely  in the range of middle-class taxpayers that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  was supposed to help. Instead, with the SALT deduction cap at $10,000,  many first responders are finding themselves on the wrong end of a tax  hike.   We support the 2-year repeal of the cap and call on Congress to  permanently repeal it for homeowners, for our communities, and for  first responders who work every day to keep those communities safe.   Madam Speaker, I want to take a quick moment, as we head into this  holiday season, to offer my appreciation to the Committee on Ways and  Means tax staff. The Members who serve on the Committee on Ways and  Means already know that they have the hardest working men and women on  the Hill at their disposal. This bill would not have been possible  without their commitment, policy expertise, dedication, and hard work.   I want to take a minute to thank my subcommittee staff director,  Aruna Kalyanam; the lead staffer on the SALT deduction, Peg McGlinch;  my senior counsel, Terri McField; as well as Scott La Rochelle, Arjun  Ghosh, Lee Slater, and Andrew Grossman on the committee for their  tremendous efforts. They do great work, and we should all be really  glad that they are here. All Americans should be.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in the spirit of the  holiday season, I accept the motion to recommit.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to the  instructions of the House in the motion to recommit, I report the bill,  H.R. 5377, back to the House with an amendment.
