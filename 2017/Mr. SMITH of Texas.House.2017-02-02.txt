 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House  Joint Resolution 37, which annuls a poorly-written regulation put in  place by the Obama administration.   We need to clean up the regulations that the previous administration  imposed upon American business. We need to reform them, and ensure that  they serve a useful purpose. This is especially important for the  Department of Defense and NASA.   The regulation in question does not allow contractors to exercise  their right of due process. Rather than letting our legal system  provide justice, American companies could be blacklisted by contracting  agencies if ``preliminary determinations'' had been made against them.   This is not how our justice system works. Perhaps that is why this  regulation was halted by a nationwide injunction.   We should protect American workers. The regulation we strike today  was poorly crafted, and it would ultimately do America's workforce more  harm than good.   As Chairman of the Science Committee, I know that such a regulation  would impede NASA from carrying out its mission of exploration and  place an unnecessary cost on taxpayers by diminishing competition.   NASA should not be hampered by such unnecessary regulations and needs  to focus its resources on the challenges of outer space exploration.   The Federal procurement process cannot afford to be bogged down with  defective regulations. Congress must clean up how our government does  business to ensure that it is just and efficient.   I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.
