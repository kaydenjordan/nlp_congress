 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate has a duty and a  responsibility to methodically review a Supreme Court nominee's record.  That is why, in past years, the Senate has sent bipartisan letters-- bipartisan--to the National Archives and Presidential libraries  requesting the necessary information on a nominee. Democrats and  Republicans agreed that however we would ultimately vote, transparency  and openness were principles we all shared.   It appears that bipartisan tradition has been tossed aside. It was  fine for our Republican friends when they were in the minority and  President Obama nominated candidates to the Supreme Court. But the  double standard is glaring, enormous, and detrimental to America.   Now the Republican majority has cast aside Democratic wishes for  openness and transparency and has made a partisan request for only a  small subset of Judge Kavanaugh's records. It is such a break from  precedent that we have to wonder: What are the Republicans hiding about  Judge Kavanaugh's record? What are they so afraid of that they tie  themselves in knots--into a pretzel--to contradict everything they  stood for when they were in the minority?   Today, every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee has joined Ranking  Member Feinstein in making a formal request of the National Archives to  provide the exact same universe of documents provided during the  confirmation of Justice Kagan. When I say the same request, I mean the  exact same request.   The Judiciary Committee has updated the letter to refer to Judge  Kavanaugh, but in every other way it is identical to the request that  Democrats and Republicans made for Justice Kagan that Republicans  insisted on when she was nominated by President Obama.   By the way, it was Senate Republicans who insisted on this standard  during previous confirmations. Democrats, even though our nominee might  be exposed, agreed because we believed in openness, and we are not  hypocritical in saying that it is only good when we are in charge, not  when you are in charge. We believe it works both ways.   Ranking Member Feinstein has made it clear that we don't need or want  every single scrap of paper from Judge Kavanaugh's time as Staff  Secretary, but to review none--none--of the nominee's records for most  of his senior role in the White House is an act of what might be called  willful opacity. That is why we are not following very sensible,  bipartisan precedent now.   Judge Kavanaugh himself has said that his time as Staff Secretary was  especially useful to him as a judge and that his time in the White  House made him a better interpreter of statutes. I hope that the  National Archives will understand the dilemma we are in and the unusual  circumstance we are in, and, ultimately, I hope my Republican  colleagues will understand and that both the Archives, either on its  own or with Republican acquiescence, will make the right decision in  the interests of transparency, consistency, and fairness. To do  otherwise is to forsake the Senate's constitutional duty to provide  advice and consent on this surpassingly important nomination.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another subject, taxes, President  Trump and congressional Republicans promised working America the Moon  and the stars with their tax bill. President Trump said that it would  create ``a middle-class miracle'' and that everyone would get a $4,000  raise. Remember that? President Trump promised the American people that  these tax cuts for the wealthy would trickle down--or torrent down--and  everyone would get a $4,000 raise. If we asked Americans from one end  of the country to the other to tell us by raising their  [[Page S5465]]  hands how many of them got a $4,000 raise, maybe the top 1 percent  would--maybe the top 2 percent--but not most Americans.   Wages are virtually stagnant. The promises the President made have  not materialized. And when we measure wages against costs of everyday  living--in other words, buying power, how much of a raise you get  versus how much things cost--the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that  year over year, hourly earnings have dropped by 1 percent. In other  words, the American consumer--the average middle-class person, even  with this tax cut--has less buying power today than they had last  year. President Trump and Republicans promised a $4,000 raise, but  average hourly earnings' buying power--the ability to live a decent  life--for far too many Americans has gone down. Talk about a sleight of  hand. Talk about an exaggerated--if not dishonest--promise. There it  is.    While average working Americans continue to struggle to keep their  heads above water, corporations and the wealthy are having a bonanza  thanks to the Republican tax bill. As the President himself tweeted  this morning, the tax bill made the Koch brothers and almost every  multimillionaire richer at a time when they are doing great. We don't  begrudge that people are wealthy and doing well, but the middle class  needed this tax break far more than the rich, even though the rich had  political power over our Republican friends--and when the wealthiest  lobbyists and big, powerful corporations say jump, our Republican  friends say how high, ignoring the middle class. So in the Trump  economy, big, wealthy corporations are cashing in, the top 1 percent  are doing great, and American workers are falling behind.   Listen to this. Already this year, corporations have dedicated over  $600 billion--now approaching $700 billion--to corporate share buybacks  and debt repurchasing programs, goosing their stock price but doing  little to help workers. That is a record pace. These buybacks help the  CEOs and wealthy shareholders but do nothing for the middle class.   There is also a new, troubling pattern being brought to light of  corporate executives selling off stocks shortly after the stock price  has been inflated. So they do the buyback, then they sell the stock and  cash in. Here is the pattern: The Republican tax bill gave American  corporations a mammoth tax cut; American corporations use some of those  newfound profits to buy back and inflate the value of their own stock;  executives of those companies then turn around and sell the stock at a  higher price to pad their pockets.   SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson studied nearly 400 examples of stock  buybacks since the beginning of 2017 and found that after half of  them--half--at least one executive sold shares within the next month.  That is American taxpayer money, President Trump. That is the money you  are taking from the American people and giving to the wealthiest of the  American people. The Republican tax bill is robbing the American  Treasury to pad the pockets of wealthy executives and the richest  Americans.   Now, if that wasn't bad enough, listen to what they want to do now.  It was reported in yesterday's newspaper, the administration is  considering doing an end-run around Congress to give another $100  billion tax cut mainly to the wealthy by cutting taxes on capital  gains. The economy is already running hot on the artificial sweetener  of tax cuts and deficit spending. Another $100 billion in tax cuts for  the rich isn't just more gasoline on the fire; it is an incendiary  device.   At a time when the deficit is out of control, at a time when wages  are flat, at a time when the wealthiest are doing better than ever, to  give the top 1 percent another big advantage is outrageous. It shows  the Republicans' true colors: tax cuts for corporations and the  wealthy, empty promises for everyone else.                            ____________________     Madam President, on North Korea, last night, we received  news that North Korea has been continuing work at a missile facility  north of its capital. Previous satellite images have shown work ongoing  at two other missile sites in the country.   Clearly, North Korea is not suspending, let alone winding down, its  nuclear missile programs. Yet, shortly after President Trump met with  Chairman Kim in Singapore, President Trump said North Korea was ``no  longer a nuclear threat'' to the United States. The juxtaposition of  President Trump's rhetoric and the facts on the ground are jarring. It  would be funny if it wasn't so sad.   President Trump explains out of nowhere that the nuclear threat is  over, and North Korea is building more missiles that reportedly can  reach all of the United States instead of just the West Coast. North  Korea's nuclear program remains a grave threat to the region and the  United States. President Trump can't wish it away. He can't place  fantasy next to reality. North Korea will not give up its nuclear  program simply because President Trump wants them to. Now, we are all  rooting for diplomacy to succeed, but if President Trump is going to  make progress toward the complete, verifiable, and irreversible  denuclearization of North Korea, he needs to grapple with the reality  of the situation, not be in a dream world where he thinks his rhetoric  is reality, when it doesn't match the dangerous reality on the ground.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, on 3D guns, in a short time,  just a minute or two from now, I will be joining several of my  colleagues to talk about an issue we have been worried about for quite  a while--ghost guns. Over the past several years, 3D printing  technology has advanced to the point where anyone with an internet  connection is now able to print guns at home.   A court order has barred companies from posting plans to print guns,  but a few weeks ago, inexplicably, the Trump administration settled  with gun activists to allow them to post detailed instructions, plans,  files, and 3D drawings of weapons on the internet, and this starts  tomorrow. So, starting tomorrow, all you need is a little money--a  couple hundred bucks--and you can download a print from the internet to  make a gun at home. No background check, no criminal history check, no  certification that the person isn't adjudicated mentally ill or has the  intent to harm. Even terrorists could avail themselves of this  technology to print an unlimited amount of home weapons. According to  the New York Post, more than 1,000 people have downloaded plans to make  AR-style, 3D-printed guns, and the ban hasn't even been lifted yet.   The idea of these print-on-command ghost guns is as scary as they  sound. We should be doing everything in our power to make sure this  doesn't happen. These guns can go through metal detectors, stadiums,  and airports: No metal; they are made of plastic only.   Out of the blue this morning, President Trump tweeted he was looking  into the matter, months after his own administration caused the problem  by settling with gun activists and allowing it to happen. From 2010 to  2017, you couldn't do this. There was an international agreement. The  Trump administration, because gun activists were pushing, said go ahead  and do it.   Now, a day before this happens, President Trump is saying he will  look into the matter--although he said he would consult the NRA. Hardly  the great advocates of gun safety in America. I wish President Trump  had looked into this matter months ago--or even last week--and urged  the Justice Department and the State Department not to reach the  settlement in the first place. It is another example--of so many--of  the President showing up on the scene a day late and a dollar short to  address a problem his own administration has created. The President's  tweet this morning gets to the basic incompetence of this  administration: The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is  doing, and it has real important consequences for the safety of the  American people.   I look forward to joining my colleagues to talk more about this issue  and what Congress can do about it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
