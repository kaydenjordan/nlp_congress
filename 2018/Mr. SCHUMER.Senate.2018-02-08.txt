Budget Agreement     Mr. President, yesterday, after months of painstaking  negotiations, the Republican leader and I reached a 2-year budget deal.  Not only will it end the series of fiscal crises that have gridlocked  this body, it will also deliver large investments in our military and  robust funding of middle-class programs. It will also give a  significant boost to our Nation's healthcare and provide long-overdue  relief to disaster-stricken parts of our country.   As I said yesterday, it doesn't include everything that Democrats  want nor everything that Republicans want, but it is a good deal for  the American people, and it is a strong signal that we can break the  gridlock that has overwhelmed this body and work together for the good  of the country.   Let me run through a few of the benefits this agreement will provide.   Our military has suffered from the uncertainty of endless short-term  spending bills. This budget deal puts that to an end. It gives the  military a significant boost in support and allows the Pentagon to make  long-term decisions about its budget. It is the right thing to do.   I want to credit two people--first, my dear friend Senator McCain. He  talked to me repeatedly, even when he was ill, about the need for  funding defense. He also talked about the need for doing immigration  and tried to make them go hand in hand. Senator McCain has been our  leader in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle in terms of making  sure defense is funded, and I know that today he is proud of what we  are doing for the military.   I would also like to thank Secretary Mattis. He visited me  repeatedly. He is a Cabinet Secretary who seems to be doing his job,  rather than focusing on an ideological path that divides people. He  worked hard for this and deserves a great deal of credit.   We Democrats have always argued that we want to fund our military and  our middle-class programs. We need good help on both. A mother whose  child has died from opioid addiction, a veteran who is waiting in line  to get help, college students with great debt on their shoulders,  pensioners whose pensions might be greatly diminished need help too. To  say that our military needs help to the exclusion of all of these other  worthy causes is not fair to them and not good for America. I have  always argued that we can do both, and this budget shows we can. We can  do both--fund the military and help fund the middle class. For those  naysayers who said it could not be done, it sure can with this budget.  I am proud of what it does for the middle class.   For a decade--we all know this; we all talk about it--our middle  class has suffered from a needless and self-imposed austerity in  Congress that has limited investments in jobs and education,  infrastructure, scientific research, and more. This deal puts that to  an end as well. For those who say we cannot do both, we can. I am proud  of this budget, because it does. Let me go into a few specifics.   There are billions of dollars of support for childcare, for helping  middle-class families shoulder the very heavy burden of childcare. They  need to take care of their kids in a way that they can have confidence  when both parents  [[Page S795]]  work, and so often that happens. In single-parent families, that  happens so often.   What about college affordability? The debt burden on the shoulders of  those who have just gotten out of college and graduate school is huge.  We are focusing on providing help here.   In this budget, we focus on police officers, teachers, and  firefighters.   What about infrastructure? Our infrastructure is crumbling throughout  America. Much of it was built 50 or even 100 years ago--roads and  bridges and water and wastewater. We need to help those, and then we  need new infrastructure.   How about broadband to rural areas and inner cities that are not  getting it? Broadband is a necessity today. Kids cannot learn. Often,  you cannot hold a job unless you can get broadband at home. In large  parts of America, particularly rural parts, you cannot get it. We  provide help, and rural America is very happy that we are doing this.   We provide billions to rebuild and improve veterans hospitals and  clinics so that when our brave soldiers come home, bearing the scars of  war, their country serves them just as well as they served us.   I mentioned opioids earlier. There is $6 billion, finally, to guard  against the opioid-mental health crisis. The opioid crisis is  widespread. The President has set up a whole bunch of commissions and  given a whole bunch of speeches, but he hasn't funded it. We in this  body have. We Democrats have led the charge. We have so many Members,  like Senators Shaheen and Manchin; we have so many Senators, like  Senators Heitkamp and Baldwin; we have so many Senators, like  McCaskill, Donnelly, and Hassan, who have been talking about the opioid  crisis for a long time. Their hard work has now produced the dollars  that will give the treatment that so many who are addicted need and the  infrastructure to prevent these bad drugs, particularly fentanyl, from  coming into this country.   My guest at the State of the Union was a woman named Stephanie  Keegan, from Putnam County. She was the brave mother of a veteran who  got hooked on opioids in the depths of PTSD. He waited 16 months for  his first appointment at the VA, but he died of an overdose 2 weeks  before he could get treatment. Stephanie Keegan has been fighting for  this. She is a brave, strong woman who is lighting the candle. She was  my guest at the State of the Union, and she is a happy woman this  morning because all of her hard work after her son's passing is coming  to fruition.   Of course, there is so much more in this proposal that we can all be  proud of as Americans, in that we will not be neglecting people who  have been neglected for so long: support for community health centers,  which serve over 25 million Americans; a full decade of funding for  CHIP, or the Children's Health Insurance Program; an effort to lower  prescription drug costs for millions of American seniors who are caught  in the Medicare Part D doughnut hole; disaster relief and recovery  funding, not just for Texas, Louisiana, and Florida--important as they  may be and are--but for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and the  Western States; and a special select committee--we don't do this  often--that will be empowered and under a deadline to deliver a  legislative fix to the pension issue by the end of the year. It is this  issue which has plagued so many working and middle-class Americans in  many States, people who have paid into their pensions day after day,  week after week, month after month, and who are now finding those  pensions vanishing. We should provide relief for them just as we should  provide relief for others. This commission is a strong, bright light  that will focus on this issue and will create a path to a solution.   I salute so many of my colleagues who have worked so hard on so many  of these pieces: Senators Murray, Wyden, and Tester, on healthcare;  Senators Brown, Casey, Stabenow, Manchin, Heitkamp, Donnelly,  Klobuchar, Baldwin, and Smith, on the pension's piece; Senator Nelson,  on the disaster package. Senator Leahy, the ranking member of  Appropriations, has done a great job on the whole thing. A lot of  credit is due to each of them and to so many more of our Members  because the final product is something that will benefit so many  Americans over the next decade. Senator McCaskill was also very much  involved in the pension issue, as well as many others.   I hope this budget agreement will pass the Senate in large numbers on  both sides of the aisle. It will be easy to say: Well, I didn't like  this, and I didn't like that. Yet this is the time to come together.  This is the time to stand up for our soldiers, our middle class, and  those aspiring to the middle class. I hope we will get a large  bipartisan vote.    To that point, I have some pointed words for some in the House's  Freedom Caucus--the hard right--who are starting to squawk about this  budget deal. They say it raises the deficit. They just voted and  cheered a bill that would add $1.5 trillion to the deficit in the form  of tax breaks for mammoth corporations. They were willing to increase  the deficit on the defense side of the budget, but all of a sudden,  when it comes to our schools or our roads or our scientific research:  Oh, we can't do it because of the deficit. It is blatantly hypocritical  to ignore the deficit when it favors corporate America but raise the  alarm when it comes to helping our veterans, our students, and those  addicted to opioids. That is selective enforcement. That doesn't fly.   There is a lot of sophistry going on. Oh, when we reduce taxes, we  will not have a deficit because it will keep the economy growing. Does  anyone doubt that education keeps the economy growing, that scientific  research keeps the economy growing, that building infrastructure keeps  the economy growing? There is a lot of hokum flying around here that  only when you cut taxes for big corporations do you grow the economy.   What is good for the goose is good for the gander, and I think  Americans are tired of the hypocrisy on the hard right, which treats a  $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit by cutting corporate taxes with  cheers--primarily taxes on the wealthy--and then says you cannot spend  money on those who need relief from the student debt loans they have or  who need help for healthcare or food stamps. It is utter, sheer  hypocrisy.   Let this budget go forward through both Chambers and go to the  President's desk, where President Trump seems willing and ready to  sign. President Trump was not involved in this process. He was not  constructive when he spoke and tweeted. He asked for a shutdown. I  think, in this body--and I hope my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are learning this--oftentimes, we can get a lot more done when  working with one another and letting the White House just sit on the  sidelines, because you do not know what its positions are. As I once  said, negotiating with the President is like negotiating with Jell-O,  and, oftentimes, his positions are just so far over to one side of the  political spectrum--Koch brothers-type positions--that they would never  pass. So this is a good motto.                                 Immigration    Mr. President, now I have one more word on immigration.   Based on my continued conversations with the Republican leader, once  we pass this budget agreement, we are ready to proceed to a neutral  bill--a shell bill--on immigration next week. The Republican leader has  guaranteed an amendment process, fair on all sides, where we will  alternate amendments. That means some of the people who are on the very  conservative side will get amendments and some on the very liberal side  will, but so will there be an opportunity for a bipartisan compromise  that will focus on the Dreamers and border security that will have a  real chance of getting 60 votes. We should all be working hard to get  that done in this Chamber.   I would say to my friends in America who care about the Dreamers to  please let their Senators know, particularly those Senators who have  not committed to helping the Dreamers, how important this is.   Next week will be one of the most vital weeks when we will be able to  deal with the Dreamer issue in a fair, compassionate way. It has been  swept under the rug for too long, but because of the agreement the  leader and I came to a few weeks ago--and he has confirmed to keep his  commitment--we will be able to deal with it. The House should be able  to deal with it as well.   What Leader McConnell and I have agreed to should be something that  [[Page S796]]  Speaker Ryan agrees to. To just put President Trump's bill on the floor  means no immigration bill and no help for the Dreamers. We all know  that. It will lose Republican votes as well as Democratic votes. It  will not pass in the House.   I say to Speaker Ryan: Allow a fair and open process to debate  Dreamers on the floor of the House, just as we are allowing in the  Senate.   Leader Pelosi shouldn't have to stand and speak for 8 hours--I  respect her for doing it--just to secure a vote on an issue as  compelling and pressing as the Dreamers. What Leader Pelosi is asking  for is the same thing that we have here in the Senate--no more, no  less--a vote and an open process. That is undeniably fair. I hope  Speaker Ryan will relent and promise a vote. There is an appetite on  both sides and in both Chambers to get this done--both to help the  Dreamers and do border security.   In the Senate, I know that everyone on the Democratic side and many  on the Republican side are working hard to find a bill that can protect  Dreamers and provide border security that can pass next week. We know  this is a difficult task, and we know immigration is one of the more  volatile issues in America, but we have to do it for the good of this  country. The budget was a difficult process, but we came to an  agreement. Let's do the same on immigration with a bipartisan  agreement, where each side gives some, and we can all be proud that we  got it done. The same effort and spirit that forged the budget deal  should carry forward to the issue of the Dreamers. Let's get it done  next week.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Indiana.    Madam President, I very much appreciate my good friend,  the junior Senator from Kentucky, for his fidelity to spending-- something we don't agree with--and for his fidelity of trying to get  his amendments on the floor and debated--something we do agree with. I  recently supported that right when the FISA bill came up, which I know  was very important to him.   The difficulty we have here is that the government will shut down. We  still have the House that has to vote. Frankly, there are lots of  amendments on my side, and it is hard to make an argument that if one  person gets an amendment that everybody else will not want an  amendment, and then we will be here for a very long time.   So I would plead with my colleague, given the exigencies, that maybe  a budget point of order might work, which would make the same point;  that is, he believes the spending is too high. Then we could move  forward and get a bill done and not risk a government shutdown. We are  in risky territory here as both of my friends from Kentucky know. If  that would accomplish the same thing and not hold us up here, we could  let the House do its will and then, maybe, get the bill to the  President, because we want to move things forward.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I propose that we give the Senator  from Kentucky an opportunity to make a budget point of order, which  would give him a vote on the substance of the matter he is concerned  about.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, at  6 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the  motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.  1892 with a  [[Page S817]]  further amendment; further, that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture  time be yielded back and Senator Paul be recognized to make a budget  point of order; that the majority leader or his designee be recognized  to make a motion to waive; and that following the disposition of the  motion to waive, the Senate vote on the motion to concur with further  amendment with no other intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   The Senator from Kentucky.
