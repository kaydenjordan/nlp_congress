 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fred Teichert and  celebrate his retirement from A Teichert & Sons, a construction company  that his great-grandfather founded in 1887.   In 1990, Fred led the creation of the Teichert Foundation. Through  the foundation, he has greatly contributed to what Sacramento is today  in his support of nonprofits in Sacramento and throughout California.   Fred has been committed to making Sacramento a better place,  particularly for our youth. Among his proudest achievements was serving  as the founding president of the Boys and Girls Club of Greater  Sacramento. His  [[Page H3862]]  participation on the Child Abuse Prevention Council and countless  education committees have served as constant reminders of his  dedication to helping children succeed both in and out of the  classroom.   For his efforts, he has earned numerous community service awards over  the last 30 years, including being selected as American Leadership  Forum's exemplary leader of the year and the Sacramento Metro Chamber  of Commerce's Sacramentan of the Year.   Mr. Speaker, I extend my congratulations and thanks to Fred Teichert  for his lifelong dedication to Sacramento. His commitment to our region  will always be celebrated and remembered. I ask my colleagues to join  me in celebrating Fred for his work and wish him the best in his next  steps.                            ____________________
