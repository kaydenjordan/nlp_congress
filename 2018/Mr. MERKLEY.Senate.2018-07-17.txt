 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Karina Ramirez Velazquez, be granted privileges of the floor for the  remainder of the day.    Mr. President, the nomination of Ryan Wesley Bounds is  just the latest in more than a year of attacks that have been based on  a strategy of converting the United States from a nation that is based  and organized on and that fights for the principle of ``we the people''  into one that bows to the powerful and the privileged.   His nomination has already strained and degraded the Senate's blue- slip tradition as our colleagues rush to pack our courts with extremist  judges to advance that vision--not of judges who call balls and strikes  but of judicial activists who want to rewrite the Constitution to put  down workers, to put down healthcare rights, to lay out and tear down  consumer rights and women's rights--so many opportunities and  empowerments diminished in the favor of the privileged and the  powerful. That is what is going on with the packing of the Court.   This deed of putting forward this nomination on the floor tonight  changes a 100-year tradition of comity in the U.S. Senate and the  recognition that the home State Senators have something important to  say about the integrity of the individual who is being put forward. At  stake in this confirmation is the Senate's advice-and-consent  responsibility as applied through the blue-slip tradition--a tradition  that incentivizes consultation and bipartisan cooperation. When you  take away the blue-slip tradition, you diminish the incentive for  consultation and cooperation. This tradition has existed since 1917. It  was 101 years ago when Senator Thomas Hardwick objected to President  Wilson's district court nominee, and he wrote his objection on a blue  slip of paper--thus, the name.   No judge until now--101 years later--has ever been confirmed by this  body having not received a single blue slip from a home State Senator.  Until this administration, just five had been confirmed without both  blue slips having been returned. This tradition has been honored by  both parties. It has been a bipartisan tradition. When the Democrats  have been in power, the Republicans have wanted it to be honored. When  Republicans have been in power, the Republicans have honored it. In  fact, in 2009, at the start of President Obama's term when the  Democrats controlled both the Executive Office and this Chamber, my  Republican colleagues wrote a letter. They wrote that they expected the  blue-slip tradition to be observed evenhandedly and regardless of party  affiliation. It was not just that letter from which we have heard over  time. We have heard from Chairman Grassley.   Chairman Grassley wrote clearly about this:         For nearly a century, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary       Committee has brought nominees up for committee consideration       only after both home State Senators have signed and returned       what is known as a ``blue slip.'' This tradition is designed       to encourage outstanding nominees and consensus. . . . I       appreciate the value of the blue-slip process and also intend       to honor it.    He intended to honor it, he wrote, in 2015. Yet putting this  nomination through the committee dishonored the tradition. Bringing it  to the floor dishonors this tradition. It doesn't honor it because it  violates it.   During the time that President Obama was in office, the Republicans  used the blue slips to block 18 nominees. The nominees never progressed  without the return of two of those slips.   We can turn back to the former chair of the Judiciary Committee,  Orrin Hatch, who wrote in The Hill:         Weakening or eliminating the blue slip process would sweep       aside the last remaining check on the president's judicial       appointment power. Anyone serious about the Senate's       constitutional ``advice and consent'' role knows how       disastrous such a move would be.    The current chair and the former chair were pretty clear, and now  they intend to tear it down--a moment of opportunity to sacrifice a  century of comity and consultation.   The clear factor is one principle when in the minority and tearing  down that principle when in the majority. It is one principle for  Obama's nominees and a different principle for Trump's nominees. Where  has all of the honor and principle gone in this Chamber? There were no  hearings for Obama's nominees without blue slips. There have been  hearings for four of Trump's nominees without blue slips.   Now, the majority leader helped to drive this change. He said:  Republicans now will treat a blue slip ``as simply notification of how  you're going to vote.'' That is what he said. It is simply  notification. So it is up to the chair of the committee, the former  chair of the Judiciary Committee, and all of  [[Page S5011]]  the members who signed that 2009 letter saying how important this was  to this Chamber to stand up and actually exhibit some trace of  consistency with the position put forward just a short time ago.   So now he is coming to the floor for a vote. This is a nominee on  whom there was no consultation. We had a committee out in Oregon, set  up by my senior colleague, Senator Wyden. We told the White House: Wait  to make your choice until after the committee submits its list. This is  the Oregon bipartisan--bipartisan--judicial selection committee. But  the President was in such a hurry to pack the court that he didn't wait  for consultation.   I happen to have heard a Member across the aisle saying: Well, the  White House said they consulted. Well, let me tell you that they didn't  consult. They didn't ask me. They didn't ask Senator Wyden.   What does that mean for the White House? Is it the case that  everything we have heard in the last year and a half is accurate out of  the White House, because I have heard virtually every Member across the  aisle say otherwise.   So here you have the two of us having asked the White House to wait  so they can get some consultation and get some advice from Oregon, but  they didn't wait. That was certainly the wrong thing to do.   At the end of 2017, the nominations go back, and the White House has  to resubmit them. We said: Here is another chance for you to honor the  concept of consultation. And what happened? The White House did it  again. They didn't care about consultation.   If we hear from our colleagues tonight, this week, and in the days to  come that they are going to push this nomination forward, don't expect  consultation from any future President when you happen to be in the  minority because that is what you are striking down--a tradition that  encouraged, expected, supported, and promoted consultation.   Have no doubt that this isn't an ordinary nominee. When asked about  anything else in his record that they should know might be  inflammatory, this nominee didn't breathe a word about key writings in  his past. When this nominee was asked about his views on diversity and  how they might have differed from before, he didn't breathe a word  about his former views--and maybe they are his present views.   What did this nominee say on diversity? He said students who work  ``to promote diversity . . . contribute more to restricting  consciousness, aggravating intolerance, and pigeonholing cultural  identities than many a Nazi bookburning.'' That is his attack on  diversity, but that isn't all he said. He said diversity training is a  ``pestilence'' that ``stalks us.''   That isn't the only topic that he weighed in on in such a way that is  way out of the mainstream and exhibiting massive intolerance for  diversity here in the United States, where we come from every corner of  the world. When it came to the process of a campus holding accountable  young men involved in sexual harassment, young men involved in rape, he  also said: ``There is nothing really inherently wrong with the  university failing to punish an alleged rapist.''   I see that my colleague is here to speak, and I appreciate his coming  down. He is coming down to speak on the principle of the blue slips and  how it enshrines cooperation, and so I am delighted he is here.   I will have more to say later, but at this moment, I defer to my  colleague, Senator Blumenthal.    Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?    I very much appreciate his laying out this basic  framework under which this conversation is taking place. But just for  clarity, the Senator made the point that there is no law that requires  a member of a circuit court to be in a particular State and that it is  only under this tradition and agreement among the Members of this body  that a judge reside in a particular State as part of a circuit court.    So if we lose this blue-slip tradition for circuit  courts, it would be the case that when the seat comes open that is now  held in Rhode Island, an administration could nominate and conceivably  a majority could confirm someone who lives, say, in Arizona.    So, in essence, if our colleagues across the aisle vote  for this confirmation, they are basically saying that they are voting  to give up the understanding among this body that has ensured that they  would have a voice in making sure that a member of their circuit court  was residing in their State and someone they felt had the qualities of  integrity and understanding necessary to administer justice.    Mr. President, I appreciate so much my colleague from  Rhode Island laying out what is at stake here.   Why has this 101-year tradition maintained itself over a period of  time in which so many things have changed in our culture? The country  has been transformed, but for over a century, there has been this  mutual understanding that, when it comes to the circuit court, it is  appropriate to have members serving on that circuit who have roots in  and approval and understanding related to different States within that  circuit. That is what has held it together.   If I tear it down for one of my colleagues, I tear it down for  myself. If I tear it down for their circuit, I tear it down for my  circuit. That is what has held it together--that we each want the  circuits to be able to reflect individuals who have an understanding of  [[Page S5014]]  the issues that might come up in that circuit.   There is embodied in the law a residency requirement for some  positions on a circuit court. But that residency requirement isn't the  same as a blue-slip requirement. You can establish residency very  easily in another State. Previous decisions of the court have made sure  it is possible to easily establish residency in another State.  Therefore, it is the blue slip that has maintained this balance.   We were taking a look at some of the writings of the individual who  is up for this particular position that so bothered and concerned me  and concerned the senior Senator from Oregon, my colleague Senator  Wyden. I shared a little bit about his stated written views on  diversity, that students working to ``promote diversity . . .  contribute more to restricting consciousness, aggravating intolerance  and pigeonholing cultural identities than many a Nazi bookburning.''  That was a direct quote. He referred to diversity training as a  ``pestilence'' that ``stalks us.''   I have an article he wrote entitled ``Labor Unions and the Politics  of Aztlan.'' This is about students who are part of a minority group on  campus, and whether they should be able to take up an issue, and, at  his campus, they did. They took up an issue about the ability of  workers to organize into labor unions.   He said: ``I would hardly suggest that no student group should be  able to take up a political matter, if it is of direct relevance to its  reported mission.'' He said: I wouldn't say that any group shouldn't be  able to, but the sundry ethnic centers or the clubs that derive many a  material benefit from those ethnic centers should not be able to take  up an issue related to their mission. I am paraphrasing here, but I  will come back to it and make sure I give the exact words.   Here, we have it. He said, essentially, that for the Chicano or  Latino Stanford students who protested against a hotel chain for firing  workers who tried to form a union, if they stood up for those workers,  he felt it was the wrong thing for them to be able to do so. He said:  ``I would contend, however, that no student group that is affiliated  with an ethnic center or any other department of this university has  any business holding political issues central to its mission.''   Can you imagine? He says he wouldn't weigh in that any group couldn't  pursue issues on campus, but when it comes to the ethnic groups, it is  just plain wrong, in his opinion, for them to be able to take a  position on an issue. That is a pretty significant situation, for  somebody who is going to be a judge on a body to be able to say that,  in his opinion, if it is an ordinary student group, they have every  right to get involved, but if it is a Latino or Chicano group or an  ethnic group, they shouldn't be allowed to get involved in an issue.  How can people come before that judge and expect anything that  resembles a fair hearing, here in the United States of America, where  we have a vision of opportunity for every single American, where we  have a 1964 Civil Rights Act that was passed long before this nominee  attended college and that threw out the notion that discrimination was  acceptable?   I am delighted that my colleague from Massachusetts has arrived to  weigh in on this issue of the appropriateness of a nominee coming to  the floor of the Senate who, in the judgment of the two home-State  Senators, isn't appropriate either because of views they have carried  that bring into question their ability to fairly administer the law  and, therefore, bring into question the entire integrity of the court  at that moment, or because the individual also demonstrated a completed  lack of integrity by failing to provide this information about their  writings when they were asked to do so.   I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.    Mr. President, I so appreciate my colleagues from  Minnesota and New York coming to the floor to share their insights on  this challenge that we are in, where a 101-year-old convention is about  to be smashed to smithereens by the majority in a determination to pack  the courts and corrupt the constitutional application of law and in a  determination to have judges who are not at all interested in the way  the people envision our Nation. They are not at all interested in the  rights of workers. Rather, they twist each provision to enable the  powerful in our country to repress the workers of our country, to  enable the interests of our country that simply want to roll on, on a  commercial plane, to take away the ability of consumers to get a fair  shake. They want to take away the ability of individuals to have fair  access to healthcare. They want to take away one right after another  after another on behalf of the wealthy and the well-connected. This  corruption--this legislating from the bench that is occurring from the  far right--absolutely flies in the face of the fundamental nature of  our Constitution.   But here it is. Not only is it their quest to put the powerful in the  catbird seat to rule over everyone else in this country, to undermine  the fundamental strategy of the distribution and equal voice principle  that Jefferson so forcefully articulated, but they are even willing to  run roughshod over their own rights in the future, because each and  every person who votes for a judge who has no blue slip--not one, not a  single blue slip--is saying that in the future they are giving up the  ability to be consulted when it is an individual who has been assigned  to their State for the circuit court. That is how intense they are at  this moment of dancing to the tune played by the Koch brothers and the  Federalist Society. It is really one of the saddest things we have seen  in a series of abuses of the process here in the U.S. Senate.    This nomination ends a tradition that has served our country well for  over a century. It is a tradition that--just a brief span of time ago,  my colleagues across the aisle were pleading with the Democratic  majority to respect their rights. But not now. Not now. This is one of  those cases where, in the transition from minority to majority, views  have been flipped 180 degrees--a tradition since 1917, when Senator  Thomas Hardwick objected to President Wilson's district court nominee,  writing his objection on a blue slip of paper. That is where the phrase  comes from. Not since then has any judge for the circuit court or  district court ever been confirmed without a blue slip.   In 2009, my Republican colleagues wrote a letter. All signed on to  it. They wrote: We expect the blue-slip tradition to be observed  evenhandedly and regardless of party affiliation.   I ask you, which Member across the aisle has the consistency to stand  up and honor the very principle they asked to be honored when then in  the minority? Who? We are waiting. We are waiting for just one to come  to the floor and be consistent in honoring the principle they begged  the Democrats to honor when we were in charge.   To be sure, when the tide turns and they again say suddenly that they  love this tradition, and won't the Democrats once again honor the  tradition they begged us to honor in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and  2014? They begged us to honor it. They are going to be back asking  again. But you cannot expect that after smashing this tradition, you  can ask to have it back. So when it comes your turn, if you don't have  any integrity today to honor the principle you begged for yesterday,  don't let us hear you begging for it in the future.   What did people have to say in the past? The former chair of the  Judiciary Committee at the time, in 2014, said: ``Weakening or  eliminating the blue slip process would sweep aside the last remaining  check on the President's judicial appointment power.'' That is what the  Republican chair said when President Obama was in office. He said:  ``Anyone serious about the Senate's constitutional `advice and consent'  role knows how disastrous such a move would be.'' Why isn't one of my  colleagues today coming down to say how disastrous it would be?   Our majority leader said just recently that Republicans will now  treat a blue slip as simply notification of how you are going to vote.  Is that the way each and every one of you wants it to be from this  floor, that while you have had the privilege in the past of weighing in  on an individual assigned to your State, no more will you be treated  differently from any other Senator because you are just being given a  chance to indicate how you are going to vote? That is what the majority  leader says we are going to reduce your Senate prerogative to, which  means it is gone, it is no different from any other Member here.   There was a whole logic behind this blue-slip process, a logic that  each circuit should have input from Senators whose States were  represented on those circuit courts and that when the individual came  from those respective States, it made sense to get the insight of the  Senators from that State, not have decisions about your particular  circuit court made by somebody from across the Nation. But that is  where we are headed to now.   This nomination was tainted from the start because the President  didn't consult with our senior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, or with  the junior Senator; didn't call us up; didn't sit down; didn't invite  us to a meeting; didn't hold a conversation; didn't have a dialogue;  didn't consult. So don't expect any consultation in the future if you  vote for this nominee.   Then at the end of the year, when the nomination was returned, we  told the White House: You have another chance to wait until you get  some consultation done, until you talk to us. No. They just forwarded  it back again--no consultation. So there it is.   When this individual, Ryan Bounds, was interviewed by our committee  in Oregon, he was asked to provide anything that was potentially  controversial from his past, and he didn't. He was asked about his  views on diversity and what information he had put out in the past, and  he didn't supply any. So not only are there the controversial  viewpoints of the past, there is a lack of integrity in the present. It  isn't as if Senator Wyden and I took it lightly. But how can you expect  people to get a fair hearing or believe they have any chance of getting  a fair hearing with these types of opinions being expressed?  [[Page S5025]]    What did he say on diversity? He said that students working to  ``promote diversity . . . contribute more to restricting consciousness,  aggravating intolerance . . . than many a Nazi bookburning.'' So if you  advocate for diversity, you are compared to being an individual who  burns books--not just any individual; a Nazi burning books.    That wasn't his only comment on diversity. He wrote quite  extensively. Another phrase he used is that diversity training is a  ``pestilence'' that ``stalks us,'' as if it is some kind of grim reaper  to encourage people to reach out and embrace people who come from a  different point of view or a different color or come from a different  State. That is what he thought, that any training you might have in how  to understand your own internal prejudices is a pestilence that stalks  us.   He didn't like the fact that the university was trying to address the  issue of men abusing women. He said that there is ``nothing really  inherently wrong with the University failing to punish an alleged  rapist.'' That is what you want to vote for?   He said more. He really disliked minority groups on campus taking a  position on anything. In his essay ``Labor Unions and the Politics of  Aztlan,'' he said: ``I would hardly suggest that no student group  should be able to take up a political matter, if it is of direct  relevance to its purported mission.'' So he is not objecting to most  groups weighing in on something related to their vision, but, he said,  ``I would contend, however, that no student group that is affiliated  with an ethnic center or any other department of this university has  any business holding political issues central to its mission.''   So if you are a member of a student group that isn't an ethnic group,  it is wide open--demonstrate, argue, involve yourself, engage. But if  you happen to be a member of an ethnic club or group on campus, then no  way. You have no business taking a position.   How can anyone expect to get a fair hearing with someone with this  extensive hostility toward ethnic diversity or ethnic groups? That is a  pretty serious question to ask yourself in your responsibility of  advice and consent, in your responsibility to ensure that there is not  just integrity on the court but a perception of integrity, not just  fairness on a court but a perception of fairness. How does anyone get a  perception of fairness with these writings?   Mr. Bounds had the opportunity to inform the committee of these  writings, but he chose not to. He kept them hidden away. The head of  the Oregon selection advisory committee wrote the following: ``Mr.  Bounds failed to disclose these writings when specifically asked by the  committee about his views on equity and diversity.''   He did get asked about them later when they were discovered. There  was a hearing in the Judiciary, and he had a chance to respond in  questions for the record. He wrote in response that he regretted the  rhetoric in the articles, but he didn't repudiate the viewpoint. He  regretted, apparently, the particular words he used to express it, but  he didn't say that he repudiated the viewpoint on his commentaries  attacking diversity, attacking diverse clubs, saying that every other  club has a right to participate and engage itself in issues relevant to  its mission except the ethnic clubs. He didn't repudiate that. How do  you expect to get a fair hearing before this judge?   At his hearing before the Judiciary Committee, in questions for the  record, Senator Blumenthal asked if he regretted not turning over the  writings to the Oregon screening committee. He replied that it seemed  reasonable to him that there wouldn't be a lot of interest in writings  that have no bearing on someone's professional practice. These writings  have everything to do with his professional practice, his consideration  as a judge--a circuit court judge, not a district judge. He is not  being nominated for the bottom rung; he is being nominated to the rung  next to the Supreme Court. You don't think it has a bearing that you  have written these things? You don't think it has a bearing that you  hid them from the committee? That in itself tells you a great deal.   It is why this nomination is opposed by so many groups: the AFL-CIO,  the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National  Women's Law Center, the Oregon Women Lawyers Association, the Asian  Pacific American Bar Association of Oregon, the Oregon Hispanic Bar  Association, the LGBT Bar Association of Oregon.   Why wouldn't they oppose when you have an individual who failed the  integrity test by hiding the writings, doesn't repudiate the writings,  and has it in for diversity and minority groups?   Records are being broken. Two nominees up this week would mean 23  appeals judges confirmed. A lot are being confirmed. There are a lot in  waiting. Why not bring someone to the floor who doesn't have these deep  flaws? Why not vote down this individual and put up the next one?   We have already broken the record for confirmations in the  President's first year, last year. Obama's 14 circuit court nominees  waited an average of 251 days; Trump is half that at 125 days--less  than half. We are marching through this.   Why not bring someone else to floor? Why not set this one aside?  Because it fails the test of being fairminded and fails the test of  integrity. Putting this judge forward does something else. It is not  just a judge who fails the test on integrity and fairness; it is also  the destruction of your rights, each and every Senator here, to have a  say on circuit court nominees in your circuit. Is that really the place  you want to go?   We have seen judges come before us who have had hearings held without  ABA evaluations. We have had two considered who were unanimously rated  ``not qualified.'' We certainly, therefore, have a lot that has changed  dramatically. Last year was the first time that a seat had been stolen  from one administration and set a year into the future. That is a  precedent everyone here should regret--to have failed advice-and- consent responsibilities, which is a failure that no other set of  Senators ever failed before. Fifteen times before, there have been open  seats during an election year. Fifteen times before, the Senate debated  the nominee. Fifteen times before, they voted on the nominee. But not  last year.   The leadership of this body failed the test of leadership by failing  to consider a nominee from the President for the Supreme Court. Is that  the precedent you want to live with for the future?   Of course, now we have a new nominee for the Supreme Court. Not only  does this nominee come from a list secretly compiled by the Federalist  Society to make sure that they met the test the President had put  forward--opposing Roe v. Wade, opposing the Affordable Care Act that  has provided healthcare to another 30 million people across this land,  400,000 in my own State, but also the President chose off that list the  one person best suited to write him a get-out-of-jail free card because  of the massive, expansive view of Presidential power--a view of  Presidential power you can find nowhere in the Constitution; a view  that is completely at odds with the checks and balances our Forefathers  so carefully crafted into that document; a view that says that a  President should never be indicted and, even more extraordinary, never  be investigated. That is a President above the law. That is a President  beyond the law. That is something that is not a President. That is a  King. That is a tyrant. That is a dictator who answers to no one  because he or she is above the law. That is not a President in a  constitutional democratic republic where there are checks and balances.   Indeed, this nominee has said that if a President deems a law to be  unconstitutional because it is his or her opinion, the President  doesn't need to follow the law. Can anyone remind this nominee for the  Supreme Court that our system was designed to let the Supreme Court  weigh in on what is and isn't constitutional, not to have a President  dictate that? It is a scary proposition, an unworthy proposition to  have that individual considered on the floor of this Senate.   In Federalist Paper 76, James Madison said that it is the duty of the  Senate to prevent the appointment of unfit characters. Each and every  Member of this Senate on both sides of the aisle has that  responsibility.   These are questions you have to ask yourself: Is the person fit when  they say the things that Ryan Bounds said? Is a person fit to serve on  the bench  [[Page S5026]]  when they say that no student group affiliated with an ethnic center  has any business holding political issues central to its mission right  after he writes that other groups should have that power?   Is the individual fit who says that promoting diversity contributes  more to restricting consciousness and aggravating intolerance than a  Nazi book burning?   Is the person fit who says that training in diversity--training that  each and every one of us has to take and our staff members have to take  in this body--is a pestilence that stalks us, as if embracing the  notion of understanding one's own biasses is an evil thing?   Is the person fit who said there is nothing wrong with the university  failing to punish an alleged rapist?   Is the person fit who hid these writings from the selection  committee?   Is the person fit when the selection committee said that based on  these writings, they would vote overwhelmingly not to recommend this  individual?   Is the person fit when they fail the test of integrity and are asked  to produce their views on diversity and hide them?   I contend that standard that James Madison laid out for the  responsibility of advice and consent--that standard of voting down  individuals who are unfit--has rarely had a clear opportunity to be  executed and should be executed 100 to 0 in turning down this  nomination and in preserving the blue-slip tradition.                            ____________________
