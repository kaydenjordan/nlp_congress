 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2726) to amend title 49, United States Code, to prohibit  smoking on Amtrak trains.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2726         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Banning Smoking on Amtrak       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SMOKING ON AMTRAK TRAINS.         (a) In General.--Chapter 243 of title 49, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``Sec. 24323. Prohibition on smoking on Amtrak trains         ``(a) Prohibition.--Beginning on the date of enactment of       the Banning Smoking on Amtrak Act of 2019, Amtrak shall       prohibit smoking on board Amtrak trains.        ``(b) Electronic Cigarettes.--        ``(1) Inclusion.--The use of an electronic cigarette shall       be treated as smoking for purposes of this section.        ``(2) Electronic cigarette defined.--In this section, the       term `electronic cigarette' means a device that delivers       nicotine or other substances to a user of the device in the       form of a vapor that is inhaled to simulate the experience of       smoking.''.        (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for       chapter 243 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:  ``24323. Prohibition on smoking on Amtrak trains.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2726.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, I rise to ask that the House pass my bill, the Banning Smoking  on Amtrak Act of 2019. I thank my friends, Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee Chair Peter DeFazio and Railroads, Pipelines,  and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee Chair   Daniel Lipinski, for  marking up my bill in committee and allowing it to move forward to the  full House.   My bill would codify Amtrak's internal policy prohibiting smoking,  including smoking electronic cigarettes, on trains, which, in light of  all the evidence of harm, should be codified.   This bill is modeled on a bill I got enacted while in the minority as  part of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 that clarified that the  smoking ban on airplanes includes electronic cigarettes. This bill is  not only an outgrowth of my desire to ensure healthy environments on  all the Nation's transportation modes, which I strive to carry out as  chair of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee, but importantly, it is  also the result of the advocacy of an 11-year old child who was  concerned to see electronic cigarette smoking on an Amtrak train.   Although Amtrak should be commended for implementing its own internal  policy banning smoking on trains in 1993, that policy could always be  repealed. My bill would make the ban a matter of federal law and put  Congress on record in support of protecting passengers from secondhand  smoke, as it has done in banning e-cigarettes on airplanes.   Smoking bans have been a critical tool in protecting people from the  effects of secondhand smoke because it is known to increase the risk of  serious cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, such as coronary heart  disease, lung cancer, and emphysema, among others.   The World Health Organization considers the tobacco epidemic to be  one of the largest public health threats in the world, killing more  than 7 million people a year. While more than 6 million of those deaths  are the result of direct tobacco use, around 890,000, close to a  million, nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke die as a result every  year.   Under my bill, smoking would be banned on Amtrak trains in the same  manner as airline travel. According to the WHO--this is important to  note--there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Even  short-term exposure can potentially increase the risk of heart attacks.  All the more reason to ask the House to support my bill.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support the bill before them.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Mrs. Fletcher), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of my friend from  the other side.   You can see that this is a bipartisan bill, and no wonder. When my  friend was in the majority, a similar bill was supported banning  smoking. This is as quintessentially a bipartisan bill as one could  have in the House, and I very much appreciate the remarks of my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
