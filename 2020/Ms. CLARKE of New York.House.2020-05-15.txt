 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  HEROES Act.   As reported in Newsweek on Tuesday, my beloved Brooklyn has the  distinction of having more deaths due to COVID-19 than any county in  the United States, with a death toll exceeding 46 entire States. Over  4,000 souls have departed due to the dreadful virus.    The HEROES Act provides crucial relief and support for our heroes  fighting COVID-19 on the front lines, who extended to us a lifeline at  great risk to their own lives.   While this legislation does not include the Paycheck Guarantee Act, I  believe that we must pass this bill. This is not the time for red or  blue one-upmanship. COVID knows no political labels. I ask my  colleagues to vote for the HEROES Act.
