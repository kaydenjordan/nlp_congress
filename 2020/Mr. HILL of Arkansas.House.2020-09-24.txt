 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness  about an ongoing issue that is happening at the International Monetary  Fund as it combats COVID-19.   As the lead Republican on the Subcommittee for National Security,  International Development, and Monetary Policy for the House Financial  Services Committee, I invite your attention to a bad policy proposal.   During this time of crisis, the IMF provides financial assistance and  debt service relief to its 189 member countries. As a part of the COVID  relief, some IMF members, particularly China, have been lobbying for  billions in extra relief through a new allocation of Special Drawing  Rights, or SDRs.   SDRs are an international reserve asset used to provide liquidity and  supplement countries' official reserves. And unlike a typical IMF loan,  Mr. Speaker, SDRs do not require repayment. Now, this idea has gained  traction among certain congressional Democrats, notably Senator Durbin  and Representatives Waters and Garcia, who have proposed allocating no  fewer than two trillion SDRs--equivalent to $2.8 trillion--to the IMF's  member countries.   What the Democrats might not fully understand is that if the IMF were  to allocate this additional two trillion SDRs, the allocation would be  made in line with IMF shareholding weights, not financial need.   This means that the bulk of SDRs would not go to the poorest  countries with hundreds of billions of dollars instead going to the  richest nations in the world.                                time  0930    Even worse, Mr. Speaker, $170 billion would go to China, $20 billion  to Iran, $75 billion to Russia, $17 billion to Assad's Syria, and $20  billion to the failed state in Venezuela.   These billions would represent no-strings-attached liquidity for the  world's most brutal dictatorships. However, there is an alternate way  to ensure the IMF is able to provide assistance to countries that truly  need it.   The IMF has two trust funds that can lend or provide grants to the  poorest and most vulnerable countries during emergencies, as we have  with the pandemic. This is the proposal of House Republicans and of the  Trump administration.   Preventing blanket SDR allocations demonstrates that the United  States is a leader to help the poorest nations in the midst of this  pandemic, but also a leader in accountability in our multilateral  institutions. A financial windfall for terrorists and authoritarians is  the wrong approach.                 Historic Breakthrough for Middle East Peace     Mr. Speaker, I was honored to attend the  signing of the historic Abraham Accords at the White House, which  represents a historic breakthrough for peace in the Middle East.  Bahrain and the UAE are the first Arab countries to normalize relations  with Israel in two decades.   I applaud President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Sheikh Mohammed  bin Zayed, and King Hamad Al Khalifa for coming together to achieve  this critical milestone and step forward.   This achievement proves the success of President Trump's undeniable  support for the State of Israel and dedication to U.S. leadership in  the region.   I look forward to continuing to work with the administration and our  allies around the world to build upon these agreements, develop deeper  diplomatic ties, and strengthen our relationships.                          Recognizing Candace Franks     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  career of Candace Franks, who is retiring as the commissioner of the  Arkansas State Bank Commission after 13 years in that top position and  more than 40 years with the Arkansas State Bank Department. I am proud  to have known and worked alongside Candace for over a quarter century.   Candace Franks has been a trailblazer in many regards. Candace is the  first woman to serve as the Arkansas bank commissioner in its 107-year  history, the first professional bank regulator to serve in the  position, and the longest serving commissioner as well.   During Candace's many years of service, she has been a good steward  for Arkansas' funds. In 1980, when she began her career, the  institutions under the Arkansas State Bank Department held $7 billion  in assets. Today, they hold more than $123 billion.   In addition to her work as Arkansas bank commissioner, she serves as  the chairman of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, a member of  the State Board of Finance, and a member of the Board of the Arkansas  Teacher Retirement System.   I thank Candace for her devotion.                            ____________________
