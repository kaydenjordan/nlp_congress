 Mr. President, thank you and a huge thanks to my  colleague for not just deferring to me to make comments, which I am  going to make very brief, but also for the leadership of the  subcommittee and the bipartisan work. It is the way the Senate should  work. Let's just expand that spirit to the entire Chamber, and we will  make a lot of progress.   This bill maintains funding for important rural development programs,  including housing and rural broadband, which is essential all across  America. It provides assistance with farm ownership and farm operating  loans because access to credit to farmers is critical to stay in  business, and it helps new farmers come into the farming and ranching  community, including minorities, women, and veterans.   It provides critical funding for SNAP. In our country, no one should  go hungry. It assists with school meal equipment grants, the Farmer's  Market Nutrition Program, and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program,  all relevant to making sure our children and our families have basic  nutrition. It assists on the international front with Food for Peace,  the McGovern-Dole program that feeds millions of children around the  world.   I was down in Central America and found that the average child in  Guatemala at 9 years old is 6 inches shorter than the average  Guatemalan child raised in the United States--stunning. It is a huge  factor and affects the entire course of the mind. America is doing  incredible work around the world in poverty-stricken countries. This  food program also increases school attendance, particularly among  girls.   Critical funding for the Food and Drug Administration is part of this  bill for a whole host of reasons.   There is only one thing in this bill that I have disagreement with,  and that is funding for the relocation of the National Institute of  Food and Agriculture and the Economic Research Service. I think those  organizations do a far better job when they are here networking with  the other key critical policy groups and when folks coming from Oregon  and places remotely around the country visit NIFA and ERS at the same  time as visiting other programs.                             Tribute to Bob Ross    Mr. President, for 11 years, Bob Ross has been a detailee from the  Department of Agriculture to our subcommittee. That is because he is  fabulous, and we just couldn't let him go here in the U.S. Senate. Most  people in rural America haven't heard of Bob Ross, but millions and  millions have benefited from his work, particularly his superb work on  rural housing. He has been invaluable to us. Few people get a chance to  leave such a mark to make the world a better place as much as he has.   He is on to the next chapter of his life, retirement, and perhaps  many adventures in retirement. Bob is sitting behind me. We thank him  for his years of service and wish him all the best of luck in the  chapters to come.   I thank the chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture.  It is a pleasure to work with him.
