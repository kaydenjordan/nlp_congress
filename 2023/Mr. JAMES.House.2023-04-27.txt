 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the House of April  26, 2023, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 30)  directing the President, pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers  Resolution, to remove all United States Armed Forces, other than United  States Armed Forces assigned to protect the United States Embassy, from  Somalia, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will start by commending both gentlemen from Florida  for their concern about our Nation's ongoing military engagements. It  is one I share as a veteran of the global war on terrorism.   Unfortunately, there are no silver bullets in policymaking, and when  we try to make one, we usually end up shooting ourselves in the foot.  It is for this reason and this reason alone that I stand in opposition.   I served in Operation Iraqi Freedom as an attack helicopter pilot. As  a combat veteran, Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that no one hates war  more than those who have come face-to-face with it. I do not look back  on the days of American military overreach and intervention in the  Middle East with nostalgia.   That said, as a West Point graduate, I understand history and the  lessons it teaches. The siren song of isolationism is tempting, but  allowing vacuums of American influence around the world to be filled by  terrorists and exploited by communists is a direct threat to Americans  at home.   While each Presidential administration has made errors in the conduct  of its foreign policy since the tragedies of 9/11 22 years ago, the  most egregious of these errors is continuing to concede America's  diplomatic leverage and allowing our agricultural, manufacturing, and  energy independence to erode.   It is Congress, this body, that has lazily conceded its  constitutional duty to guard its war powers jealously from the  executive branch. Congress' failure to hold each administration this  century accountable for their vague, broad, and failing foreign  policies may force Congress to exercise our war powers again in my  lifetime.   That is why I agree with Mr. Gaetz, in large part, that war should  never be on autopilot nor open-ended. Americans have the right and  Congress has the responsibility to understand and approve of the  sacrifice that we will be asking our country to make.   Our servicemembers are real people with families. They are sons and  daughters. Many weren't even born when 9/11 occurred.   Congress needs to do its job, but it needs to do its job the right  way. That is why, rather than continuing an open-ended, 22-year-old  law, I believe we must work together to first replace it with an  Authorization for Use of Military Force that focuses on today's  critical terrorist threats and requires Congress to stay engaged.   We must prioritize first building an America that is strong at home,  or we will never have hope of being strong abroad.   Regrettably, my friends, today's resolution does little toward those  ends. It will merely direct the removal of U.S. forces from Somalia.  That will not work.   Less than 2 years ago, we saw what happens when we pull troops with  no plan. Joe Biden's botched Afghanistan withdrawal forced our troops  to abandon billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded military equipment.  It resulted in 13 young American servicemembers dead. It left hundreds  of thousands of American veterans who served in Afghanistan wondering  if their efforts were in vain. It embarrassed America on the world  stage and left a gaping hole that China and the Taliban rushed to fill  in.   What have we learned? The Biden administration responded with the  Commander in Chief checking his watch during a dignified transfer of  servicemembers killed, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin claiming he  had no regrets about the withdrawal.   What have we learned?   Lest my argument be debased or derided as petty partisanship, let me  flip the script.   Mr. Speaker, I ask you, what happened the last time Republicans tried  to repeal something without a plan to replace it?   I tell you the truth: What happened then will pale in comparison to  the consequences of ceding the global strategic high ground of the  future to those who mean to harm us.   I will be the first to argue that we have become overdependent on the  military rather than investing in ourselves, in our industrial base at  home, wielding diplomacy, and harnessing economic statecraft as our  tools of first resort.   There is no global stability when America is economically weak and  militarily impulsive and has a reputation of retreat. The most  devastating effect of abandoning our allies--even now, thousands of our  fellow Americans are on the battlefield--is that our friends don't  trust us and our enemies no longer fear us. If we want nations around  the world to choose America instead of dictators and despots, we must  give them a reason to do so.   This premature withdrawal from Somalia will be a great victory for a  dangerous al-Qaida affiliate that seeks the death of America.   There is another group of adversaries to keep in mind, as well.  Russia and the Communist Party of China would like nothing more than to  see the U.S. take a foreign policy of isolationism. There is already a  Chinese military base on the east coast of Djibouti. There are reports  of more coming to the west coast of Africa, which will pose a direct  threat to America.    If we cavalierly withdraw from Africa, the CCP will rush to fill in  the void like they did in Afghanistan. By emboldening terrorists,  Russia, and Communist China, this resolution would harm the national  security of the United States.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I applaud the gentleman from Florida's initiative  for forcing this long-overdue debate. I also applaud leadership for  allowing it to come to the floor.   I invite the gentleman to work with me to end this executive  overreach of over two decades, to pull back our war powers and Article  I authority under the Constitution in a way that truly puts America  first. As it stands today, regretfully, this resolution will not  strengthen America at home or keep her safe abroad.   It is for that reason, and again, that reason alone, that I urge my  colleagues to join me in opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague, Mr. Gaetz. He makes a series  of great points. The greatest, I believe, is our military cannot be  used to fight an ideology. Unlimited war without checking by Congress  is unconstitutional, and we must come up with a better solution, which  is why the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and me, as the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Africa, recognizes that the DOD doesn't exist in  a vacuum. We recognize that the State Department and USAID are present  in building civilian leaders and institutions. We understand these  institutions must work together with different mandates, and we are not  shooting our way out of Somalia. We must provide additional ways to fix  the problem.   I agree we cannot fight ideology with military. I look forward to  working with all sides to figure out exactly how we can strengthen our  ties to make sure that we have partners and move from aid to trade with  a long-term partner.   We had a rousing speech from the President of South Korea just an  hour ago where he mentioned the great aid that the United States  taxpayers and the great investment that we have made over decades and  years in South Korea. Now as a shining example, they are the 10th most  wealthy country in the world because of America, our great generosity,  and because we are exceptional.   I think we have a remarkable opportunity to do that and show that  America truly should be the first choice and first option for folks  around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Zinke).    Mr. Speaker, I think this is what we call a violent  agreement. We need to fix the ills of the past with a solution for the  future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  McCormick).    Again, Mr. Speaker, I believe we are in violent agreement.   The gentleman from Georgia mentioned, I believe, and it is extremely  appropriate, that this isn't about protecting another nation. It is  about protecting ours.   Today, I think that we are just standing here, and I think if we were  to take the vote on the floor, I am pretty sure that most of our  colleagues would agree that the executive branch is abusing its power  and that we as Congress have ceded our constitutional authority to hold  them to account.   We should absolutely hold the executive branch to account for their  two decades of missteps, but a number of my colleagues and I in the  freshman class have been here but a mere 110 days. I am sure I can  speak for most of us that we refuse to be held bound to the mistakes of  the past.                                time  1330    We are inspired and excited to make sure that we correct those  mistakes of the past with strong policy to benefit the American people  and our allies in the future.   That requires not repealing something without a replacement.   That requires the executive branch to come to us for permission, as  they are constitutionally obligated to do.   It is our duty to retain these authorities, but not proceeding  without an event-based strategy rather than a time-based strategy.   Regrettably, I restate that this resolution does nothing toward those  ends. It merely directs the removal of U.S. forces from Somalia within  a time frame without regard for what may be going on on the ground.  [[Page H2066]]    Again, I applaud and appreciate forcing this debate. It is long  overdue. I respect and thank the gentlemen, Representative Mills for  his service and Representative Gaetz for forcing this very important  debate.   I am looking forward to taking this up with the help of the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Meeks), my friend, in the House Foreign Affairs  Committee to make sure that we can satisfy our obligations, first to  the American people and also to our allies who count on us to take up  the mantle and use global leadership not to be isolationist and also  not to be imperialist but to make sure that we are staying strong at  home first.   Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I have the right to  close, and I will continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, again, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz) and the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mills) are both very well-intentioned on  this resolution today, and I firmly agree that Congress must reassert  its Article I constitutional responsibility to declare war.   This body must replace the 22-year-old counterterrorism AUMF with an  authorization that focuses specifically on the threats that we face  today. Yes, it must be both time and event based because, frankly, when  I heard Representative Gaetz, my colleague and a great patriot as well,  mention this may not be a threat, I got shivers down my spine, and I  remembered something when I heard former President Obama talk about  ISIS as the JV team.   Under this administration, we have wide open borders, and frankly, it  is a direct security threat. I am not comfortable taking our eye off  the ball with an Al-Shabaab that is well funded that has designs on  killing Americans.   This resolution, as a blanket statement, I do not believe  accomplishes very specific, targeted time- and event-  [[Page H2069]]  based goals to keep Americans at home safe.   Our troop presence in Somalia is small, serving primarily in a  training role. It has made critical national security gains. As I will  mention again, I am a big Lions fan, and I learned growing up as a  Lions fan that the reason we all knew the names of the offensive  linemen is because our quarterbacks kept getting sacked. I learned very  early that sometimes the best offensive linemen, the best small units  are the ones you never know their name.   I believe that those nameless, faceless heroes all over the world in  corners that the administration has not justified in 22 years deserve  updated AUMFs with congressional authority and approval in order to  justify their presence putting their lives on the line, being at risk,  and being away from their families.   We all agree that the way we are doing things is wrong and must be  fixed. Let's work together to fix it. We would not even be having this  conversation if not for the courage of my colleagues to stand up and  force the issue, so I personally thank them for forcing this debate. It  is long overdue, and I am excited to do well by our servicemen and - women all over the country.   I again call on my colleagues to please join me in opposition to this  resolution and commit to working with all of our colleagues to make  sure that if the administration wants to send our men and women into  harm's way, they better doggone well come to Congress first.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Roger, my brother. Go Army.   Mr. Speaker, it is in similar fashion that I approach this body out  of respect for American life and our servicemembers, even as I watched  the situation unfold in Sudan with shock nearly 2 weeks ago when rival  forces started fighting in the streets of Khartoum.   It caught our entire diplomatic establishment by surprise, despite  the many risks of trying to get the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid  Support Forces to integrate into one structure.   The fighting has been relentless, and except for a brief window in  which we withdrew our diplomats, every cease-fire has failed to truly  hold. There are pockets of less violence today in Khartoum, but that is  because thousands upon thousands have already fled the bloodshed.   I want to commend the bravery of our brothers and sisters and their  professionalism, those military servicemembers who conducted a  successful extraction of our embassy personnel, flying missions in  Chinooks over 800 miles through the night and accomplishing their  mission flawlessly. It was a remarkable success.   I am glad that our diplomats are now out of harm's way, but there  remains much more work to be done. Unfortunately, that work is not  being conducted with the competency and urgency that the situation in  Sudan demands.   Congress was told thousands of American civilians are still in Sudan,  but the Department of State, as this administration has shown a  penchant for, has left them behind to fend for themselves.   This policy that is furthered by this administration not only leaves  Americans abroad vulnerable, but as targets to those who would hurt and  kill us. This Department of State is proving time and time again that  they are unable to perform their duties confidently. We must look into  this as a body in Congress.   Right now, the Department of State is unable to provide an update of  how many Americans have contacted the department for assistance. They  either can't or they won't. In either case, they will be held to  account.   The Department of State refuses to be honest and transparent about  the structure of the task force, the number of consular offices  answering the need of Americans on the ground, or to describe how those  Americans waiting to get out are being assisted besides updates on the  next foreign flight or vessel.   There are French planes assisting their citizens, there are Chinese  ships assisting their citizens, and there is silence for the cries of  American citizens in Sudan being ignored. In a world where we cannot  shoot our way out of conflicts exclusively, we need our diplomats to  show up and with a plan that will have the full support of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, our President came to this Chamber mere months ago and  told us repeatedly that he wanted to finish the job. It is not clear,  after seeing what is happening in Afghanistan and seeing what is  happening at our borders and seeing what is happening in Sudan that he  ever started the job to begin with. We need the leadership of this body  to stand up for American citizens when this administration will not.
