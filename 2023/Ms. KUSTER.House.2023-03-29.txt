 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 1, the  polluters over people act. I will take my time to point out two glaring  flaws with this bill: First, H.R. 1 will make energy more expensive for  Granite Staters.   Right now, natural gas is the single largest source of electricity in  New England. When natural gas prices go up, electricity prices in New  Hampshire go up, yet H.R. 1 makes it easier for natural gas producers  to export American fuel to foreign adversaries like China. Making it  easier for natural gas companies to export fuel to China, where the  prices are currently higher, will cause U.S. natural gas prices to  rise.   As a result, electricity prices in New Hampshire will rise, too.   My amendment to H.R. 1, which the Rules Committee did not make in  order, would have addressed this problem, but instead of putting  American consumers first, the majority is focused on lining the pockets  of Big Oil and Gas companies.   The solution to our Nation's energy problems is building new low-cost  renewables so we aren't reliant on expensive carbon-polluting forms of  energy.   Second, H.R. 1 is going to actually weaken control on PFAS chemicals.  In New Hampshire, we know just how damaging PFAS can be to our water  supply and the communities that rely upon them. Congress should be  making it more difficult to bring new PFAS chemicals to the market, but  H.R. 1 erodes the chemical review process under the Toxic Substances  Control Act, allowing new PFAS chemicals to come on the market without  any consideration for the danger that they may present to the public.  It is the responsibility of Congress to prevent these dangerous  chemicals from coming to the market.   Rather than wasting our time pursuing legislation that puts polluters  over people, let's focus on coming together.
