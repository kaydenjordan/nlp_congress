 Madam Speaker, President Biden has allowed the American  people and Main Street businesses to suffer while his reckless spending  policies continue to make things even worse.   With this crisis weighing heavy on us all, the President and Senate  Democrats are pushing to add a trillion dollars in higher taxes on Main  Street small businesses. That will only lead to more higher prices,  wage cuts, and supply shortages, exacerbating the inflation problem  significantly.   Instead of working to address America's inflation crisis, House  Democrats will spend this week pushing for trillions more in government  spending, which will only worsen America's inflation crisis further.   Instead of addressing the economic crisis, Democrats are prioritizing  liberal initiatives and increasing Federal spending with some accounts  receiving double-digit and triple-digit percentage increases.   Some of these out-of-touch woke spending priorities include taxpayer- funded abortion. Funding for FDA--the same agency that failed to  prevent the infant formula crisis--has increased 10 percent. And  partisan climate change initiatives, even though the American people  are facing the highest gas prices on record.   The American people don't need any of these far-left priorities.   They need a responsible spending plan.   They need the Biden administration to unleash American energy  independence and domestic production.   They need the Republicans to stop the Biden administration's radical  policies from driving our Nation straight into another recession.  [[Page H6685]]    President Biden's denial of inflation that his policies have created  are leading the Nation straight into said recession.   Last week, June's Consumer Price Index score came out and revealed  that inflation has soared 9.1 percent. That is right, the largest 12- month increase in over four decades. I kind of believe 9.1 percent  might be a lowball number when it gets right down to kitchen-table  issues that regular, everyday Americans have to deal with. So even  though inflation is up by 9.1 percent, the American people are paying  far more for just about everything, such as gas, approximately 44  percent; airline tickets, 33 percent; used cars, 23 percent; hotels, 23  percent; suits, 22 percent; bacon, 18 percent; oranges, 17 percent;  tires, 16 percent; furniture, 15 percent; milk, 15 percent; coffee, 14  percent; deliveries, 14 percent; bread, 14 percent; baby food--if you  can find it--13 percent; soup, 13 percent; cereal, 12 percent; eggs, 10  percent; dry cleaning, 10 percent; then the rents on their homes and  apartments and such, averaging about 30 percent.   And we saw that a little over a year and a half ago, lumber had gone  up quadruple. It is coming back, but it is still double of 2 years ago  for lumber in order to build homes and build anything else.   So where are we at? These outrageous prices are crushing the American  Dream.   Last July, the President claimed that inflation was only transitory;  that if we continued down this administration's path, then prices would  go down again.   Certainly. Right.   Obviously, that was false.   Now it is the blame game: Putin. The war in Ukraine. Gas stations. Or  Republicans. We are not the ones doing the big spending.   Inflation is indeed a tax on all Americans. It is caused by Biden and  the House Democrats' out-of-control spending--trillions without  accountability.   Small businesses can't afford the increase of input costs across the  board. Farmers' fertilizer and all the other things that you would use  to grow something, build something, manufacture something, are driven  at their core by high energy costs. That is at the base of everything,  energy costs.   So workers are effectively--because of all these costs--really seeing  their wages cut. Even though they have seen some increases on paper,  the higher costs of doing everything is hurting low- and middle-income  Americans badly.   What I hear coming out of Sacramento and out of the White House  doesn't seem to be helping. It seems to be more focused on a handful of  agenda items. The religion of climate change--which, by the way, I will  remind you again, carbon dioxide is only 0.04 percent of our  atmosphere.   So we have to get back to business and rely on Americans to do  business and produce things domestically. Let's not import all this  stuff from China. We don't need their stuff. We can make it here. We  can make it efficiently. We can make it more ecologically sound  with our energy than it can be done anywhere else in the world.    Madam Speaker, let's put Americans back to work and let's get the  government off their backs and out of their wallets.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, one in four Americans can't afford to have  their basic needs met now due to high energy costs.   Instead of prioritizing policies that will knock down costs and  provide financial relief to the American people, House Democrats are  doubling down on their woke environmental policies in this week's  spending package.   Far-left spending priorities include a 20 percent increase for the  EPA. This comes right after the Supreme Court ruled that the agency is  to roll back their overreaching, self-endowed authority.   Also in the package, is taking away the status of biomass from our  forests that are on fire all the time--especially this time of year.  The biomass would be a renewable resource to help produce electricity,  et cetera. They want to take that away. So let the forest burn.   It also further restricts offshore oil and gas activities while  increasing oil and gas inspection fees at the same time that President  Biden is over there begging the Saudis to send more imported oil to us.   How is this going to help?   Instead, the Biden administration must end the Federal freeze on oil  and gas leases, fast-track pending LNG export permits, and expedite  approval of all pipeline and energy development.   This will help regular American people with their high costs of doing  business and raising their families.                            ____________________
