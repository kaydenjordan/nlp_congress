 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Hensarling) for yielding time and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill) for bringing this bill, a very important bill, to the floor for a  vote today. Mr. Hill's bill will simplify and streamline one of the  most complicated regulations from Dodd-Frank, the Volcker rule.   The Volcker rule is intended to prevent banks from engaging in risky  investments that do not benefit their customers, also known as  proprietary trading. There are currently five Federal regulatory  agencies implementing the Volcker rule. This has caused overlap,  duplication, and confusion among regulated companies.   The bill on the floor today will ensure that one Federal agency, the  Federal Reserve, is responsible for writing  [[Page H3222]]  this regulation and that each bank's primary regulator will have the  sole enforcement authority for that bank. This will streamline and  simplify this overly complicated rule so financial institutions can  spend more of their time making loans to consumers and businesses and  less time on regulatory compliance.    This bill will also fully exempt our small community banks that  maintain less than $10 billion in assets from the Volcker rule rather  than requiring them to prove a negative.   There are currently 176 banks headquartered in my home State of  Georgia, and all but three of them have less than $10 billion in  assets. This bill will go a long way toward relieving small community  banks in Georgia from unnecessary, complicated, and burdensome  regulation.   This bipartisan bill passed out of committee by a vote of 50-10 with  the support of all the Republicans and the majority of the Democrats. I  urge all my colleagues to support this bill.
