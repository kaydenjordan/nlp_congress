 Mr. Speaker, June 1, that is when the Treasury estimates  that we will no longer be able to fulfill our financial obligations if  Congress has not acted.   Defaulting would have catastrophic consequences on our economy. It  would shake financial markets, send interest rates skyrocketing, risk  millions of jobs, and create higher costs for working families.   We can't allow the full faith and credit of the United States  Government to be called into question by defaulting.   I am encouraged by ongoing conversations and discussions that are  moving us in the right direction, but we need to get this done.   I am committed to being at the table and being ready to work in a  bipartisan way to find short-term and long-term solutions to avert a  crisis and get our fiscal house in order.                            ____________________
