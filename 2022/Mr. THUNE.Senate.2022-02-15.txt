 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the AP headline from last Thursday said it  all: ``U.S. inflation highest in 40 years, with no letup in sight''-- with no letup in sight. That is life in the Democrats' America. In  January, U.S. inflation hit 7\1/2\ percent--the highest inflation since  February of 1982. Inflation has now been above 5 percent for the last 8  months.   There are people raising families today who have never experienced  this  [[Page S684]]  kind of inflation in their entire lifetimes. American families are  hurting--hurting badly. The average American household spent an  estimated $3,500 more last year as a result of inflation--$3,500. That  is a lot of money for an ordinary family--a lot. Everywhere they turn,  families are facing higher prices. Whether it is ground beef for the  chili, bunk beds for the kids' room, or a new car to accommodate a new  addition to the family, higher prices are the order of the day.   The price of chicken is up 10 percent. Pork is up 14 percent. Beef  roasts are up 19 percent. Eggs are up 13 percent. Citrus fruits are up  10 percent. Whole milk is up 8 percent. The list goes on. Furniture and  bedding were up 17 percent. Major appliances are up almost 10 percent.  Tires are up 14 percent. Used cars and trucks are up 40 percent.    And then there are energy prices. Fuel oil is up 46 percent. Gas  prices are up 40 percent. Natural gas is up nearly 24 percent--and on  and on and on.   Predictably, inflation is having its biggest impact on those least  able to afford it. A recent Penn Wharton Budget Model study found that  lower-income houses, on average, faced an even greater spending  increase in 2021 when compared to higher-income households, as a result  of inflation.   It is no wonder 69 percent of Americans disapprove of the President's  handling of inflation. Democrats have talked about wage growth. Here is  the story on wages. Despite wage growth, Americans received a de facto  pay cut in 2021, thanks to inflation. Between January 2021 and January  2022, real average hourly earnings declined by 1.7 percent--a pay cut.   How did we get here? Obviously, the reopening of economies and supply  chain issues have created inflationary pressures for the United States  and countries around the world. But a big part of the reason things are  so bad in the United States today is because Democrats decided to pass  a massive so-called COVID relief bill last March that far exceeded  anything the economy needed. That is right. When Democrats took office  last January, inflation was 1.4 percent, well within the Fed's targeted  inflation rate of 2 percent.   It might have stayed there had Democrats not decided that they needed  to pass a massive and partisan $1.9-trillion spending spree under the  guise of COVID relief mere weeks after Congress had already passed a  major COVID bill--one of five COVID bills, I might add--that passed in  2020, all bipartisan.   The definition of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods  and services. That is exactly the situation Democrats helped create  with their so-called American Rescue Plan. They sent too many dollars  into the economy, and the economy overheated as a result. You don't  have to take my word for it. Let me just quote a recent New York Times  article:         ``The United States has had much more inflation than almost       any other advanced economy in the world,'' said Jason Furman,       an economist at Harvard University and former Obama       administration economic adviser, who used comparable       methodologies to look across areas and concluded that U.S.       price increases have been consistently faster.        The difference, he said--    This is Jason Furman, former Obama administration economic adviser.       The difference, he said, comes because ``the United States'       stimulus is in a category of its own.''    Despite all of this, despite the fact that it was Democrats' massive  March spending spree that helped plunge our economy into this inflation  crisis--there are still Democrats out there who want to double down-- double down--on the strategy that helped get us into this mess in the  first place and pass yet another massive spending spree that would  undoubtedly make this inflation disaster even worse.   ``U.S. inflation highest in 40 years with no letup in sight.''   ``No letup in sight.''   That was the headline. That is where Democrat policies have gotten  us.   I was actually pleased to hear this morning the Democratic leader  come down here and talk about inflation. It seems to be at least--maybe  because of polling or whatever--starting to be realized by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle that this is an issue that is  having a massive and very adverse impact on the pocketbooks of the  American people, particularly low-income Americans, because, you see,  inflation is a tax that hits every American, but it affects and impacts  lower-income and middle-income Americans the most.   The Democratic leader said that Republicans should quit complaining  about inflation and start doing something about it. Well, we obviously  don't have the majority. The Democrat's solution to this, as I pointed  out, is another $5-trillion spending bill. Oh, yeah, that will solve  the problem. Let's flood the zone with another $5 trillion on top of  the $2 trillion already out there, have even more dollars chasing fewer  goods, driving inflation even higher.   One thing we can do, what Republicans have advocated, is let's end  wasteful spending. Let's don't do crazy stuff. Let's don't massively  expand the size of government and flood the economy with more dollars  at a time when inflation is already raging. That is a really simple  solution.   Another solution is not to raise taxes, which is, again, something  Democrats have proposed: raising taxes by $1.5 to $2 trillion to  partially--and I say partially because the cost of $5 trillion doesn't  get compensated for by $1.5-trillion tax increase but tax increases,  nonetheless; all of which, of course, get passed on to consumers,  raising inflationary pressures even more. They want to raise taxes  massively and grow the government and spend money and add about $3  trillion to the debt, which is already $30 trillion. Those are the  solutions of our colleagues on the other side.   I would say, end--stop in its tracks cold--the wasteful spending.  Two, don't raise taxes. Provide some certainty. Maybe even make  permanent a lot of the tax relief that was put in place in the 2017 tax  law. Three--how about this? How about this idea? How about we become  energy independent in America, which is where we were?   We were actually exporting energy in the previous administration for  the first time in American history--at least in my lifetime--where we  actually had energy policies that were producing American energy on a  level that was keeping energy costs low for Americans and enabling us  to actually export energy to other places around the world.   That came to an abrupt end when President Biden came to office.  Democrats got control of both Houses of Congress, and what happened?  First thing, day one--day one in office, first day, first thing he  did--President Biden canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would  have allowed us to get energy fuel oil from where? Our friend, our  neighbor, Canada, the Canadians, and move it through a pipeline to  places across the United States, helping fill the demand with  additional supply that Americans need to power their everyday lives-- first thing in office, first day in office. It hasn't stopped there.   The administration decided that energy, evidently, is evil, at least  if it comes from the ground, and decided to cancel a bunch of projects.  There are all kinds of areas now that are off-limits to energy  exploration, energy production in this country. There are lots of  regulations and permitting things that are slowing down energy  projects, making it more difficult, more expensive to produce American  energy, leading us, leading Americans, to a place we didn't want to be,  a place where we were a few years ago; but we are going hat in hand to  Saudi Arabia, to OPEC countries, saying: Please, please produce more  energy. We need more energy in this country.   What has happened is predictable, and what has happened is this: The  demand for energy in this country is great. We are coming out of a  pandemic. People are going back to work. They need, during the winter  months, to heat their homes. They need fuel to get where they need to  go--transportation--to work, to travel. So the demand for energy is up,  the supply is going down; so what is happening?   Boom. Simple. It is really pretty simple. It is economics. The price  is going up. So the price of oil in this country is now pushing $100 a  barrel. Gasoline prices, as I mentioned, are up 40 percent--40  percent--over a year ago. It is simple math. It is simple economics.  And there are some Democratic Senators now who are suggesting: Let's  just waive the gas tax temporarily--  [[Page S685]]  the gas tax which pays for all the infrastructure that we travel on in  this country and which would leave a huge hole, obviously, in the  highway trust fund, which is critically important to every State in the  Union that depends upon the Federal Government and the highway trust  fund and the fuel tax--to fund the infrastructure that enables our  economy to move and keeps us competitive in the global marketplace.  That is their solution.   Now, it is short-term--short-term, obviously to benefit--to try to  gain some political advantage at a time when people, all of a sudden  now on the other side, are starting to worry. Efforts are being led by  four Democrats who are up for reelection this year. No surprise there  because they have understood now what we know, and that is the American  people are fed up and frustrated--fed up and frustrated with policies  that are driving up the cost of everything that they have to buy, from  the groceries in the store, to the rent that they pay, to the gas they  put in their automobiles. Everything is going up.    Energy factors into almost everything we do. A pound of hamburger  that you buy at the grocery store probably had to get there from  somewhere, unless you live in the middle of the country where some of  us do. But if you live on one of the coasts, you probably had to have  transportation to get it to the destination, so it is factored in--it  is baked in the cost of everything. When fuel prices go up, natural gas  prices go up, when the cost of energy generally goes up, everything  else goes up with it. It is economics.   The solution isn't a short-term political ruse to try and provide  political cover to people who are running for reelection. It is to put  policies in place that encourage American energy independence, that  invest in American energy. That can be done in ways now with  technologies we have that are environmentally friendly.   But we have to be energy independent. We can't depend upon other  countries around the world that are unreliable to fuel and fund and run  our economy. That investment should be here in the United States of  America. And if we solve more of that, we would see less inflation,  lower fuel prices.   If we end the crazy spending ideas and tax ideas coming out of the  other side, we could restore some sanity to this country when it comes  to these out-of-control prices, which is a tax, literally, on every  American and hits particularly hard those who are struggling to make  ends meet.
