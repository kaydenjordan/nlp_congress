 Mr. President, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to hold  our Nation on high alert.   More than 1.4 million Americans have been infected; more than 80,000  lives have been tragically lost; and the livelihoods of tens of  millions of working families have been turned upside down in what seems  like the blink of an eye. Our Nation's healthcare system has not been  stressed by contagion on this scale in over a century, and unemployment  has not been this high since the Second World War.   A new generation of American heroes--from medical professionals, to  lab researchers, to grocery store workers, to custodians and janitors,  to community volunteers--has been called up to the frontlines to serve  its neighbors and our country. So, for several weeks now, the Senate  has counted ourselves among those ranks of essential workers. They are  showing up for our country, so we are showing up for them. With respect  to the pandemic itself, we are conducting rigorous oversight of the  Senate's historic CARES Act rescue package and are helping to plan the  pivot toward reopening.   Last week, Chairman Alexander and the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions engaged with Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Admiral  Giroir, and other top experts to discuss paths for schools and  businesses to reopen, and numbers of our colleagues are joining me and  Senator Cornyn in thinking proactively about the issue of legal  liability that could crush the recovery on the runway. We need strong  legal protections to ensure that our historic recovery efforts are not  drained away from healthcare workers, schools, and universities or  small businesses in order to line the pockets of trial lawyers.   At the same time, we have kept our eye on the ball on other  significant global challenges. Last week, on a bipartisan basis, the  Senate reauthorized critical surveillance authorities for our national  security professionals. We also made sure to include important new  reforms to begin to address the abuses that marred the 2016 election,  [[Page S2470]]  the disturbing details of which are continuing to come to light every  day. Our action on that subject is not finished.   Thanks to leadership from Senator Rubio, we passed legislation to  continue ratcheting up the pressure on the Chinese Communist Party. In  this case, our bill will shed new light and impose new consequences for  the egregious abuses against the Uyghur people and other Muslim  minorities. We also confirmed well-qualified nominees to important  roles at the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Homeland Security, and  the Department of Housing and Urban Development.   In other words, we have done more for the American people in 2 weeks  on this side of the Capitol than the House of Representatives has done  in the last 2 months. In the two months that the House Democrats have  spent away from their duty stations, they have seemingly given  themselves just one assignment--to draft an enormous political  messaging bill and brand it as coronavirus relief.   Yet, even on this basis, they have failed. The 1,800-page doorstop  that Speaker Pelosi dropped last week was appropriately greeted as the  legislative equivalent of a standup comedy. There were tax hikes on  small businesses in the midst of a small business crisis, and there  were targeted tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the bluest States.  There were two separate taxpayer-funded studies on diversity and  inclusion in the market for marijuana. In sum, it was a $3 trillion  wish list slapped together in a clumsy effort to never let a good  crisis go to waste--serious work here in the Senate and partisanship  pointlessness over in the House.   The Senate will stay on course and continue our serious work at this  serious time. Tomorrow morning, our colleagues on the Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs will hear from Secretary Mnuchin  and Fed Chairman Powell on the latest status of the CARES Act  implementation efforts. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee will meet this week to consider the nomination of Brian  Miller to serve as Special Inspector General for the pandemic recovery  programs. The Special Committee on Aging will be examining the  challenges facing American seniors during this pandemic as both the  virus itself and the social distancing measures take a heavy toll on  older Americans. Of course, we will continue to uphold our  responsibilities beyond the scope of COVID-19. We will consider more  nominations to the Federal Election Commission and to the Federal  bench.   Tomorrow, our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee will vote on  reporting the nomination of   John Ratcliffe to serve as Director of  National Intelligence. This role is essential for monitoring and  countering evolving threats from Russia to China, to terrorist groups,  and for ensuring the intelligence community's important work is not  tainted by partisan bias or political weaponization.   We have a busy week ahead of us. This pandemic is not going to defeat  itself; a careful reopening will not plan itself; and our Nation's  other challenges are not about to politely step aside in the meantime.  All kinds of American heroes across the country are tackling the  coronavirus head on. We are going to do all we can to keep them safe  and supported while they do.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
