 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, and I do so  without hesitation or reservation. I do so because there is no way that  we could stand idly by and watch the horror that is being heaped upon  our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.   Rather than just wringing our hands and talking about how unfortunate  it is, we are doing something about it. We are bringing aid and help  and assistance.   I am proud to be part of a country that looks out not only for itself  but recognizes that we either stand for something or we fall together.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her leadership. I also must  thank the country of Poland. I thank Poland for standing up in the face  of dire circumstances.
