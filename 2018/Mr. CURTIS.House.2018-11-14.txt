 Mr. Speaker, as we recognize Veterans Day this week, I  would like to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Major Brent  Taylor.   Major Taylor and I had the great privilege of serving together as  mayors of each of our hometowns in Utah.   Brent first enlisted after the terrorist attacks on September 11 and  quickly became a major in the National Guard. He served in Afghanistan  and twice in Iraq before returning to Afghanistan for what would become  his fourth and final tour.   On November 3, Major Taylor was tragically killed in an insider  attack by one of those he was trying to help.   As our communities, State, and Nation mourn this tragic loss, his  dear wife, Jennie, reminded us why so many choose to serve this great  country. In her words:         The price of freedom surely feels incredibly high to all       those of us who know and love our individual soldier. But the       value of freedom is immeasurable to all who know and love       America, and all that she represents.    Let us never forget those who have given their lives, their families,  and their futures for our precious freedoms.   May God bless the Taylor family and others who grieve, and may God  bless America.                            ____________________
