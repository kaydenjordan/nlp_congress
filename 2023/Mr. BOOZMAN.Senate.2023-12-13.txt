 Madam President, I rise today to recognize Rogers  Fire Chief Tom Jenkins whose service and dedication will be missed  following his retirement.   Tom has been a firefighter for 26 years, serving as chief of the  Rogers Fire Department since 2009. He has truly lived out his childhood  dream of becoming a firefighter and exceeded his young expectations.   As fire chief, he has worked tirelessly to develop and grow the  department to fit the needs of the community. He advanced the  department's medical services and improved the training of paramedics  and firefighters to better serve Rogers residents. By making each  ambulance a mobile emergency room and equipping each firetruck with  medical equipment, he made sure citizens can get assistance no matter  what type of emergency they are experiencing.   During his tenure, he successfully led the city to earning a class 1  rating by the Insurance Services Office. This accomplishment helped  save property owners money as a result of the department's hard work  and commitment to excellence.   Tom's leadership extends beyond Rogers. He served at the request of  Arkansas Governors Mike Beebe and Asa Hutchinson on several State  safety commissions and groups. He also served on the board of directors  for the International Association of Fire Chiefs as second vice  president. In 2017, he was elected president and chairman of the board.  In this role, he traveled around the world observing other fire  departments.   Tom is a humble servant who is always quick to give credit to the  dedicated men and women he works with. He has seen the department  through tremendous growth in the community, a pandemic, and more. He  imparted a feeling of trust to citizens. They know when Rogers  firefighters are on scene, they are in good hands.   While he will be missed, he has certainly earned a well-deserved  retirement. Chief Jenkins demonstrated the true meaning of dedication,  passion, and public service. I wish him the best of luck in his future  endeavors.                            ____________________
