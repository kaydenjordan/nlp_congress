 Mr. Speaker, today National Security Advisor John  Bolton eliminated the position of special assistant to the President  and cybersecurity adviser. I could not more strongly disagree with that  decision.   As the co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, I have  followed the work of the executive branch very closely on this issue  over many years. I have had my critiques of President Bush, of  President Trump, and, yes, even of President Obama.   But always, from President Clinton through the current  administration, I have always felt that we are moving in the right  direction in better protecting the country in cyberspace--even if too  slowly and with a few bumps along the way   Today, we took a giant step backwards.   Cybersecurity, Mr. Speaker, is the economic and national security  challenge of the 21st century, and as such,  [[Page H3958]]  we need to be increasing our focus on it, not weakening it.   I have respected and admired the work of our three cybersecurity  coordinators, the late Howard Schmidt, Michael Daniel, and President  Trump's pick, Rob Joyce. I am sorry that their legacy is being  tarnished today.   I have introduced legislation with my friend, Mr. Lieu, to reinstate  and empower the coordinator position, and I hope that the House moves  to take it up quickly. Our national security demands no less.                            ____________________
