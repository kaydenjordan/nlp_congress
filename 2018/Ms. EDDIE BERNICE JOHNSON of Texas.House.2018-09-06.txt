 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute and to honor the legacy of my dear colleague, the Honorable  Ronald V. Dellums. Although it saddens my heart to see that we have  lost another great trailblazer, I would be remiss if I didn't take the  time to honor his life and the change he brought to this great country.   Dellums was not only a patriarch for the Congressional Black Caucus,  but he was trailblazer for change all around the world. With a  political career of over forty years, he was determined to help those  around him and provide hope for his community. As a former member of  the Berkeley City Council, United States House of Representatives, and  mayor of Oakland, Dellums always inspired to pave the way for the next  generation to be advocates and a voice.   During his 14 years in the U.S. House of Representatives he became  the first African American to chair the Armed Services Committee.  Dellums used this platform not for his own benefit, but to create an  agenda to ensure civil rights and programs for people ahead of weapons  systems and warfare. He was also the antiwar activist to hold that  post. As a Congresswoman who proudly stands in the gap for my  constituents, I always admired how Congressman Dellums fought hard and  served his constituents with distinction and treated his colleagues  with the utmost respect. He was determined to share his light with the  world.   As a dedicated leader in human rights and civil rights in America and  around the world, Congressman Dellums worked tirelessly to pass anti- apartheid legislation against South Africa. After a 14-year campaign  against apartheid in South Africa, he wrote the 1986 legislation that  mandated trade embargoes and divestment by American companies and  citizens of holdings in South Africa.   Congressman Dellums was not only a leader; he was a person of  incredible intellect who possessed the ability to build alliances with  people and groups from diverse backgrounds and varying interests. He  was a co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, which he chaired  from 1989-1991, and a co-founder of the Congressional Progressive  Caucus in 1991. After retiring from Congress he remained involved and  determined to be a light for his people. He worked in the private  sector on global aids, healthcare and transportation. He returned then  to his native Oakland, in 2006, and was elected Mayor, serving one term  and retiring from elective office in 2011.   I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Congressman  Dellums for his outstanding and dedicated service.                            ____________________
