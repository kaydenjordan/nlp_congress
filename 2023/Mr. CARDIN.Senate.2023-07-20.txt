 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, yesterday was the last work day for Tricia  Engle, our beloved assistant Democratic secretary. Tricia is leaving  the Senate after 26 years of devoted service. I would like to take this  opportunity to thank her and wish her well as she embarks on the next  adventure in her life.   If Tricia were a Senator, she would rank ninth in Senate seniority,  in-between Senator Collins and Leader Schumer. She arrived here in July  1997, shortly after graduating from South Dakota State University. She  started in the Senate as a staff assistant for her home State Senator,  then-Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. Within a few months, she went to  work in the Democratic cloakroom and then became a floor assistant for  Leaders Daschle, Reid, and Schumer before becoming assistant secretary  in 2019.   The Senate, as we all know, is not the most ``family-friendly''  institution, but Tricia has managed to raise two fine boys, William and  Garrison, while working here. And she managed to earn her M.A. and  M.B.A. from Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School in 2010, an  extraordinary accomplishment when you consider the long hours and  unpredictability of the Senate schedule.   Tricia knows Senate rules and procedure as well as anyone and has  been indispensable to me and so many other Senators. Our landmark  legislation such as the Affordable Care Act, COVID-19 pandemic relief,  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction  Act, and so many other bills have Tricia's fingerprints on them. Day  after day, month after month, year after year, Tricia has been in the  cloakroom, on the floor, or in the well, deftly negotiating unanimous  consent agreements, figuring out how to get amendments up or cleared,  and working with her Republican counterparts to help the Senate  function. Through it all--from all-night votearamas to the January 6  insurrection--Tricia has been cool, calm and collected, never losing  her temper even in the most heated moments, always offering the best  advice any Senator or staffer could ask for with regard to Senate  procedure and precedents. She is always friendly, quick to help, and  reassuring.   We Senators are the focus of public attention, but there are so many  staffers like Tricia who make the Senate run. They work hard and mostly  anonymously, driven by a strong sense of public service and love for  our country and this institution. I have said many times that our  Federal workforce, which includes congressional staff, is one of our  Nation's most important--and least appreciated--assets. It consists of  people like Tricia. I am grateful for her wise counsel and friendship  over the years. I am also grateful to her family for allowing Tricia to  be part of the Senate family for the last 26 years. She leaves us  universally well-liked, respected, and accomplished--a testament to her  many fine qualities. Senators and staff--Republicans and Democrats-- will miss her, but she certainly has earned a respite from life here in  the Senate. I know all my colleagues join me in thanking her for her  extraordinary service and wishing her and her family all the best  moving forward.
