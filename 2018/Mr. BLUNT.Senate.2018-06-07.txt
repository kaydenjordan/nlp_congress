 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Red  Schoendienst, who in passing leaves behind a lifetime of commitment to  baseball, the St. Louis Cardinals, and the St. Louis community.   Red Schoendienst began his major league career with the St. Louis  Cardinals in 1945, after spending only 2 years with the Albany  Cardinals, the franchise's minor league affiliate. His star rose  quickly within the franchise and the league, winning the 1946 Home Run  Derby and, in the same year, participating in the Cardinals' World  Series victory over the Sox.   In his 19 seasons as a player, Red compiled a storied list of  accomplishments, including being named to 10 All Star teams, but his  contributions to the sport did not end when he retired his bat. He  would return to the Cardinals as a coach in 1964 and managed the team  from 1965-1976. He led the team to multiple World Series victories and  National League pennants, and he was named National League manager of  the year in both 1967 and 1968. After 2 years coaching the Oakland  Athletics, he returned to the Cardinals to coach from 1977-1995. For  the next two decades, Schoendienst would wear the Cardinals ``Birds on  the Bat'' before home games and in spring training as a special  assistant to the general manager.   Red Schoendienst was one of the greatest Cardinals of all time,  having been a Red Bird as a player, coach, and manager. The Cardinals  retired his No. 2 in 1996. St. Louis recognized him with his induction  into the St. Louis Walk of Fame in 1998. His legacy was not only  engrained in the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989, but also  in the memories of teammates, colleagues, and fans who had the  privilege of seeing his accomplishments and his great smile.   To quote the Schoendienst family upon his passing: ``He inspired all  that knew him to always do their best. Red was a great ball player, but  his legacy is that of a great gentleman who had respect for all. He  loved his family, friends, teammates, the community and his country. He  will be greatly missed.''   To Red Schoendienst's family, thank you for sharing him with the St.  Louis Cardinals, St. Louis community, baseball, and baseball fans. Red  Schoendienst was a great gentleman, a great sportsman, a great  competitor, and he will be greatly missed.                            ____________________
