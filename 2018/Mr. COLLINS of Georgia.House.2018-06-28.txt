 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 971 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 971         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order without intervention of any point of order to       consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 970) insisting       that the Department of Justice fully comply with the       requests, including subpoenas, of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence and the subpoena issued by the       Committee on the Judiciary relating to potential violations       of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by personnel of       the Department of Justice and related matters. The resolution       shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble to       adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of       the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary or their respective designees.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on House Resolution 971, under current  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, this morning I am pleased to  bring forward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule  provides for consideration of H. Res. 970, which insists that the  Department of Justice comply with the request of the Judiciary and  Intelligence Committees. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate,  equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from  Congressman  Jim Jordan, a fellow Judiciary Committee member, as well  as Ranking Member Jerry Nadler. We also heard from Congressman Mark  Meadows and Congressman Scott Perry and engaged in a vigorous  discussion that lasted a while in the Rules Committee yesterday.  [[Page H5821]]    Mr. Speaker, oversight of the executive branch is one of the House's  most important responsibilities and authorities. As a member of the  Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the Department of Justice  and the FBI, it is a responsibility that I take very seriously.   I believe the administration has an obligation to comply with the  committees of jurisdictions' legitimate oversight requests and  subpoenas. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has not fully  complied with numerous of these requests, many of these which stretch  back several months. To illustrate this, let me lay out a timeline for  you.   On November 3, 2017, Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Gowdy, along  with additional Members, sent a letter to the Attorney General and  Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, requesting five specific  categories of documents. The deadline listed in the letter was November  17, 2017. That deadline was not met.   On December 12, 2017, Chairman Goodlatte, Chairman Gowdy, and  additional Members sent a letter reiterating the expectation that the  Department of Justice provide the requested documents. The deadline  listed in that letter was December 19, 2017. Again, the deadline  arrived, and again, the deadline was not met.   On February 1, 2018, Chairman Goodlatte sent a third letter  requesting documents relating to potential abuses under the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act.   On March 22, 2018, the Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein compelling him to produce  documents and communications referring to internal DOJ or FBI  management requests to review, scrub, report on, or analyze any FISA  collection involving the Trump campaign or the Trump administration.                                time  0915    It also compelled the production of communications relating to  defensive briefings provided by the Department of Justice or the FBI to  the 2016 Presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.   Finally, he compelled production of all documents and communications  referring to proposed, recommended, or actual FISA coverage on the  Clinton Foundation or persons associated or in communication with the  Clinton Foundation. The deadline for this subpoena was April 5, 2018.  The Department of Justice is in the process of complying with this  subpoena, but complete compliance has not yet occurred.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that, in regard to the subpoena, the  Department of Justice is trying to comply and is in the process of  doing so but, yet, has not at this point.   I also share the frustration of my colleagues and the American people  that this process is taking way too long. We need the answers, and we  need transparency. It is our duty to conduct oversight. The law charges  us with shining light where the government has fostered shadows instead  of providing answers. The Department of Justice has a responsibility to  produce these documents and yet has not made them available.   The resolution provided for by this rule speaks to the core of our  democracy, the inherent tension between branches of government that our  Founders intended and our responsibility as a coequal branch to act as  a check upon the other branches.   Could this debate not happen at a more appropriate time as we look  toward the Fourth of July and our country's founding? This is why we  were set up the way we were.   The inherent tension has arisen most recently out of the Department  of Justice's failure to timely comply with congressional oversight.  Some of the documents this body seeks relate to congressional inquiries  that have extended almost the length of the 115th Congress. They deal  with some of the most pressing issues in our government today.   Has the Department of Justice abused its FISA authority?   Was an investigation of national importance affected by bias?   I believe that these investigations need to play out, but I also  believe they can't last forever. I also believe that evidence of bias,  a library of extremely troubling texts, and key personnel removals at  the FBI illustrate the heightened need for robust congressional  oversight.   As James Wilson, an architect of the Constitution and Associate  Justice on the first Supreme Court so eloquently stated: ``The House of  Representatives . . . form the grand inquest of the state. They will  diligently inquire into grievances, arising both from men and things.''  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I will continue to take that  charge seriously.   Yesterday, the Judiciary Committee considered a similar resolution.  Today, the whole House has a chance to responsibly exercise its  oversight responsibility and reiterate to the Department of Justice the  need to fully comply with our legitimate requests.   It is important to note that the House Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence has been similarly stymied by delays to requests for  information and that certain documents have been provided to only  select members of that committee.   This resolution insists that the Department of Justice comply with  the requests, including subpoenas, of these committees--one of which I  proudly serve on--so that the American people can get answers and we  can exercise our proper constitutional duties. The American people  demanded answers, and that is why Congress, Representatives of the  American people who answer to the American people, are demanding that  the DOJ answer to us.   Let this also serve as a reminder to the Department of Justice that  the U.S. Congress was created by our Founders, and its authority and  responsibility arise directly from Article I of the United States  Constitution.   The Department of Justice, on the other hand, was created by  Congress. Its powers arise from those given to it by Congress. And just  as those powers are given by Congress, it is Congress' responsibility  to ensure that they are not abused; and, if necessary, it is Congress'  responsibility to limit these powers.   Woodrow Wilson, who was among the first to use the term ``oversight''  in reference to the investigation of the executive branch, stated:         Quite as important as legislation is vigilant oversight of       the administration.    Today, we show that we are taking oversight of the executive branch  seriously, particularly the Department of Justice, and we are working  to prevent bias in government. We demand accountability because the  American people deserve no less.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    At this point in time, as the gentleman from  Massachusetts and I have discussed many times--and he has his opinions  on things and process; I have mine as well--we can agree and disagree.  But I think one thing is let's take a step forward today.   This is a process of what we are doing forward. We are warning and  requiring  [[Page H5823]]  from an Article I to an Article II agency. Let's do that and continue  that process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. If the  gentleman is ready to close, I will be as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, we can discuss this and continue to discuss it, as we  have.   I respect my friend from Massachusetts and his opinion and the issues  of transparency. I want to see that same transparency. I want to see us  work. And I think we have an opportunity to do that. By saying that we  bring this rule and this resolution here today, to disparage this  institution, when we are asking for what we are required and can't get,  I am not sure how that is.   Now, we can discuss other issues you want to investigate and other  areas you want to go to, and you can do that and we can discuss things,  but there is nothing undermining the investigation. The Mueller  investigation is still going on, the FBI investigation. All of that is  still going on. Nothing is undermining it except the DOJ that has had  obvious issues of telling the truth and obvious issues of not giving us  the documents we have requested. This is Article I, Article II.   We can have discussions about everything else. And I know if I were  in a position on the other side, I would want everything investigated,  because when you have seen what we have been able to do in the last  year and a half with the economy, with jobs, with regulations, with  small business, when you start looking at that, I would yell at  everything else, too, Mr. Speaker, because the President has done what  he said he was going to do. And our economy is better, our jobs are  better, and we are working toward a system in which America is safer.   But I would also want to investigate everything else, too, because if  I was going into a cycle, I would want to throw off and look other  places and tell the American people things aren't really right when  they know that it is.                                time  0945    Also, the American people, when I go back home to Georgia, want to  know: If the Congress asks an agency for documents, why do they not get  to produce them?   And don't go to the fact, well, it is classified.   We have SCIFs up here. We have got classified areas up here. What is  problematic here is we are hiding behind the fact of things that look  like--after they are produced, after they are compelled to produce--it  looks like they are just trying to keep it from us to hide  embarrassment, and that is not a reason to hide documents.   So we have a simple proposal here. Do what you are required to do.  Let Congress be the oversight that it is supposed to be, and we can  discuss whatever else we want to for oversight. That is the part of two  parties working.   But in this one, this is pretty simple. You can vote ``no'' and say  no, Congress shouldn't do that, in an area in which we have  responsibility and oversight protection. If you want to do that, go  right ahead.   Again, when you want to throw off everything else in the world--I  think it is when you look at the President and you look at the  administration and you look at what we have done in the last 18\1/2\  months, you see a light at the end of a tunnel, you see an economy  coming back, you see a good thing for businesses and small businesses.   When people get up and do not care, Mr. Speaker, what happens on this  floor. They really don't. All they want to do is get up in the morning,  get their families ready, pay their bills, get a good job, have a  possibility of a promotion, or go start that business they want to  have. We have provided that.   Now, up here, in the internal workings of government, in the mesh of  web that is inside this beltway, when you have got a government agency  and government employees who do not want to do what they are supposed  to do, it is time for Congress to act. That is exactly what we are  doing today.   John Stuart Mill stated: ``The proper office of a representative  assembly is to watch and control the government, to throw the light of  publicity on its acts, to compel a full exposition and justification of  all of them which any one considers questionable.''   Today the Republicans in the House are doing that, Mr. Speaker. We  are taking our oversight responsibilities seriously. We are abiding by  the checks  [[Page H5825]]  and balances of the Constitution to ensure that the government is  acting appropriately to ensure that the American people--who, by the  way, we represent--have the answers that they deserve, one way or the  other.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 971 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       6238) to secure the rights of public employees to organize,       act, concertedly, and bargain collectively, which safeguard       the public interest and promote the free and unobstructed       flow of commerce, and for other purposes. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6238.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
