 Mr. Speaker, here we go again, voting on an  appropriations package without funding Yucca Mountain because the  Federal Government will not follow the law passed by Congress.   It is the law of the land to store the Nation's nuclear waste in a  long-term repository, and Yucca Mountain is the site that was chosen by  the Federal Government to store that.   Now, the government wants the American people to follow the mandates  recommended by the CDC, but they won't follow a duly-passed law. Let's  be clear: It doesn't matter whether the Republicans or the Democrats  control the House of Representatives or the White House, the law is  ignored because of the politics of Nevada.   The terminology the other side uses, ``The science is settled,''  well, the science is settled with regard to Yucca Mountain. It was  settled a long time ago.   It is settled with reprocessing, too. But short of that, we need to  do something with the waste that sits beside the pristine waters of  Lake Erie, the Savannah River, Lake Keowee in my district, and  waterways all across this great land.                                time  1145    I have got a question for my colleagues, Republican and Democrat: How  much have the utility rate payers in your State forked out for nothing?  Nothing.   I can tell you, in South Carolina, it is over $3 billion. I can tell  you that nationwide, it is about $40 billion.   And, folks, we are not just talking about spent fuel, which sits at  121 sites in 39 States. There is also yucky stuff sitting at Savannah  River site, Idaho Flats and Oak Ridge and Hanford, Washington, that has  been turned to glass.   Let's put that glass and the spent fuel where the Nation decided by  law that we should put that, and that is Yucca Mountain.
