 Mr. President, it is my privilege to honor an  esteemed group of Americans for their courageous stand against the  horrors of segregation.   It has been said that those about to make history can't possibly  comprehend the impact their actions will have on the world; but I think  that in this case, the opposite was true. The heroes I honor today  weren't fighting to cross a threshold, but for something far more  fundamental: the dignity and freedom granted by our Lord God to all  men, women, and children. It was a moment of hope and profound  consequence that rippled across the country and embraced the potential  of future generations.   On behalf of the entire Tennessee congressional delegation, I would  like to thank the following Tennesseans for their tremendous  contribution to the fight against hatred:         Jo Ann Crozier Allen Boyce,        Bobby Cain,        Anna Theresser Caswell,        Ronald Gordon ``Poochie'' Hayden,        Minnie Ann Dickie Jones,        William R. Latham,        Alvah Jay McSwain,        Regina Turner Smith,        Maurice Soles,        Robert Thacker,        Gail Ann Epps Upton, and        Alfred Williams, who comprise the ``Clinton 12'';        Dr. Ahmed Alhamisi (Lawrence Graham),        Rufus Graham,        L.C. Gipson,        Emma McCaskill,        Ernestine Avery,        Margaret Strickland Guinn,        Eugene Hawkins,        Mary Mahone Bohanon,        Ethel Davidson Sykes,        Monroe Jones,        Leroy Justice,        Maxine Officer,        Alma McKinney Stevens,        Archie Lee,        Dorothy Kirk Lewis,        Eloise Mitchell,        Edward Lewis Threat,        Charles Walker,        Shirley Hawkins Lawrence,        Barbara Jean Sims Thomas,        Jessie McClanahan,        Webster Jackson,        John D. Ghosten, Jr.,        Evindies Copeland,        Mattie L. Scales, and        Joe West, Jr.,        who comprise the living membership of the ``Oak Ridge 85'';       and the late Reverend Paul Turner, whose bravery and defiance       on December 4, 1956, advanced the cause of integration on       behalf of countless generations of young Black Americans.    I pray the American people will hold close the example set by these  freedom fighters. I thank them for their bravery, their sacrifice, and  above all their belief that love can overcome irredeemable evil, if  only we have the courage to welcome it in.                            ____________________
