 Madam President, I rise today to speak about a dedicated  husband, father, son, public servant, and Marylander, Chris Allen.   Sadly, Chris passed away last week. He was 58 years old. He leaves  behind a wife Lynda-Marie, and two daughters, Sophie and Lucie.   Chris spent years in the office of my friend Senator Roberts,  relentlessly advocating on behalf of his constituents. More recently,  he worked for Senator Grassley on the Republican staff of the Senate  Finance Committee, where he pushed for pragmatic policy solutions to  improve the life of retirees and the pension system.   Those of us who were lucky enough to know Chris know he lifted the  spirits of those around him through his wry sense of humor and  infectious positivity. At work, he was experienced, passionate, and  knowledgeable about his work, always searching for good policy with  bipartisan support.   For those lucky enough to work with Chris, he made lifelong friends  and allies. He will not soon be forgotten.   The world is a little less upbeat without Chris here. I hope you will  join me in praying for his family and friends.                            ____________________
