 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 3749) to amend the Congressional  Accountability Act of 1995 to reform the procedures provided under such  Act for the initiation, review, and resolution of claims alleging that  employing offices of the legislative branch have violated the rights  and protections provided to their employees under such Act, including  protections against sexual harassment, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
