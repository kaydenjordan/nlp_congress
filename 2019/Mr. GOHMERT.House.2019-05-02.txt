 Madam Speaker, we had an interesting debate and  interesting vote today regarding the Paris climate change agreement  that is a treaty. It hasn't been properly treated like a treaty, just  like the Iran treaty was a treaty.   No matter whether the House or the Senate agreed to violate the  Constitution and treat the Iran treaty in exactly the opposite format  as required by the Constitution, it doesn't matter. It was treaty. It  was never properly ratified.   It doesn't matter whether it was a Republican or a Democrat who came  up with the bill. A Republican Senator or House Member cannot come up  with a bill that changes the Constitution and say: Do you know what? We  are going to take this treaty and act like you have to have two-thirds  to vote it down instead of two-thirds to ratify it.   But that is what they did, so the President did exactly the right  thing. It was time to stop giving billions of dollars in both direct  money aid to the largest sponsor of terrorism, Iran.   It was also time to reimpose the sanctions that had basically brought  Iran to its knees begging for help. Well, the Obama administration  helped them in two ways: number one, allowing them to pursue nuclear  capabilities, just doing it privately.   I am one of three people who met with the two main inspectors from  the IAEA over in Europe, and they would issue the statement each time  that they had seen no evidence that Iran was developing nukes. They  were asked the question: Did you see the military facilities that they  keep so hidden in secret and where their nuclear development would be  occurring?   In response, they said: No. Gee, they gave us a video that they said  came from there, but we had never been allowed to examine the  facilities.   So the IAEA was not allowed to examine the facilities where nuclear  weapons would have been developed, probably were being developed.   From Iran's standpoint, based on how ridiculous the agreement was and  knowing their mentality of cheating, certainly they would have been  pursuing nuclear weapons, whether or not  [[Page H3433]]  they would wait for 10 years before actually going public with actually  having nuclear weapons.    But I even asked: Okay. The Obama administration sent them $150  billion in cash. Say, hypothetically, Iran decided, ``We will just take  some of that $150 billion and buy us one, two, three, four, five nukes  from North Korea or from Pakistan.''   We know that during those final years of the Obama administration  that Iran had met with Pakistani officials and with North Korean  officials, so that was certainly a possibility, but I wondered if the  IAEA had a capability of noting and discovering if Iran were to import  a nuclear weapon from, say, North Korea or Russia or Pakistan.  Apparently, unless the Iranians brought their new nuclear weapons  immediately near the detection equipment, there would be no way to know  that Iran bought nuclear weapons.   So, to anyone who used reason in dealing with the largest supporter  of terrorism in the world, responsible for killing so many precious  American military members and others, President Trump did a great  thing. He did the right thing. It was a great thing to do for America's  future safety; it was a great thing to do for the world's safety; and  it was absolutely a helpful thing to do for the nation of Israel. So  that was smart.   We have had these different climate accords, and what so many of them  have in common, basically, was, gee, we will pay the world lots of  money, supposedly some type of guilt money, even though we have been  more philanthropic than any other country in the history of the world.   To any astute eye examining the state of the world and world history,  it becomes very clear that the only countries that are able to do  anything about pollution on the planet are countries that have a  strong, vibrant economy. Countries that are struggling are doing all  they can to put people to work and to survive. They just can't spare  the money to clean up the environment.   You have got countries like China and India, massive polluters, and  under these accords, heck, China wouldn't even have requirements for  them to clean things up until 2030, and by then, there would be all new  agreements that would probably give China even more time.   These accords appear to be geared to do one thing: do damage to the  economy of the one country that is doing so much to clean up carbon  emissions and to clean up pollution.   I have an article here from Forbes. This is back in the fall of 2017.  Yes, the U.S. leads all countries in reducing carbon emissions--and  that was 10 months into the Obama administration--but, as the  Environmental Protection Agency announced, we are leading the world  with respect to our CO2 footprint in reductions.   The Washington Post fact-checked this claim and rated it three  Pinocchios, which means they rate the claim mostly false.   They further wrote that Pruitt's usage of data appeared to be a  deliberate effort to mislead the public. But the data mostly supports  Pruitt's claim. You have to consider the source, Madam Speaker.   Just like during my days on the bench as a felony judge, major civil  litigation, it was all about the credibility of the witness.   As we have seen, The Washington Post is exceedingly biased and  slanted in their reporting, so we need a source that gives Pinocchios  to The Washington Post.   If you look at the 2017 BP Statistical Review of World Energy, since  2005, annual U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have declined by 758 million  metric tons. That is, by far, the largest decline of any country in the  world over that time span, and it is nearly as large as the 770 million  metric ton decline for the entire European Union.   By comparison, the second largest decline during that period was  registered by the United Kingdom, which reported a 170 million metric  ton decline. So we had a 758 million metric ton decline in carbon  emissions in that year, and the U.K. was second. They were not quite up  to our 758 million metric tons. They were at 170 million metric ton  decline.   But, at the same time, China's carbon dioxide emissions grew--that is  grew--by 3 billion metric tons, and India's grew by 1 billion metric  tons.   So we are over here in the United States trying not to destroy our  economy and yet cleaning up the environment more than anybody else in  the world, and this ridiculous accord--really, a treaty--allows the  biggest polluters in the world to keep polluting much more, just either  one of those, than the rest of the world.                                time  1300    It is just phenomenal.   The article goes on: ``The Washington Post gets into per capita  emissions, and indeed despite the decline, U.S. per capita emissions  are still among the highest in the world. However, The Washington Post  story claimed: `The United States may have had the largest decrease in  carbon emissions, but it is still the largest per capita emitter.'   ``That's not accurate either.   ``According to World Bank data, U.S. per capita carbon dioxide  emissions rank 11th among countries. So, we are not the largest per  capita emitter, but we do emit 2.2 times as much on a per capita basis  as China. But, China has 4.3 times as many people, and that matters  from an overall emissions perspective. China's lower per capita carbon  dioxide emissions are more than offset by its greater population, so  China emits over 70 percent more carbon dioxide annually than the  U.S.''   So, there is a lot of manipulation as to what is going on, but it is  ridiculous for the United States to be part of a treaty in which the  United States is punished, and our economy punished and the American  people punished even though we are cutting the rate of carbon dioxide  emissions more than anyone else.   Another article from Liz Peek on The Hill: ``China's rising emissions  prove Trump right on Paris Agreement.''   This article is from last year: ``Nothing horrifies the  intelligentsia more than President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris  Agreement on climate change. But, based on new information on China's  emissions, it increasingly looks like the President made the right  call.   ``Just last week, an analysis from Greenpeace indicated that China's  2018''--and the numbers we were quoting before were from the year  before--``carbon emissions were on track to grow at the fastest rate in  6 years. The study, based on government data regarding the use of coal  and other energy sources, shows carbon output rising 4 percent in the  first quarter of this year. Analysts are projecting similar gains over  the next several quarters.   ``The weakness of the Paris Agreement was that it was lopsided,  requiring little from China and a great deal from the U.S. President  Obama committed the United States to reducing carbon emissions in 2025  by 26 to 28 percent, which would have meant a substantial jump in  electricity costs.   ``By contrast, China committed to boosting nonfossil fuels to around  20 percent of its overall energy mix by 2030 and a `hope' that  emissions might peak at that time. As one analyst commented in The New  York Times, `What China is pledging to do here is not a lot different  from what China's policies are on track to deliver.'''   So, the President really did do the right thing for the American  public.   We lost a great man, a former Member of this body, in John Dingell.  He and I had disagreements over some issues, but I knew John Dingell--I  knew, and I know--was an honest man. He was an honorable man. He was a  very decent man. He was a genuine asset to this legislative body.   He followed the rules. He made others follow the rules. Yet, he was  removed as chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, even  though he was looking forward to working diligently on a healthcare  bill.   He was removed as chairman of the committee because he made a  statement that can still be found on YouTube. Like I said, he was an  honest man. He did not want to move the cap and trade bill out of his  committee. As he said, that cap and trade bill was basically--the big  thing in it was a carbon tax. He said that cap and trade bill is not  only a tax; it is a great big one.   And he had talked about how, when you skyrocket the costs of energy,  you know, the rich people are inconvenienced, but it is the poor in the  Nation, it is the lower middle class, it is the  [[Page H3434]]  senior citizens on a fixed income, on Social Security, where they may  go for years without getting a cost-of-living increase, and, even if  they get one, it doesn't keep up with skyrocketing energy costs.   And he could not abide hurting poor people--hardworking, lower middle  class people--with skyrocketing energy that they couldn't afford to pay  for.   And that is where so many of these things lead. If we are going to  have compassion for the people that are the working poor, for heaven's  sake, the last thing you want to do to them is skyrocket the cost of  what they absolutely have to have just to exist.   In America today, you have got to have energy, whether it is electric  energy, whether it is natural gas energy, gasoline, diesel. You have  got to have energy. Even a wood-burning stove. You have got to have  energy.   These kinds of bills that push for these kinds of efforts devastate  the working poor in this country.   Here is an article from Justin Sykes--it also is from 2017--analyzing  Obama's Paris Agreement. The title says, ``All Cost and No Benefit for  the U.S.''   So, I am pleased that President Trump withdrew us from the treaty  that was never properly ratified and that would continue to send jobs  to China and India from the United States.   We have a President who understands, before America can continue to  be the most philanthropic country in the world, helping those less  fortunate, you need a vibrant economy. And simply bringing the U.S.  economy down to the almost no rate of growth during the Obama years is  not going to help us help other countries.   So, the economy, as some may recall--you can go back and see  President Obama talking in terms of basically the 3 percent growth is a  thing of the past; the economy can't grow past that; we need to get  used to the new normal.   Well, under this President, the new normal is over 3 percent growth,  and the only chance we have to overcome our massive deficit and growing  deficit is to get the economy going so strongly that it grows in enough  sufficient manner that we are able to start paying down our deficit, if  we will just quit the massive overspending.   Now, we have had quite a show--really, more of a circus--in our  Judiciary Committee the last couple of days. It has really been  outrageous. The Judiciary Committee ought to be, if anything the last  bastion of civility in this town.    The Judiciary Committee should be the committee from which good rules  emanate that inspire others in the country and around the world that we  have a model that can be followed. What occurred in our Judiciary  Committee in the last 2 days has made a mockery of the legislative  process.   And something that our committee, under our new majority, Democrat  majority, has not been willing to focus on that is a threat to our  First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment rights is the overreach by  the Department of Justice, by the FBI, and potentially by the Intel  community, in taking away Americans' right to have privacy in their  phone conversations, in their emails; their right to have a court  system in which the judges are not closer to being a prosecutor than  they are actual even-handed judges.   And one of the things that is a huge concern for me and should be a  huge concern for all Americans--I know it used to be a big concern with  our now Chairman Nadler. My first term here in '05 and '06, at that  time Congressman Nadler was a great stalwart in pushing for privacy  rights and civil liberties to make sure the government under the Bush  administration didn't overreach.   But an interesting thing happened on the way to their majority and  having the Obama administration in charge, which seemed to be a  complete loss of interest in protecting civil liberties of people whom  the Obama administration chose to spy on.   And I know that the Attorney General has said he is going to be  following up with critically important investigations now, but I would  hope--and maybe the majority just really doesn't want to protect  Americans' rights, is more focused on trying to destroy the current  President.   But there are things that have now arisen. Evidence is clear:  massive, widespread abuse at the top of the FBI, top of the DOJ,  potentially in the Intel area. And even to the point that we would have  a special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who, in the words of Wilford  Brimley: Last time we had a leak like this, Noah built himself an ark.   That seems to be what has happened under Mueller's watch, when he was  at the FBI, under Mueller's watch as a special counsel.   And a good example is in this article from BuzzFeed. They are  certainly no fan of mine, but the News Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith has  this article from April 18, 2019. In this article he says: ``Our  reporters''--talking about the BuzzFeed reporters--``went back to the  two senior law enforcement sources who had told them, as the article  put it, that `Donald Trump directed his longtime attorney Michael Cohen  to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow,  according to two Federal law enforcement officials involved in an  investigation of the matter.'''   That means there has got to be a couple of people on the Mueller team  leaking information that turns out was not accurate, but leaking  information. For one reason, obviously, since it turned out not to be  accurate: to do harm to the President of the United States. That is not  the job of the Department of Justice or the FBI.                                time  1315    Further down in the article it says--and this is a news editor-in- chief talking at BuzzFeed--``Our story was based on detailed  information from senior law enforcement sources. That reporting  included documents specifically''--and get this--``specifically pages  of notes that were taken during an interview of Cohen by the FBI.''   Now, we got to looking at this issue back--regarding witness  statements that are taken down by the FBI, and it is really time that  the FBI came on up into the 20th century, the latter half of the 20th  century. I am not even asking them to come to the 21st century.   But a practice of the FBI has been--and it is advantageous to law  enforcement that does this, it is not really honorable, but it is  advantageous--they don't like to film, or record statements made by  witnesses. They prefer to have an FBI agent take notes of their  interpretation of what the witness is saying. If they recorded it, by  video, or audio tape, then, when there was a question, Well, which is  right; the FBI agent's notes, or the actual words coming from the  witness's mouth? Then you could go to the tape and find out which was  actually accurate.   But when there is no recording, then, advantage goes strictly, inures  strictly, to the benefit of the government agent, because, gee, they  have got no convictions; they come into court. I saw so many felonies  being tried in my court. I have tried felonies many times. But you know  which way the jury is normally going to go? They are going to believe  the law enforcement officers, especially prior to the last few years,  back when the FBI had a much higher, well-thought of reputation. It has  been devastated in recent years.   But they come in and testify and the witness says, that is not what I  said. You don't get to see a video. You don't get to hear the audio of  what the witness actually said. What you have to decide between is this  FBI agent that has never been convicted and looks good on the stand,  sounds good on the stand, and this defendant, that probably has a  criminal record. So that usually goes in the direction of the FBI  agent.   But now, most State and local law enforcement offices have done more  and more to record statements, to record what happens, so that juries  can see for themselves; so they don't have to judge between the  credibility of law enforcement or a defendant. They see for themselves.  They hear for themselves what was said or done.   The FBI doesn't like to do that. They much prefer to have agents make  their notes of their interpretation of what the defendant said. And  Mueller particularly loved that during his 12 years as Director of the  FBI, because his people always got the benefit of the doubt, and they  were able to convict people because the FBI agent, who may have  completely misinterpreted what was  [[Page H3435]]  said in his or her notes, they get the benefit, and the defendant gets  convicted. So that has been a great strategy for law enforcement.   Some people felt like I was a hang-'em-high-type felony judge, but I  wanted fairness. We have got to have fairness. And because of the  credibility issues of the FBI, I feel comfortable Christopher Wray  won't do it. He is more interested in trying to rebuild the image of  the FBI without actually correcting anything.   So I am sure he is correcting some things, but certainly, he is not  changing 302, witness statements taken down in writing as the FBI  agents' interpretation.   And there are other indications he is more interested in trying to  have a good front, making it look like the FBI is better now. But there  are actions that do need to be taken.   But this story, going back to it; that reporting included documents,  specifically, pages of notes that were taken during an interview of  Cohen by the FBI. ``In those notes, one law enforcement source wrote  that: `DJT personally asked Cohen to say negotiations ended in January,  and White House Counsel office knew Cohen would give false testimony to  Congress. Sanctioned by DJT. Joint lawyer team reviewed letter Cohen  sent to SSCI about his testimony about Trump Tower Moscow, et al,  knowing it contained lies.' ''   Well, it turns out, those notes that were taken by FBI agents were  not accurate, which, again, causes problems for credibility.   But the real problem is the fact that you had investigators, which  must have been FBI, working for the Mueller team, and they are turning  over documents that, at least, were law-enforcement sensitive, and they  are probably classified to some level.   And as we know, as people looked into it after former FBI Director  Comey basically admitted a crime, that he had leaked information that  he had taken down or typed up in a memo based on his conversation with  the President--well, under the FBI rules and regulations, that is not  his property. It is not to be leaked. And yet, he leaked it to a  professor friend so that the professor friend could get it out to the  press. I think it was the New York Times.   But regardless, get it out to the press for the sole purpose of  trying to get a special counsel appointed to harass President Trump.   So you have got the former FBI Director--what kind of example is  that? Comey is knowingly leaking information that was potentially  criminal to leak. And so when you have the FBI Director potentially  committing overt crimes himself, what kind of example--what do you  expect that to do inside the FBI?   As an example, I know from talking to FBI agents from all over the  country, they were, and still are, amazed at the things that top people  in the FBI in Washington did to destroy FBI credibility. Of course, I  think part of that was a result of Robert Mueller's 5 year up-or-out  policy. He used it to eliminate people in the FBI that had more law  enforcement experience than him. He ran off thousands and thousands of  years of experienced, ethical, moral, upstanding FBI agents.   I wonder why would an FBI agent, director, run off their most  experienced agents from all over the country? And really, the only  reason I can think of that you would do that, you know young guys  coming right out of school that are patriotic; they come in; they take  their orders. They don't have the experience to know when it is a  stupid order or maybe an improper order, and so they are not going to  talk back. They are going to salute Mueller and go do what he said;  whereas, he knew that people that are longer in the tooth, that have  been around, when he ordered one of his ridiculous policies into effect  that he would later have to repeal, he didn't want the experienced FBI  agent saying, sir, I know it seems like a good idea, but 15 years ago  we tried that and here was the result. It doesn't work out like you  think it is going to.    Mueller didn't want anybody there that would do that kind of thing.  He didn't want anybody that knew more than he did. He ran off thousands  of years of experience.   I cannot help personally but think, if Mueller had not run off so  many thousands of years of FBI experience, there would have been people  around inside the FBI who could have nudged an FBI director like Comey  to avoid committing crimes; could have encouraged an idiot like Peter  Strzok, maybe a great law enforcement officer at one time, but clearly  immoral, illegal in his conduct, and a disgrace to the FBI, and a guy  that can lie with a smirk on his face. That was pretty impressive.   But there would have been people around to say, you can't do that,  and if you don't stop, I am going to report you. Well, Mueller ran  those guys off. He didn't want people like that.   A good example is the FBI agent that--after Ted Stevens, under the  Mueller FBI, was tried and convicted of a crime that he did not commit  right before the election--so he lost his seat in the U.S. Senate--we  had an FBI agent come forward, he filed an affidavit that he swore to  that the FBI had, in effect, manufactured a case against Ted Stevens  that did not exist; that he did not accept hundreds of thousands of  dollars' worth of improvements to his home. He paid for them. He  overpaid for them.   But the FBI did their raids. They hid evidence that he needed to--it  would have exonerated him, not just raised a reasonable doubt, but  completely exonerated himself, and the FBI agent identified his  superior that participated in manufacturing that crime.   So what happened with Mueller as director of the FBI when he finds  out, if he didn't already know, that he had a supervisor agent who  manufactured a case to convict an innocent man?   Well, the Mueller FBI ran off the guy that filed the affidavit  because he had a conscience, and Mueller didn't want people of  conscience in the FBI under him. He wanted people that would salute  Mueller, salute the flag, and do whatever he wanted done.   And apparently, in that case, it was manufacturing a criminal case  against a U.S. Senator, the longest serving Republican in the Senate at  that time.   And, of course, you have the case of Dr. Steven Hatfill. Mueller had  no evidence whatsoever that Steven Hatfill was guilty of the anthrax  crime that killed and harmed people after 9/11. And at one point, the  nonexistence of any evidence caused, apparently from reports, President  George W. Bush to call Mueller in and say, hey, it doesn't look like  there is any evidence here. Are you really sure that Dr. Hatfill is the  anthrax defendant, the guy? And Mueller reportedly said, I am 100  percent certain.   There was no evidence. None. He just had a feeling. He basically  framed an innocent man and ultimately, the U.S. Government had to pay  over $6 million in settlement to Dr. Hatfill.   He didn't really get his life back. We still talk about him in terms  of anthrax.   But when Mueller was asked if he had any regrets, apologies, he said,  absolutely not. He had no apologies. He didn't care if he ruined an  innocent man's life.   He never apologized about Ted Stevens and, of course, Ted Stevens was  killed in a plane he would never have been on if the Mueller FBI had  not manufactured a case against him.                                time  1330    So it shouldn't come as a big surprise here that you have a Mueller  team--it has got to be Mueller investigators; they were the ones that  were doing this investigation--and they are leaking their own documents  that are not to be leaked, well, unless they are directed to by  Mueller, so I guess that is a possibility. But anyway, leaking this to  the press.   And it wasn't just one FBI agent, according to the BuzzFeed news  editor in chief, because he says, in the story he wrote, that they had  ``senior law enforcement sources.''   And they gave BuzzFeed--it is a liberal news organization, being kind  here. They gave them the FBI notes to try to bring pressure on Cohen.  That is the reason normally that law enforcement does this, to build up  public hysteria against somebody and hatred for someone so that they  ultimately give up and agree to testify however they are asked to  testify.   Now, this BuzzFeed editor also says: ``At the time, the sources asked  reporters to keep the information confidential, but with the  publication of Mueller's report, they have permitted its release.''  [[Page H3436]]    That is so outrageous. I mean, was nothing learned from the FBI  framing the wrong person in the Atlanta bombing case? Apparently not.   And then what happened to Curt Weldon. He used to come speak from  this very podium multiple times in my first term--I think it was mainly  in 2006--and he kept alleging that the FBI had information that they  knew there was going to be a terrorist attack, just like what happened  on 9/11.   I didn't know how Congressman Weldon knew what he was talking about.  He sure seemed to. He kept making these allegations that the FBI didn't  do their job. They could have saved 3,000 American lives on 9/11.   Anyway, they were very tough allegations against the FBI, and as a  freshman, I am thinking: Wow, Mueller has got to come back and respond  to this. This looks bad for the FBI. Even though he only took over  shortly before 9/11, it still makes his FBI look bad. Mueller has got  to come out and address this.   Apparently, Director Mueller, FBI Director Mueller, did address the  allegations of Congressman Curt Weldon, because 2 weeks before his  election that year, in 2006, there was a raid of the Weldon office, his  daughter's law office, and it was early morning, and the press was all  there.   Gee, had to have been the FBI. They are doing the raid. They got the  press all there.   And in no time at all, there were protestors with already-made signs  at Curt Weldon's office calling him all kinds of names, thief and  different things. And that, occurring 2 weeks before the election,  caused him to narrowly lose.   Then some months later, they were notified by the FBI: Oh, by the  way, you can come get all that stuff we seized during our raid. We  didn't really use it for grand jury or anything.   They apparently used it to defeat Curt Weldon as a Member of  Congress, who made them feel bad.   An intelligent person might ask: Well, look, if that is what the FBI  has done to people in the past, whether Hatfield or Weldon or Stevens,  aren't you concerned about doing just what Curt Weldon did?   And the fact is it should be a matter of concern. We are seeing, even  from BuzzFeed, how the FBI will disclose information that is not even  accurate to bring down public opinion against both a witness and, in  that case, the President himself just to smear somebody's name even  when it is not accurate.   So it should be a matter of concern. But if people don't stand up in  this body--actually, the way Jerry Nadler used to years ago--about  concerns with Federal law enforcement activities, if we don't stand up  here, nobody is going to, and it isn't going to get better.   So it is a risk we have got to take, because somebody has got to  speak up about these outrageous abuses. And they truly are abuses.   Now, as the evidence continues to come out, what appears to be quite  clear was not that there was collusion or conspiracy between the Trump  campaign to bring down Hilary Clinton as a candidate, but the Russian  effort has not changed, not when they were the Soviet Union and now  that it is an independent country of Russia. They want to cause as much  problem and division in the United States as they can, and, boy, did it  work this time.   Just a little over a week ago, apparently, former MI6 agent, secret  agent--he is no 007, that is for sure. Christopher Steele was hired by  Fusion GPS, that also hired Nellie Ohr, who is the wife of a top FBI  official named Bruce Ohr. She was digging up dirt, whatever she could  find--that was why she was hired--on Donald Trump; and Christopher  Steele, who hated candidate Donald Trump was hired to dig up dirt on  Donald Trump.   As I understand it, he didn't even go to Russia. He is calling,  emailing, whatever he needs to do to communicate, and word gets out  around Russia this British agent now working for the Clinton campaign  through Fusion GPS and working with at least one FBI top official, he  is looking for dirt on Donald Trump in Russia.   Steele has now basically admitted: You know what? It could well be  that the people that gave me this dirt about prostitutes and Donald  Trump that has now turned out to be 100 percent fabricated, it is  possible that those could be agents for Vladimir Putin.   You think? You bet.   Russia was able to divide this country and had plenty of willing  accomplices in what turned out to be an outrageously corrupt top in the  FBI and some in the DOJ.   You know, I know Mr. Rosenstein has said, oh, he was joking when he  said he would wear a wire into the Oval Office to try to trap Donald  Trump as President so they could try to remove him as President. I  mean, they were working on a coup.   But from what I understand, we know he was not joking, because there  was a second meeting in which Andy McCabe and another person, at least  one more person, were there when Rosenstein brought it up on his own  again: Hey, I wasn't kidding. I really am a team player. I know you are  mad at me for the memo about Comey that allowed him to be fired, but I  am a team player. I want to be part of the team. I will wear a wire  into the Oval Office to try to trap the President. I am really willing  to do that.''    And McCabe, apparently just blown away that Rosenstein would offer to  do that again, goes back and has a meeting with his subordinates and  says: You won't believe Rosenstein just brought up again he is willing  to wear a wire into the Oval Office. I don't know what is wrong with  that guy.   Well, there is a massive stench that has existed. It came about  during the Obama administration. It came about when Robert Mueller ran  off so many of our incredibly qualified, upstanding FBI agents.   I was hoping that when Christopher Wray came in, he would help clean  up the mess, get rid of the bad actors, but he has been more of hold  what you have got and try to make the picture look rosier.   Why would I say that? Because I know from having talked to the  individuals who found the information. They knew that Hillary Clinton's  private server was hacked by a foreign country, and it was not Russia.   I knew at the time I was asking Peter Strzok questions, but I didn't  mention the country. But now it has come out that a Chinese  intelligence agency had embedded instructions in her private server  that every email coming in and every email going out was to go to this  Chinese intelligence agency, and it happened.   We also now know there was classified information that came and went  through her private server.   But the inspector general for our intelligence community was so  concerned, he told his investigator, Frank Rucker: Frank, you have got  to get over there and tell the FBI. They don't know that her private  server was hacked. You have got to go tell them.   This didn't come out in the hearing. I didn't bring it up. But I did  ask Strzok, because we know from his private texting that he was doing  everything he could to exonerate Hillary Clinton and doing everything  he could to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President.   So it had to come as an incredible blow to Peter Strzok when the  intelligence community's investigator, their IG investigator, comes  over to the FBI, as directed by the IG, and he has to tell Peter Strzok  because he is director of counterintelligence at the FBI. And they have  their liaison there, Dean Chappell, and they have another person there;  and the IG also sent over one of their top lawyers, Janet Mitchell.   Rucker says: I needed to get you this information, and you weren't  responding, so here it is. We now have proof positive that Hillary  Clinton's private server was hacked, and it was hacked by China, and  every email coming in, going out is going to their intelligence agency.   And this didn't come out in the hearing, but the fact is he was  shocked at the response by Peter Strzok, because he just looked at him.  He showed no surprise. And Chappell and Strzok thanked Frank Rucker for  the information, shook his hand, and sent him on his way as if it were  no big deal.   So where does Christopher Wray come in there? After that came out  that our United States intelligence IG had proof positive that Hillary  Clinton's private server had been hacked and after it was exposed what  a detriment it was, possibly criminal activity by Peter Strzok, and  after it came  [[Page H3437]]  out that they were instructed that her private server was hacked, what  does Christopher Wray's FBI do? They release an official statement that  the FBI still has not seen any evidence that Hillary Clinton's private  server was hacked.   That was despicably dishonest. All they had to do was contact the  intelligence community IG's office. They could have gotten the  information.   But Christopher Wray was more interested in trying to preserve the  old reputation of the FBI, so he continued with the facade: Well, yeah,  we put on our blinders. We see no evil. We hear no evil. We don't know  about any evil. We are not going to go look at the evidence that  absolutely, unequivocally shows her private server was hacked. We will  just ignorantly and intentionally mislead the American people and say  we haven't seen any evidence that her private server was hacked.                                time  1345    This is a dangerous, dangerous time in our history. People can throw  all the rocks at Bill Barr. I didn't know the guy. I don't think I ever  met the man. I had concerns because he was a private friend of Bob  Mueller, and his wife was a friend of Mrs. Mueller. I had concerns.   Now that he is trying to get to the bottom of all the corruption  within the FBI and at the top of the DOJ, the rocks are being hurled.   This should be a time when we come together to try to root out the  corruption. If they can attempt a coup of a duly-elected President,  whether you like the electoral college or not, if they can do it to a  Republican, then the day can come when we have conservative people who  disagree with a liberal President and decide to take him out the way  they made so many inroads into almost taking out Donald Trump.   This is a scary time in our history. I literally hope and pray, and I  know there are people who make fun of the prayers, but I truly believe  prayers have brought about God's blessing on this country.   We have a chance to fix things here, but it is going to take courage  by people who are willing to stand up to an FBI, some corruption at the  top.   There are still some people at the FBI who do not like Donald Trump.  They are still there. They still would like to cover for people who  were helping try to effectuate this attempted coup on Donald Trump.  They need to go.   It used to be--and I know personally--assistant U.S. attorneys who  were career, or FBI agents who were career. Most times, you don't even  know how they voted. You don't know if they did vote because they had  one interest, getting to the truth of whether or not there was probable  cause a crime was committed and, if so, who probably committed it. That  gets them an indictment, and then they can go for a conviction. That is  what they were interested in, enforcing the law.   The FBI under Robert Mueller and then James Comey became an  instrument to abuse enemies, and it has to be cleaned up.   I have seen no indication that Christopher Wray is interested in  doing that. He is covering for the guys who created the problem. Maybe  he is doing some things internally that I am not seeing, but he is not  the answer.   For the sake of continuing this little experiment in self-government,  we need to clean up the mess at the FBI in Washington, D.C., and the  mess that still exists at the top of the Justice Department. Then we  can have a chance to keep this little experiment of self-government  going.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
