 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young  man in my district who will represent Iowa on the world stage.   Thomas Gilman, a University of Iowa alumni, has qualified for the  U.S. Olympic team for freestyle wrestling and will be competing in this  summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, later this month.   As a former Hawkeye, Thomas was a force to be reckoned with in the  125-pound weight division, finishing his career in Iowa City with an  impressive record of 107-12 and a Big Ten Conference title. He was also  named the Outstanding Wrestler of the 2017 Midlands Championships.   His other athletic accomplishments include a silver medal at the  World Wrestling Championships in Paris in 2017 and another silver medal  at the U.S. National Championships in Las Vegas in 2019.   I wish Thomas the best of luck as he goes on to represent the great  State of Iowa and the United States in the Olympic Games. Bring home  the gold.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my  bill, H.R. 3263, the DHS Medical Countermeasures Act.   The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc all over the world, causing  countless deaths, both from COVID and from unexpected causes unrelated  to COVID, businesses shuttering, job loss, and our everyday way of life  almost coming to a halt. While I am pleased that the United States is  heading back to normalcy with three excellent and widely available  vaccines, we cannot forget the great struggles that we encountered just  last year.   Every day, countless Americans put their lives on the line for  others, including the men and women in the Department of Homeland  Security. Throughout the pandemic, the agencies and officers at CBP  continued to protect our borders; TSA officers secured our  transportation system; and representatives from FEMA, who took a lead  role in the government's response to the pandemic, still had to deploy  when disaster struck in other areas.   My bill, the DHS Medical Countermeasures Act, supports the DHS  workforce and Department mission continuity by requiring the Secretary  to establish a medical countermeasures program to protect employees and  working animals in the event of a chemical, biological, radiological,  nuclear, or explosives attack; naturally occurring disease outbreak; or  pandemic.   This legislation requires the chief medical officer of the Department  to maintain a stockpile of medical countermeasures and to develop  Department-wide standards for storage, security, placement, dispensing,  supply diversity, and documentation of countermeasures.    This bill requires the establishment of a medical countermeasures  working group comprised of representatives from relevant Department  components and offices to ensure medical countermeasure standards are  maintained and guidance is consistent.   Finally, the bill requires the chief medical officer to develop an  integrated logistics support plan for medical countermeasures that  includes a methodology for determining types and quantities of  countermeasures, inventory tracking, and a replenishment plan for  existing stockpiles.   Mr. Speaker, as a doctor, former director of the Iowa Department of  Public Health, and military veteran, I can assure you I know full well  the necessity of medical countermeasures for treatment, diagnosis, and  maintaining the safety of our community.   The Department of Homeland Security has over 240,000 employees tasked  with jobs ranging from border and aviation security to emergency  response and cybersecurity, with one common goal: keeping America safe.  It is imperative that materials and processes are put in place to  protect the safety and welfare of employees and to  [[Page H3708]]  ensure effective pandemic and disaster planning and response for  mission continuity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this  commonsense bill, H.R. 3263.
