 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from Colorado for all her leadership.   We are barely 6 weeks into this new Congress and the Republicans are  back at it again, attacking comprehensive health care for American  women. The regulation under attack says that in order to be awarded  title X funding, you must be able to deliver the services. Those  services are family planning and related preventative health services.   The majority is correct, we are not talking about abortion because  abortion is not funded by title X.   Why would Republicans oppose this regulation?   Because it allows them a backdoor way to make funding decisions based  on ideology, not quality of care.   Don't we want the best health outcomes for the over 4 million  patients who benefited last year from HIV tests, breast exams, and  contraception coverage under title X?   Title X-funded healthcare providers around this country are high- quality professionals who provide needed care for millions of families,  many of whom are underserved. I oppose this resolution.
