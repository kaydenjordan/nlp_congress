 Mr. President, to quote the great Yogi Berra, ``It's deja  vu all over again.''   It is the 26th day of the shutdown, and for the 26th day in a row,  Democrats are refusing to seriously engage with the President to get  the government reopened. Democrats have spent a lot of time talking  about their desire to get the hundreds of thousands of furloughed  Federal workers back to work, but their actions contradict their words.   The only way for the government to reopen is for both sides to come  to the table and compromise. The Democrats are absolutely refusing to  consider any concession. Their position is, my way or the highway.  Unfortunately, that is not the way things work in the real world. When  you have two groups with diametrically opposed positions, both sides  have to give a little if they are ever going to get anything done.   The White House has a strongly held position on this issue, but it  has also made it clear that it is willing to be flexible and to  negotiate with Democrats. The Democrats don't share that willingness,  and their refusal to negotiate is victimizing the very workers they  claim they want to protect.   Senate Democrats' latest attempt to distract from Democrats' refusal  to negotiate is to push for votes on House-passed legislation on  reopening the government, but as Democrats know very well, these votes  would be meaningless because this is not legislation the President is  going to sign.   Indeed, before Christmas, the Democratic leader in the Senate stated:  ``The President must publicly support and say he will sign an agreement  before it gets a vote in either Chamber''; that from the Democratic  leader as recently as just a few weeks ago.   Well, there is no point in spending time taking up a bill that hasn't  received agreement from all parties. We know that, and the Democrats  know that as well, but apparently they are willing to flip-flop on this  issue if they think it will suit their political purposes. Kind of like  how they were for a border fence before they were against it. That is  right.   In 2006, the Democratic leader and the ranking member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee voted for legislation to authorize a border fence.  They were joined in that vote by then-Senator Biden, then-Senator  Clinton, and then-Senator Obama. In 2013, every Senate Democrat--every  Senate Democrat--supported legislation requiring the completion of a  700-mile fence along our southern border. In 2009, the Democratic  leader praised border fencing as a border security accomplishment.   So what has changed? The need to secure our borders hasn't changed.  The effectiveness of barriers hasn't changed. That has been well  documented.   The House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, was asked about the  Democrats' flip-flop, whether there is any real difference between what  they supported previously and what they are opposing now. Here is what  he said: ``I don't have an answer that I think is a really good  answer.''   Well, that is an honest reply. Democrats don't have a good answer  because there is no real difference between what they supported a few  years ago and what they are opposing now. Democrats have flip-flopped  on the issue because they are afraid to oppose the radical far-left  wing of their party and because they are committed to obstructing this  President no matter what.   If Democrats weren't hurting anybody, their refusal to play ball  wouldn't be a problem, but every single day that they refuse to engage  in serious negotiations is a day that families aren't getting paid,  national priorities aren't getting funded, and important border  security is being postponed.   That is where we are. I urge my colleagues to rethink their  obstruction and to work with the President to get the government  reopened and Federal workers back to work and funding for that critical  and important priority of ensuring that we have a secure southern  border.                                March for Life    Mr. President, this Friday, as they do every year, individuals from  every corner of the United States will come to Washington, DC, to  participate in the national March for Life.   As usual, South Dakotans will be among them. Tens of thousands of  individuals will march from the National Mall to the Supreme Court to  bear witness to a simple truth; that unborn babies are human beings and  that they deserve to be protected.   It can be easy sometimes for human beings to turn their backs on  injustice. Maybe because we don't want to get involved, we are  reluctant to speak out.   It is particularly easy to turn our backs in the case of abortion  because the injustice of abortion is hidden. It happens out of the  public view behind closed doors, but we must not forget that every day  in the United States, unborn babies are being killed.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which compiles data  on the number of U.S. abortions, reports that there were more than  638,000 legal abortions in 2015--638,000. That is roughly equivalent to  three-quarters of the population of South Dakota. That is an incredible  number of lives lost, an incredible amount of joy lost, an incredible  amount of love lost, and it is all too easy to forget because we don't  see it happening. We can't forget. We can't forget injustice. We can't  let fear or discomfort stop us from speaking up for those who cannot  speak for themselves.   Fortunately, there are tens of thousands of men and women and young  people around this country who are committed to speaking up for the  unborn and who travel to Washington, DC, every year to remind us of the  truth about abortion, to remind us that abortion is the destruction of  an innocent human life, that every abortion kills an innocent human  being with her own DNA and her own, distinct identity.   I can think of few greater things than to defend the defenseless, to  stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves, and I am  grateful for all those who will march through the streets of  Washington, DC, on Friday to speak up for the innocent unborn. I thank  them for reminding us of this great injustice, and I join them in  praying that one day every child will be safe from abortion.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 151         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) Implementation.--The Federal Communications Commission       shall not take the action described in paragraph (1) if the       Commission determines that a provider of voice service, not       later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this       Act--        (A) has adopted the STIR/SHAKEN authentication framework       for calls on the internet protocol networks of voice service       providers;        (B) has agreed voluntarily to participate with other       providers of voice service in the STIR/SHAKEN authentication       framework;        (C) has begun to implement the STIR/SHAKEN authentication       framework; and        (D) will be capable of fully implementing the STIR/SHAKEN       authentication framework not later than 18 months after the       date of enactment of this Act.        (3) Implementation report.--Not later than 12 months after       the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications       Commission shall submit to the Committee on Commerce,       Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee       on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a       report on the determination required under paragraph (2),       which shall include--        (A) an analysis of the extent to which providers of a voice       service have implemented the STIR/SHAKEN authentication       framework; and        (B) an assessment of the efficacy of the STIR/SHAKEN       authentication framework, as being implemented under this       section, in addressing all aspects of call authentication.        (4) Review and revision or replacement.--Not later than 3       years after the date of enactment of this Act, and every 3       years thereafter, the Federal Communications Commission,       after public notice and an opportunity for comment, shall--        (A) assess the efficacy of the call authentication       framework implemented under this section;        (B) based on the assessment under subparagraph (A), revise       or replace the call authentication framework under this       section if the Commission determines it is in the public       interest to do so; and        (C) submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and       Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the       findings of the assessment under subparagraph (A) and on any       actions to revise or replace the call authentication       framework under subparagraph (B).

(c) Safe Harbor and Other Regulations.--        (1) In general.--The Federal Communications Commission       shall promulgate rules--        (A) establishing when a provider of voice service may block       a voice call based, in whole or in part, on information       provided by the call authentication framework under       subsection (b);        (B) establishing a safe harbor for a provider of voice       service from liability for unintended or inadvertent blocking       of calls or for the unintended or inadvertent       misidentification of the level of trust for individual calls       based, in whole or in part, on information provided by the       call authentication framework under subsection (b); and        (C) establishing a process to permit a calling party       adversely affected by the information provided by the call       authentication framework under subsection (b) to verify the       authenticity of the calling party's calls.        (2) Considerations.--In establishing the safe harbor under       paragraph (1), the Federal Communications Commission shall       consider limiting the liability of a provider based on the       extent to which the provider--        (A) blocks or identifies calls based, in whole or in part,       on the information provided by the call authentication       framework under subsection (b);        (B) implemented procedures based, in whole or in part, on       the information provided by the call authentication framework       under subsection (b); and        (C) used reasonable care.        (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall       preclude the Federal Communications Commission from       initiating a rulemaking pursuant to its existing statutory       authority.  [[Page S277]]            SEC. 4. PROTECTIONS FROM SPOOFED CALLS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, and consistent with the call       authentication framework under section 3, the Federal       Communications Commission shall initiate a rulemaking to help       protect a subscriber from receiving unwanted calls or text       messages from a caller using an unauthenticated number.        (b) Considerations.--In promulgating rules under subsection       (a), the Federal Communications Commission shall consider--        (1) the Government Accountability Office report on       combating the fraudulent provision of misleading or       inaccurate caller identification required by section 503(c)       of division P of the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2018       (Public Law 115-141);        (2) the best means of ensuring that a subscriber or       provider has the ability to block calls from a caller using       an unauthenticated North American Numbering Plan number;        (3) the impact on the privacy of a subscriber from       unauthenticated calls;        (4) the effectiveness in verifying the accuracy of caller       identification information; and        (5) the availability and cost of providing protection from       the unwanted calls or text messages described in subsection       (a).       SEC. 5. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP.         (a) In General.--The Attorney General, in consultation with       the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, shall       convene an interagency working group to study Government       prosecution of violations of section 227(b) of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 227(b)).        (b) Duties.--In carrying out the study under subsection       (a), the interagency working group shall--        (1) determine whether, and if so how, any Federal laws,       including regulations, policies, and practices, or budgetary       or jurisdictional constraints inhibit the prosecution of such       violations;        (2) identify existing and potential Federal policies and       programs that encourage and improve coordination among       Federal departments and agencies and States, and between       States, in the prevention and prosecution of such violations;        (3) identify existing and potential international policies       and programs that encourage and improve coordination between       countries in the prevention and prosecution of such       violations; and        (4) consider--        (A) the benefit and potential sources of additional       resources for the Federal prevention and prosecution of       criminal violations of that section;        (B) whether to establish memoranda of understanding       regarding the prevention and prosecution of such violations       between--        (i) the States;        (ii) the States and the Federal Government; and        (iii) the Federal Government and a foreign government;        (C) whether to establish a process to allow States to       request Federal subpoenas from the Federal Communications       Commission;        (D) whether extending civil enforcement authority to the       States would assist in the successful prevention and       prosecution of such violations;        (E) whether increased forfeiture and imprisonment penalties       are appropriate, such as extending imprisonment for such a       violation to a term longer than 2 years;        (F) whether regulation of any entity that enters into a       business arrangement with a common carrier regulated under       title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 201 et       seq.) for the specific purpose of carrying, routing, or       transmitting a call that constitutes such a violation would       assist in the successful prevention and prosecution of such       violations; and        (G) the extent to which, if any, Department of Justice       policies to pursue the prosecution of violations causing       economic harm, physical danger, or erosion of an inhabitant's       peace of mind and sense of security inhibits the prevention       or prosecution of such violations.        (c) Members.--The interagency working group shall be       composed of such representatives of Federal departments and       agencies as the Attorney General considers appropriate, such       as--        (1) the Department of Commerce;        (2) the Department of State;        (3) the Department of Homeland Security;        (4) the Federal Communications Commission;        (5) the Federal Trade Commission; and        (6) the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.        (d) Non-Federal Stakeholders.--In carrying out the study       under subsection (a), the interagency working group shall       consult with such non-Federal stakeholders as the Attorney       General determines have the relevant expertise, including the       National Association of Attorneys General.        (e) Report to Congress.--Not later than 270 days after the       date of enactment of this Act, the interagency working group       shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and       Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the       findings of the study under subsection (a), including--        (1) any recommendations regarding the prevention and       prosecution of such violations; and        (2) a description of what progress, if any, relevant       Federal departments and agencies have made in implementing       the recommendations under paragraph (1).       SEC. 6. ACCESS TO NUMBER RESOURCES.

(2) Regulations.--If the Federal Communications Commission       determines under paragraph (1) that modifying the policies       described in that paragraph could help achieve the goal       described in that paragraph, the Commission shall prescribe       regulations to implement those policy modifications.        (b) Authority.--Any person who knowingly, through an       employee, agent, officer, or otherwise, directly or       indirectly, by or through any means or device whatsoever, is       a party to obtaining number resources, including number       resources for toll free and non-toll free telephone numbers,       from a common carrier regulated under title II of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), in       violation of a regulation prescribed under subsection (a) of       this section, shall, notwithstanding section 503(b)(5) of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 503(b)(5)), be subject       to a forfeiture penalty under section 503 of that Act. A       forfeiture penalty under this subsection shall be in addition       to any other penalty provided for by law.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Baldwin,          Mrs. Capito, Mr. Tester, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Moran,          Mr. Jones, Mr. Hoeven, and Ms. Rosen):   S. 164.

(a) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Stir/shaken authentication framework.--The term ``STIR/      SHAKEN authentication framework'' means the secure telephone       identity revisited and signature-based handling of asserted       information using tokens standards proposed by the       information and communications technology industry to attach       a certificate of authenticity to each phone to verify the       source of each call.        (2) Voice service.--The term ``voice service''--        (A) means any service that is interconnected with the       public switched telephone network and that furnishes voice       communications to an end user using resources from the North       American Numbering Plan or any successor to the North       American Numbering Plan adopted by the Commission under       section 251(e)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47       U.S.C. 251(e)(1)); and        (B) includes--        (i) transmissions from a telephone facsimile machine,       computer, or other device to a telephone facsimile machine;       and        (ii) without limitation, any service that enables real-      time, two-way voice communications, including any service       that requires internet protocol-compatible customer premises       equipment (commonly known as ``CPE'') and permits out-bound       calling, whether or not the service is one-way or two-way       voice over internet protocol.        (b) Authentication Framework.--        (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), not       later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act,       the Federal Communications Commission shall require a       provider of voice service to implement the STIR/SHAKEN       authentication framework in the internet protocol networks of       voice service providers.        (2) Implementation.--The Federal Communications Commission       shall not take the action described in paragraph (1) if the       Commission determines that a provider of voice service, not       later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this       Act--        (A) has adopted the STIR/SHAKEN authentication framework       for calls on the internet protocol networks of voice service       providers;        (B) has agreed voluntarily to participate with other       providers of voice service in the STIR/SHAKEN authentication       framework;        (C) has begun to implement the STIR/SHAKEN authentication       framework; and        (D) will be capable of fully implementing the STIR/SHAKEN       authentication framework not later than 18 months after the       date of enactment of this Act.        (3) Implementation report.--Not later than 12 months after       the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications       Commission shall submit to the Committee on Commerce,       Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee       on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a       report on the determination required under paragraph (2),       which shall include--        (A) an analysis of the extent to which providers of a voice       service have implemented the STIR/SHAKEN authentication       framework; and        (B) an assessment of the efficacy of the STIR/SHAKEN       authentication framework, as being implemented under this       section, in addressing all aspects of call authentication.        (4) Review and revision or replacement.--Not later than 3       years after the date of enactment of this Act, and every 3       years thereafter, the Federal Communications Commission,       after public notice and an opportunity for comment, shall--        (A) assess the efficacy of the call authentication       framework implemented under this section;        (B) based on the assessment under subparagraph (A), revise       or replace the call authentication framework under this       section if the Commission determines it is in the public       interest to do so; and        (C) submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and       Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the       findings of the assessment under subparagraph (A) and on any       actions to revise or replace the call authentication       framework under subparagraph (B).        (5) Extension of implementation deadline.--The Federal       Communications Commission may extend any deadline for the       implementation of a call authentication framework required       under this section by 12 months or such further amount of       time as the Commission determines necessary if the Commission       determines that purchasing or upgrading equipment to support       call authentication would constitute a substantial hardship       for a provider or category of providers.        (c) Safe Harbor and Other Regulations.--        (1) In general.--The Federal Communications Commission       shall promulgate rules--        (A) establishing when a provider of voice service may block       a voice call based, in whole or in part, on information       provided by the call authentication framework under       subsection (b);        (B) establishing a safe harbor for a provider of voice       service from liability for unintended or inadvertent blocking       of calls or for the unintended or inadvertent       misidentification of the level of trust for individual calls       based, in whole or in part, on information provided by the       call authentication framework under subsection (b); and        (C) establishing a process to permit a calling party       adversely affected by the information provided by the call       authentication framework under subsection (b) to verify the       authenticity of the calling party's calls.        (2) Considerations.--In establishing the safe harbor under       paragraph (1), the Federal Communications Commission shall       consider limiting the liability of a provider based on the       extent to which the provider--        (A) blocks or identifies calls based, in whole or in part,       on the information provided by the call authentication       framework under subsection (b);        (B) implemented procedures based, in whole or in part, on       the information provided by the call authentication framework       under subsection (b); and        (C) used reasonable care.        (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall       preclude the Federal Communications Commission from       initiating a rulemaking pursuant to its existing statutory       authority.
