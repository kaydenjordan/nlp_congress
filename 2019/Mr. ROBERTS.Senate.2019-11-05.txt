 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, about a month ago there was a headline  in one of the publications that people pay attention to that read:  ``Senate Republicans Amp Up Pressure for an USMCA Vote.'' USMCA, by the  way, is an acronym for the new trade agreement between Mexico, Canada,  and the United States. I initially thought it was ``United States  Marine Corps Always,'' but that is not the case. About nine of us came  to the floor and pointed out this was imperative, and if we were going  to have a new trade agreement to replace NAFTA, if we could at least  get some price recovery and also make some progress with regard to  Canada and Mexico--historically great trading partners--it might be a  good thing to get the USMCA passed. That was a month ago.   We were assured, at that particular time, by folks over in the House  of Representatives--our colleagues over there--that they would do  everything in their power to see if we could get it done. It is not  done. Still, it is not done. Still, farmers, ranchers, growers, and  everybody connected with agriculture, and, for that matter, trade,  certainly have been waiting and waiting. Times in farm country, as I  think most people know, are pretty rough these days. So at least  passing USMCA would be something everybody could agree to.   I rise in support of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement  again--1 month later. It is time to move forward and pass this  important legislation now. ``Now,'' that is my acronym for ``right  away,'' ``yesterday.''   As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I want to talk about  not only my producers in Kansas but all producers throughout these  United States and across the country. Time and again, we have asked why  there is a delay. Farmers tell me, time and again, they wonder what on  Earth is going on back there. Well, that is obvious to everybody, with  the ``i'' word being considered over in the House, but even with that,  this is a situation where, if that were brought up to a vote, both the  administration and House Members--both sides of the aisle--it would  pass, more so especially since our Trade Ambassador, Robert Lighthizer,  has been working with my colleagues across the aisle over there in an  effort to settle labor issues and also environmental concerns.  [[Page S6380]]    I have been down that road before with the Honorable Kika de la  Garza, the late Kika de la Garza, but a wonderful man who was chairman  of the House Agriculture Committee. I was the ranking member and then  became the chairman. We worked on NAFTA, writing that bill. We would  revert to that bill, but after months and months, there was finally an  agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. We were ready  to do this, and it had to go to the House of Representatives.  Ambassador Lighthizer and Bob--he used to work for Bob Dole, a good  friend of mine--had been working with Democrats over time on these two  issues. He tells me he is pretty close to a deal--except we are not.  Now, Ambassador Lighthizer, on behalf of the administration, is not  going to send this deal, if you will, this trade agreement, to the  House unless there is a clear intention that it will be brought up. He  doesn't want to be held hostage. So the House has to move.   I want to continue to point out that USMCA, this new trade agreement,  will not only increase market access for farmers and provide new  opportunities for dairy, poultry, for egg producers, for all the  commodities we talk about--wheat, corn, et cetera--but it will also  address longstanding nontariff barriers that will help our Kansas  farmers export wheat to Canada.   That used to be the case with Mexico. The Kansas winter wheat, once  harvested, would get on the Kansas City railroad, down to Mexico. They  would sell the wheat to Mexico, where they sorely needed it. It was a  very good business trade agreement. That has pretty much dried up.   Let me go back to 2017. At that particular time, 110,000 Kansas jobs  were supported by trade with Canada and Mexico, and, I am sure, the  neighboring States are even equal to that or much more than that.   While many of those jobs are spread across all sectors of the  economy, many are tied to the agriculture value chain; that is,  farmers, ranchers, and growers, to the consumer.   In total, Kansas exports $4 billion of products to Canada and Mexico  each year--$800 million from agriculture alone. It is nearly impossible  for me to overstate the importance of this trade deal to my home State  of Kansas. We are not going to experience price recovery in farm  country because of the supply-demand situation worldwide, and we are in  a lot of trouble in farm country. The least we could do is consider  USMCA, where we know we have the votes to pass it in both Chambers,  both in the House and the Senate.   In fact, the call for Congress to get moving on this trade deal has  united more people from different political and professional  backgrounds than almost any other issue in recent memory, including  organized labor. I recently started a web series, if you will, ``Trade  Tuesday,'' to give a platform to the many constituents who have voiced  their support to me by saying: ``Pat, where on Earth is the UMSCA  bill?'' We have featured farmers and manufacturers from around Kansas,  including Rich Felts. Rich Felts is a great friend of mine, a farmer  from Southeast Kansas, and the president of the Kansas Farm Bureau.  Rich hit the nail right on the head. He said:         We are an exporting State. We produce much more than we are       ever going to consume [in Kansas], and if we want to grow our       economy, specifically our economy in the State, we have to       export the excess commodity. I think it is easy to say we       want trade, we don't want aide, and this is going to be a       step in that direction if we can get this passed by Congress.    I could not agree more with Rich on the importance of this trade deal  to farmers and producers in Kansas, but it is not only the agriculture  industry that is interested in getting USMCA across the finish line. We  have also featured Jason Cox, the president of Cox Machine, Inc., a  small aerospace company based in Wichita, KS--typical of the small  business community of my State. He recently said:         Trade is very important to our business, both on the raw       material supply side as well as the selling side. This USMCA       is important for us to help lower the cost of raw material       that we buy and pass that savings along to our customers so       we can get more work and produce more goods [and also jobs].    Look, my colleagues, it has been nearly a year since President Trump  and the leaders of Mexico and Canada signed this new trade agreement.  It was November 30, 2018. We are running out of time to get this deal  done for folks like Rich and Jason and the many other workers whose  livelihoods depend upon trade.   There are deadlines. If we get past the deadline, we will go back to  the original NAFTA bill, which--as I look back in my public career, I  was happy to work with Kika de la Garza, as I said--the former chairman  of the House Ag Committee, and he helped me to write NAFTA at that  particular time. As a result, the ag sector has grown by leaps and  bounds in not only producing enough food and fiber and other products  for our consumers but also for a troubled and hungry world.   We need this trade agreement. I sincerely hope my friends in the  House can quickly come to an agreement with the administration so that  we can all do what is right by our constituents and get this bill  passed this year.   I would point out that the ag chairman today in the House is Collin  Peterson. He is a veteran. He is a friend of mine. Mike Conaway is the  ranking member--same thing. They are for USMCA. It is bipartisan in the  Ag Committee over there.   I would also give a shout-out to Robert Lighthizer, who is our  Ambassador, who has been meeting constantly day in and day out--trying  to iron out any labor or environment portions of this trade agreement  where we have some holdup.   We are not going to go anywhere if we continue to insist on these  kinds of requirements. You know, these are sovereign countries. These  are our neighbors. For us to try to dictate labor standards and  environmental standards for them is a little much, but I understand  that is what we have to do.   I don't know, here, what more we can do. I can come to the floor  every day. I can just say that we had 9 Senators here before. I think  we could get a mutual agreement to say: Hey, let's get this done. Let's  separate it from all of the goings-on that are happening in the House  of Representatives today.   I hope Speaker Pelosi--she knows about this. California depends on  this big time, and, as Speaker of the entire United States--I am not  trying to lecture her or point fingers at her, but she knows exactly  what the situation is. If she would just send a signal to Ambassador  Lighthizer and we would send that trade pack up and we could get a  vote, I think it would pass overwhelmingly, and at least we would have  something we could claim we are doing in behalf of our farmers, our  ranchers, our growers, and everybody who is supported by the  agriculture industry.   I yield the floor.
