 Madam Speaker, I am deeply concerned with the Biden  administration's efforts to look to other foreign adversaries for oil  amid the current conflict in Eastern Europe.   Last week, Secretary Buttigieg said the option to import oil from  Iran is on the table. Over the weekend, the Biden administration sent a  delegation to Venezuela to discuss resuming relations with dictator  Maduro and is weighing options to import Venezuelan oil.   Not once has the Biden administration considered the solution that is  staring us right in the face: revitalizing domestic energy production.   The U.S. is blessed with the world's largest oil and gas reserves,  and we are fully capable of producing these resources more cleanly and  efficiently than anywhere else in the world.   Before we turn to socialist nations or countries that openly chant  ``death to America'' in the streets, we must harness the potential in  our own backyard.   American energy means lower prices for consumers at home and greater  energy security for us and our allies.   The Biden administration needs to end their war on domestic energy  production immediately and restore our Nation's energy dominance.                            ____________________
