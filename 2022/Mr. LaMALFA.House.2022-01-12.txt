 Mr. Speaker, many areas in northern California and  across my district have seen record snowfall due to recent winter  storms. That is good in a lot of ways, but we have seen that tens of  thousands of residents have been without power for several weeks in  freezing temperatures, and our Governor has banned the use of gas- powered generators as a heat and electricity source.   Meanwhile, those who do still have power face all-time high energy  costs as they try to heat their homes, thanks to President Biden's  anti-domestic energy policies.   On President Biden's first day of office, he canceled the Keystone  pipeline, effectively killing 11,000 American energy jobs and stopping  new exploration for oil, which has driven up energy prices and  increased our dependence on foreign oil from China, Russia, and the  Middle East.   The cost of having our homes heated has increased 30 percent since  last winter, and more than one in four Americans reported they were  forced to forgo other basic expenses to pay their energy bill in this  last year.   Under the climate agenda President Biden has, gas prices are up  nearly 60 percent. The cost of propane, kerosene, firewood, and energy  are all up over 30 percent from this time last year.   We must reverse these damaging and unnecessary policies and reduce  our reliance on foreign oil before more harm can be done to the  American people and our economy.                            ____________________
