 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Police Week. It is a privilege to take the time this week to  reflect, remember, and honor our Federal, State, and local law  enforcement officers who courageously defend American citizens and  protect our communities. They selflessly put their lives on the line to  ensure that this Nation is one of safety and order.   On November 18, 2016, the reality of that danger hit home in  Georgia's First Congressional District. Deputy Commander Patrick  Carothers, a 26-year veteran of the U.S. Marshals Service and a  resident of Long County, lost his life in the line of duty while  serving a routine warrant. He left behind a loving wife and five  children.   This week the House will vote on H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act.  With this bill, we can put a safeguard in place that works to protect  our officers and their families from experiencing the same tragedy that  took Commander Carothers' life.   Thank you to the hardworking men and women of law enforcement that  work each day to keep us safe, and thank you to the family of Commander  Carothers, who sacrificed his life in the name of public good. You are  in our thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
