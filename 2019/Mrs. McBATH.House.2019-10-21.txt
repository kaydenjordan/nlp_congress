 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I would like to begin by offering my deepest prayers to Congressman  Cummings' wife and family and the Baltimore community. He was a solid  voice of conscience and always offered a steady hand and sound wisdom.   He was one of the giants among us here in Congress.   Congressman Cummings was born the son of sharecroppers from Clarendon  County, South Carolina, a county where children were forced to walk  miles to attend segregated schools. The refusal of Clarendon County to  provide buses for the Black children in that district became the court  case Briggs v. Elliott, one of the five cases that would be decided  under the shared designation of Brown v. Board of Education.   Remarkably, Congressman Cummings never forgot his roots. He spent his  entire life as a fierce champion for justice and humanity. He boldly  fought for civil and human rights with the strength given him by God.   His humility, his compassion, and his commitment were nothing short  of inspiring.                                time  2100    I remember the times I would come in here on the floor and I would  sit down next to him and he'd say: How are you doing today, kid?   And I would say: Well, you know, it is kind of rough being a  freshman.   And he said: That is okay. Take care of your family. Stay focused.  Stay clean. Do your work. Stay in the district, and you will be just  fine.   Representative Cummings once said: When we are dancing with the  angels, the question will be asked, what did we do to make sure that we  kept our democracy intact?   Well, Representative Cummings, you moved mountains for democracy.   And so, now, as he dances with the angels in Heaven, we honor his  lifelong fight for our democracy, his towering legacy, and his  unwavering dedication to the United States of America and to the world.  He will truly be missed.
