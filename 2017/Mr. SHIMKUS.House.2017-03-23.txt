 Mr. Speaker, this is an important day, and I have great  friends on the other side of the aisle. We debated aggressively, and,  in fact, I see one of my colleagues from California. We spent 27\1/2\  hours dealing with our committee of jurisdiction's markup of the bill.   It has been a long time since ObamaCare was passed, 7 years, and  those of us on our side said: Well, we didn't keep the insurance plan  they said we were able to keep, we didn't get to keep the doctor that  they promised we could have, we didn't save the $2,500 a month that was  promised would be the savings if we passed ObamaCare.   So I would argue, we have been very patient--7 years--and I think the  public has been very patient. The public has judged ObamaCare through a  couple of election cycles and has claimed failure. So we are on, as we  call it, a rescue mission, because right now premiums have increased 25  percent, on average, across the country; one-third of U.S. counties  have only one insurer; 4.7 million Americans were kicked off their  health plan; and $1 trillion in new taxes.   Out of the 23 ObamaCare CO-OPs--I love co-ops. I am from rural  America. We believe in co-ops. They are not-for-profits. Out of the 23  ObamaCare CO-OPs, 18 failed. It shows you it is not working: $53  billion in new regulation costs; 176 million hours of paperwork.   So what do we do? Republicans believe in transparency. We believe in  markets. We believe in competition. We believe in what we are calling  cooperative federalism: returning power to the States.   We are seeing that in part of the Medicaid proposals, allowing the  engines of our country, the States--some have been very, very  successful in reforming the Medicaid programs, providing first-dollar  coverage, and some  [[Page H2356]]  have not. Hopefully, they will learn from the other States.   We also want to empower the individuals in the individual markets.  One-size-fits-all, mandatory--you have to have one of only four plans-- has destroyed the individual market.   So 7 years is too long to wait. I appreciate us moving aggressively.  Time is of the essence. We are on a rescue mission, and this is just  another path in the process of repealing and replacing ObamaCare.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have a lot of respect for my colleague from Illinois, but let me  just say to him that the Republican plan is not a rescue mission. It is  a full-fledged attack on the middle class--a rescue plan for the rich,  maybe, slamming the middle class with a tax hike.   Ripping away coverage and undermining Medicare is not a rescue  mission, I assure you. I have seen the townhalls around the country.  They want nothing to do with your rescue plan.   Rescuing something you sabotaged, offering Americans a plan that  costs more and covers less, going after essential services--please,  that is not what the American people want.   To my colleague from Texas, the distinguished chairman of the Rules  Committee, he is assuring us that Republicans are huddled somewhere.  Well, I have got news for him. I have been reading press reports that  Republicans have canceled their 9 a.m. Conference meeting. As I  understand it, one Republican Member told the reporter that that move  ``tells me it's panic time.''                                time  0945    Another Republican source is quoted as saying: This is such a  disaster. Representative Massie said: Frankly, it is not very well  thought out.   So I don't think people are huddling. I think people are dispersed,  and so it makes me even more wary about what we are going to see later  today.   By the way, all we are asking is that we actually see the bill. We  had a Rules Committee hearing yesterday on a bill that, quite frankly,  will not be the bill we are going to consider later today or tomorrow  or Saturday or Sunday or Monday.   We are talking about health care that affects millions and millions  of people, and nobody in this Chamber has seen what we are going to  vote on. This is ludicrous. How can this be? What are you thinking? Do  this right. There is no rush. You don't get extra points for being  fast.   When we read about some of the compromises that are being talked  about--going after essential services that basically help the most  vulnerable in this country, services like mental health treatment,  treatments for opiate addiction, maternity care--essential benefits are  being compromised or being taken away. So what will end up happening is  you will get up and say: Yeah, we will sell you insurance. It will be  cheap, but you get no coverage. Nothing is covered.   That is not what the American people want.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Lowey), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on  Appropriations.
