 I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.    Madam President, I rise today to talk about the debate  that we  [[Page S1528]]  are having with regard to the nomination or, I should say, confirmation  of the EPA Administrator.   All of us in this Chamber and the other body, the U.S. House of  Representatives--frankly, anyone in government--has an obligation to  act in accordance with a goal of being good stewards of the Earth. Some  might call it creation care--care of God's creation.   Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency, under its current  leadership, is, in my judgment, failing to meet that obligation. From  day one, the administration has prioritized gutting environmental  protections and rolling back policies that had us on a path toward a  more sustainable future.   From attacking the Clean Power Plan to weakening methane protection  standards, this administration has repeatedly prioritized the interests  of polluters over the health and wellness of the American people.   Andrew Wheeler, the nominee, if he is confirmed to run the EPA or, I  should say, the Environmental Protection Agency, which we call the  EPA--this assault on clean air, clean water, and so many other  protections will continue if he is, in fact, confirmed.   Some of the most troubling EPA actions have come while Mr. Wheeler  has been running the EPA in an acting capacity.   In recent weeks, the EPA has decided to move forward with a rollback  of the clean car standard and to gut the mercury and air toxics rule.  These moves will harm public health and the health of our children, in  particular.   The American Lung Association reports that 5 Pennsylvania counties, 5  of our 67 counties, which are home to approximately 4 million people,  rank among the top 25 counties most polluted by particulate matter year  round.   Rolling back the clean car standards and clean air standards will  cause more exposure to harmful pollutants that lead to increased  mortality, respiratory problems, emergency room visits, and work-loss  days.   As we know, the transportation sector is the largest source of  greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. We also know that the  MATS rule, the so-called mercury and air toxics rule, is an  environmental and public health success story.   Mercury pollution is particularly harmful for unborn children, who  are much more sensitive to exposure and who may suffer neurological and  developmental problems.   Powerplant mercury emissions have declined by 90 percent because of  the MATS rule. This was achieved ahead of schedule and at one-third of  the projected cost. Let me say that again. Powerplant mercury emissions  have declined by 90 percent because of the MATS rule. This was achieved  ahead of schedule and at one-third of the scheduled cost.   Let me give testimony from two Pennsylvanians--partial testimonies,  though they are from longer letters that they wrote to us.   Mollie Michel of South Philadelphia wrote to me, and I am quoting  her:         As parents, my husband and I spend a lot of time making       sure our daughters are safe and healthy. We make sure they       eat healthy foods, get enough sleep, do their homework, and       treat each other and their peers with kindness and respect.       But the one thing we cannot control is the air they breathe.       For that, we rely upon our elected officials to enact the       policies that protect the health and well-being of my       children.    The only thing I would correct in Mollie's excerpt of her letter is  that it is the obligation not just of elected officials but of  appointed officials, as well--those confirmed by the U.S. Senate, in  this case, the Administrator of the EPA. Of course, it is our duty, as  elected officials, to make sure that we confirm people who will meet  the legitimate expectations of a mom like Mollie.   Patrice from Gibsonia, PA, wrote to me to say:         As a mom of two boys, I am deeply concerned by the track       record of Acting Administrator Wheeler. He has spent his time       at EPA proposing and implementing dangerous rollbacks to and       attacks on pollution protections. He is putting our       children's health and future at risk.    So said Patrice of Gibsonia.   While we are on the subject of major threats to the environment,  major threats to our communities, to our children, and to our families,  we cannot forget about climate change itself. Climate change is a  threat to the health and well-being of our children and future  generations. We must take action to address the global climate crisis  with a sense of urgency and determination. The effects of climate  change are real and have become worse, and unless we take action, we  are going to be in a position where it will be impossible to take any  action if we do it too late.   We can address the challenge of climate change and continue to  protect jobs. We can and we must do both. One is not exclusive of the  other. We have already demonstrated that we can make advancements in  clean energy and that it can happen quickly while also benefiting the  economy and creating jobs.   According to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and  Bloomberg New Energy Finance, renewables--renewable sources of energy-- now account for 18 percent of power generation in the United States, up  from just 9 percent in 2008.   According to the 2018 U.S. Energy Employment Report, the wind and  solar industries support three times as many jobs as oil and gas--three  times as many jobs as oil and gas. According to S&P Global, battery  storage cost for a 20-megawatt facility declined by 40 percent in 2018.  So I think it is entirely possible, and the data proves it, to deal  with this crisis, to meet our obligations, to continue to create and  grow jobs, and also to make sure that our economy grows as well.   I live in a State where more than a generation ago we passed a State  Constitution provision. Article I, section 27 of the Pennsylvania  Constitution says in pertinent part that people have a right to clean  air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural scenic,  historic, and aesthetic values of the environment. That constitutional  provision goes on to say that we are trustees. We, the citizens of the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, are the trustees of our natural  resources, and they specifically talk about future generations.   That is my obligation, not only as a citizen of the Commonwealth and  not only as an elected official but, I believe, as an American as well.   To confront these crises--whether it is attacks on clean power  standards, clean air and clean water standards or whether it is the  challenge of climate change itself--we need an EPA and an EPA  Administrator who is totally committed to that same spirit that is set  forth in that State constitutional provision that the people have a  right to clean air and clean water, and, I would argue in a larger  sense, the right to the kind of creation here that is connected  directly to the question of climate change.   We are talking about God's creation and preserving His creation. If  we are trying to preserve God's creation, we better make sure we  nominate and confirm people committed to preserving creation itself. We  are but stewards of that creation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
