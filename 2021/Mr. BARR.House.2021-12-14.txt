 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee for yielding.   I rise in opposition to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, Islamophobia  is wrong, just as anti-Semitism, anti-Christian hatred, and all forms  of discrimination based on race or religion are wrong.   But this bill, despite whatever the author and defenders of this  legislation claim as its purpose or their intent, is not targeted to  counter actual Islamophobia.   In fact, this bill is so poorly drafted, any objective analysis of it  raises serious concerns about what the true intentions of the bill are  because it specifically does not define Islamophobia.   This lack of definition not only risks confusing U.S. foreign policy,  but it also would compromise U.S. counterterrorism efforts and  undermine our national security.   What we need, Mr. Speaker, and what this bill fails to provide is  moral clarity. We don't need nuance or political correctness or  silencing debate or censorship on the issue of radical Islamic  terrorism. What we need is intellectual and moral clarity.                                time  2000    Before 9/11, radical Islamic terrorists were at war with the United  States. That was before 9/11. Since then, radical Islamic terrorists  have been at war with the United States.   Now, you may wish that wasn't the case, but it is a historical fact.  If you cannot even acknowledge who the enemy is or that we are at war  with them, then how can you expect to defeat that enemy?   We must face the truth, the truth that there is a very real struggle  within the Islamic world between religious tolerance, the purported  goal of this bill, and an evil, toxic intolerance, the potential  byproduct of this bill that says if you are a Christian or if you are a  Jew or if you are a moderate Muslim, then you must be destroyed.   This bill, either unintentionally or by design, gives voice to this  toxic religious intolerance by failing to exclude from the definition  of Islamophobia any policy or viewpoint that rejects radical Islamic  terrorism.   This ideology of evil and extreme religious intolerance must be  confronted with clarity, as much as each individual act of terrorism.  And an overinclusive definition of Islamophobia threatens to encourage  the very extremism that we all say we oppose.   Is it Islamophobia to criticize the Taliban, a self-proclaimed  Islamic organization, when they commit grave human rights abuses and  oppress women?   Is it Islamophobia to criticize rejoining the Joint Comprehensive  Plan of Action when talking about the malign, theocratic Islamic  Republic of Iran, the leaders of which chant, ``Death to America,'' and  promise the destruction of the State of Israel?   Is it Islamophobia to condemn Hamas when they are firing rockets on  innocent Israelis from Gaza?   Is it Islamophobia to criticize someone who dismissively, derisively,  and defensively refers to 9/11 hijackers as ``people who did some  things''?   These actions are not Islamophobic. These are beliefs motivated out  of security and fact. However, we are voting shortly on a bill that  actually does combat Islamophobia, real Islamophobia, a bipartisan bill  to combat the forced labor of Uyghur people and the systemic genocide  of peaceful Muslim minorities by the Chinese Communist Party.   Mr. Speaker, that bill makes a clear, defined difference. This bill  does not. Simply saying we are against Islamophobia without clearly and  correctly defining it and establishing an office within the State  Department to combat it without safeguards against the relativist views  of the politically correct is an invitation to weaponize our foreign  policy against itself. We must deal with this problem as it is, not as  we would hope it to be.   History teaches us that when Islamic extremists and jihadists are not  fought, they grow. Their movement metastasizes. The longer they are not  confronted, the more they become emboldened. The more they are appeased  and tolerated, the more they overrun territories in the areas they  occupy and secure safe havens from which they can launch attacks  against the United States and the West.   As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I was more than  disappointed that my Democratic colleagues, many of whom I respect  very, very much, rejected a good faith amendment in our markup to  clearly define what Islamophobia actually is.   We do have a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism who  works off an internationally adopted definition of anti-Semitism. But  the way this bill is structured fails to acknowledge that a policy of  countering jihad is not, never has been, and never will be  Islamophobia. And the bill establishes an office that would actually  undermine the very mission of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat  Anti-Semitism.   In sum, this bill, without definitional restraint, will invite anti- Semitism and anti-Christian bias into State Department decisionmaking,  and it will do so under the guise of combating Islamophobia. That is  what this bill will do without definition.    Maybe this bill is well-intentioned, but if we don't agree  to some kind of definition, if we do not provide some clarity--moral  clarity, intellectual clarity--as to who the enemy is versus what  Islamophobia is, then what we have here in this bill is a wolf in  sheep's clothing. Nuance and political correctness will not help us  defeat our enemy, and it leaves peaceful practitioners of Islam robbed  of the definition that they truly deserve.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee, my good friend from New York (Mr. Meeks), for his  leadership in helping support this legislation and bringing it to the  House floor.   I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his leadership  in recognizing this serious human rights travesty that is happening.   I also want to thank the 11 House Foreign Affairs Committee  Republicans who are cosponsors of this legislation, including Mr. Smith  of New Jersey.   I want to thank Senator Rubio from Florida for working with the  gentleman from Massachusetts on finding a bipartisan and bicameral  compromise to bring this important legislation to the floor.                                time  2045    Mr. Speaker, it is past time for this Chamber and the Congress to act  to stop the Chinese Communist Party from using American consumers to  subsidize its brutality. Preventing products made with slave labor from  [[Page H7807]]  contaminating our market is a longstanding priority of U.S. trade, not  just because it puts American manufacturers at a disadvantage, but  because the American values that we all share will not tolerate it.   Truly free trade cannot involve slave labor. But today, the CCP is  using the forced labor of Uyghurs and other minorities to help bankroll  its genocide against those very same groups. The repression taking  place right now in Xinjiang is breathtaking in its scope and in its  brutality. More than 1 million people have been locked in concentration  camps and subjected to surveillance and brainwashing on a massive  scale.   Families are being broken up and children are being taken from their  parents. Forced sterilization and forced abortion are being used to  limit births among ethnic groups targeted by the CCP.   This is outrageous human rights violations and the world cannot turn  a blind eye. It is a horrific warning, not only to China's neighbors  and to the American people, but to the world. The Chinese Communist  Party is fundamentally focused on expanding its power and its  authoritarian style of government. It views things that it does not  control, like religion, cultural identity, and the yearning of all  people for freedom, as threats that must be destroyed.   Because we have drawn the CCP into many of our most critical supply  chains, it has the ability to hold our national security hostage while  it uses U.S. consumers to subsidize its atrocities. This cannot stand.  As many as one in five cotton garments globally are potentially tainted  with Uyghur slave labor.   Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized a 13-ton  shipment of human hair that originated in Xinjiang's forced labor  system. We have a duty to prevent the CCP from making Americans  complicit in these sickening abuses. For that reason, I support the  bipartisan bill before us today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), a Member of this body who, for  many, many years, has been a champion of human rights and, frankly, no  one has done more to advance the cause of human rights than my  colleague from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in recent years the world has stood by as the Chinese  Communist Party has detained more than 1 million ethnic minorities in  concentration camps where they are tortured, brainwashed, and put into  forced labor. This is all part of a deliberate program by the CCP to  wipe out their ethnic identity, their religion, their culture, anything  that might compete with the Communist Party for their loyalties and  affection.   We have a moral duty to speak out against these horrifying crimes,  but we have an even greater duty to avoid funding this genocide by  paying for slave labor in Xinjiang.   Many American companies have built their businesses on values that  include respect for basic human rights. The United States must continue  to lead the world in setting corporate responsibility standards. There  can no longer be business as usual with China. The world is watching.   While this bill did not go through regular order in the Foreign  Affairs Committee, I commend Chairman McGovern and Senator Marco Rubio  for coming to this important bipartisan agreement.   I appreciate the chairman's leadership, and it is good to have a  bipartisan bill where we stand united in one voice for human rights,  and to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable.   I support this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2100
