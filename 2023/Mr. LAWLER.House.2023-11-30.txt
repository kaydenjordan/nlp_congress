 Mr. Speaker, of all the lies that George Santos told, two  are the most jarring: that his mother perished in 9/11--was in the  building, got cancer from 9/11, or that his parents or grandparents  fled the Holocaust. In both instances, Mr. Santos used tragic events in  history to try and propel himself to public office.   Worse than that, he not only defrauded the voters of the Third  District, he also defrauded donors, stealing their money for personal  gain.   The facts and the evidence are clear. He can defend himself in a  court of law, but for the purposes of this body, he has to go. It is  time to expel George Santos.
