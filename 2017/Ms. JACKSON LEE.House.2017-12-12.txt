 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  Florida and the author of the legislation and manager for their  leadership on this issue as members of the Oversight Committee and  indicate that I rise to support H.R. 4171.   I am a member of the Judiciary Committee and have worked very hard on  patent and trade issues, and particularly the patent office, and I see  this as  [[Page H9815]]  raising the caliber of opportunity of different types of employees,  which are very important. The patent office is a skilled entity, and  clearly, this gives a greater opportunity for those individuals to work  in places beyond Washington, D.C.   I also think it is important to note that telework is advancing, and  it should not be considered less work than anyone who is at an office.  I would hope that, as we look at legislation dealing with telework,  that telework would not diminish the benefits that an employee gets and  they would not be distinguished because they are working at home, if it  was allowed, versus in an office.   So I think this is an important responsibility of the Oversight  Committee, and clearly, I rise to support that. Keeping in mind that  the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee have  worked together on a number of issues, I might just comment on, I  think, an element that needs the cooperation of the Judiciary Committee  as well.   I think, today, many of us heard of a statement being offered by the  Oval Office. I would like to read part of it into the Record. It deals  with the standards of accountability and protocol and decorum. It was  sent by the Oval Office.   ``Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck  Schumer and someone who would come to my office `begging' for campaign  contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now  in the ring fighting against . . .''--I will just say the Oval Office.   This requires oversight of the appropriate committees because it is a  question of protocol, dignity of the office.   I would offer to say, as a woman, I am outraged that these comments  were made. I don't know what it means to say ``would do anything.'' We  all know that we do not have public finance, and members of various  parties and levels of government raise fundraising dollars to  communicate to their constituents. I would imagine that they go to any  number of individuals who live in their State.                                time  1430    I think that Senator Gillibrand obviously went to an individual who  lived in her State, but to silence a sitting Senator on her expression  of outrage over treatment of women and to utilize a theme that has been  used for decades regarding how women rise--this is the larger question,  how women rise.   Are they Ph.D.'s? Are they law enforcement? Are they secretaries or  doctors? Are they teachers? Are they in businesses in Hollywood? Are  they in aviation? How do they rise?   This squarely talks about, overall, all women and, frankly, I think  it is important, in an oversight capacity, that the women who have  asked to be heard as it relates to issues of the Oval Office should be  heard, as all, in a process of combining committees, such as Oversight  and Judiciary. That is our appropriate protocol.   All that I have said, I have always said that these issues should be  allowed the appropriate investigation and due process, and that, I  think, would be what the American people would want us to do.   So I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I could not be on the floor,  and I would be remiss, if I did not bring to the attention of my  colleagues the dastardly comment that does not fit the office and,  really, characterizes women, American women, since this is an issue and  a statement made here in the United States, characterizes women in a  highly inappropriate manner; and a professional colleague in an equal  branch of government to be castigated by the Oval Office, I think an  apology is warranted.   But I think an investigation is warranted for those women who have  made allegations who have yet, to date, been heard, and I might add,  they have yet, to date, been sued, so they have not had their day in  court to be able to answer any such allegations.   I hope that our respective chairpersons and committees will  investigate this in the most appropriate way forward.   And any woman that is of a generation of this time, millennials or  other women, have had the allegations made against them that the only  way they have risen is because they have acted in a certain manner, I  don't think that that is appropriate and appropriate decorum.   With that, I support this legislation. I look forward to the answer  to our request for full hearings on these women who have to have their  say and to be heard regarding the protocols of the Oval Office.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House  Resolution 407 condemning the persecution of Christians around the  world, as amended.   I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with all those who have been  persecuted for their religious views and remain committed to fighting  with you as we embark on the journey of promoting freedom of  conscience, speech, association, religion, and all other freedoms that  are inalienable to all humankind.   As a Member of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, I continue to  work with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner in order to amplify the  important work of upholding religious freedom, facilitating human  dignity, and protecting human rights.   As a Member of Congress, one of our charges is to understand how to  improve religious freedom and diplomacy across the globe and here at  home.   A good measure for this congressional call of fostering religious  freedom and diplomacy is H. Res. 407 that calls on:   (1) discriminatory regimes to cease their persecution of not only  Christians but all religious minorities, and   (2) the President and heads of the governments of all democratic  countries to uphold the right to religious freedom and condemn the  persecution of Christians and minorities.   This resolution highlights the United States foreign policy  commitment to the protection and promotion of religious freedom across  the globe from Indonesia, to Pakistan to Nigeria to China to name a  few.   The persecution of religious minorities is a global problem,  occurring in countries across the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the  Americas.   Christians, for example, face persecution not only from Islamic  extremist groups, like the Islamic State and Boko Haram, but also from  other religious extremist groups and from officials at all levels of  certain foreign government.   Such persecution of religious minorities ranges from social  harassment and discrimination to physical violence, imprisonment,  torture, enslavement, rape, and death.   Over 200 million Christians experience persecution across the globe,  the majority of those are found in the Middle East. But it is important  to note that Christianity is not a Western imposition on historically  Islamic countries in the Middle East.   The Middle East has been a home to Christians since the first century  A.D., but unfortunately the Christian population in the Middle East has  significantly decreased over the past few decades as a result of  persecution, displacement, and genocide.  [[Page H9824]]    Not only Christian lives, but also Christian holy sites have been  destroyed by the Islamic State.   And not only Christians, but anyone who opposed their ruthless war on  peace.   In many places, Christians must practice their faith in secrecy  because churches are not allowed, and makeshift churches in homes are  raided.   A loud example of this persecution is aimed at the Coptic Christians  in Egypt that have faced persecution for over 50 years, and on April 9,  2017, Palm Sunday, 44 people were killed in bomb attacks by the Islamic  State on Coptic churches.   The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack on a bus  on May 26, 2017, in which 29 Coptic Christians were killed while  traveling to a monastery in Minya, Egypt;   This important resolution describes numerous instances where  Christians have been attacked by terrorist groups, groups that hide  behind religion as a pretext to destroy minority groups and to  recklessly and harmfully seek power.   Religious minority persecution has been on the rise in Asia,  primarily due to religious nationalism.   Recently, in Bangladesh, hundreds of Christians are being forced off  their property, and legal action rarely results in the favor of a  Christian party.   In Burma/Myanmar, since late August 2017, more than 645 thousand  ethnic Rohingya have fled a campaign of ethnic cleansing by Burma's  security forces and sought asylum in Bangladesh.   The Rohingya massacre is another example of religious minority  persecution, overlooked and disregarded by a government that, as some  may surmise, values power over people.   Not surprisingly, Christians and other dissidents of the government  in North Korea are forced into harsh labor camps, where approximately  70,000 Christians are imprisoned in 2017.   All that is to say that religious discrimination is a global human  rights problem and the right to religious freedom is a universal right  recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   In the 114th Congress, I introduced and continue to support  legislation by my colleagues that seek to protect religious freedom and  democracy which are the very bedrock of the United States Constitution.   Fighting for human rights across the globe is one of my passions and  I have sought to promote and protect religious freedom such as H. Res.  290, a resolution I introduced in the last Congress condemning  blasphemy laws that serve as a pretext to persecute religious  minorities; that resolution was co-sponsored by our former colleague,  Joseph Pitts of Pennsylvania.   Within the context of H. Res. 407 and other legislation addressing  human rights, some of the issues we continue to grapple with include:   Expanding the Country of Particular Concern (CPC) list to include  more countries who have not improved in their treatment of religious  minorities or upholding religious freedoms;   The need for an Annual Countries of Particular Concerns Designations;   Double hatting of sanctions and indefinite waivers;   The need to designate non-state actors as violators of religious  freedom;   Prosecuting Islamic state militants; and   The need to have a high functioning Department of State with  appropriate leadership for both senior and junior staff, and sufficient  funding.
