 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of an American  patriot and hero, Mr. Troy Bowling of Lexington, Kentucky, who  completed his life's service on June 17, 2017, at the age of 90 years  old.   His military service during World War II and his commitment to  supporting our veterans and the men and women in uniform throughout his  life is an inspiration to us all.   At the age of 19, Mr. Bowling began his service as a United States  marine and was a proud member of the Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th  Marines, 5th Division. During the United States campaign to end the war  against Japan, Mr. Bowling's unit was among the first to arrive on the  beachheads of Iwo Jima.   While attempting to secure Mount Suribachi, his unit came under  intense and concentrated fire, completely overwhelming his unit. Two  projectiles struck Mr. Bowling in the chest and leg, leaving him  critically wounded on the battlefield.   At that moment, Mr. Bowling said he looked to the heavens and  committed to serving mankind for the rest of his life if he survived.  Miraculously, a combat photographer and medical team then carried Mr.  Bowling to the safety of a landing craft, where he witnessed the  planting of the American flag atop Mount Suribachi, an iconic image  that persists as one of the most legendary and triumphant moments of  the war. The U.S. Marines eventually took control of the island.  However, this victory came at a heavy cost, as over 6,800 U.S.  servicemembers gave their lives during the battle of Iwo Jima.   In keeping faith with his commitment to God made during that battle,  Mr. Bowling devoted over 78,000 hours of volunteer service to others at  the Lexington VA Medical Center. For over 66 years, Mr. Bowling rose  through the ranks within the Disabled American Veterans organization,  holding nearly every position possible, including State commander.                                time  1030    The Bible teaches in Proverbs 21:21 that ``He who pursues  righteousness and love finds life, prosperity, and honor.''   Mr. Bowling has brought great honor upon himself through his  dedication, determination, and love for serving the people of our  community. Without a doubt, he has remained true to the commitment he  made on the rocky terrain of Iwo Jima.   Mr. Bowling embodies the best of American ideals, values, and  commitment to serving others, never abandoning the Marine motto of  semper fidelis, ``always faithful.''   On behalf of a grateful nation, I would like to thank Mr. Bowling, a  model member of the greatest generation, for his many years of service  to our country and our community. He is truly an outstanding American  and an inspiration to us all.   Troy Bowling, may you rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: the anti-arbitration rule  recently finalized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is not  consumer protection. It is a giveaway to special interest trial lawyers  that will expose financial firms to ruinous liability; limit consumer  access to affordable, high-quality financial services and products; and  undermine consumers' ability to resolve disputes more quickly and more  cost-effectively than class action lawsuits.   The Bureau's own study found that, while trial lawyers earn millions  of dollars in fees, in 90 percent of class action lawsuits, consumers  were awarded absolutely nothing--nothing. Of the remaining 10 percent,  the average payout to consumers was a mere $32. That same CFPB study  found that the average arbitration payout was almost $5,400, or over  150 times more than the average class action recovery.   Even more troubling, the Bureau's unilateral decision to ban  alternative dispute resolution will result in increased litigation  costs for financial services firms, undermining their safety and  soundness, forcing consumers to pay higher prices and making it more  difficult to obtain credit cards and other financial services and  products. That is not pro-consumer.   For these reasons, I am a proud cosponsor of Congressman Rothfus'  bill that would disapprove this misguided resolution to the  Congressional Review Act.   Congress should be making the laws of the land, not unaccountable,  unelected bureaucrats at the CFPB circumventing the democratic process.  That is why, in addition to invalidating this bad anticonsumer, pro- trial lawyer, anti-arbitration rule, Congress must act swiftly to rein  in the Bureau and subject this agency to the congressional  appropriations process, reclaiming Congress' constitutional power of  the purse over this out-of-control agency.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution of  disapproval to block this ill-advised, anticonsumer rule and reclaim  its authority under Article I of the Constitution.
