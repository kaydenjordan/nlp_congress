 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the Grace  Christian School Warriors baseball team for their come-from-behind  victory in this year's Virginia Association of Christian Athletics  State championship.   Down to the last 12 outs, the Warriors trailed 4-0. But thanks to  some timely hits, their comeback started as they were able to put one  run on the board in the fourth.   In the bottom of the fifth, things really started turning in Grace  Christian's favor. A few hits, some heads-up base running, and costly  errors made by their opponents gave the Warriors a 5-4 lead.   However, the lead didn't last long, as the Bulldogs from Westover  Christian Academy scored two in the top of the sixth. But the Warriors  battled back, tying the game in the bottom half of the inning.   Grace Christian's MVP pitcher, Isaiah Riddle, mastered Westover  hitters in the top of the seventh, meaning it all came down to the  Warriors' bats.   First baseman Justin Hain led off with a base hit, then stole second,  and moved to third on a wild pitch. With another wild pitch, Hain  sprinted home and secured Grace Christian the title.   Truly, it ain't over till it's over.   Congratulations to the players, coaches, parents, and staff on an  incredible season and a well-deserved win.                            ____________________
