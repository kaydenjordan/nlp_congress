 Mr. President, it is nice to see you back in that  position.   Yesterday, Mr. President, we began a new chapter in the history of  our Nation. On the same steps stormed by domestic terrorists 2 weeks  ago, we held a ceremony to the enduring power of our democracy. It was  a symbol to the world that America is back and a message to those  domestic terrorists that they will never prevail.   Even as the festivities were in full swing, our new President and  this new Senate commenced the work of rebuilding our country and  healing its wounds. With the stroke of a pen, President Biden started  the process of rejoining the United States to the Paris accords. He  extended the pause on student loan payments, put an end to the Muslim  travel ban, reinstalled safeguards for our Nation's Dreamers, and put a  halt on the ineffective border wall.   Crucially, President Biden signed a number of orders to refocus the  Federal Government's efforts on fighting the coronavirus pandemic. The  United States has rejoined the World Health Organization. A mask  mandate has been issued for all Federal properties. And President Biden  has named a new coronavirus response coordinator to manage vaccine  distribution, which is so desperately needed and was such a failure  under the Trump administration.   Our country has suffered deeply from the chaotic, lackluster, and  incompetent Federal response to COVID-19. As we cross the grim  milestone of 400,000--400,000--American fatalities from COVID, the  Biden administration is wasting no time in marshaling the resources of  the Federal Government into action and today released a national  strategy to defeat the pandemic.   What a concept--a President who actually takes the defining crisis of  our time seriously. What a change--and how great is the need.   Here in the Senate, the first order of business is to fulfill our  constitutional duty to advise and consent on the President's  appointments to his Cabinet. Last night, the Senate confirmed the  President's selection for the Director of National Intelligence, Avril  Haines. We appreciate the bipartisan cooperation to get her  confirmation done yesterday, and we should continue in that spirit  today.   Traditionally, the Senate has confirmed several national security  nominees for an incoming administration during their first few days.  Even as power changes hands from one administration to the other, the  work of keeping our Nation safe must not be paused or be disrupted.  Foreign adversaries will seek to exploit this period of transition, and  we cannot allow America's military, intelligence, and national security  policy to be disrupted by staffing delays.   In 2017, President Trump had his Defense Secretary and Secretary of  Homeland Security in place on Inauguration Day. President Biden  deserves his national security team in place as soon as possible, as  well as key officials in charge of responding to the current health and  economic crises. With the cooperation of our Republican colleagues, we  can and should confirm the Secretaries of Defense, State, Homeland  Security, and Treasury without much delay.   While national security is paramount, I would remind my colleagues  that we are in the middle of an economic crisis. The sooner we confirm  a Treasury Secretary, the better.   And so, as we begin the process of bringing our country back  together, let the first week of this Congress be a collaboration  between our two parties to confirm President Biden's Cabinet.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Inaugural Ceremony proceedings be printed in the Record.

Madam President, I will be, in a moment, asking for  unanimous consent that we do the waiver on the Secretary of Defense,  and we will vote on that relatively shortly, the Members should be  aware.
