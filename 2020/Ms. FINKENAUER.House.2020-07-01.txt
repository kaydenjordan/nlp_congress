 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am proud to stand here today as a Congresswoman from Iowa's First  Congressional District, but even more proud to stand here today as a  daughter of a retired union pipe fitter/welder.   And you see I brought something with me today of my dad's. You can  see right here it is a sweatshirt actually that he welded in. And you  can see right here it has got these tiny little holes from the sparks  of his welding torch.   And I kept this sweatshirt actually with me when I was in the State  House in Iowa for 4 years to remind me every single day of who I was  fighting for and also to give me hope when the Republicans in Iowa went  after worker's compensation and collective bargaining in my State,  making it harder for folks just like my dad.   Today, I see Congressional Republicans doing the same thing, pushing  an amendment to gut Davis-Bacon prevailing wage protections that will  make life harder for working families like the one that I grew up in.   And you see, I brought this with me today not because I need a  reminder of who I am or where I come from, but clearly, my colleagues  across the aisle in this body today need a reminder of the working men  and women who have sacrificed day in and day out to provide good lives  for their families who don't complain when they get burned from the  sparks of a welding torch, who don't complain when they have to wring  sweat out of their belt at the end of a hard day's work, which I have  seen my father do more times than I would like to count.   You see, what they have done right now with this amendment and the  proposals that they have shown us this year are going after, again, the  families like the one that I grew up in. What they have done with  amendments like this is to try to drive down wages and take away  opportunities.   This amendment is outrageous. Without Davis-Bacon how many more  workers busting their tails every day will see their paychecks go down  and not up? How many more kids like me are going to go weeks without  seeing their father or their mother? How many more families will be  forced to leave their hometowns just to make ends meet?   Republicans are trying to cut off access to healthcare right now in  the middle of a pandemic, and now they are trying to eliminate fair  wage protections in the middle of an economic crisis.   This is outrageous, and quite frankly, it is disrespectful. Working  families are already struggling to get by. Millions have lost their  jobs, and millions more are worried about their job security. And now  in the middle of this crisis we are going to take away wage  protections? Again, this isn't just outrageous, it is disrespectful,  and quite frankly, it is heartless.   Please join me in defeating this amendment, voting ``no'' and  actually showing working men and women across the country who really  has their back.                                time  1245
