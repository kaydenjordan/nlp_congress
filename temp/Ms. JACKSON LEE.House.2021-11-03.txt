 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker and I thank the  manager very much, and I thank Congresswoman Garcia of Texas for her  leadership and sponsorship of H.R. 3992, Protect Older Job Applicants  Act. It is long overdue and an important initiative.   Words from Patti Temple Rocks, communications professional, really  capture what this bill is about: ``I was still on my game, but I was  being moved . . . to make room for someone younger.''   Let me be very clear. There is a great opportunity for all of us to  be employed, and that is what this legislation says. It is specifically  making sure that every American worker is protected. Specifically, this  bill will make it unlawful to limit, segregate, or classify job  applicants in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any  individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect  his or her status as a job applicant because of such individual's age.   This bill will include the job application process in ADEA's  antidiscrimination provisions and, again, disallow anyone from  classifying you and discriminating because of age.   H.R. 3992 would give external candidates the express right under  Federal law to bring these types of claims against employers. What I  would simply say to my friends, this is to prohibit but it is also to  prevent or intervene so that employers can know the right things to do.   According to AARP, one in four workers age 45 and older have been  subjected to negative comments about their age from supervisors or  coworkers, and 76 percent age discrimination find that as a hurdle in  helping to find a new job.   We also recognize that there is a lot of talent with older workers.  Paradoxically, what most companies do not seem to understand is that  older workers possess a depth of knowledge and experience that is worth  paying for and is not easily replaced and can be tapped in from many  different ways; and, as well, having a mix of people of all  generations, able and ready, and disabled, if you will, to work  alongside of each other.   ``People walk out of companies now with an enormous amount of  intellectual property in their heads,'' says Paul Rupert, the founder  and CEO of Respectful Exits, a nonprofit consulting firm that is  raising corporate awareness about age discrimination. ``They know  things that are essential to the company's success, and if that  knowledge is not captured and transmitted to the next generation, that  company is losing a tremendous chunk of capital, and it will eventually  pay a price.''   So what is the point? The point is to recognize how important it is  to ensure that we don't discriminate. In fact, women age 40 are finding  that if they lose a job they, too, are being discriminated against in  terms of getting a job.   I want to, again, salute the sponsor of this legislation, the manager  of this legislation, and of course, the chairman of the Education and  Labor Committee, Chairman Scott, along with all of those who supported  this to ensure this is about fairness.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, we always promote equal  justice. We partner with the Education and Labor Committee in its work  on equal justice. So this is legislation that provides opportunities  for equal justice, and I would ask my colleagues to support this bill,  H.R. 3992, Protect Older Job Applicants Act. But more importantly,  let's protect the intellectual capital of all Americans, every job  applicant.   Let there not be discrimination against you for race or color or  creed or disability or gender or anything else, and certainly have  respect for that intellectual capital that older American workers bring  to the workforce. Let's celebrate it; let's have a good time with it;  and let's build our companies on all of this genius that happens to be  the American workers now today.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3992, the ``Protect  Older Job Applicants Act,'' which will amend the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits age-based discrimination in  hiring, to specifically prohibit employers from limiting, segregating,  or classifying job applicants on the basis of age.   People of all ages, but especially older applicants, must be  protected from discriminatory practices and loopholes that hurt their  chances to get a job, especially as we have seen that older American  workers have disproportionately experienced long-term unemployment in  the COVID economy.   The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967 was  passed to prohibit age-based discrimination for current employees and  job applicants.   However, two federal circuit court decisions over the last five years  have ruled that some provisions of the ADEA's federal anti-age  discrimination protections only applied to current employees, not job  applicants.   In 2016, the 11th Circuit case Villarreal v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco  Company held that the ADEA disparate impact statute only covers  employees, but not older applicants, and in 2019, the 7th Circuit  adopted the same interpretation in Kleber v. CareFusion Corporation.   The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to review the appellate court  decisions.   Currently, employers, especially those within the 7th and 11th  Circuits, have a valid defense to claims under the ADEA where external  job applicants allege they have been negatively impacted by hiring  practices on the basis of their age.   H.R. 3992 would give external candidates the express right under  federal law to bring these types of claims against employers.   This bill will include the job application process in ADEA's  antidiscrimination provisions.   Specifically, this bill will make it unlawful ``to limit, segregate,  or classify . . . [job applicants] in any way which would deprive or  tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise  adversely affect his status as . . . [a job applicant], because of such  individual's age.''   According to the AARP, 1 in 4 workers age 45 and older have been  subjected to negative comments about their age from supervisors or  coworkers, and 76 percent see age discrimination as a hurdle to finding  a new job.   In one University of California, Irvine, study, resumes were sent out  on behalf of more than 40,000 fictitious applicants of different ages  for thousands of low-skill jobs like janitors, administrative  assistants and retail sales clerks in 12 cities.   This study found that the older the applicant was, the fewer  callbacks the applicant received.   This study also found that age discrimination has the highest impact  on women, who suffer more age discrimination then men starting in their  40s.   According to David Neumark, a professor of economics who oversaw the  study, ``[t]he evidence of age discrimination against women . . . pops  out in every study'' conducted on age discrimination.  [[Page H6163]]    Ageism is still very much present in our society, and it is important  we acknowledge that we still have much work to do to correct this bias  and give every job applicant a fair and equal opportunity when applying  for a job.    Madam Speaker, I just wanted to be able to really  inform the American people and to let my friends on the other side of  the aisle know what they are missing out on. And that is the greatest  effort to improve the quality of life of Americans and raise their  economic level of living since Social Security under Franklin Delano  Roosevelt, since the Great Society under Lyndon Baines Johnson.   Working moms having the ability to not pay more than 7 percent of  their income to get childcare. Young--just beginning school, three  years old and four years old--and not one three- or four-year-old being  left out of pre-K. Giving them the intellectual stairstep to make a  difference in their lives.   And in the State of Texas--the poster child for the uninsured--oh, my  goodness, how we have suffered: 766,000 uninsured refuse to take the  expanded Medicaid. And now we have the ability to give every person  healthcare. And when I spoke to a group that was supported by the  American Heart Association, they applauded.   Build back better is what we need to do and we need to do it now and  pass both bills, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill--changing lives in  America.                            ____________________
