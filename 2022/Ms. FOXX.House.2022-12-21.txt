 Mr. Speaker, our postsecondary education system is broken.   The Government Accountability Office recently released the troubling  report blasting colleges for giving perspective students misleading  information on financial aid letters. The report found that only 9  percent of college financial aid letters correctly calculated students'  out-of-pocket costs, and nearly half misled students by blurring the  lines between grants and loans, in some cases by tens of thousands of  dollars.   This lack of transparency is inexcusable and outright shameful.   Students and families make one of the most critical financial  decisions of their lives when they accept their financial aid offer.  Schools should not hide the true cost of college from them.   That is why Representative Lisa McClain and I introduced the College  Cost Transparency and Student Protection Act to ensure that aid offers  are clear, so student and parent choice are maximized.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 989, the Native American  Language Resource Center Act of 2022.   This legislation will support Native American language centers toward  fulfilling the mission of the Native American Language Act, a  bipartisan bill passed in 1990, with the intent of revitalizing Native  American languages.   This legislation has been helping Native American Tribes preserve  their cultural heritage for 32 years. S. 989 will help advance this  mission. Specifically, S. 989 ensures taxpayer funds are targeted  toward the intended purpose preserving Native languages.   Promoting and preserving Native American languages is a challenging  mission, but a worthy one. Sadly, some languages have already been  lost.   In 2008, Chief Marie Smith Jones passed away. She was the last  speaker of the Eyak language of an Alaskan indigenous Tribe. When she  died, so would have the Eyak language if she had not worked to create a  dictionary and recordings of the language.   According to the National Geographic, one language dies every 14  days. S. 989 will help prevent that from happening. Simply put, this  legislation works to provide Native American language centers with the  resources they need to keep our country's cultures, traditions, and  heritage alive.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 989, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, S. 989 will assist Native American resource centers in  further aligning the resources they are provided by the Department of  Education with the goals of the Native American Language Act.   By supporting the development, preservation, and promotion of Native  American languages, this legislation ensures that the rich, cultural  heritage and traditions of Native Americans are not lost to future  generations.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues who have spoken in support of S.  989, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1402, the Durbin Feeling  Native American Languages Act, named after Durbin Feeling, a linguist  from the Cherokee Nation who passed away in 2020. This bill takes  positive steps to preserve the legacy of Native languages and cultures.   In short, this legislation directs the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, HHS, to work with other Federal agencies, local, and Tribal  partners to examine which laws are helping protect Tribal languages and  which aren't.   This legislation will bolster efforts to preserve, promote, and  revitalize Tribal languages and culture. This legislation also creates  a voluntary survey to assess the use of Native American languages. It  is important to know if these efforts are effective.   This bill also promotes good governance. The President will be  required to report to Congress on whether Federal laws are hindering  the preservation of Native American languages. This is an example of  responsible legislating, which includes limiting redundancy, holding  agencies accountable, and ensuring laws are working as intended.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1402, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, the Durbin Feeling Native American Languages Act is a  commonsense bill that will help preserve the integrity of Native  languages and culture.   Directing the Secretary of HHS to work across the Federal Government  and with Tribal leaders to examine which laws are helping Native  languages thrive is pragmatic. Directing the President to keep us  informed on those efforts is also wise.   Language is integral to any culture; this sensible legislation will  aid in the important work of keeping Native American languages alive  and strong.   Madam Speaker, I support this bill, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 5329, the Food Donation  Improvement Act. This bipartisan, bicameral bill will help expand the  donation of food to those most in need. This is the perfect bill to  pass during the holiday season, a time when we are reminded that it is  better to give than to receive.   Specifically, this commonsense legislation extends liability  protections to those who donate food, either directly to a person in  need or to those selling food at a deeply reduced cost. In other words,  it is another avenue to help disadvantaged Americans get the food they  need to thrive.   Helping nonprofits, farmers, schools, restaurants, and others to  assist the hungry in their neighborhoods without increasing costs to  taxpayers is legislating at its best.   This bill ensures generous Americans can give food to those in need  without facing unnecessary liability. Our country is one of the most  generous in the world. It is time to unleash that generosity.   S. 5329 will help reduce food waste, while also increasing support  from Americans most in need. According to Forbes: ``Approximately 40  percent of food in the U.S. is wasted, and the U.S. spends $408 billion  each year processing, transporting, storing, and disposing of food that  is never eaten.''   This is an unnecessary waste, especially when so many Americans could  use this food to feed their families. That is why I support this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank my colleague and friend,  Jim McGovern, also for calling this  bill to my attention last week. He pointed this out to me, and I say  that Republicans support good government solutions that prevent waste,  while also providing for those most in need.   Today's legislation is the embodiment of commonsense solutions. It  provides the assurance many Americans need to guarantee they are  protected when giving to those in need.   Our laws should be promoting charity and generosity, not curtailing  it. There is no reason to let food go to waste when we can get it to  those families most in need.   This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will get food to the hungry,  and it does so without adding to the taxpayers' tab. This is a win-win.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.
