 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the  conclusion of Senator Brown's remarks I be recognized for my remarks.    Mr. President, I am here on the floor for my 202nd  ``Time to Wake Up'' speech. I would like to begin by thanking this body  for the passing of the National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund as  part of the measure that Republicans and Democrats agreed to before the  recent recess. The Presiding Officer obviously represents an extremely  coastal State. I represent Rhode Island, a very coastal State. This new  program will provide resources for the communities along our shores to  be able to deal with the threats they are seeing from sea level rise,  fisheries moving about, worsening offshore storms, tides that now come  ashore on bright sunny days, and the various hazards that they must  undertake so that they are not left alone trying to address them.   I often use these speeches to explore why it is that we get nothing  done in Congress on climate. I point out that the major reason is the  insidious fossil-fuel-funded web of climate change denial, with a  parallel lobbying and electioneering effort.   I point out that this network is funded by the fossil fuel industry  in a deliberate and systematic effort to misdirect public discussion  and to distort public understanding of climate change and climate  science.   I point out that it is actually working. It has been so effective at  infiltrating our political system that the head of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency is a full-on fossil fuel flunky. I  discuss the fossil fuel industry's parallel web that directs rivers of  dark money into our political system and deploys related, but more  clandestine, threats and promises to work the industry's will in  Congress.   Like I said, it is working. The web of denial and political  enforcement organizations has so far achieved its purpose: to prevent  Congress from carrying out its responsibility to rein in carbon  pollution. We are, as a result, failing to protect the American people  and our economy from the effects of that pollution, particularly our  coastal economies. But now agriculture and other economies are feeling  it too, and Congress is still doing nothing.   So this secretive and insidious apparatus deserves our attention.  Nowadays, this apparatus is dedicated to denying science, confusing the  public, and holding a political whip hand over Congress on the issue of  climate change. Nowadays, it does this to protect the fossil fuel  industry from responsibility for its pollution. But it is actually not  a new enterprise.   We have never seen this machinery operating at this scale before. It  is bigger and more multifaceted than ever, but we have seen its tricks  before. The science denial playbook, commissioned by the Koch brothers,  ExxonMobil, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to stymie climate action,  is the same doubt-mongering playbook we have seen used by Big Tobacco,  by chemical industries, and by other corporate polluters for decades.   I am not the only one who has noticed. A lot of work has examined  this denial apparatus--how it is funded, how it hides its funding, how  it communicates, and how it propagates the denial message. This is  valuable work because the better America understands the mechanisms of  this deceitful operation, the better America can inoculate itself  against that deceit.   So I have brought some of this work with me to the Senate floor  today. It is kind of a beginner's bibliography of this apparatus.   I will start with a book called ``Deceit and Denial,'' and, on the  cover, described by Bill Moyers as ``the best detective story I've read  in years.'' This  [[Page S2031]]  book is written by Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner, who have been  tracking the efforts of industry to hide scientific facts about  pollution for a long time. They point out in their introduction here:         Some industries . . . have reassured the public that their       products are benign by controlling research and manipulating       science. Throughout much of the twentieth century, most       scientific studies of the health effects of toxic substances       have been done by researchers in the employ of industry or in       universities with financial ties to members of that industry.       At times their results were subject to review by industry; if       the results indicated a problem, the information was       suppressed.    This goes way back into the annals of denial.   My next book is ``Poison Tea.'' It is a book written by Jeff Nesbit.  It goes back into the tobacco documents that were protected in the  tobacco settlement. The attorneys general demanded that the documents  of the tobacco companies be set aside as a permanent reference. Jeff  Nesbit was present at some of the efforts to create the tobacco  industry version of climate denial. He saw it happening up close. He  was in some of the meetings. In chapter 25, he opens up with this:         If the 14 million internal tobacco industry memos and       documents show one thing clearly, it is this: political       campaign networks built to defend and promote large corporate       interests with integrated goals, messaging, targets, and       allies simply don't materialize overnight. The funding and       strategies behind them take years to develop before reaching       maturity. And they build on each other over time.    I turn now to ``Doubt is Their Product.'' This is David Michaels'  book. The subtitle is ``How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens  Your Health.''   The quotation I have selected moves from the general principle of  science denial on behalf of industries into global warming as this  scheme moved forward:         Take global warming. The vast majority of climate       scientists believe there is adequate evidence of global       warming to justify immediate intervention to reduce the human       contribution.    Now, this was written, just to be clear, in 2008, a decade ago--a  decade ago:         The vast majority of climate scientists believe there is       adequate evidence global warming to justify immediate       intervention to reduce the human contribution. They       understand that waiting for absolute certainty is far       riskier--and potentially far more expensive--than acting       responsibly now--    That is, 10 years ago--       to control the causes of climate change. Opponents of action,       led by the fossil fuels industry, delayed this policy       debate--    And for another decade--       by challenging the science with a classic uncertainty       campaign.    He cites what he calls a cynical memo that Republican political  consultant Frank Luntz delivered to his clients in early 2003, saying:         The scientific debate is closing [against us] but not yet       closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge       the science.        Luntz understood that his clients can oppose (and delay)       regulation . . . by simply manufacturing uncertainty. Doubt       is their product.    The next book is by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, entitled  ``Merchants of Doubt,'' which was actually made into a film as well.  They have done a lot of work in this area.   Here is the conclusion:         Doubt-mongering works because we think science is about       facts--cold, hard, definite facts.        This is a mistake. There are always uncertainties in any       live science because science is a process of discovery.        Doubt is crucial to science . . . but it also makes science       vulnerable to misrepresentation, because it is easy to take       uncertainties out of context and create the impression that       everything is unresolved. This was the tobacco industry's key       insight: That you could use normal scientific uncertainty to       undermine the status of actual scientific knowledge.        ``Doubt is our product,'' ran the infamous memo written by       one tobacco industry executive in 1969.    ``Merchants of Doubt'' goes on to describe how that exact same  technique--and many of the same individuals and organizations--carried  that over from tobacco smoke to global warming. Subtitle: ``How a  Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke  to Global Warming.''   This is a book by Pulitzer Prize winning author Steve Coll. He is  actually speaking tonight at the Library of Congress. This book is  called ``Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power.'' It describes  the mischief that Exxon got up to in pursuing its political goals here  in Washington. He describes the underlying structure of Washington  policy debates. He calls it a ``kaleidoscope of overlapping and  competing influence campaigns, some open, some conducted by front  organizations, and some entirely clandestine.''   Obviously, if you are ExxonMobil, you don't want your name on all of  this stuff--hence, the ``kaleidoscope of overlapping and competing  influence campaigns, some open, some conducted by front organizations,  and some entirely clandestine.''   He continues:         Strategists created layers of disguise, subtlety, and       subterfuge--corporate-funded ``grassroots'' programs and       purpose-built think tanks, as fingerprint-free as possible.       In such an opaque and untrustworthy atmosphere, the ultimate       advantage lay with any lobbyist whose goal was to manufacture       confusion and perpetual controversy. On climate, this       happened to be the oil industry's position.    In his book ``The War on Science,'' Shawn Otto goes in some detail  through the scheming that backs up what he calls ``a steady stream of  pseudoscience that can be used by foot soldiers to sway the public  debate.''   He goes through a number of steps that are the standard parts of this  campaign, starting with phony science:         Phony science . . . that creates ``uncertainties'' about       the accepted views of mainstream science.    So you start off with phony science that creates phony uncertainties  about the accepted views of mainstream science.         Step two follows with slanted press materials spoon-fed to       journalists by industry-affiliated nonprofits and bloggers.    A third step of this PR battle is what he calls ``building and  financing industry-aligned front groups (fake public-interest  organizations) and astroturf groups (fake grassroots organizations).''   And we sure do see those fake public interest organizations and fake  grassroots organizations whipped up by the fossil fuel industry today.   Step 4 is outlier scientists--the ones who can cook up the  pseudoscience that can be used by foot soldiers:         Outlier scientists are recruited to publish in phony       journals and speak at conferences of physicians, lawyers, and       other professionals, emphasizing the controversy and sowing       ``uncertainties'' and denial, thus using peer-pressure to       create true believers among the influential opinion leaders.    You then shove out into ``industry-aligned, or otherwise sympathetic  talk-radio and cable-news purveyors, who reference these mainstream  sources, react with outrage, and call for policy action.'' This  provides political cover for legislative or other ``policy action by  partisan allies in government.''         Industry representatives can step safely out from behind       the curtain for the main act of the culture-war drama and       plead their case to policymakers. . . . The strategy is       designed to neutralize the primacy of objective knowledge--    We wouldn't want to make decisions around here based on objective  knowledge--       and slowly move public opinion toward accepting the       industry's position as the only truly reasonable one,       subverting the democratic process.    From my experience, that is a pretty good description as to how this  game is played.   Thank you, Shawn Otto.   Two of the people who do some of the best work looking at this  climate denial apparatus and tracking its funding are academic writers  Riley Dunlap and Robert Brulle. Their book, ``Climate Change and  Society,'' drills into this pretty well. Here is the description.         Over time, manufacturing uncertainty has evolved into       ``manufacturing controversy,'' creating the impression that       there is major debate and dissent within the scientific       community over the reality of anthropogenic climate change.       To accomplish this, corporations and especially CTTs have       supported a small number of contrarian scientists (many with       no formal training in climate science) and other self-styled       ``experts'' (often social scientists affiliated with CTTs) to       produce non-peer-reviewed reports and books, publish in a       handful of marginal journals, hold ``scientific''       conferences, compile dubious lists of supposed scientists who       question climate change, and in general mimic the workings of       conventional science . . . fashioning a ``parallel scientific       universe'' that serves to generate confusion among the public       and policymakers.    Thank you, Riley Dunlap and Robert Brulle for your years of research.  [[Page S2032]]    Recently Jane Mayer's book, ``Dark Money,'' has gotten a lot of  attention. It focuses on the extent to which the Koch brothers  specifically use the caverns for subterranean dark money to mess around  in our politics. Following up on the use of conservative think tanks,  we have an early--I guess you would say ``strategizer'' of this effort  quoted as saying:         It would be necessary to use ambiguous and misleading       names, obscure the true agenda, and conceal the means of       control.    That is the background. This whole development of the think tank is  described here this way:         In the 1970s, with funding from a handful of hugely wealthy       donors . . . as well as some major corporate support, a whole       new form of ``think tank'' emerged that was more engaged in       selling predetermined ideology to politicians and the public       than undertaking scholarly research.    To use her phrase, it was ``the think tank as disguised political  weapon.''   That is part of what we are up against.   ``Democracy in Chains,'' a book by Nancy MacLean, looks back at some  of the early history through which the Koch brothers and others funded  this operation. It points out that ``the Koch team's most important  stealth move, and the one that proved most critical to success, was to  wrest control over the machinery of the Republican Party, beginning in  the late 1990s and with sharply escalating determination after 2008.''   What made them want to do this? I will read. The Koch cadre  identified the public's embrace of environmentalism as a problem early  on. They then pulled together--       a circle of less-known Koch-funded libertarian think tanks       driving what two science scholars describe as systematic       environmental ``misinformation campaigns.'' They spread junk       pseudoscience to make the public believe that there is still       doubt about the peril of climate change, a tactic they       learned from the tobacco companies that for years sowed doubt       about science to keep the public from connecting smoking and       illness.        The Koch team by then could count on its Club for Growth to       fund primary challenges to ensure that the party line on       environmentalism would be maintained by Republican members of       Congress. . . . ``We're looking at a party,'' the economist       and columnist Paul Krugman rightly points out, ``that has       turned its back on science at a time when doing so puts the       very future of civilization at risk.''        Backing up that chokehold on federal action is what one       reporter called a ``secretive alliance'' between red-state       attorneys general and fossil fuel corporations.    Again, we link back to my earlier remarks. One of the red States'  attorneys general who link up with the fossil fuel corporations is none  other than our EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt.   She concludes it this way:         To put all this another way: if the Koch-network-funded       academics and institutions were not in the conversation, the       public would have little doubt that the evidence of science       is overwhelming and government action to prevent further       global warming is urgent.    I will close with a return to Jane Mayer, whose research on this  whole dark money problem that bedevils our democracy has been nothing  less than heroic, in my view. She wrote recently:         If there was any lingering doubt that a tiny clique of       fossil-fuel barons has captured America's energy and       environmental policies, it was dispelled . . . when the Trump       Administration withdrew from the Paris climate accord. . . .       [A] majority of Americans in literally every state wanted to       remain within the agreement, and . . . the heads of many of       the country's most successful and iconic Fortune 100       companies, from Disney to General Electric, did, too. . . .       Yet . . . a tiny--and until recently, almost faceless--      minority somehow prevailed.        How this happened is no longer a secret. The answer . . .       is ``a story of big political money.'' It is, perhaps, the       most astounding example of influence-buying in modern       American political history.    It is focused now on climate change because climate change is--and I  quote her again here--`` `a direct challenge to the most powerful  industry that has ever existed on the face of the Earth. There's no  depth to which they are unwilling to sink to challenge anything  threatening their interests.' ''   That is a pretty good description by a lot of very well-regarded, and  some in cases, Pulitzer Prize winning and award-winning writers and  researchers about where we are. The result of all that is the gridlock  that these interests have bought and paid for in Congress on this  critical issue and an administration that is driven by fossil fuel  interests to roll back all regulations that impinge on fossil fuel  profits. Using that screen these authors have talked about--and that I  have talked about--of think tanks and foundations and public relations  firms and trade associations and, of course, those rivers of dark money  flowing through subterranean political caverns, this industry--the  fossil fuel industry--has taken control of and disabled our American  political system. That is a very inconvenient truth for those in our  political system, but its inconvenience takes away nothing from its  truth.   Thanks to these authors and researchers and many others like them-- many others like them--the truth of what has happened is plain. It is  not just plain in these books. It will be plain before the reckoning  gaze of history. There will be a reckoning. History always looks back,  ultimately. If you look at these books and you look at others and you  look at the record of what has taken place and the reporting, there is  no doubt that this is the biggest influence-buying operation of all  time. Do we in Congress really want to be found on the side of this  crooked apparatus when that reckoning comes? God, I hope not. It is  time to wake up.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
