 Mr. Speaker, on June 12, 2016, a lone gunman walked  into the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and opened fire with a  semiautomatic rifle. That night, the shooter killed 49 people and  injured 53 others. At the time, it was the largest mass shooting in  American history.   The Pulse nightclub is in my district, but I was not in Congress at  the time. When I saw the Members of Congress taking to the floor and  holding a sit-in, I was not surprised that the person leading the way  was Representative John Lewis. To him, the victims were a part of the  big family John Lewis often spoke about.   Thank you, John, for never discriminating. Thank you, John, for never  leaving people behind.   Galatians 5 defines the fruit of the spirit as love, peace, long- suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self- control. John Lewis was all of that to the House, to the Nation, and to  the world, and I am grateful for his friendship and his counsel and  grateful for a life well-lived.
