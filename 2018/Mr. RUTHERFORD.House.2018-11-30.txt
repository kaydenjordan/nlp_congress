 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Ms.  Carrie Johnson, a Lincolnville icon who, sadly, passed away earlier  this week in St. Augustine, Florida.   Depending on whom you talked to, Ms. Johnson had many different  names. To some, she was ``St. Augustine's Sweetheart'' or the ``Voice  of Lincolnville.'' To others, she was simply ``Miss Carrie.'' But to  all of us, she will always be remembered as an irreplaceable piece of  our northeast Florida community who truly lived to serve others.   Born out of her life's creed, ``A mission of love, a message of  hope,'' she began a foundation for homeless students in St. Johns  County. She organized annual Christmas caroling to nursing homes, and  she was even considered an honorary officer by the local police, who  loved her and who often came to her for guidance.   She could be seen on any given day riding her ``Lamborghini''  tricycle around town, spreading kindness and hope to everyone she met.   Her passing will leave a hole that can only be filled with the  countless stories of the people whom she touched.   I am thankful for her dedication to making the world a better place  for those around her and grateful that her memory lives on forever. She  was a mission of love and a message of hope.                            ____________________
