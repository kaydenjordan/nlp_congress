 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized for such time as I shall consume.    That is another way of saying I want to complete my  remarks.   Let me say this about the Senator from Maine: Of all the Members of  the Senate Armed Services Committee, he is the one who is always there  and getting involved in these things with a sense of urgency that he  feels in his heart, and I appreciate him as a very valuable member of  that committee. I thank the Senator for all of his service.                                    Russia    Mr. President, earlier this morning, I was at the White House with a  few other Members to receive a briefing on the reports of Putin putting  bounties on troops in Afghanistan. You have been hearing about this.  After a very long briefing, I am confident that President Trump did not  know about the reporting. There is some confusion in terms of our own  intelligence, and it just didn't rise to the level of the President at  that time.   Another takeaway from the briefing is that our intelligence agencies  aren't in complete agreement on this even now. This is going to  continue to be a Washington, DC, story--one where they try to make the  President look bad.   Here is what we also know, and we don't need any special intelligence  to tell us. Putin is a murderer, a thug. He hates America. He hates our  interests. We know that, and we are doing something about it. President  Trump has taken a whole list of steps to protect our troops and stand  up against Russia's actions.  [[Page S3992]]    In the Senate, the NDAA is focused on our top priority of taking care  of our troops and also aligning our military to better deter against  China and Russia. As we continue consideration, let me just give a  brief update as to where we are right now.   We talk a lot about our troops and our military strength in this  bill.   At the end of the day, the bill affects all American families and our  communities directly. It is about their security, their freedom, their  prosperity.   We introduced an amendment last night that included 79 bipartisan  amendments. As we speak, we are working on building a managers' package  that includes dozens of bipartisan amendments. We are really doing the  job the way it is supposed to be done, the way we did last year and the  year before.   The safety of the American people is not negotiable. With the fiscal  year 2021 NDAA, we move one step closer to ensuring the safety of and  closing the gap between our military and those of China and Russia.   For some reason, this never gets out in the media. Nobody ever talks  about this and, to me, it is so significant that during the Obama  years--the last 5 years, which would have been between 2010 and 2015-- he reduced spending on defense by 25 percent. That is 25 percent in a  5-year period. I don't think we have ever seen that before. At the same  time that we were reducing by 25 percent, Russia was increasing by 34  percent. If you think that is bad, at the same time China was  increasing by 83 percent. We reduce by 25 percent and China increases  by 83 percent.   How do you catch up? It is going to be hard work.   As for some things in this bill, it increases funding for weapons  procurement programs, including Tomahawk missiles, long-range anti-ship  missiles, ground-based anti-ship missiles, and realigning our weapons  capability to match the NDS.   This is the NDS. I like to take this with me so people understand  that this is really a well-thought-out short document. This is put  together by 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans. All were considered to be  experts and all were coming to agreement. Can you believe that 12  Democrats and 12 Republicans were all in agreement?   That is what this is all about. It reestablishes our superiority in  the air by focusing on procurement for the Air Force, while also  preventing divestment of legacy aircraft like the KC-135. It was  envisioned about a year ago that we would be phasing it out, but things  have slowed down a little bit. Its replacement is the KC-46. It will  take a while for that to get online. In the meantime, we do have an  adequate number of working KC-135s. We are talking about a vehicle that  is 60 years old, but they are still working and working well. It shows  what we are going to come up with when the KC-46 finally comes online.   It reestablishes our superiority on the seas by increasing  authorization for shipbuilding and authorization for procurement to  achieve the 355-ship Navy. We are still talking about that. It supports  the Army's focus on multidomain capabilities, especially the  modernization priorities, and it keeps our eye on Space.   The bill also goes beyond our bases too. A few examples are the  Defense Community Infrastructure Program, Impact Aid, STARBASE for  science and technology, and research partnerships with universities.  This is very significant because I know three universities that have  been active in this field for the last 3 years.   It also includes research and experimentation in 5G, which is vital  to maintaining both our military and our economic advantages.   One other thing this bill does that I want to highlight is that it  protects our GPS signals. This is very important. Recently, the Federal  Communications Commission OK'd a proposal by Ligado Networks to make a  new cellular network that jeopardizes GPS signals that so many people  rely on. That is not just me saying that; we had a hearing. We had the  military, and some 12 agencies of government all joined in. Nobody else  on the other side was talking about what Ligado is going to do and the  jeopardy it puts on our GPS system. That is not just military. We are  not just talking about use in the field for these signals, but the  pilots in the sky, construction workers on job sites, and even our  farmers use GPS to irrigate and harvest their crops.   Even though the Department of Defense and more than a dozen other  Federal agencies objected, the FCC went ahead with this deal. To make  it even worse, the FCC was aware of the threat that was being posed and  the objections that were out there, and they actually had that vote  over a weekend. I went back and checked with it and found out that they  had never done that before. I don't know. I can't talk about that  because I don't have the answers. I have been trying to get the  answers.   The NDAA makes sure the DOD is not on the hook for the costly updates  if Ligado moves ahead with the deal by prohibiting the use of DOD funds  to comply with the order until these three things occur: The Secretary  of Defense submits an estimate of the costs associated with the GPS  interference; two, it directs the Secretary of Defense to contract with  the National Academies of Science and Engineering for an independent  technical review; and, three, then the bill further directs the  Secretary of Defense to create a process to ensure that our Nation's  military is reimbursed directly by Ligado for the interference that  they caused. In short, it makes sure that we are not wasting taxpayer  money to fix the problems that Ligado is causing.   These are just a few of the reasons this bill is more than just a  military bill. First and foremost, it is what it is--a security bill.  Every provision in this bill matters to our national security, but it  also goes beyond that.   I think it is really important that Americans know that, with the  bill, we are leaving a legacy for our children and our grandchildren.  It is one that values peace, protects economic prosperity, and  safeguards our freedoms.   You have to keep in mind that this bill has passed every year for 60  years. It is very unusual that something like this would happen. In  fact, this is the only area where that has happened. We do know that  the results are there. We know that it is going to pass. It has passed  for 59 years, and it will pass for another year   We are going to make sure that we put our military back to where it  should be--back where it was prior to the last administration.   I think everyone should realize that we are still waiting for the  last shot of amendments, and we are ready to go ahead and finish it.  Conceivably, we can get this thing done before the Fourth of July  recess. That could happen. We are talking about this coming Thursday.  We are in the process of getting this done now.   In my opinion, it is the most important bill of the year, and we are  going to get it finished.   I yield the floor.
