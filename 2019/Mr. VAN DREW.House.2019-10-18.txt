 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove my name  as a cosponsor of H.R. 860, the Social Security 2100 Act.    Madam Speaker, Marilyn Miguel is 18 years old. She  graduated from Vineland High School with a 4.0 this year, and she  received a full-ride scholarship to Harvard University. She also has  coordinated with Harvard for their new community outreach program,  Service Starts with Summer, which encourages incoming freshmen to  create service projects for their various communities.   As a first-generation college student and a second-generation Mexican  American, Marilyn knew the importance of implementing a college  preparation course for incoming seniors at her high school. Her free  program ran from August 13 to 15, and Marilyn made sure to create an  accessible, comprehensive college prep course for the people of south  Jersey.   Marilyn says the goal of her program was to help people discover  their own potential. Nothing could be more important. Programs like  these are essential for the success of young people, and I commend  Marilyn for bringing it to our community in south Jersey.   I wish Marilyn the best of luck at Harvard and to have a wonderful  year. You are truly a star, and south Jersey is proud of you.                            ____________________
