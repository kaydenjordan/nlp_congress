 Madam President, the deadline to fund the government  is nearly upon us. The Senate is now just hours away from an entirely  avoidable government shutdown. At midnight tonight, funding for  programs that millions of Americans rely on--veterans services, opioid  treatment centers, death benefits for the families of fallen soldiers,  and health insurance for 9 million vulnerable children--would be thrown  into chaos.   Last night the Senate began consideration of a bill passed by the  House that would erase all of these threats. The bill keeps the Federal  Government open. It extends the State Children's Health Insurance  Program, which provides coverage for 9 million children and low-income  families for 6 years. This vote should be a no-brainer, and it would  be, except that the Democratic leader has convinced his Members to  filibuster any funding bill that doesn't include legislation they are  demanding for people who came into the United States illegally. What  has been shoehorned into this discussion is an insistence that we deal  with an illegal immigration issue.   He has insisted that he will not support any legislation at all for  the American people no matter how noncontroversial or how bipartisan  unless we pass a bill on illegal immigration first. If that means  shutting down the funding for veterans, military families, opioid  treatment centers, and even Federal grants to his home State of New  York, so be it. If it means throwing a wrench into the gears of the  U.S. economy, just as Americans are starting to feel the benefits of  historic tax reform, so be it. If it means failing to renew the  Children's Health Insurance Program, which the House-passed bill funded  for a full 6 years, apparently that is just fine with those on the  other side.   Nearly every Democrat in the House made the same demand. That has  been their stated position: Nothing for hundreds of millions of  Americans and no healthcare for 9 million vulnerable children until we  solve a non-imminent issue related to illegal immigration. To even  repeat this position out loud is to see how completely ridiculous it  is.   Now that we are 13 hours away from a government shutdown that the  Democrats would initiate and Democrats would own, the craziness of this  seems to be dawning on my friend the Democratic leader. Perhaps he is  remembering his own words from 2013. Here is what he said back then  about threatening a government shutdown.         No matter how strongly one feels about an issue, you       shouldn't hold millions of people hostage . . . that's wrong.    A few days later, the Democratic leader added:         It's sort of like this. Someone goes into your house, takes       your wife and children hostage, and then says, ``Let's       negotiate over the price of your house.''    He went on to say.         We're shutting down the government, we're not gonna raise       the debt ceiling until you pass immigration reform. It would       be governmental chaos.    Now maybe he is remembering those words today because now he is  saying: Never mind, I really didn't mean it, and he himself is calling  for an even shorter short-term funding bill. Of course, his last-ditch  proposals would do nothing for the Children's Health Insurance Program  or the 9 million children who are waiting on us to renew it. What is  more, the incredibly short-term continuing resolutions he is now  proposing do not meet any of the demands--none of them--that he and his  own conference and Democrats in the House have been making for weeks.  None of that would be solved in a short-term CR--the stuff they have  been calling for.   So apparently now he wants his Members to default on their own  demands. He has spent days apparently persuading all of his colleagues  to insist that we cannot pass another continuing resolution. Now he  wants them to pass one. He spent weeks getting his Members to proclaim  that we should not do anything to fund the government unless we address  the DACA issue, and now apparently he is calling  [[Page S316]]  on them to do just that. These incredibly short-term extensions would  not even give us enough time to actually write the legislation the  Democratic leader is demanding. One extremely short-term CR would lead  to another and another--exactly the outcome Democrats have declared  they cannot accept.   Now, I wish for all of our sakes that the Democratic leader would  figure out what he actually wants. I feel bad for his own Members. He  has painted them into a corner, but I especially feel bad for the  American people whose government the Democrats are threatening to shut  down and the 9 million children whose health insurance could be thrown  into jeopardy because Senate Democrats cannot get their story straight.   Now, my friend the Democratic leader now wants his Members to pass a  bill that allows SCHIP to expire. Apparently, he now wants every  Democrat in the House of Representatives to break their word and pass a  separate funding bill of his own that does not address the illegal  immigration issue they said they must have. So let's think about this  for a minute. First, he leads his own troops into a box canyon, and  then tells them it was really all for nothing. Maybe it is time to come  back to reality.   We already have a bill that we know can pass the House because it  already did. We have a bill that we know the President will sign into  law because he has already committed to do just that. We know that with  one noncontroversial and bipartisan vote we can keep the government up  and running. We can fund the children's healthcare program for 6 years,  and we can give ourselves the time we need to finish ongoing  negotiations on DACA, border security, and the long-term needs of our  military. We could do all of that today--all of it--or our Democratic  friends can continue to take the Democratic leader's advice and vote to  shut down the government, destabilize funding for our troops, shut down  the children's healthcare program, and still not get what they are  demanding on illegal immigration. It is really up to them.   I look forward to voting soon on cloture on the House bill. The  American people, the citizens who actually elected us, will be  watching. They will see which Senators make the patriotic decision to  stand up for the American people and vote to continue government  funding and extend children's healthcare while we continue our  bipartisan talks, and they will see which Senators vote to shove aside  veterans, military families, and vulnerable children and to hold the  entire country hostage until we pass an immigration bill they haven't  even written yet.   It is completely unfair and uncompassionate for my Democratic  colleagues to filibuster government funding, harm our troops, and  jeopardize health coverage for 9 million children because extreme  elements of their base want illegal immigration to crowd out every  other priority. Apparently, they believe the issue of illegal  immigration is more important than everything else--all the government  services the American people depend on.   I would recommend to stop the wild-goose chase. Don't go to a  destination that cannot be explained. Let's fulfill the core  responsibilities of Congress. Let's fund the government, provide for  the American people, and then resume serious negotiations on the issues  that matter most. Let's fund the government for a full month so we can  actually get something done.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke  cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate  amendment at 10 p.m. tonight.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Mr. President, I want to call to the attention of my  colleagues a part of the statement of the White House Press Secretary  tonight, presumably on behalf of the administration. It simply says: We  will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats  hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands.   That appropriately represents the White House view of where we are.  And what we have just witnessed on the floor was a cynical decision by  Senate Democrats to shove aside millions of Americans for the sake of  irresponsible political gains. A government shutdown was 100 percent  avoidable--completely avoidable. Now it is imminent, all because Senate  Democrats chose to filibuster a noncontroversial funding bill that  contains nothing, not a thing, they do not support--nothing they do not  support.   Perhaps across the aisle some of our Democratic colleagues are  feeling proud of themselves, but what has their filibuster  accomplished? What has it accomplished? The answer is simple: their  very own government shutdown.   The shutdown effects on the American people will come as no surprise.  All week, as we have stood on the floor and begged our colleagues to  come to their senses, Senate Republicans have described exactly what  this will mean.   For America's men and women in uniform, shutting down the government  means delayed pay. For the many thousands of civilian employees who  support their missions, it means furloughs. And for the families of  fallen heroes, it may well mean a freeze on survivor death benefits.  For veterans who rely on our promise of care, shutting down the  government means threatening their access to treatment. For so many  Americans struggling with opioid addiction, the same is true. Thanks to  the Democratic leader's decision to filibuster an extension of the  State Children's Health Insurance Program, low-income families will  slip closer to losing health coverage for their kids, and in many  States, this is an emergency.   I am having trouble understanding which one of these outcomes my  Democratic colleagues could possibly be proud of. Which one of them? I  think our friends on the other side took some bad advice--really bad  advice. I would hate to have to be trying to explain this myself.   They ignored the Governors, including seven Democrats who wrote  Congress begging us to extend SCHIP for 9 million children. They  ignored the needs of millions of Americans who rely on the Federal  Government for important services. They held all this hostage--all of  this hostage over the completely unrelated issue of illegal  immigration.   Republicans in the Senate have done all we can to continue the normal  operations of the Federal Government and secure certainty for these  SCHIP kids. We could pass it tonight, it could go to the President for  signature, and these kids would be OK.   Well, we are going to continue to do all we can. We will vote again  so the American people know who stands for them. And when our friends  across the aisle remember who it is they actually represent, we will be  ready to come together in a bipartisan discussion that will be  necessary to clean up all of this mess.   We have all been having private conversations here on the floor.  Almost everybody on both sides doesn't understand how we ended up here,  because most of the stuff, we agree on. Well, there is only one reason  we ended up here: the shoehorning of illegal immigration into this  debate.   Now, having said that, there is a lot of sympathy in this body for  doing something about the DACA kids. It is not like nobody is  interested in that. We have been talking about it for 3 months. But the  one reason we are where we are is because we couldn't close out any of  these other component parts because our friends on the other side said:  You have to deal with this issue. This issue is the key to getting  defense spending, this issue is the key to getting help for SCHIP kids,  and on and on and on.   I think most of the American people believe that shutting down the  government over this issue, which doesn't even ripen until March, is  irresponsible. And I have just listed all of the people who are going  to be adversely impacted by this action.   So we are going to keep on voting, and the government may be heading  into a shutdown, but the Senate is not shutting down. We are open to  talk and to resolve this. I don't think it makes the institution look  very responsible. The American people should expect better from us than  this.    Mr. President, I want to particularly commend the five  Democrats who voted not to shut the government down. The new Senator  from Alabama, during his campaign, said it was important to fund the S- CHIP program before it ran out of money, and he listened to the seven  Democratic Governors who said: This is an emergency; we need help.   There were five courageous Democrats on the other side who stood up  to this ridiculous argument that it made sense somehow to shut down the  government over an illegal immigration issue that the vast majority of  this body would like to do something about anyway.   I want to particularly commend the five Democrats who had the courage  to stand up to this ridiculous strategy that put their whole party in  an incredible predicament because, as the White House just indicated,  the President is not going to talk about the issue at all while the  government is shut down. He made it quite clear. He said: ``When  Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders, we will  reopen negotiations on immigration reform.''   So this particular strategy has eliminated the possibility of getting  a signature on the thing they shut the government down over. Can  anybody explain to me this strategy? I am perplexed. I wasn't first in  my class, but I wasn't last either. How does this get them what they  are looking for?   We will continue to talk because when all the games stop, the issues  are still there--every single one of them are still there. The American  people expect us to act like adults, to get together and solve the  problems.   Now I will be offering an amendment to change the date to February 8.  We will, unfortunately, not be able to get that vote tonight, but I  will be subsequently asking for consent, but at some point here, we  will be voting on February 8. That is the date the senior Senator from  South Carolina and I have been talking about, and the Democratic leader  and I have been talking about--which begins to move a little bit closer  to where our friends on the other side said they wanted to be--but a  reasonable period of time that takes into account the State of the  Union, our party conferences, and the amount of time it takes to  actually write a bill once you have an agreement. You can't just reach  an agreement, snap your fingers, and everything falls into place and  you are ready to go. It is a reasonable period to first agree, and then  write, get ready to negotiate a settlement that we have been working on  for months. February 8 is a very reasonable time. I hear there is  sentiment for that on both sides of the aisle. I hope so.  [[Page S354]]    At some point, we will vote on that option. I can't get that vote  tonight, but I am going to ask consent to have that vote tonight.               Vote on Motion to Refer with Amendment No. 1905     Mr. President, I move to table the motion to refer.    Mr. President, I move to table the motion to concur  with further amendment.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment to H.R. 195, with a further amendment.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk on  the motion to concur with amendment.    Mr. President, I move to refer the House message on  H.R. 195 to the Committee on Appropriations to report back forthwith  with instructions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the mandatory quorum call be waived and the  Senate immediately vote on the motion to invoke cloture without any  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we  passed similar legislation during the government shutdown back in 2013.  My hope is that we can restore funding for the entire government before  this becomes necessary. I am going to object for tonight, but we will  discuss it again tomorrow. Therefore, I object.    I object.    I object.    Mr. President, for the information of all our  colleagues, the Senate will convene at 12 noon tomorrow.   My hope is that an agreement can be reached. We will be here in  session tomorrow working to finally resolve the way forward. Senators  should expect votes tomorrow.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon,  Saturday, January 20; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that  following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the House  message to accompany H.R. 195.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:28 a.m., adjourned until  Saturday, January 20, 2018, at 12 noon.                            ____________________
