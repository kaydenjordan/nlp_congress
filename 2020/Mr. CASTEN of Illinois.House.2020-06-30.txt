 Mr. Speaker, in 1896 Svante Arrhenius  hypothesized that carbon dioxide pollution would trigger a greenhouse  effect.   Since then, we have emitted 1.4 trillion tons of carbon dioxide, and  it has gotten hotter.   In 1987, the Reagan administration crafted the Montreal Protocol to  close the ozone hole. It used market tools to solve environmental  problems, and it worked.   The Kyoto Protocol was supposed to apply that logic to carbon  dioxide. But as many of you know, we then decided to just go  collectively crazy. Scientific truths got politicized. Crackpot  theories got weaponized. Meanwhile, it got hotter.   Today, the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis will release a  comprehensive report with a roadmap to turn this ship around. It  provides policy recommendations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by  almost 90 percent, save our country $9 trillion, and save 62,000 lives  per year by 2050.   It goes further than that. It identifies negative emission tools to  take us back to the sustainable carbon dioxide levels we had in 1985.  1985 by the way, is that point in history where prior to that point we  had emitted 50 percent of all the CO2 emissions as a species  we have emitted up to this point. Back to the future indeed.   I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity. This is an  opportunity to grow the economy and to protect the environment, but  more importantly, it is an opportunity to tell your children that when  the times called on you to act, you rose to that challenge.   Please. Seize this opportunity.                            ____________________
