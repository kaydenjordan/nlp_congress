 Mr. Speaker, last week, the Republican majority pushed  through legislation attacking clean air, clean water, and blocking  public transparency into payments made to foreign governments by oil  and mining companies.   Today we are considering legislation that will roll back  opportunities for the American people to have a say in how our Nation's  public lands are managed. The idea that there should be national public  lands that belong to and are managed on behalf of the American people  is a value that dates back to the founding of our country and is  embedded in our Constitution.   Generation after generation of Americans has endorsed the idea that  our public lands should be managed to balance many competing uses:  recreation, responsible economic development, sustainable resource  extraction, renewable energy, military purposes, and conservation of  historic American landscapes, just to name a few.   We all want to see this important aspect of our national heritage  managed in an effective and efficient manner, balancing conservation  for future generations with sustainable productivity for local  communities.   The Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0, as it is known, will  help us better achieve this balance on the approximately 245 million  acres of land managed by the BLM. As American citizens, we all have a  right to provide input on how we would like to see these public lands  managed; but the current process for doing so is slow, lacks  transparency, and fails to incorporate over 30 years of updated science  and understanding of our changing climate. In fact, this process hasn't  been substantially updated since the Reagan administration. States,  local governments, and other stakeholders all agreed that the process  was in need of updates.   BLM agreed with this consensus and began a 2-year review, receiving  over 3,000 public comments on what changes needed to be made. Two  years, 3,000 public comments, this was no midnight regulation. Their  final product, which the resolution before us today would permanently  overturn, increases transparency, enhances the role of science and  decisionmaking, and strengthens the role of the public's voice earlier  in this planning process.                                time  1400    Planning 2.0 also upholds the Federal Land Policy and Management  Act's commitment to States, local government, and tribes in land  management decisions.   The Bureau of Land Management made several changes in between the  draft rule and the final rule to clarify coordination requirements and  promote consistency with local land use plans, all in response to  concerns raised through the public input process.   According to a BLM fact sheet on the final rule, ``The new rule does  not change the special relationship and opportunities provided by  statute for cooperating agencies,'' and, ``The final rule establishes  several new opportunities for coordination between the BLM and our  government partners.''   We should be working together on proposals that strengthen management  of our public lands, balance conservation with economic development,  and provide sustainable benefits to the people who rely on them for  their economic livelihoods. The resolution before us today flies in the  face of these goals.   I urge my colleagues to reject this Congressional Review Act  resolution and vote ``no.''
