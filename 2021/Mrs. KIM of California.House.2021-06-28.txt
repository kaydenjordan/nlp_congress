 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representatives Houlahan and  Fitzpatrick, for their work on the Global Learning Loss Assessment Act.   As of December 2020, the United Nations estimated that school  classrooms for one in five children, which is over 320 million  children, remained closed. Further reports indicate more than 880  million children worldwide faced disruptions to their education due to  full and partial school closures.   The continued closure of schools and classrooms is having a  devastating impact on the education and the development of the next  generation. This bill requires a report on COVID-19 impacts on the  United States to support education programs in developing countries.   Last year, the United States provided over $900 million to support  basic education programs, including support for teacher training,  curriculum development, and expanding access to education for refugees  and communities in conflict zones.                                time  1630    In many countries, including here in the United States, schools were  forced to pivot to virtual learning or close entirely. This bill does  not provide any additional assistance. Instead, it requires USAID to  assess how previously appropriated funds have been impacted by school  closures and other COVID-19-related issues.   It also requires an assessment of how the administration and our  implementing partners are changing programs to avoid backsliding in  education outcomes as COVID-19 continues to prevent regular schooling.   It is critical that we understand the impacts of COVID-19 on our  programs to ensure our foreign aid is used efficiently and effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Houlahan for this important legislation that  she is introducing. Education lays the foundation for future prosperity  and stability. I am deeply concerned by the impact this pandemic is  having on school children, particularly amongst the vulnerable  communities facing conflict and refugees who are already experiencing  barriers to educational access.   We must understand the full scope of these challenges in order to  address programs accordingly and ensure effective use of our funds. So  I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank my colleagues Congressman Sherman  and Congressman Chabot for introducing this legislation.   COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the world, but some  countries have been hit harder than others.   In March of this year, just as Americans were receiving COVID-19  vaccines and the United States was seeing a decline in cases,  infections in India began to surge. A year before, in the spring of  2020, when the United States was experiencing a spike in COVID-19  cases, India came to our aid and lifted its export ban on certain drugs  in response to a request by the United States.   In response to India's surge, the United States quickly delivered  much-needed supplies, such as PPE, rapid tests, and other drugs to  India. This action from the United States, the world's oldest  democracy, to India, the world's largest democracy, is only fitting.  India and the United States are natural partners and COVID-19 has only  proven our ties are growing stronger.   This resolution further shows that the House stands with the people  of India as they work to stem the spread of COVID-19 throughout India.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, I would like to, once again, thank Representative Sherman  and Representative Chabot for their work on this resolution.   It has been said before, but I will say it again, COVID-19 has shown  that pandemics know no borders. Allies must come together and support  one another during these difficult times. And we must work with India  and the international community to end the spread of COVID-19 and  prevent future pandemics.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this resolution, H. Res.  402, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2225, the NSF for the Future Act, legislation that invests in our  country's future through targeted investments in research and  innovation at the university level, K-12 STEM education, and the  development and commercialization of new technologies.   I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 2225, which provides our country and  the National Science Foundation with the tools to preserve our  technological and economic supremacy in the face of the shifting  patterns of global competitiveness.   This bipartisan legislation would authorize $50 billion over 5 years  for American innovation and basic research. Additionally, the  legislation ensures taxpayer investments in innovation and research are  protected from theft and espionage by the Chinese Communist Party.   H.R. 2225 also contains important provisions to ensure our country is  developing a 21st century workforce by investing in STEM education at  all levels, from pre-K through 12th grades. I am proud to have worked  with my colleagues, Representative Gwen Moore, Ranking Member Lucas,  and Chairwoman Johnson, to include my legislation, H.R. 3859, the  Innovations in Informal STEM Learning Act.   H.R. 3859 sets up the pre-K through eighth grade informal STEM  program, which directs the NSF Director to award competitive, merit- reviewed grants that support student participation in competitions,  after-school activities, and field experiences related to  STEM education. Additionally, this legislation would bridge the  achievement gap for minority and rural students by prioritizing STEM  education in those communities.    As our Nation fights to stay ahead as the world leader in innovation,  science, and technology, we must rely on the strength of our Nation's  diversity. We cannot afford to compete in the 21st century economy and  against China with one hand tied behind our back.  [[Page H3205]]    I commend Ranking Member Lucas and Chairwoman Johnson's leadership  for reaching a bipartisan agreement on this legislation. I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 2225.
