 Madam Speaker, we are all in Congress because we see room  for improvement in America, especially for our servicemembers,  veterans, and our military families. As a 20-year Navy veteran myself,  I know it is not just the brave men and women who fight for America,  but also the families who support them every step of the way.   When Gold Star widows from Virginia Beach contacted me about how  their tax bills jumped thousands of dollars as a result of the 2000 tax  law, I knew I had to do something. That is why I took action to  introduce the bipartisan Gold Star Family Tax Relief Act, which fixes  the unintended tax hike that many Gold Star families experienced.   A number of families across our coastal Virginia district have shared  their stories about how this tax law changed their lives. One woman,  the widow of a Navy SEAL killed in Afghanistan, saw the taxes on her  son's benefits rise by $4,000 in 2018, another by $6,000, and another  by $2,500.   What this tax bill did to Gold Star families was wrong, but I have  been heartened to see so many of my colleagues join me in a bipartisan  effort to right these wrongs. As of today, we have 155 cosponsors and  received endorsements of 20 veterans service organizations.    Madam Speaker, with this momentum, we can fix a problem  for so many heroic families and ensure security for their benefits.   I include in the Record a letter signed by 20 veterans service  organizations in support of the Gold Star family tax provisions  included within the SECURE Act.                                                       May 22, 2019.      Hon. Elaine Luria,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Luria: As leaders of the major veterans,       military, and survivor organizations, we are pleased to offer       our support for H.R. 2481, the Gold Star Family Tax Relief       Act.        Surviving spouses of service members who die in the line of       duty and military retirees who die from service-connected       wounds, illnesses, or injuries are entitled to Dependency and       Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits from the Department of       Veterans Affairs. Survivors who paid into the Department of       Defense Survivor Benefits Plan (SBP) have a dollar-for-dollar       offset of their SBP benefits by the amount of DIC benefits.       To avoid the SBP/DIC offset, surviving spouses often sign       over SBP benefits to their children to ensure the family       receives both earned benefits.        Due to a recent change in tax law, known as the ``Kiddie       Tax,'' Gold Star families who were formerly obligated to pay       12 to 15 percent in taxes on their earned benefits are now       being taxed up to 37 percent, leaving them thousands of       dollars in tax debt. This important bill would rightfully       repeal the Kiddie Tax and reinstate military survivor       benefits to the previous tax rate.        Thank you again for your leadership on this issue. We look       forward to working with you and your staff to pass this       important legislation immediately.            Sincerely,        Robert Wallace, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United       States; Bonnie Carroll, Tragedy Assistance Program for       Survivors; Harriet Boyden, Gold Star Wives of America; Joseph       R. Chenelly, AMVETS; Louis Celli, The American Legion; Joyce       Wessel Raezer, National Military Famiy Association; Dana T.       Atkins, Military Officers Association of America; Carl Blake,       Paralyzed Veterans of America; Keith A.

Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for  the SECURE Act and, in doing that, fix this tax problem that has  impacted so many of our Gold Star families across the Commonwealth of  Virginia and the country.
