 Mr. Chairman, first, let me thank Chairman  Scott for yielding, but also for his tremendous leadership on behalf of  American workers.   I rise in strong support today of the PRO Act. This bill protects the  basic right to join a union by giving millions of workers protections  to organize, negotiate better pay, and a strong voice on the job.   Unions are vital to the health of our economy and our community. They  help reduce racial and economic inequality, boost pay, and increase  benefits for workers.   Unfortunately, antiworker attacks have seriously weakened our unions  and our middle class. Union membership is at an all-time low, and  workers are scared even to organize or join a union. That is so  shameful.   We must protect workers' rights to organize and improve the quality  of life for themselves and their families. That is why this bill is so  important. The PRO Act strengthens the power of  [[Page H890]]  all workers to join a union and hold wealthy corporations accountable.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters from labor groups  in support of this PRO Act. These letters are from the Department for  Professional Employees, Coalition of Labor Union Women, Equal Rights  Advocates, National Employment Law Project, National Partnership for  Women and Families, National Taskforce on Tradeswomen's Issues,  National Women's Law Center, and UltraViolet.                                        Department for Professional                                              Employees, AFL-CIO,                                   Washington, DC, February 4, 2020.      Re H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.         Dear Representative: On behalf of the 24 national unions in       the Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO (DPE), I       urge you to support H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to       Organize (PRO) Act, and to oppose any weakening amendments       and any Motion to Recommit when the House of Representatives       considers this bill. The PRO Act will ensure that       professionals can exercise their right to join together in       union and negotiate collectively with their employers by       restoring the original intent of the National Labor Relations       Act (NLRA).        DPE knows from our 2016 national survey of nonunion       professionals that a majority of professionals want to join       together in union. Unfortunately, in too many instances,       employers are able to violate the NLRA and deny professionals       their right to form a union with their colleagues.        The PRO Act will help ensure all professionals can achieve       their right to join together in union and negotiate       collectively with their employers to improve their lives and       their workplaces. The legislation modernizes the NLRA so that       it has remedies consistent with other workplace laws, ending       the perverse incentive that exists currently for employers to       break the law. Companies and individual corporate officers       will be subject to financial penalties if they violate the       NLRA, and professionals will have the ability to bring their       cases to federal court. Further, the PRO Act will provide for       fair union elections. The bill will also stop employers from       hiding behind a subcontractor or other intermediary, or       deliberately misclassifying professional employees as       supervisors or independent contractors to evade their       employer responsibilities.        Recognizing that professionals can only fully realize the       value of joining together in union when they have a written       contract, the PRO Act will also put a stop to employers using       tactics that prevent employees from achieving a union       contract. The legislation establishes a process for mediation       and arbitration to assist employers and their employees with       reaching agreement on a first contract. A written contract--      just like CEOs have--is how union professionals can guarantee       pay and benefits, ensure a voice in decisions affecting them       at work, and secure pathways to sustain their careers.        The PRO Act also recognizes that professionals must be able       to picket or withhold their labor in order to have the power       necessary to improve their workplaces. The legislation will       prevent employers from hiring permanent replacement workers       in instances when professionals decide they have no choice       but to go on strike. In addition, nonunion professionals will       be able to engage in collective action to enforce basic       workplace rights, instead of being required to pursue justice       on their own through employer-favored arbitration       proceedings.        Lastly, the PRO Act would eliminate state right to work       laws. Secretive special interest groups and their billionaire       funders push these laws in an effort to give corporations       more power at the expense of everyday professionals. We must       learn from the experience of the past seven decades, which       has shown that people in states with right to work laws have       lower wages and reduced access to quality health care and       retirement security.        The experience of the more than four million professional,       technical, and other highly skilled workers who make up DPE's       24 national unions demonstrates that working people do better       when they can negotiate collectively for better pay and       improved working conditions. That is why a majority of       nonunion professionals want to join together with their       colleagues and negotiate with their own employers. And it is       why I urge you to support the PRO Act when it comes before       you for a vote on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                  Jennifer Dorning,      President.                                   ____                                                   February 6, 2020.      Re Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act (H.R. 2474).         Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations write in       support of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act       (H.R. 2474) and in opposition to any amendment that would       deny the bill's protections to the approximately 9.2 million       working people in franchise employment in the United States.       The PRO Act is an important measure that will improve the       lives of millions of working people and their families by       streamlining the process for forming a union, ensuring that       new unions are able to negotiate a first collective       bargaining agreement, and holding employers accountable when       they violate workers' rights. These rights are especially       critical for women, who not only disproportionately benefit       from union representation, but who make up 6 out of 10 low-      paid workers in the United States toiling in jobs that are in       desperate need of union protections.        Of the 9.2 million people who work in franchise employment,       the largest share by far works in the restaurant and fast       food industry--approximately 5 million people. The       consequences of shielding these corporate franchisors from       taking responsibility for employees they jointly control       would be felt by some of the most vulnerable and lowest-paid       working people. Over half of employees in the U.S. fast food       industry are women, and around one-quarter are raising       children. The fast-food industry is notorious for workplace       abuse: according to one recent survey, for example, over 40       percent of women in the fast-food industry face sexual       harassment on the job, which can lead to negative physical       and mental health impacts, job insecurity, and major life       disruption. Carving franchise employment out of the       protections of the PRO Act would allow franchisors to       continue to shirk their responsibilities to these working       people. For collective bargaining to be most meaningful and       effective, every entity with control over workers' jobs must       be at the bargaining table.        For instance, the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, the ACLU,       Fight for $15 and others are supporting courageous McDonald's       workers who are speaking out about the sexual harassment they       face working at corporate and franchise-run stores. These       allegations include vile verbal abuse, groping, stalking, and       assault, including of teenagers, as well as swift retaliation       for workers who speak out about harassment. In its public       responses, McDonald's continues to distance itself from       responsibility for the sexual harassment in its franchise-run       stores. When announcing new policies to respond to sexual       harassment, McDonald's has carefully noted that the new plans       apply only to corporate-owned stores; franchise-run stores       were encouraged, but not required, to have similar policies.       At the same time, McDonald's sets policies for its franchise-      run stores that determine so many details of the work--down       to the kind of pickles on a hamburger--precisely so that any       difference between corporate and franchise stores is       undetectable. In fact, McDonald's corporate identity is so       intertwined with franchise operations that many workers do       not even realize they are working in a franchise-run store--      just as customers do not notice any difference, either.       McDonald's wants it both ways: to closely control the product       and reap the benefits of its brand in franchise-run stores       but not to have any of the liability when workers whose day-      to-day work is dictated by this corporate control are       harassed.        The McDonald's workers who have come forward to make their       industry better for millions of other women deserve the       chance to improve their lives using the tools that the PRO       Act provides, and so do all working people employed at       franchise establishments. Unions can help create a safe and       healthy workplace for all working people. Working people with       a union may be better able to raise harassment concerns       because collective bargaining agreements can provide       increased protection from firing and retaliation than are       available to most non-union workers--and if harassment or       retaliation does occur, individuals may have more mechanisms       to challenge unjust employer actions.        The PRO Act is critical for women and their families       because collective bargaining increases women's equality at       work. Women in unions are more likely than their non-union       counterparts to receive higher and more equal pay, better       health care and pension benefits, and greater protections       against discrimination on the job.        We urge you to support the PRO Act and reject attempts to       weaken this bill by changing the joint employer standard to       leave behind millions of franchise workers.            Sincerely,        Coalition of Labor Union Women, Equal Rights Advocates,       National Employment Law Project, National Partnership for       Women & Families, National Taskforce on Tradeswomen Issues,       National Women's Law Center, UltraViolet.     Mr. Chairman, I ask for a ``yes'' vote for our  workers and a ``yes'' vote for this bill.    Mr. Speaker, we lost a devoted public servant  with the recent passing of our dear friend, Representative Pete Stark.   As a student at Mills College during the early 1970s, I was president  of the Black Student Union, and Pete helped me with many of my  organizing efforts. He was also the very first Member of Congress I  voted for.   Pete served for 40 years as a passionate and courageous public  servant who made it his goal to advocate for those most in need.   Through working alongside him in Congress, I came to admire his  willingness to speak out for what he believed to be right, even when it  meant challenging those in power.   Pete made a difference in the lives of millions of people across the  country. His substantial and lasting influence on health policy  reflected his deeply held values of compassionate legislating and  courageous advocacy.   Pete believed it was his role to fight for the people's interests,  not for special interests. He saw his role as one of advocacy for the  underserved people of his district and throughout the country.   Pete never failed to speak up when it came time to champion a more  compassionate approach to governance. He truly spoke truth to power.   My thoughts and prayers are with Pete's wife, Deborah, his children,  his family, and his loved ones.   May we carry his baton forward in our work for a more just world, a  more compassionate world, and may he rest in peace.                            ____________________
