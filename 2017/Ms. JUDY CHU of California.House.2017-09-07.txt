 Mr. Speaker, Ana was an intern in my  office. She is also an undocumented immigrant. When DACA was announced,  Ana was ecstatic. She told me that DACA meant she could qualify for  financial aid or be an intern at the State Department. All she saw were  opportunities to contribute to our country, and that is exactly what  she has done.   Thanks to DACA, Ana earned her master's degree and got a job helping  other immigrants to lay roots and contribute, like she did. She was  able to get a driver's license to safely get to school and work. And  today, she is attending law school.   Ana represents the promise that if you come here, work here, and  contribute here, you will have a future here. But Donald Trump is  breaking that promise by ending DACA.   And so it is up to us to fix it. The bipartisan Dream Act will  protect these DREAMers who are American in every way but on paper.   Mr. Speaker, let us vote to restore our values and give these  DREAMers the opportunities they deserve.                            ____________________
