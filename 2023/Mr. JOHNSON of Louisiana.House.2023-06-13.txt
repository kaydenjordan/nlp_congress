 Madam Speaker, this week, Congress is going  to take up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation that  this body has considered in years.   Despite the lack of fanfare from the national media, the REINS Act is  a very important piece of legislation and has the potential to overhaul  the Federal bureaucracy, overhaul what many of us and many of my  constituents back in Louisiana refer to as part of the deep state. It  also has the potential to restore Congress' constitutional role as the  chief rulemaking body in America.   However, to understand the necessity of this bill, it is important  that we take a step back for just a moment and examine how Congress has  ceded our lawmaking authority to nameless, faceless bureaucrats that  aren't accountable to anyone: not to voters and really, largely, not  even to those of us in Congress.   Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution itself declares that: ``All  legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the  United States. . . . '' All. All legislative powers.   The Founders intended that governments derive their powers from the  consent of the governed, of course--a radical idea that suggests that  laws are unjust unless they come from the people. The way that is done  in our system, in our unmatched constitutional Republic, is that it  comes from the people through their duly elected Representatives in  Congress. This idea, of course, was espoused originally by principles  originated in the Nation's birth certificate, the Declaration of  Independence.   The Founders, having signaled their intent to break free from the  world's most powerful nation were fearful of the undue power and  influence of an absolute monarch, but of course, tyranny in any of its  forms is an evil.  [[Page H2816]]  Therefore, they created this system, this system that we have, with  separation of powers, checks and balances, one that provides elected  Representatives with the authority to make the laws, an executive to  implement them, and a judiciary to call the balls and strikes about  disputes over that.   However, through the decades of congressional disinterest in  lawmaking and an ever-growing Federal bureaucracy, the executive branch  has usurped Congress' role as the rulemaking authority in America.    It is important to note that this development has been somewhat of a  slow creep, and it is not a sinister plan to upend Congress' authority.  You can mostly blame the Congress itself for this having happened.   Here is what has occurred: For decades, Congress has really willfully  delegated its authority to Federal agencies, through passage of a  patchwork of spending bills and the ``vote now, read later'' mindset.  It also allows some of the duly elected Representatives of the people  to evade their responsibilities because they don't have to take tough  votes. If you can just make bureaucrats do it, it is a lot easier.   However, think of the results of this. Just consider this one  statistic: In 2021 alone, Congress here passed 143 laws, that is bills  that passed both Chambers and were signed into law by the President. In  that same year, by comparison, Federal agencies enacted 3,257 rules.  That is 23 times the number of laws actually duly passed by the  Congress.   Unfortunately, these rules often serve the interests of liberal and  progressive causes. That is the effect of it. They cater to the desires  of environmental groups, unions, LGBTQ activists, and those who want to  abolish the Second Amendment. We have example after example after  example.   Progressives have realized that congressional inaction has opened a  window to usher in this agenda outside of the legislative or electoral  framework. Their ideas aren't popular at the ballot box, so they  entrust Federal agencies to do all that bidding behind closed doors. It  is not American.   Frankly, my concerns with the growth of the administrative state are  viewpoint neutral. I don't somehow quietly hope for a similarly sized  Federal Government that serves conservative political interests. No, we  are intellectually consistent in this.   Reining in the administrative state is not about retribution. It is  about restoration; restoration of our founding principles, the things  that made our great Nation in the first place. That is why passing the  REINS Act is a critical first step in achieving these goals.   This bill would reassert the Article I legislative authority of  Congress and prevent excessive overreach by the executive branch in the  Federal rulemaking process. What it means is that every new major rule  proposed by Federal agencies would be subject to congressional scrutiny  before going into effect. We define ``major rule'' as any regulation  with an annual effect on the economy of over $100 million, any major  increase in cost or prices for consumers, or any significant adverse  impact on competition, employment, investment, or productivity of U.S.- based enterprises.   By quick way of example, if Congress would have passed this bill in  the last session, President Biden's student loan bailout, his ban on  oil and gas lease sales, his plan to allow retirement funds to consider  ESG, and even the mandated climate risk disclosures would all have been  subject to an up-or-down vote by the people's duly elected  Representatives in this body.   Instead, in President Biden's first year, he finalized 69 regulations  that carried over a $100 million price tag or significantly impacted  the economy. Those regulations add up to more than $200 billion-- billion with a b--in regulatory costs, and Congress wasn't even  consulted to approve one dime of it.   The REINS Act represents a long overdue first step in restoring  accountability and reducing government overreach. I am really grateful  that House Republicans have prioritized this bill this week. We will  pass it off this floor. We will send it to the Senate, and hopefully we  can rein in the bloated government that is controlling all of our  lives.                            ____________________
