 Madam Speaker, according to the national  environmental officials, for the first time this year, toxic algal  blooms have formed on the shores of Lake Erie.   This toxic accumulation of algae represents a direct threat to the  people of western New York, but they also threaten the surrounding  Great Lakes communities, representing 20 percent of the world's  freshwater drinking supply.   This past year, toxic blooms have been so extreme that they have  infiltrated clean drinking water sources, turning once clean waters  into toxic swamps. These hazardous blooms threaten the local economy,  which is dependent on fishing, recreation, and tourism. Furthermore,  they represent a critical danger to wildlife present on Lake Erie.   At a time when the House is considering defunding environmental  efforts, I would remind my colleagues of the tremendous progress that  we have made to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to clean up our  Nation's lakes and rivers. This is no time to turn back.                            ____________________
