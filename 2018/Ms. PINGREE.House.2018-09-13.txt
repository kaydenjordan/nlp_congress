 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Arts in Education  Week. I believe strongly that arts in our schools, whether it is visual  art, music, drama, creative writing, or dance, are as much of a  component of a well-rounded education as STEM or humanity subjects.   The measurable benefits of a robust arts education are clear. The  U.S. Department of Education has found that students in arts  programming had better attendance and fewer disciplinary issues. But  anyone who has experienced arts education knows that its value goes  well beyond what's measurable. It builds confidence, teaching students  how to express themselves in front of their peers and the larger  community.   It promotes diversity and inclusion, encouraging kids to engage with  and learn from creative traditions that they may not be familiar with.  And it can start important conversations, using fun and accessible  mediums to get us thinking about hard topics.   I thank the educators and students in Maine and across the country  who commit to bringing the power of the arts into our schools and homes  every day.                            ____________________
