 Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago our country witnessed  the incredible marvel of American ingenuity when NASA successfully  landed its Perseverance rover on Mars, laying the groundwork for the  next generation of space travel and exploration.   Perseverance has four primary goals: determine whether life ever  existed on Mars, understand the climate of the planet, characterize the  geology of Mars, and finally, make any preparations necessary for human  exploration. These goals are crucial not only for our Nation's eventual  mission to send humans to Mars, but also for the continued advancement  of mankind as a whole.   Before making its journey to the red planet, Perseverance spent some  time in my backyard in northeast Ohio. It was researchers and  scientists at Cleveland's NASA Glenn Research Center that developed the  rover's power source and oversaw testing the rover's parachute needed  to land safely on Mars.   Mars truly is the next frontier in space travel and exploration. I am  incredibly grateful that northeast Ohio has added yet another chapter  to our State's already rich history in space travel and exploration.   I look forward to what Perseverance can teach us about this new  unknown and what our next endeavor will be.                            ____________________
