 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their marks and submit  extraneous material on this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to host this Special Order during  National Agriculture Month on the strength of American agriculture. I  am inspired by the American farmers, ranchers, and agricultural  producers who feed, fuel, and clothe not only this country but the  entire world.   I grew up on a farm south of Quinter, Kansas, that my parents and  brother still operate. Growing up there meant that I spent thousands of  hours on a tractor working in fields and on horseback doctoring sick  cattle in the family feed yard. Those hours turned into love of country  and lessons about the values of hard work, creativity, flexibility, and  putting others before ourselves.   My district, the Big First of Kansas, is home to more than 60,000  farms where farmers, ranchers, feedlot managers, ethanol producers, ag  lenders, and agribusiness owners ensure that America remains the most  food-secure country in the world.   As Congress becomes increasingly urban, the distance from farm to  fork has never been greater, and since America's national security  depends in large part on our food security, we need strong voices for  agriculture in this Congress, which is why I am honored to serve on the  House Agriculture Committee and to host this Special Order tonight.   If Congress is going to legislate effectively on matters relating to  agriculture, Congress must first understand the agricultural  perspective in America. There is something about being in the middle of  the country where farmers pray for rain, parents drive 30 miles both  ways just to take their kids to school, and communities shrink and grow  with oil and gas prices that gives you a greater perspective.   House Agriculture Committee Republican leader GT Thompson and I just  returned from a trip to my district. While there, we saw an American  heartland infused with both the innovative energy that creates new  ideas and the love of tradition that respects tried-and-true methods.  We saw the USDA National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility that will take  American agriculture into the future, and we met with the family who  owns and operates Brookover Feed Yards, one of the first feedlots in  Kansas. We also saw oil production, ag lending, ethanol production,  wheat innovation, and the next generation of leaders in food and  agriculture at Kansas State University.   I look forward to celebrating the culmination of National Agriculture  Month with my colleagues here tonight as we celebrate the force,  passion, and strength of American agriculture.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson), a descendant of dairy farmers, a champion of rural  development, my friend who joined me just last week on an agriculture  tour of my district in Kansas, and the Republican leader of the House  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for being here tonight  and sharing with us thoughts about Pennsylvania agriculture. It is very  important to this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse),  who is a third-generation family farmer and good friend. I always  appreciate his perspectives of Washington State agriculture and what he  brings to this body.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman. His leadership in  agriculture, his leadership for the Western Caucus are very, very  important, and I thank him for joining us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller),  a staunch defender of farmers in his district and a fellow  Congressional FFA Caucus member.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  joining us tonight. And as you were reading that, I thought about my  family, my grandparents and many producers all over America that that  describes. Thank you very much for sharing that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Miller),  who runs a grain and livestock farm with her husband and who has raised  her children to be the 4th generation of farmers on her family farm in  Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for  joining us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao),  who represents our Nation's largest dairy district. He and his family  operate a dairy farm; lives at the dairy.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for joining us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ellzey), the  pride of Levelland, Texas, who farmed and ranched in the Texas  Panhandle before he came to Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for joining  us, and representing Texas in such a legacy of agriculture in a great  State.   Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone who spoke today for helping Congress  understand an agricultural perspective. As Dwight Eisenhower--who was  from my State, from my district--said, Farming looks mighty easy when  your plow is a pencil, and you are a thousand miles away from a  cornfield. Today, it felt like the Members who spoke on this floor  brought the farm a little closer to Capitol Hill, and for that, I thank  them.   Congress uses the reauthorization of the farm bill every 5 years to  determine the nature of our support for the men and women who feed,  fuel, and clothe the world. America's food security is so important  because it determines the strength of our national security. We will  never be a secure country if we have to rely on other countries to feed  ourselves.   Because of the tenacity of the American farmer, we are the most food  secure country in the world, and I will do everything in my power to  keep it that way.   As Congress determines how we will support farmers, ranchers, and  agricultural producers in the 2023 farm bill, I encourage Members to  imagine how different their lives would be without healthy American  agriculture. From the food on our tables to the fuel in our cars to the  fibers in our clothing to the roofs over our head, agriculture is all  around us, and we tend to take it for granted.   Well, it isn't granted. It is gifted. Every day American farmers,  ranchers, and agricultural producers give us the gift of our quality of  life in this country. Our comforts come from the sweat of their brows.  The least this Congress can do is support their efforts wholeheartedly  with a strong thoughtful 2023 farm bill and related legislation. The  future of America depends on it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
