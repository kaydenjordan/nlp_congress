 Mr. President, first, on the Republican healthcare bill,  my good friend the Republican leader says that there should be  amendments on the floor. On such an important matter, it would be  astounding if we didn't have committee hearings and committee votes on  such a bill. I know there is an attempt to rush it through, but if it  is such a fine product, it ought to withstand the scrutiny of hearings  and of markups in the various committees. To rush it through is an  indication that the sponsors of the bill, the supporters of the bill,  are not very proud of it, and that is a theme that has continued with  the executive branch and the Speaker of the House.   As we know, CBO estimated that it would cause 24 million fewer  Americans to have health insurance--I don't hear the Republican leader  mention that, of course--while raising premiums in the short term and  jacking up the price of healthcare for older Americans.   We have heard from the other side of the aisle that access is what is  important. No, it isn't. Access doesn't get you healthcare. I have  access to walk into a Lamborghini dealer and look at a Lamborghini, but  I can't afford one. That is true of average Americans, and that is true  of healthcare as well. Access doesn't get you healthcare, and it is a  far cry from what people need.   Because the bill helps so many fewer Americans, because the bill  seems to be a tax break for the wealthy above all, it is having its  trouble, and nobody seems to really want to embrace it. That is why  Republicans on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue don't want their name  near any end of the bill.   As I said yesterday, Speaker Ryan doesn't want to call it RyanCare,  even though he wrote the bill. President Trump doesn't want to call it  TrumpCare. If it is so good, why doesn't any Republican want to put  their name on it? It is Abbott and Costello: You put your name on it;  no, you put your name on it. That is not an indication that people are  proud of this legislation, and it is particularly ironic with President  Trump. President Trump slaps his name on buildings, ties, steaks,  hotels, and golf clubs, but not on a bill that he supports in his daily  tweets. He has spent 30 years of his business career trying to put his  name on nearly everything, but not this healthcare bill, even though he  is inviting wary Republicans to the White House to try and sell them on  it.   Today his Vice President is here on the Hill lobbying recalcitrant  Republicans. He has dispatched HHS Secretary Price, the person he  picked, to lobby for the bill. His own Press Secretary says the White  House is in full sale mode. Make no mistake about it, this is the  President's bill, and he should be straight with the American people  about it. We call it TrumpCare. That is what it is.                            ____________________     Mr. President, next week the Senate Judiciary Committee  will begin its hearing on President Trump's nominee to the Supreme  Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. As I have said before, we in the Senate have  a special responsibility to judge whether this nominee, Judge Gorsuch,  will tip the scales on the Court in favor of Big Business and powerful  special interests over average Americans. The Court has steadily been  moving in that direction under Justice Roberts.   My colleague Sheldon Whitehouse and the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee, Senator Feinstein, have documented in 5-to-4 cases  that the Court, over the last decade, has almost always tilted in favor  of the powerful and against those who are average Americans. In fact,  the Court under Justice Roberts has been judged the most pro-corporate  Court since World War II. So this country can ill afford another  Justice who will side with the powerful.   Judge Gorsuch may act like a studied, neutral judge, but his record  suggests he actually has a rightwing, pro-corporate, special interest  agenda. In today's New York Times, this morning we learned that Judge  Gorsuch's career  [[Page S1811]]  has been nurtured by a far-right billionaire and corporate titan,  Philip Anschutz, who has gone out of his way to fund hard-right  judicial causes, including the Federalist Society and the Heritage  Foundation. President Trump outsourced his choice of a Supreme Court  nominee to these organizations, and they recommended Judge Gorsuch.   Neil Gorsuch represented Mr. Anschutz's firm as a young lawyer. He  has earned his favor and patronage ever since. It was Anschutz's top  lawyer, someone who represented Anschutz here on the Hill, who lobbied  for Gorsuch to get the spot on the Federal appeals court. Judge Gorsuch  has been partners in an LLC with two of Anschutz's top advisers,  building a vacation home together. Of course, there is no problem with  that. Anyone can be partners. But it goes to show the longstanding  intertwined ties between one of the leading advocates for a hard-right  pro-corporate agenda, Mr. Anschutz, and Judge Gorsuch. The long history  of ties between Judge Gorsuch and Mr. Anschutz suggests a judge whose  fundamental economic and judicial philosophy is favorable to the  wealthy and the powerful and the far right.   Judge Gorsuch may sometimes express sympathy for the less powerful  verbally, but when it comes time to rule, when the chips are down, he  has far too often sided with the powerful few over everyday Americans  trying get a fair shake. He has repeatedly sided with insurance  companies that want to deny disability benefits to employees. In  employment discrimination cases, Bloomberg found he sided with  employers 66 percent of the time. In one of the few cases where he  sided with an employee, it was a Republican woman who alleged she was  fired for being a conservative.   On money in politics, the scourge, the poison of our political  system--undisclosed dark money--Judge Gorsuch seems to be in the same  company as Justices Thomas and Scalia, willing to restrict the most  commonsense contribution limits.   Judge Gorsuch's record demonstrates he prefers CEOs over citizens,  executives over employees, corporations over consumers.   Later this morning, I will be meeting with people who have personally  experienced the real-life implications of Judge Gorsuch's decisions:  Alphonso Maddin from Michigan, a truckdriver who was fired because he  left his vehicle when freezing; Patricia Caplinger from Missouri, who  sued Medtronic after being injured by a medical device implanted in a  non-FDA-approved manner; David Hwang and Katherine Hwang, whose late  mother, Proffer Grace Hwang, sued Kansas State University after being  fired following a 6-month leave for cancer and requesting to work at  home because of a flu epidemic. Their stories illuminate the real-world  effects of a judge who sides with Anschutz-like interests over everyday  Americans like Mr. Maddin, Ms. Caplinger, and the Hwang family.   My colleague, my friend, the Republican leader, said there is no  principled reason to be opposed to Judge Gorsuch. Yes, if your  principles say the law should be used time and time again to support  powerful corporate interests over average Americans, maybe there is no  principled objection. But for most Americans, the overwhelming majority  of whom want the Court to bring justice to the people who have less  power--and the Court is their last resort--there are plenty of  principled reasons to vote against Judge Gorsuch.   Because of starkly unequal concentrations of wealth and ever- increasing corporate power, aided and abetted by decisions like  Citizens United, because they have skewed the playing field even more  decisively to special interests and away from the individual citizen,  we need a nominee who would reverse that trend, not exacerbate it.   Donald Trump campaigned on helping average people. His nominee sides  with corporate interests against average people like Mr. Maddin, Ms.  Caplinger, and the Hwang family over and over again. From all  indications, Judge Gorsuch is not the kind of nominee who has sympathy  and helps average Americans when it comes to judging and the law.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, since coming to office, the President's  National Security Council has experienced more turmoil than any in  history at this stage in a Presidency. The President's first National  Security Advisor and head of the NSC, Michael Flynn, was fired after  only a month in his position. The Council itself has been reshaped in  ways that concern all of us. Permanent postings for the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of the National Intelligence  Agency have been removed and a permanent seat has been installed for  White House Political Adviser Steve Bannon.   This organization is a disturbing and profound departure from past  administrations. On the most sensitive matters of national security,  the President should be relying on the informed counsel of members of  the intelligence and military communities, not political advisers who  made their careers running a White nationalist website.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the President's primary  military adviser and, along with that of the Director of National  Intelligence, is the only independent, apolitical voice on the NSC.  President Trump's move to strip them of their seats is baffling and  potentially endangers our national security. The President has  installed in their stead one of the most strident, ideological voices  in his orbit.   On the most sensitive issues of national security, we have to have  fact-based decisions. The President has to get the most dispassionate  and accurate advice. With all due respect, that is not Mr. Bannon's  forte. His installation on the principals list of the NSC moves it  further away from what it needs to be and closer toward a shadow  council of a dangerously ideological West Wing.   The bottom line is, this decision was poorly thought out and ill- conceived. It puts a filter on the information going to the President  and will make us less safe. My concerns are shared by Members on both  sides of the aisle. I know that from conversations I have had with  some.   It has special relevance today because we are about to vote on  reappointing H.R. McMaster to lieutenant general, who will be the next  head of the NSC. General McMaster, by all accounts, will have a  grounding presence in the national security apparatus of the White  House. I have met him. I have a great deal of respect for both his  integrity and his abilities, but I remain deeply concerned that General  McMaster's judgment may not be followed and instead the fevered dreams  of Mr. Bannon will influence the most sensitive national security  discussions and decisions. It has been reported he doesn't want to see  NATO exist or the European Union. Those are political decisions in a  body charged with giving the President advice on security.   So this should concern all of us, especially Lieutenant General  McMaster.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
