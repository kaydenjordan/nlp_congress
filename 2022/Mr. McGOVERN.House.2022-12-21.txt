 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, if you go out behind almost any restaurant, hotel,  grocery store, catering company, or even at some farms in America, you  will find a dirty little secret that is as offensive as it is solvable;  food waste.   This bill, the Food Donation Improvement Act, has a simple goal: Make  it easier for people with extra food to donate it to people in need.   It has been a long and winding road to get here today. This was  supposed to be a part of the omnibus bill. We have very broad  bipartisan support from Democratic and Republican leaders on both sides  of the Capitol. All four corners on the committees of jurisdiction,  Senators Boozman and Stabenow, and our colleagues, Representatives  Virginia Foxx and  Bobby Scott signed off on this.   Due to a clerical error, the text of the bill was left out, so we are  trying to pass this as a freestanding bill. All we are doing here is  making sure this truly bipartisan bill moves forward and gets to the  President's desk.   Hunger is not inevitable. We live in a land of abundance. There is  plenty of food for everyone; so much so, in fact, that close to 40  percent of food that is perfectly good gets wasted in America. We don't  have a shortage of food, we have a mismatch between abundance and need,  a mismatch we can solve by passing this commonsense, bipartisan bill.   This bill is so bipartisan because it is very clear that ambiguous,  outdated laws are preventing people who have extra food from donating  it to people who need extra food. All we are doing here is expanding  protections to increase the quantity and efficiency of food donation  efforts.   Madam Speaker, after decades of work, we are moving in the right  direction on hunger. The Biden administration has released a National  Strategy  [[Page H9959]]  on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, identifying the need to reduce  barriers to food recovery as part of their whole-of-government  response. The Food Donation Improvement Act is an important step toward  making that goal a reality.   Again, I thank Leader Schumer, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Boozman,  Chairwoman Stabenow, Speaker Pelosi, Chairman  Bobby Scott, and my good  friend, Ranking Member Virginia Foxx.   I also thank Representatives Dan Newhouse, Chellie Pingree, and the  late Jackie Walorski, for their support of this effort.   I specifically recognize Alex Urry, Dick Meltzer, and Keith Stern, in  the Speaker's Office; Carrie Hughes and Andre Lindsay of the Education  and Labor Committee; and Caitlin Hodgkins and Jenn Chandler on my own  team.   I thank all the anti-hunger and environmental advocacy organizations,  industry leaders, retailers, and food companies who fought so hard to  pass this bill.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan bill that  will prevent food from going to waste and get us closer to the goal of  ending hunger in America once and for all.     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1529 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1529         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 9640) to       amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for       examination and disclosure with respect to Presidential       income tax returns. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived.

Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (S. 1942) to       standardize the designation of National Heritage Areas, and       for other purposes.

(c) Upon the offering of a motion pursuant to subsection       (a) concerning multiple measures, the ordering of the yeas       and nays on postponed motions to suspend the rules with       respect to such measures is vacated to the end that all such       motions are considered as withdrawn.        Sec. 6.

Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House  Resolution 1529, providing for consideration of H.R. 9640 under a  closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Ways and Means and one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of S. 1942 under a closed  rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural  Resources and one motion to recommit.   The rule deems as passed House Resolution 693 and House Resolution  1434. It also provides the majority leader or his designee the ability  to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension bills considered on  December 21 through December 23.   Finally, the rule provides standard recess instructions starting  December 23 through the remainder of the 117th Congress.   Madam Speaker, it is a simple idea with profound implications, that  no person in this country, regardless of the position you hold or the  power you wield, is above the law, even perhaps especially the  President of the United States.   Today, we are considering H.R. 9640, the Presidential Tax Filings and  Audit Transparency Act of 2022 to ensure that the great power of the  Presidency is subject to proper oversight and public scrutiny.   Frankly, we are codifying into law something that I and many other  Americans thought was already happening, mandatory tax audits for the  most powerful person in the country, followed by public disclosure of  those taxes in the interest of transparency and public scrutiny.   Look, this is not about Donald Trump. In fact, the only person right  now who would be audited here is Joe Biden. This is about the simple  idea that with great power comes the need for oversight and  transparency.   The bill we are considering today, H.R. 9640, codifies this mandatory  audit program to give the American people faith that the President has  to follow the same rules as everyone else.   We are also considering S. 1942, the National Heritage Area Act.  America's 55 national heritage areas are some of the greatest cultural,  historical, natural treasures of the United States.   In Massachusetts, we are lucky to have two, the John H. Chafee  Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, which tells the  epic story of the birth of the industrial revolution in America and the  Last Green Valley National Heritage Corridor, which preserves natural  wonders and expansive forests and farmland within the Northeast  corridor.   The House version of this bill has overwhelming bipartisan support. I  am pleased to say that last night the Senate cleared their version for  our consideration. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) and  the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) for their leadership on  this issue and for their work to make sure the Congress doesn't lose  sight of this bill before the end of the session.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no requests for time, I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, as I said previously, S. 1942, the National Heritage  Area Act should have been able to pass under suspension. It passed  under a UC in the Senate. It is a straightforward bill. But the bottom  line is that noncontroversial, bipartisan, bicameral bills that are  brought under suspension oftentimes get defeated because my friends on  the other side engage in some sort of a tantrum.   We have just witnessed on the floor a series of suspensions that will  get overwhelming support when members of their Freedom Caucus are  demanding votes where bills will pass unanimously or maybe two  contrarians on their side will vote ``no.'' A total waste of time.   So, yes, we are bringing this National Heritage Area Act to the floor  under a rule because it is important, and we want to get it passed.  That is why we are utilizing this process.   On H.R. 9460, the Presidential Tax Filing and Audit Transparency Act,  this is about codifying something that, frankly, we all thought was  happening already: the mandatory audit of Presidential taxes.   The President of the United States is the leader of the free world,  the most powerful person on this planet. The people of this country  deserve to know what is in his or her taxes. If you don't want people  to know what is in your taxes, it is simple: Don't run for President.   This isn't about party politics. It isn't about Democrats versus  Republicans, and it isn't about Donald Trump. In fact, the only person  who would be audited as a result of this bill would be Joe Biden,  unless of course, my colleagues plan to use their new majority to once  again try to overturn the 2020 election and reinstate Donald Trump.   This is about upholding the simple idea that no person is above the  law and that the American people have a right to know whether or not  their leaders are telling the truth on their taxes.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this rule and on the  underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
