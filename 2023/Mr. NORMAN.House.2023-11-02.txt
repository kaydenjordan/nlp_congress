 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I have been sitting here for about an hour  listening to the debate back and forth on amendments. The amendments  the Republicans are putting up are wanting to put some fiscal sanity  back in this House. My good friends on the left are wanting to spend  more money. The priorities and the cancer in this country is the  bankruptcy of America. The amendments I have will offer to cut programs  that need to be cut.   Amendment 108 prohibits funding for the American Climate Corps. My  amendment would prohibit funding for the American Climate Corps that  the Biden administration recently established through executive order.  This costs, by the way, $30 billion. The Biden administration describes  the American Climate Corps as a workforce training and service  initiative for careers in clean energy and climate reliance economy. As  part of the administration's Justice40 goal, the Corps will focus on  equity and environmental justice. The American Climate Corps will cost,  as I mentioned, $30 billion.   Instead of funding Democrats' woke climate agenda, why don't we focus  on  [[Page H5337]]  a pro-growth agenda that spurs the economy and prioritizes American  energy independence?   Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I met a lot of the young people in the Corps.  They are good people. They build bridges. They build roads in our  national forests. Now, to task them with stopping storms and stopping  hurricanes, that is preposterous. They do active work. To say they can  effect that is just, it is laughable if it wasn't so serious.   Democrats want to focus on social movements and further entrench  environmental justice in the bureaucracy. These priorities are  misguided and harmful. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and  ensure that we don't waste more valuable taxpayer dollars and resources  to fund the Biden administration's radical climate agenda.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this is another spend-a-thon by my friends  from the left. My amendment would prohibit funding for the rule titled,  ``Control of Air Pollution from New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine  and Vehicle Standards.''   My good friend, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Miller) and her  family are big time farmers in Illinois, and anybody that farms the  land--let me tell you what this is going to affect. As far as the  actual vehicles, it affects all models in model year 2027.   EPA last tightened the NOX emissions standards for heavy- duty vehicles in 2001. The new standards are 80 percent more stringent  than the current rules. The examples of heavy-duty trucks, it is going  to affect every farm in this country. It applies to engines used and a  broad spectrum of heavy-duty vehicles, including trucks from class 2b.  That is the Ford F-250 through the class 8. These are semitrucks. It  affects mobile homes. It affects schoolbuses. It affects pickup trucks  and vans. The cost is from $2,568 per vehicle up to $8,304 for new  equipment on semitrucks.   The American Truck Dealers estimates it is more likely a $42,000  increase. That is per truck. Talk about putting people out of business.  Talk about attacking farmers and everyday Americans. This overreach of  government could reach over $55 billion in the lifetime of the program.   I urge my colleagues on the left to reconsider this vast overreach of  government.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2110     Mr. Chair, the compliance cost is unbelievably high.  Owners and operators of trucks will be forced to leave the market or  keep less safe trucks on the road.   According to the Truckload Carriers Association, the rule outpaces  available technology and would worsen the already tight equipment  market.   I hope everyone that is tuning in tonight listens to what this  amendment will do to every American in this country, regardless if you  are a farmer. If you just own a pickup truck, this is what we are  talking about.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would prohibit funding for  policies that advance the Biden administration's radical diversity,  equity, and inclusion agenda.   Specifically, my amendment would prohibit the use of funds for the  Department of the Interior's Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Civil  Rights. This office's goal is to promote equity and justice for all  Americans. What does that mean? I think what they mean is they want  equal outcomes instead of equal opportunity. What this does is further  entrenches environmental justice in the bureaucracy in and of itself.  [[Page H5338]]    From the military to corporations to Federal agencies, we have seen  time and time again that the DEI mission fosters tribalism in the  workplace, undermines our shared American identity, and distracts from  the missions of our Federal agencies.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I close out by saying the cancer in this  country is the $33 trillion in debt. Companies have to expend funds for  this, which the interest alone is over $20,000 per second. Woke  programs have got to be dealt with. The only way you deal with them is  cut their funding.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would prohibit funding for the  Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases. This  is another bureaucratic nightmare that businesses are having to put up  with.   This amendment would prohibit funds from being used by the  Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases. This  group was originally convened by the Obama administration before being  disbanded by the Trump administration and reimposed through Biden's  radical climate Executive Order No. 13990. Democrats use the social  cost of greenhouse gas metrics to justify sweeping climate policies and  strict regulations that are vague and have no ending to the cost.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I close by saying that by boosting the climate  cost of projects, regulators can use the social cost of carbon to  derail everything from energy to infrastructure projects. Agencies can  also use a higher value to justify new regulations on everything from  power plants to appliances in the home. This administration has  attacked every appliance known to man, including the gas stove.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, what my amendment does is it reduces the  salary of Tracy Stone-Manning, director of the Bureau of Land  Management, to $1.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Rosendale), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, I will add that you are not firing anybody.  You are just reducing their salary to what, in the minds of this body,  they believe that it is worth. A dollar is plenty of money for what  this lady does. By the way, she makes $148,500.   In the words of Bob Abbey, who was the first BLM Director under  President Obama, he said that Stone-Manning's involvement with tree  spiking should disqualify her from leading the agency.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for my amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment will reduce the salary of  Michael Regan, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to  the large sum of $1.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Mrs. Miller), my good farmer friend.    Mr. Chair, I just take issue, a dollar is--we are  providing a person an opportunity to volunteer, which is a tremendous  opportunity. Mr. Chairman, if you want to be serious about combating  emissions and supporting good environmental policies, why don't we  start with getting countries like India and Communist China to reduce  their pollution? Nobody says anything about that from the left.   This administration is only interested in creating unfair, costly,  and burdensome regulations that will kill American jobs. I am a  developer. The gentlewoman mentioned solar panels. We priced them.   Mr. Chairman, guess where most of the components of solar panels are  made?   China, which is not exactly a friend.   Mr. Regan's salary is a whopping $183,000. Like I said, we are  promoting volunteerism and doing good work for mankind.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would prohibit the funding for  EPA's Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Workgroup. This group  is, in their own words, committed to fostering an inclusive and  respectful culture and improving justice, equity, diversity, and  inclusion. It commits to training and educating members on the implicit  biases and historical environmental injustices.   Mr. Chair, you can look on their website to a page of resources with  hundreds of woke documents. I will read just a few for my colleagues:  The Whiteness of America, ``Remaking Manhood: The Battle Against  Dominance-Based Masculine Culture,'' and Greed's Not Good: 10 Movies  That Expertly Criticize Capitalism.   This is the one thing that has made America the greatest country in  the world.   Another one is 23 Movies for Those Days When the Patriarchy's Got You  Down. Another one is Inclusive Scientific Meetings. I don't know what  that is.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just urge my colleagues to accept my  amendment. If there were a salary I could cut, I would cut every bit of  it. Taxpayers don't deserve this type of supposed work encouraging  these types of things that are being done in this country.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment gives another member of the Biden  administration's paid employees a chance for volunteerism and doing  well for mankind.   It reduces the salary of Deb Haaland, who is the Secretary of the  Interior, to a dollar. She is currently making $221,400. She holds  extreme land and energy views, like support for the Green New Deal and  opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline.   We are being forced to buy from OPEC countries that hate America that  are funding Hamas now, and that is what this lady was for, doing away  with the Keystone XL pipeline.   She has used the power of the Department of the Interior to implement  her radical agenda at the expense of hardworking Americans.   Under her leadership she has shut down pipelines, delayed federally  mandated onshore and offshore leases, repealed commonsense regulations,  shuttered mining projects, and much more with no regard for how these  actions have and will continue to raise energy costs, eliminate  American jobs, and harm our national security and increase reliance on  foreign energy sources.   We should not spend another dollar of taxpayer money funding her  salary.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Montana (Mr. Rosendale), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Rosendale), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
