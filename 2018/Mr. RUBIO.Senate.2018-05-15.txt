 Mr. President, I want to begin by reading an excerpt of an  article that ran on October 8, 2012. It was in the New York Times. The  article opened with the following quote:         A House committee issued a blistering bipartisan report on       Monday that accused two of China's largest telecommunications       companies of being arms of the government that had stolen       intellectual property from American companies and could       potentially spy on Americans. The House Intelligence       Committee said that after a yearlong investigation it had       come to the conclusion that Chinese businesses, Huawei       Technologies and ZTE Inc., were a national threat because of       their attempts to extract sensitive information from American       companies and because of their loyalties to the Chinese       government.    The story continued by saying:         Allowing the Chinese companies to do business in the United       States . . . would give the Chinese government the ability to       easily intercept communications and could allow it to start       online attacks on critical infrastructure, like dams and       power grids.    This was from a bipartisan report in the year 2012, in the month of  October, by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on  Intelligence. Since then, over and over again, we have heard the  intelligence community in this country clearly define this threat. In  virtually every one of the open hearings that we had on the  Intelligence Committee, I or one of my colleagues have had an  opportunity to ask every member of the intelligence community--Director  of National Intelligence, Director of the CIA, Director of the FBI, the  Director of Counterintelligence, Mr. Evanina, or the nominee before us  today--and every time one of us would ask: Would you use a ZTE phone?  We are still waiting for one of them to say yes. Every single one of  them said no, which is why I was pleased a couple of weeks ago when the  Commerce Department brought sanctions against ZTE.   It was not a Congressional issue. Although it could be, it wasn't. It  was because, on top of the spying and everything else, ZTE had helped  Iran and North Korea evade international sanctions. So the penalty was,  American companies could no longer sell component pieces to ZTE, which  has led them to being on the brink of being out of business.   No one should feel sorry for ZTE. This is a company heavily  subsidized by the Chinese Government that protects them at home,  protects them in China, subsidizes them in China but exports them  abroad with the hopes that they can help them steal secrets, monitor,  and be an arm and tool of intelligence for them. No one should feel  sorry for them.   So I was surprised to see, a couple days ago--as the President  tweeted and then there have been articles about how perhaps maybe these  sanctions might be going away in exchange for a deal on agriculture. I  want to tell you, if that is what happens, the President has gotten  terrible advice, and it would be a terrible thing for him to do. I  think it would be deeply problematic for the national security of the  United States and ultimately for his hopes of rebalancing America's  relationship with China, geopolitically, economically, commercially,  and certainly on security.   The most important thing to understand is, China is carrying out a  plan. They put it out there. It is not a conspiracy. It is there for  the world to see: Made in China 2025. Made in China 2025 is a plan to  dominate the 10 most important technologies of the 21st century. You  may ask: Why is that a big deal? Countries would want to do that. They  have every right to aspire to that, and I agree. If they want to  dominate these 10 fields, they have every right to invest in research  and innovation. They have every right to do all of that.   The problem is, that is not how they intend to dominate these fields.  The way they intend to dominate the 10 top technologies of the 21st  century is to steal the intellectual property, basically the protected,  secret ideas our companies are innovating, that American researchers  are innovating--to steal that and use it for themselves.   Furthermore, they insist that all of their companies be allowed to  sell whatever they want to the United States without any restriction.  On the other hand, our companies are restricted--some prohibited--from  selling to China's 1.2 billion, 1.3 billion-person market, soon to be  the largest economy in the world.   So, in essence, they intend to dominate these 10 fields by cheating  their way into a position of dominance, and that alone is not just an  economic issue. This is a national security issue. If you dominate the  field of artificial intelligence, if you dominate the field of  telecommunications, if you dominate the field of aerospace technology,  [[Page S2674]]  you will dominate the field of national defense and national security,  and you will pose a threat to other countries that do not.    We are giving it to them. We are literally allowing them to steal it  from us, and they play our system against us. American companies go to  China to do business, and here is what they tell them: You can only do  business here if you partner up with a Chinese company. You have to  give them all the secrets to how you do business. By the way, time and  again, as soon as the Chinese company can do what the American company  can do, the American company gets kicked out. Suddenly, you have a  competitor all over the world that you helped build by giving it to  them for free.   Sadly, a lot of American companies play the game because all they  care about is being able to sell to China in the short term and have  profits, without any thought about the long term or national security  of the United States.   I imagine many of these are the same voices that are trekking down to  the White House to tell the President to do this deal on ZTE. The ZTE  thing is not just a commercial and trade issue--although it is and it  could be. It is much more than just that. It needs to be taken with the  seriousness it deserves. It is not just about telecommunications.   If you have a ZTE phone--and they are widespread in the United  States. These things are hitting up against our towers. They will not  just use that to pull American phone companies out of business; they  can use that to spy on American companies to steal the intellectual  property of the United States. It is exactly what they have done. It is  what the report said they do: spying on Americans and stealing  intellectual property from American companies. This trade dispute with  China is about a lot more than trade. It is about geopolitical balance.  It is about fairness.   This is our last chance to get it right. It is almost too late. I am  telling you, if we get this wrong--if we back down, when historians  write about this period of time in our history, they are going to say  the Americans literally gave it over to the Chinese; allowed them to  steal from them because they were more interested in short-term gain  and were willing to turn over the future.   We will live in a world where China dominates many of the top fields,  including many that are critical to our national security and the  defense of our interests and of our Nation.   I would argue to you that ZTE should not be allowed to sell anything  in the United States. I would argue to you that if a technology company  from another country is being used by that country not just to spy on  government secrets but to steal the intellectual property of our  businesses, they should be out of business in the United States. Some  people would say: Well, China is very powerful. They are going to come  back and use other means to punish us for this. Let me tell you  something. We have extraordinary leverage over their technology  industry. For example, one of the things ZTE can do is they can buy  from a company named Tsinghua Unigroup, which is a government-owned  company. They can buy components from them, but then we can cut them  off as well. In fact, every major telecom in China--Huawei, BBK, Yiomi,  Lenovo--every single one of these depends on component parts from the  United States.   Ultimately, what I would hope to arrive at is a balanced trade  situation, a balanced commercial arrangement, and a balanced  geopolitical situation between the United States and China, but right  now it is way out of balance, and when you allow imbalances to exist  and persist in international relations, it leads to conflict. It leads  to wars. It leads to showdowns. That is what imbalances lead to. An  imbalance leads to the country that becomes dominant to try to take  advantage of the countries that are not, unless you agree to surrender  to them.   This issue of China and ZTE is a terrible mistake. If the President  cuts a deal with ZTE that says: Pay a couple of hundred million dollars  in fines and you are back in business in exchange--and they violated  the law. This is a law enforcement function on top of everything else.  These sanctions against them are punishment for evading and breaking  sanctions. If you basically wave that off in exchange for a deal on  agriculture--these farmers didn't do anything wrong. These farmers are  not being punished for evading sanctions. They are victims of  retribution.   We have other angles. In fact, what we should be saying is: If you  don't lift the tariff on our farmers, we will do the same thing we did  to ZTE, to Huawei, BBK, Yiomi, Lenovo or any other company. That is  what we should be saying, instead of being tricked into this apparent  deal that someone is cooking up over there and giving the President  terrible advice--which, by the way, I know that is not where his  instincts are, but someone is getting to him. I don't know if it is  from Treasury or where it is, but someone is basically telling him now  is the time to cut a deal. It is the wrong time to cut a deal. This  would be a terrible deal.   Let me close by telling you this. This is not just about technology.  If you don't believe that China uses its leverage, the leverage of  economics, to reach into your life here in America--people will ask:  What does that have to do with me? What does it have to do with us?  Yes, it is a bad thing. We are worried about China in the long term.  What does that have to do with me here at home?   China has no problem using its long arm and its economic leverage to  interfere in the lives of Americans. I will tell you how.   About 2 weeks ago, two American airlines, United and American  Airlines, got a letter in the mail from the Chinese Government telling  them: We notice that your website says ``Taiwan.'' It doesn't say  ``Taiwan-China.'' Unless you change your website, we are going to  punish you. We may even take away your routes.   They haven't made a decision yet. We have reached out to both  companies. Let me clue everyone in right now. If they are anything like  the other American companies that have been threatened, they are going  to cave. They are going to cave, especially United, which has all of  these routes over there. This is an American company, headquartered in  the United States, that is going to have to change their website  because China has threatened them.   If you think that is not bad, I will tell you something crazy.  Yesterday, the Gap clothing store came out with a T-shirt. It had a map  of China, but it didn't have Taiwan on the T-shirt. China threatened  them. Within hours, the Gap put out a tweet: We are so sorry. We  apologize. We didn't mean to offend you. We respect your sovereignty.   This is over a T-shirt, for God's sake. This is the leverage they  have.   Do you know there are Hollywood movies that are written in a way to  avoid certain topics because, otherwise, they will not be allowed to  play the movie in China? Do you know there are actors--such as Richard  Gere--who are not allowed to be in certain movies or who can't get a  Hollywood blockbuster movie because they can't distribute it in China?  They will not let them. They can't have Richard Gere in movies in China  because he is pro-Tibet. This is crazy stuff.   Here is perhaps the most egregious one. Marriott, a great American  company, a hotel--everybody has stayed at one. Marriott had an  employee, a guy who lives in America; he is not even an executive--just  a good guy, a hard-working guy. He accidentally went online and  accidentally--it wasn't even on purpose--liked a tweet about Tibet, and  China went crazy. They threatened Marriott. Marriott didn't just  apologize; they fired him. This is an American. He didn't live in  China. He lives in the United States of America. He lost his job for  accidentally liking a tweet that China didn't like.   This happens over and over again, and it isn't noticed. This is how  they use economic leverage. This is how they get Panama to tell Taiwan:  We no longer recognize you diplomatically; we now recognize China. This  is how they got the Dominican Republic to do the same thing last week  or a couple of weeks ago, and they are not going to stop. I hear  Paraguay might be next. This has to stop.   We don't want to contain China. We welcome a prosperous China. We  want a global partner. Imagine the United States and China working  together against nuclear proliferation, against radical terrorism, and  against all the  [[Page S2675]]  threats in the world. But this is not leading to a partnership. This is  leading to a world in which China dominates every key industry, remakes  every institution, and America becomes a junior partner the way  Vladimir Putin and Russia already are to China, and that we cannot  accept. But that is where we are headed because administrations--both  Republican and Democrat--have taken this threat too lightly. They  thought that when China got rich, they would start playing by the  rules. Guess what. They not only have not played by the rules, but they  assume all the benefits of the rules and live by none of the  responsibilities.   This is our last chance. This administration has been given the  historic opportunity--the last chance--to get the balance of this  relationship right. One misstep could blow the whole thing apart and  doom generations of Americans to living in a world--not one with a  powerful China, one with a dominant China and a declining America.   That may sound like hyperbole, but if they win this battle on ZTE,  the world will notice, and the message it will send is that when push  comes to shove, this administration is no different from the others.  When they come under pressure, you can get to the right people with the  right friends in corporate America, and they will back down. Once that  happens, every country in the world will govern themselves accordingly.  They will not join us in confronting China's aggression and China's  unfairness because in the back of their minds, they will be saying to  themselves: When push comes to shove, America is going to back down the  way they did for ZTE.   The issue itself is problematic. We can't be selling phones in  America that they use to spy on us in our companies. But on a broader  scale, it sends a message that demoralizes this effort and I think has  dramatic consequences.   I encourage the President to think very seriously and very carefully.  He is in a very strong position right now. I urge him to think very  carefully about the next step and to listen to the people in his  administration who are talking to him about the ZTE issue for what it  is--a national security threat much bigger than just one company in the  telecom industry.   I yield the floor.
