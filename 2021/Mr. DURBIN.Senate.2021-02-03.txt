 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just returned from the memorial service  for Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. It was held in the Rotunda  of the U.S. Capitol, a place which is reserved on such occasions for  those who have brought special honor to the United States. It was  appropriate that Brian Sicknick receive that honor.   On January 6, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick reported for duty  and never returned home. A simple red wooden box contained his remains  at the service. Tributes were given to him, all deserved, because this  man gave his life to protect our Nation, to protect me.   It was protection from an enemy--not foreign enemy but, as we say in  our oath, a domestic enemy, American-born and -bred terrorists who  streamed into this Capitol building on January 6 at the instigation of  President Donald Trump. He had summoned them to Washington on that day  because the Constitution required that the Congress meet that day, that  we count the electoral votes and announce to America who would be the  next President officially. We knew the results State by State. They had  been verified over and over again, challenged and verified again.   But this was the formal ceremony which involved calling the States  and the vote counts in the House, and if there were objections,  considering them, the objections, in both the House and the Senate.  That was the process that President Donald Trump set out to disrupt, so  he called a rally of his loyal followers. They met on the Ellipse. He  fired up the crowd and sent them to the Capitol Building to stop the  count--as they said in their warped logic, ``stop the steal.''   They weren't permitted to enter the building, and so they broke it  down--the doors, the windows. We have seen the videos over and over.  They assaulted every law enforcement officer who stood in their way.  Brian Sicknick, of course, lost his life, but there were 140 other  police officers who were beaten and maimed and stabbed, who still  suffer from those injuries today. The same terrorist mob that took  Brian Sicknick's life stormed past everyone who stood in their path.  What a day in the history of the United States of America.   Their occupation of the Capitol included their occupation of this  Chamber. They marched into this Chamber, opening desks, taking  photographs of documents, posing for pictures at the President's chair.  They had a jolly time showing off to their friends that they could take  over the U.S. Senate.   Next week, we begin the impeachment trial. The House of  Representatives has accused this President of instigating an  insurrection. When you think of it, could there be anything more  serious than provoking a group for the violent overthrow of a  legitimate government process?   Some say we shouldn't do this impeachment. They argue any speech  given by the President to his mob was protected by the First Amendment.  Well, if the First Amendment was designed to protect activities to  overthrow our government, then it was a recipe for democracy that would  die of its own accord. I think we know better. The Founding Fathers  expressly included the impeachment clause in the Constitution for a  President who would be so bold as to challenge the very existence of  our democracy and the peaceful transition of power.   After the ceremony in the Rotunda, I went to the Rayburn Room in the  House and met with Officer Sicknick's family. We stood and talked for a  few minutes. In respect to them, I will not repeat our conversation,  but I am going to remember it, and I am going to remember them. And  although I didn't meet him personally, I will remember him next week  when this impeachment trial is underway.   For anyone who makes the argument that when it comes to January 6, it  is time for America to ``get over it,'' I am going to remember one  Capitol Police officer who gave his life to protect me and this  Capitol. I am also going to remember his family, the loss that they  have endured because of a political exercise based on a big lie  propagated by the former President of the United States.                                 Coronavirus    Mr. President, the headline in last Thursday's Chicago Sun-Times  captured the grim reality of tens of millions of Americans desperately  seeking a COVID vaccine. The headline read: ``Looking for a vaccine  appointment at your pharmacy? Get ready for `The Hunger Games.' '' For  those who don't know ``The Hunger Games,'' it is a fictional book  turned into a movie about a dystopian future where people are forced to  fight one another to the death just to survive.   The Chicago Sun-Times assigned two reporters to try to book COVID-19  vaccine appointments for relatives older than 65 in any one of the  major drugstore chains in the Chicago area. The results were  discouraging. The websites were hard to navigate, appointments were  scarce to nonexistent, and even when they searched for appointments in  pharmacies as far as 50 miles away, no luck.   Reporters spoke to people who had gone online at 2 in the morning in  the hopes of landing a coveted vaccination slot--no luck. They spoke to  a Chicago-area woman who had been trying for days to book a vaccination  appointment for her mother, who is 75 years old and battling cancer.  That woman knew too well what failing to receive a vaccination could  mean. Her mother-in-law is recovering from the virus. Her 85-year-old  father died from it 1 week shy of his first official vaccination. After  several frustrating days, she was finally able to book an appointment  for her mother to be vaccinated. She is relieved for her mother. She is  worried about others who are eligible but can't find a vaccination. She  said, ``It's not fair. It's absolutely ridiculous.'   Earlier this week, Illinois administered its one-millionth dose of  COVID vaccine--an important milestone--but in my State and nearly every  State, the process for distributing vaccines or getting shots in the  arm is still too limited, too slow, too confusing. Too many elderly and  other eligible Americans are still scrambling to receive the  vaccination.   Let me say in defense of the State I proudly represent. Under  Governor Pritzker, we have a pretty good record of vaccination rates.  He is doing his best. Unfortunately, the supply is limited and he needs  more, and he certainly has plenty of people anxious for it.   This isn't just a Chicago problem. It is a statewide problem. It is a  nationwide problem. It reflects that while the Trump administration  worked quickly to discover the vaccine, it failed to work with the  States in implementing a plan to vaccinate people.   When Joe Biden took office, there were more COVID-19 vaccines in  freezers than in the arms of Americans. That was 10 or 12 days ago. The  results of those earlier missteps are staggering. Today, the United  States, with 5 percent of the world's population, is home to more than  20 percent of the  [[Page S281]]  COVID infections and deaths. As of Monday, more than 26 million  Americans have been infected and nearly 440,000 Americans have died of  COVID-19. In my State of Illinois, we have seen 1.1 million infections  and more than 19,000 deaths.   Even as the Trump administration tried to conceal the truth and  squandered precious time in responding to this crisis, other Americans  were working heroically to protect their neighbors and friends. These  heroes included doctors and nurses on the frontline, orderlies who kept  hospitals and health centers clean and safe, even grocery store clerks,  truckdrivers, mail carriers, teachers, and many other essential  workers. They worked around the clock. They included brilliant  scientists and researchers who not only developed COVID vaccines but  watched for the variants that were emerging that may or may not be  protected.   Sadly, their dedication was not matched by the performance of the  previous administration. President Biden is trying to change that. He  is trying to dramatically increase the production of vaccine and also  the distribution. His plan sets some worthy goals: 100 million  Americans vaccinated in 100 days. Boy, I want him to be right. He even  said there may be more if we count to the end of the summer. We want to  get a pace and have a momentum to break the back of this pandemic once  and for all. He calls it the American Rescue Plan. It includes  necessary assistance for vaccinations first and foremost, and it  should, but then it speaks to the economic crisis that also devastates  this country.   His plan provides economic assistance for small businesses--many just  barely hanging on; extends unemployment relief for millions of  Americans who lost their jobs; and increases funding for food stamps,  SNAP benefits, so that 1 in 10 Americans who right now can't afford to  put food on the table have an alternative. The President's American  Rescue Plan includes funding to dramatically ramp up production of  COVID treatment. It includes funding to help schools and universities  reopen safely and stay open. It includes funding to help get teachers  vaccinated and key administrators.   The American Rescue Plan represents the best thinking of leading  economists and public health experts. We can debate it if we wish, but  we can't drag our feet. We can't waste a day. People are dying every  minute. In fact, every 30 seconds, another American dies from COVID-19.   As the virus circulates and replicates and we dither, variants  emerge, mutations emerge, and we wonder if our vaccine is ready for  them. Scientists warn that our current COVID vaccines are less  effective with new strains. We could rush through this double-shot  vaccination across America and perhaps reach our goal sooner rather  than later and find that some mutant or variant is a new challenge that  requires a booster shot.   I am not a scientist. I certainly don't have a medical degree. I am  not professing any expertise. But we do know that variations are  emerging, and shame on us if they don't spur us to action as quickly as  possible. We are in a life-and-death struggle, a race against the clock  to vaccinate Americans against the variants before they become  dominant.   The cost of the rescue plan that President Biden has proposed is $1.9  trillion--about the same as the CARES plan that the Senate passed a  year ago. We passed it with 96 votes a year ago. We passed some $900  billion more this last December. This $1.9 trillion is no small sum,  but do you know what would be even more expensive? Continuing down this  path of the pandemic, watching this deadly virus mutate and eat up  companies and jobs and hope and education for our kids. Doing nothing  is unacceptable. Doing too little is unacceptable.   Remember when you took your kids to the doctor with that earache or  sore throat or whatever it was? He said: I will tell you what I can do,  Dad. I am going to give you a prescription for your little child, and  it is for 5 days on the antibiotic. Now, I have to warn you ahead of  time that the child is going to start looking better and feeling better  in 2 days and, in 3 days, will want to run outside and play with the  other kids, and you are going to think, ``Fine, that is behind us,''  but don't do it. Give that antibiotic all 5 days because we know, in  many cases, if you stop giving the antibiotic, the illness returns.   A similar situation faces us with COVID-19. If we don't put enough  into the vaccination effort, if we don't put enough into strengthening  the economy, if we don't put enough into sustaining those unemployed  and underemployed--if we don't put enough into this--we will be back  again. It may not be $1.9 trillion then. It may be even more. So  shouldn't we take all of our medicine? Shouldn't we do it as most  doctors and, in this case, economists order to make certain that we  have a positive impact on the economy?   Now I want to say a word about the 10 Republican Senators who met  with the President of the United States the day before yesterday.   I thank the President for the meeting because he was sincere, and I  was told by those who attended that he was responsive to their  questions, and he was well prepared. When they went in and started  talking about the different programs and how much we should spend on  each one, one Republican Senator said: He had a sheet of paper in front  of him, with a few things written on it, and for 2 hours, we kept  active conversation. It was like another Member of the Senate speaking  to these 10 Republicans. That to me is gratifying. It is the reason I  supported this man to become our President. I knew he would be ready  for the job and anxious to try to bring America back together.   So the 10 Republicans who met with him have said they want to work on  a bipartisan basis. Well, I know them. I know each and every one of  them pretty well. I sat through those meetings with them before, when  we prepared the last COVID relief bill. They are sincere. They are well  prepared. They argue their cases. Even if I disagree with them, I  respect the way they argue.   I would say to them there are two things that are critically  important. First, respond quickly. We can't drag this out for weeks or  months. It is unacceptable. We have deadlines looming in the middle of  March when unemployment benefits are going to be cut off for many  Americans, and we certainly have a vaccination crisis we have to  address right now. Secondly, don't err on the side of stopping the  medicine before you are really protected and well. We need to put the  medicine into the economy. I am talking about the dollars--the money-- into the economy to get people back to work so that schools can reopen,  for goodness' sake. Anyone with a child or a grandchild knows this is  unsustainable for these kids to be out of the classroom. It is hurting  them, and it is holding them back in terms of their educations. It  needs to end and end quickly.   So, to my Republican friends, thank you for joining us, but stick  with us for a real solution to this. We can't delay. Every day we wait  is another day that this virus mutates and grows stronger. Every day we  delay, thousands of Americans die from this virus; businesses close;  workers lose jobs; families get more desperate. This is terrific  devastation we have lived through, but it can come out right in the end  if we stick together on a bipartisan basis as a nation.   We are going to soon deal with the budget resolution here on the  floor of the U.S. Senate and then move to reconciliation. I have tried  my best, though I have been a Member of the Senate for a number of  years, to understand reconciliation and, particularly, to understand  the famous Byrd rule. It is named after a man who was a Senator for  many years, from West Virginia, named Robert C. Byrd. He used to sit at  that desk.   When he came to the floor, there was such respect for him and his  knowledge of this institution that the standing order was people who  were speaking stopped. Senator Byrd is here. Defer your remarks until  he is finished. That was done over and over again. As a new Member of  the Senate, I thought: Who is this man? Well, I came to understand the  reputation which he ha garnered in the U.S. Senate and he, I suppose-- maybe others with him--was the author of the reconciliation process.  Originally, it may have been intended--I underline ``may''--for deficit  reduction. Now it is something different. Deficit reduction is not the  goal  [[Page S282]]  per se. Instead, there have to be measurable revenues and losses  involved in any proposal within reconciliation.    Holding to the Byrd rule is going to be a matter of interpretation by  the Senate Parliamentarian and a decision by the Senate as to whether  that interpretation will be respected. There could be items that are  objected to by the Parliamentarian and others that will be accepted. I  think it is too early to speculate on that, but it is one of the more  arcane elements of the Senate rule process; yet it has a massive  impact.   Years ago, when the Republicans were in similar positions as the  Democrats, they used reconciliation for tax cuts. Some who believed  that reconciliation dealt with deficit reduction could never understand  how a tax cut wouldn't add to the deficit. They argued the other way.  They prevailed. Reconciliation was used for a tax cut. Now we come up  with a proposal, the American Rescue Plan, which either, in part or in  whole, is going to be offered in reconciliation, and the question is  whether each category of that plan that is included in reconciliation  is eligible under the Senate rules.   I will say there is one fundamental difference which one of my  colleagues raised earlier. Instead of talking about tax cuts for the  wealthiest, we are proposing changes in the reconciliation for the  American Rescue package by President Biden which are really designed to  help working families and those who are struggling in our economy.   For instance, the tax changes that are proposed in the American  Rescue Plan, if they are included in reconciliation, will include  additional assistance to families with children. There will be  substantial tax relief and tax credits--refundable tax credits--to  those in poverty, raising children. We have economists who tell us  that, if the Biden proposal on these tax benefits for families with  children are enacted into law, we will cut child poverty in half in  America. Think about that--a dramatic change.   We hear so many conversations about the state of the economy, of  those who are being left behind, and whether or not income inequality  is going to be addressed. Starting with the children, I will say to  President Biden, is the right starting point. It would be wonderful if  we had bipartisan support for helping these kids. I can tell you this:  The money it costs for these tax cuts and credits is far less than the  expense that would be incurred by America as a nation if these kids  don't have an opportunity to grow up healthy, educated, and productive.  So I am watching carefully as this debate continues.   I yield the floor.
