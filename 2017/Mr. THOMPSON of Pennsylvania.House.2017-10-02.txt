 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2316) to amend the Mineral Leasing Act  and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to repeal provisions relating only to  the Allegheny National Forest.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 2316         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cooperative Management of       Mineral Rights Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  McEachin) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank leadership for allowing H.R. 2316 to come to the  floor.   The Allegheny National Forest, located in my district in northwestern  Pennsylvania, is located near the first commercial oil discovery in the  country. The Allegheny National Forest is Pennsylvania's only national  forest and, since its creation in 1923, has been home to numerous  recreational and commercial activities.   Oil and gas has been produced from privately owned subsurface  minerals within the forest for decades, and mineral owners worked  cooperatively with the Forest Service to safely produce oil and gas  within the national forest boundaries.   Mineral owners routinely provided 60-day notification of drilling  plans  [[Page H7641]]  prior to the commencement of operations, and the Forest Service then  issued a notice to proceed, or NTP. However, in 2006, the Forest  Service deemed issuance of an NTP to be a major Federal action that  triggered the application of the National Environmental Policy Act.   This designation requires a full environmental analysis of the  Allegheny National Forest, and environmental groups were quick to sue  the Forest Service to enforce the new rule. After settling with these  groups, the Forest Service issued a moratorium when issuing NTPs until  the full environmental analysis was completed. This moratorium had  immediate and severe impacts on the mineral rights owners, who were  unfairly denied access to their mineral property.   The oil and gas industry sued, claiming that the Forest Service did  not have the authority to preclude the development of privately owned  minerals, and in 2009 the U.S. District Court of Western Pennsylvania  agreed and lifted the moratorium in the Allegheny National Forest. The  lower court's decision was confirmed on appeal in 2013. This bill fully  repeals the invalidated language from the Mineral Leasing Act and the  Energy Policy Act of 1992 in accordance with these court decisions.   Throughout the litigation, the Forest Service claimed section 2508 of  the Energy Policy Act of 1992, codified in the Mineral Leasing Act,  provided them with the authority to restrict mineral development. It is  critical to strike this language. Had this regulation not been  challenged, over 11 million acres of split estate minerals throughout  the country would have been locked up, devastating mineral owners and  local and State economies.   A similar version of this bill passed the House during the 114th  Congress, demonstrating the support for protecting private property  rights in the Allegheny National Forest.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to implementing this crucial solution. I  urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2316 is nearly identical to a bill that passed the  House last year with overwhelming bipartisan support.   The intent of the bill, according to the sponsor, is to ensure that  owners of mineral rights in the Allegheny National Forest are allowed  to drill for their oil and gas within the boundaries of that national  forest.   In the Natural Resources Committee last Congress, the majority  accepted an amendment by Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee  Ranking Member Lowenthal that clarified the intent of the bill and  ensured that the Forest Service would still receive advance notice of  any oil and gas operations and that no other national forest would be  affected.   So this bill is a bipartisan compromise that protects the private  property rights while also protecting the rights of the Forest Service,  and I thank the sponsor for working so cooperatively on this.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2316, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional  speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2316.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1547) to provide for the unencumbering of  title to non-Federal land owned by the city of Tucson, Arizona, for  purposes of economic development by conveyance of the Federal  reversionary interest to the City.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1547         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1547 completes the transfer of the Bureau of Land  Management's reversionary interest in Udall Park, located in Tucson,  Arizona, nearly three decades after the city donated $4 million worth  of land to the Bureau of Land Management to complete their portion of  the exchange.   Twenty years after the exchange took place, the Bureau of Land  Management threatened to invoke its reversionary interest because the  city dared to hold a local farmers market in the park. The city of  Tucson has invested millions of dollars in this community park,  building swimming pools, recreation centers, and athletic fields, and  it deserves to have clear title to the land and complete jurisdiction  over the uses of the park.   The bill is bipartisan and has nearly unanimous support from the  Arizona congressional delegation. I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1547 transfers the reversionary interest associated  with Udall Park to the city of Tucson, Arizona.   The land was transferred to the city back in the 1980s under the  Recreation and Public Purposes Act, a program that authorizes the  conveyance of Federal land to local governments and nonprofits.   These conveyances include what is known as reversionary interest,  which stipulates that the land must permanently remain in use for a  public purpose or ownership reverts back to the United States.   Typically, if a recipient wants to convert the land to a nonpublic  purpose, they have to compensate the Federal Government. However, this  is not the typical situation.   In 1989, Tucson came to an agreement with the Bureau of Land  Management. In exchange for the title to Udall Park, the city gave the  Bureau of Land Management a 297-acre parcel known as the Freeman Road  property.  [[Page H7642]]    A letter from the BLM State Director at the time indicates that the  agency supported elimination of Udall Park's reversionary interest in  exchange for the Freeman Road property. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker,  Congress never followed through on that promise.   This bill honors the Federal Government's long forgotten commitment,  which is why we support it and encourage its swift adoption. The unique  circumstances of Udall Park justify transferring the reversionary  interest without further consideration or compensation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally).   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill,  H.R. 1547, the Udall Park Land Exchange Completion Act.   Udall Park is a cherished urban park in the heart of Tucson. The city  has invested millions of dollars in park facilities, including  construction of very large community recreation and senior centers, a  large swimming pool, a walking track, and multiple athletic fields and  picnic areas.   In 2011, the mayor and city council approved a master plan update  that calls for plans to invest even more money into the park by way of  additional athletic fields and expanded recreational programming.  However, unresolved disputes over this land have directly impeded the  city from taking advantage of opportunities to supplement park funding,  approve certain community events, or look to other commercial ventures  like local farmers markets on small portions of the park that would  benefit the city in general.   The Udall Park Land Exchange Completion Act resolves this historic  land exchange agreement between the city of Tucson and the Bureau of  Land Management at Udall Park.   In 1989, the city of Tucson and BLM entered into an agreement to  exchange 297 acres of land adjacent to Saguaro National Park for 173  acres of BLM-owned land in northeast Tucson, now known as Udall Park.  This agreement specifically outlined that the terms and conditions of  this land conveyance would include a legislative fix to remove any and  all encumbrances on Udall Park. Unfortunately, this legislation never  came to fruition due to staff changes in multiple agencies in the city,  and who knows what else, but as a result, the city has been prevented  from utilizing Udall Park to its fullest extent. Recently, the issue  came to a head over disputes on a small commercial lease located in  Udall Park.   Federal red tape should not stand in the way of communities like mine  developing local parks. It is common sense. Udall Park is a beautiful  place in our southern Arizona community to gather, but this  longstanding land dispute has prevented the city of Tucson from  improving the park and growing it to its full potential for too long.   When I am out and about in my district and people come to me with  challenges and issues like this, the first question I usually ask is:  Does this literally take an act of Congress to fix? Let me say that  again. Does this literally take an act of Congress to fix? In this  case, the answer is yes.   I appreciate, as we testified before the House Natural Resources  Federal Land Subcommittee, the ranking member, Ms. Hanabusa, was  saying, no kidding, in July: ``If it takes an act of Congress to get  this done . . . then that's what we've got to do.''    I am with the ranking member at this point. It is time to finally  take action and get this thing finished. My legislation would formally  and finally complete a long overdue agreement on land that has already  been exchanged at fair market value. The act directs conveyance of the  Federal reversionary interest in Udall Park to the city, as the parties  intended when the land exchange was made. This bill will allow Tucson  to finally take full ownership of the park.   In closing, I want to thank Chairman Bishop, Chairman McClintock, and  the members of the Natural Resources Committee, really, on both sides  of the aisle, for working with me to move this legislation forward.  This has got strong bipartisan support. I look forward to seeing this  issue through and ensuring the land transfer is completed.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this issue.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional  speakers.   I yield back the balance of my time.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 965         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

DESIGNATION OF SAINT-GAUDENS NATIONAL HISTORICAL                     PARK.         (a) In General.--The Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site       shall be known and designated as the ``Saint-Gaudens National       Historical Park''.        (b) Amendments to Public Law 88-543.--Public Law 88-543 (78       Stat.749) is amended--        (1) by striking ``National Historic Site'' each place it       appears and inserting ``National Historical Park'';        (2) in section 2(a), by striking ``historic site'' and       inserting ``Saint-Gaudens National Historical Park'';        (3) in section 3, by--        (A) striking ``national historical site'' and inserting       ``Saint-Gaudens National Historical Park''; and        (B) striking ``part of the site'' and inserting ``part of       the park''; and        (4) in section 4(b), by striking ``traditional to the       site'' and inserting ``traditional to the park''.        (c) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation,       document, record, map, or other paper of the United States to       the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site shall be considered       to be a reference to the ``Saint-Gaudens National Historical       Park''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  McEachin) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Augustus Saint-Gaudens is one of the most prolific  sculptors in our Nation's history. His work includes Boston's Robert  Gould Shaw Memorial, Chicago's Standing Lincoln, and New York's William  Tecumseh Sherman Memorial. Most notably, Saint-Gaudens designed a $20  double eagle gold piece for the U.S. Mint, considered one of the  greatest American coins ever issued.   The Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site is a 190-acre historic site  in Sullivan County, New Hampshire. The site encompasses the summer home  and studio of this renowned American artist, whose annual presence in  Sullivan County helped spawn the Cornish Artist Colony in nearby  Cornish, New Hampshire. This colony, which was  [[Page H7643]]  comprised of painters, sculptors, and musicians, helped drive a period  of American artistic resurgence called the American Renaissance in the  years following the Civil War.   The main house and surrounding gardens were initially designated as a  National Historic Landmark in 1962, which was converted to a National  Historic Site in 1964, when the grounds were donated to the National  Park Service. The current property contains 21 buildings, a number of  Saint-Gaudens' sculptures, and miles of hiking trails.   This bill simply changes the designation of Saint-Gaudens National  Historic Site to a National Historical Park, allowing the National Park  Service to better relay the impact and legacy of this historic American  artist.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 965, introduced by Representative Kuster of New  Hampshire, redesignates a site in her State as the Saint-Gaudens  National Historical Park, a critical name change that recognizes the  cultural and historical importance of that landscape.   Augustus Saint-Gaudens was a keystone figure in the 19th century  American Renaissance of art and architecture. Since 1977, the home,  studio, gardens, and artwork of this American icon have been managed  and preserved by the National Park Service as part of the Saint-Gaudens  National Historic Site in Cornish, New Hampshire.   One of Saint-Gaudens' most well-known creations is the Shaw Memorial  in Boston. This sculpture memorializes the bravery of Robert Gould  Shaw, who led the first regiment of African-American soldiers recruited  from the North during the Civil War. However, this is just one of the  many public monuments credited to Saint-Gaudens, many of which are  preserved and managed by the National Park Service at the Saint-Gaudens  National Historic Site.   In 2010, however, the National Park Service acquired the adjacent  Blow-Me-Down Farm, an important meeting place for the Cornish Art  Colony led by Saint-Gaudens. The acquisition of the farm allows the  site to fulfill its vision as a national park for the arts. The  expanded physical size and historical scope is better defined as a  National Historic Park rather than a National Historical Site, which is  usually reserved for a single building or other stand-alone structure.   Importantly, this redesignation will not change any laws or policies  affecting the site and will only require changes in signage, maps, and  handouts. Therefore, redesignating this area as Saint-Gaudens National  Historical Park conforms to naming standards used by the National Park  Service and further honors the legacy of Augustus Saint-Gaudens.   In addition to preserving Saint-Gaudens' legacy, the site also  protects a variety of important ecosystems. The site is bordered by two  streams that feed into the Connecticut River, and it contains a large  forest and pond where visitors can observe wildlife.   Representative Kuster introduced H.R. 965 with the support of the  entire New Hampshire delegation, and I would like to thank her for her  dedication to protecting the historic areas important to her State and  our national story.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), the author of this fine  piece of legislation.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman  McEachin for yielding this time to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of H.R. 965, the Saint- Gaudens National Historical Park Redesignation Act.   Named after the great American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, this  historic site, located in Cornish, New Hampshire, has preserved his  home and working studios since it was established in 1965.   Augustus Saint-Gaudens was born in Dublin, Ireland, and immigrated to  America with his parents when he was just 6 months old. It was at a  young age when Augustus developed a strong interest in sculpting, which  set him on a path to Paris and Rome, where he studied art and  architecture and worked on his very first commission.   In 1876, Saint-Gaudens was tapped for his first of several prominent  Civil War-related commissions, which include the Standing Lincoln  statue of our 16th President. At over 12 feet tall, this historic  landmark stands prominently in Chicago's Lincoln Park. After working on  the statue for close to a decade, the towering piece was unveiled in  1887 to a crowd of over 10,000 people, including President Lincoln's  only living grandson.    His most famous work was commissioned soon after: the Robert Gould  Shaw Memorial, a bronze bas-relief which took Saint-Gaudens 14 years to  complete. Located in Boston Common, this iconic sculpture depicts  Colonel Shaw and the 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry,  which was the first African-American regiment organized by the Union in  the Civil War.   As one of the foremost American sculptors of the 19th century, Saint- Gaudens left a lasting legacy on our country's artistic heritage, which  continues to be cherished at our historic site in Cornish.   Since its authorization by Congress in 1964 and establishment a year  later, the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site has blossomed into a  popular tourist attraction and location for local artists and musicians  to share their talents. However, the present name, which designates  this location as a historic site, is no longer the most appropriate or  useful to accurately portray the complexity of this site.   Whereas, National Historic Sites are typically designated for single  buildings or sites that only encompass a few acres in size, the Saint- Gaudens National Historic Site is 190 acres in size and includes  multiple buildings, a vast collection of American art, and a small  trail network that allows visitors to explore the grounds.   My legislation would simply redesignate Saint-Gaudens National  Historic Site to Saint-Gaudens National Historical Park, which would  more accurately illustrate all that the park has to offer.   In partnership with the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a private nonprofit  that operated the site until it donated the land to the National Park  Service in 1965, this historic site offers rotating contemporary and  historical exhibitions, concerts, hands-on workshops, lectures, and  many other educational opportunities for our visitors.   The array of recreational activities offered to visitors makes this  park much more than a historic site. It is a living remembrance to the  great American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and the artistic legacy  that he has left behind. It is my hope that this proposed name change  will help attract more interest in the park, boost annual visitation,  and help drive our local economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass this legislation.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, having no one else to speak on this issue,  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for  this piece of legislation and thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire  (Ms. Kuster) for putting this forward, and I yield back the balance of  my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  McEachin) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2582, introduced by the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs.  Love), seeks to resolve an ongoing standoff between the State of Utah  and the Bureau of Land Management over statehood-era land grants to  promote responsible land management and enable the United States to  fulfill its commitments to provide land for the support of Utah's  higher education system.   Since 1998, the Bureau of Land Management has cited an administrative  technicality to favor land exchanges over State selections of land,  which has held up the State of Utah's selection of roughly 500 acres of  Bureau of Land Management land classified for disposal.   The land in question has been selected by the State for the benefit  of Utah State University, and this bill makes it clear that State  selections are equally acceptable as land exchanges and would confirm  that the Bureau of Land Management may process the State's current  selection as well as future State selections in the immediate area.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2582 authorizes the Bureau of Land Management to  process the State of Utah's land claims without amending existing  planning documents.   The Utah State Enabling Act of 1894 authorized the State of Utah to  select certain lands to support schools and other public purposes.  Approximately 2,000 acres of authorized grants are unfilled.   In 1998, the State started the application to acquire 440 acres of  land in Utah County, Utah, to support Utah State University. BLM  eventually rejected the application because the lands are identified  for disposal by exchange, which only allows BLM to convey the land  under certain conditions.   This bill allows the agency to process these specific claims without  updating the underlying planning documents, something that would take a  significant amount of time and money. BLM testified in support of this  legislation but requested an amendment to clarify that the lands will  be used for Utah State University and the addition of a legislative  map.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs.  Love), the State of Utah, and the Republican Committee staff for  working with us to address these concerns. Thanks to their  consideration, we were able to amend this bill in markup to address  these concerns.   There are many fights over public lands in this country, but this  does not have to be one of them. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and  urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love).    Mr. Speaker, being from the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2582, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.  [[Page H7645]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2937) to amend the Surface Mining Control  and Reclamation Act of 1977 to authorize partnerships between States  and nongovernmental entities for the purpose of reclaiming and  restoring land and water resources adversely affected by coal mining  activities before August 3, 1977, and for other purposes.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5  [[Page H7646]]  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5  [[Page H7646]]  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank leadership for allowing H.R. 2937 to come to the  floor. This legislation, introduced by my friend from Illinois (Mr.  LaHood), will help address the challenge of abandoned coal mines  present in many affected communities across the Nation.   The Community Reclamation Partnerships Act enables States to partner  with Good Samaritan entities to reclaim abandoned mine sites and  facilitate acid mine drainage cleanup. H.R. 2937 creates more  opportunities to address this challenge.   Mr. Speaker, representing the Pennsylvania Fifth Congressional  District, just to note, my congressional district has more abandoned  mine sites than any congressional district in the country, so I am very  grateful for the leadership that Mr. LaHood has shown in bringing H.R.  2937 forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2937, introduced by Representative LaHood, is a  step forward for communities looking to address abandoned coal mines in  their backyards by partnering with Good Samaritans seeking to help.   The Commonwealth of Virginia, my home State, estimates that it will  need over $400 million to clean up all of its remaining abandoned coal  mines and, while this bill is no substitute for a long-term  reauthorization of the Abandoned Mine Land fund, every little bit  helps.   Each project funded by a Good Samaritan through this bill will help  one more community make their economy stronger and their environment  healthier.   A hearing on a discussion draft of this bill brought a number of  problematic issues to light, but I greatly appreciate the willingness  of the bill's sponsor and the majority staff of the Natural Resources  Committee to reach across the aisle and work with us on a bipartisan  agreement that was able to achieve unanimous consent in the Natural  Resources Committee.   I thank the sponsor for his diligent and collaborative work on this  bill, and I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2937.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Thompson and the  ranking member for helping to bring this bill, in a bipartisan way, to  the floor. I appreciate your support on H.R. 2937.   This legislation will help address the complex legal and funding- related challenges for abandoned mine lands across the Nation.   The Community Reclamation Partnerships Act amends the Surface Mining  Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to enable States to partner with  nongovernmental entities to reclaim abandoned mine sites and facilitate  acid mine drainage cleanup across the country.   Nongovernmental entities, like Trout Unlimited, have recognized the  need for reclamation in coal communities and are willing to contribute  their resources and expertise to address the problem. Unfortunately,  liability and regulatory concerns have discouraged them from  participating and partnering with the States on reclamation projects.  This legislation enables nongovernmental entities' participation in  State reclamation programs by minimizing undeserved liability and  codifying proven practices established by the State reclamation  agencies.   This legislation also addresses a frequent problem that States  experience in addressing water pollution at abandoned mine land sites.  States must choose between risking noncompliance under the Clean Water  Act or foregoing acid mine drainage abatement projects altogether. Some  States, like Pennsylvania, have successfully addressed this problem by  establishing their own guidelines for the treatment of water pollution  at abandoned mine land sites. These State-specific strategies have  resulted in successful water treatment projects and a significant  reduction in acid mine drainage in several States. We want to replicate  that across the country with this legislation.   Currently, State reclamation activities have been funded solely by  fees levied on the coal industry over the past four decades. These fees  have resulted in reclamation of approximately $4 billion of abandoned  mine land liabilities. However, according to the Department of the  Interior, the estimated remediation costs exceeds $10 billion across  the country.   The outstanding abandoned mine land liabilities in Illinois, my home  State, is $156 million; and in my district, the 18th Congressional  District, it is $17 million. The cost of reclaiming these sites will  continue to strain State resources in the coming decades, and the  conditions of these sites will only worsen over time.   In short, this bill empowers State and local community leaders who  want to assist in abandoned mine cleanup efforts so that future  development can occur in these areas. No group should be punished for  wanting to help out their local community in a responsible way.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2937 brings more resources to bear on this  considerable challenge, and I urge adoption of this bipartisan measure.    Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just ask my  colleagues to support this piece of legislation. I am very appreciative  to the author of this bill for his leadership. Having a congressional  district that has significant presence of abandoned mine lands, I know  that the authorities and the protections he is seeking here will be  good for all, for the communities, for the environment, and for the  economy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2937.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, October is National  Disability Employment Awareness Month, and it is a time when we  celebrate the numerous contributions and skills of American workers  with disabilities.   Many Americans with disabilities struggle to find employment  opportunities despite the wealth of skills they have to offer. In 2016,  only 27.7 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities were  employed.   More employers should recognize the fresh perspectives and skills  that these men and women can add to an organization.   Workers with developmental disabilities tend to be reliable,  dedicated, and loyal employees with a positive attitude and a strong  work ethic.   Right here on Capitol Hill, my office participates in the  Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual  Disabilities. This program is designed to give students with varying  intellectual disabilities an opportunity to gain congressional work  experience, and it has been rewarding for everyone involved.   Mr. Speaker, hiring an individual who has a disability can have a  profound impact on their life. They experience the independence,  economic self-sufficiency, pride, and community that come with a job.   These individuals promote workforce diversity and can truly enhance  the workplace for the better.                            ____________________
