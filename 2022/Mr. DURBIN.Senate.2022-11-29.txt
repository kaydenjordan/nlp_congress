 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5  minutes before the rollcall begins.    Madam President, I am glad that I am on the floor today  to hear the previous speakers. I think Senator Collins of Maine gave a  thoughtful presentation about the substance of this bill and addressed  many of the worries and criticisms that were raised on the floor  earlier.   I think one thing stuck with me: If there is a protection under  Obergefell, it is the same protection under this bill. It is not an  expansion of rights.   But I also want to thank the Senator from Wyoming. That was an  outstanding statement. It really was, and I join Senator Collins in  commending her for saying it. I am sure her position has not been an  easy one at home, but it reflects some thoughtful consideration on her  part. Most importantly, it reflects her appeal to us in this Chamber  and to the Nation to really seize this opportunity for tolerance. If  there was ever a time when we needed more of that in this Nation, I  can't imagine when it was. We need it now more than ever.   It wasn't but just a few days ago that there was a mass shooting  involving those who were at a gay nightclub, and innocent people were  killed. Now, more than ever, we need to stand up and say there needs to  be tolerance in America, and her statement really touched my heart. I  thank her so much for coming to the floor and delivering it.   I take a look at this and say many times I have been critical of  Supreme Court Justices, particularly Supreme Court Justice Thomas. We  disagree more than we agree. But I, in a way, have to be grateful to  him for bringing us to this moment because it was his statement in the  Hobbs decision about the possibility of raising questions on other  Supreme Court decisions that led us to the introduction of this Respect  for Marriage Act.   I thank the Senators who led in that effort. I want to make sure that  the Record reflects Senator Baldwin, Senator Collins, Senator Portman,  who spoke on the floor earlier, and Senator Sinema and Senator Tillis,  the original cosponsors--bipartisan cosponsors--of the Respect for  Marriage Act.   What we are considering here is very fundamental. I went back to read  Obergefell, and what Justice Kennedy wrote in that majority opinion was  the acknowledgement that there is a constitutional protection based on  due process and equal protection under the laws for same-sex marriage-- fundamental. He said we don't have to wait on the legislature to spell  this out; it already exists. And that, to me, says how powerful this  issue is.   My wife and I are blessed to have so many friends who are in same-sex  marriages and are wonderful people in so many respects. It has really  opened our eyes to the reality of life for so many good Americans who  simply want to have the opportunity under the law to marry the people  they love.    The vast majority of Americans believe in that. I do, and I think  what we are trying to do today is to protect that right as best we can.  Maybe what we are doing is not as expansive as Obergefell, but it is a  genuine good-faith effort.   Senator Lee, in his amendment, claims that it is necessary for his  amendment to protect religious liberty. But he ignores the robust  protections for religious liberty already in the Respect for Marriage  Act.   The bipartisan substitute has been quoted over and over, but it bears  repeating:         Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act,       shall be construed to diminish or abrogate a religious       liberty or conscience protection otherwise available to an       individual or organization under the Constitution of the       United States or Federal law.    Of course, the free exercise of religion must be protected. No one  disputes that, and that is why the bipartisan substitute amendment  makes clear that this bill does not override existing religious freedom  protections.   I commend those religious organizations that have stepped forward,  read this bill carefully, and supported it publicly. It is across the  political spectrum and religious spectrum of America. I think they  understand the lengths that we went--those of us who supported it, as  well as those who wrote it--in putting in provisions to protect the  free exercise of religion.   But we must remember that this critical First Amendment right is a  shield, not a sword. It cannot and must not be wielded to discriminate  against individuals solely based on whom they love. We have seen too  many who have tried to turn this crusade the wrong way. I hope today's  vote on the U.S. Senate floor makes it clear that we are here to  protect civil rights and not enable civil rights violations. We need to  protect LGBTQ families and ensure that same-sex marriages are offered  the same stability and dignity that all marriages are entitled to.   For these reasons, I oppose Senator Lee's amendment and encourage my  colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6482     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back  all time.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
