 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to highlight in memoriam the  legacy of Dr. Sam Scolaro, a respected pillar in Florida 15th  District's medical community, and a devoted husband and loving father  who kept his promise to God to serve his patients until the day that he  died, a promise fulfilled when COVID-19 took his life in August.   Dr. Scolaro graduated from Jefferson High School in 1963, earned his  undergraduate degree from USF in 1967 and, after earning his medical  degree, started his medical practice in 1972 in Brandon-Valrico.   For 48 years, he served in many community roles while caring for  patients, including as president of both the Brandon Chamber of  Commerce and the Missing Children's Help Center, and as a Brandon  Hospital founding member. His mark on our community will not be  forgotten.   Dr. Scolaro extended his passion for medicine and helping others by  mentoring generations of medical students.   To his beloved wife of 53 years, Janie, and his two daughters,  Stephanie and Jennifer, our district and community mourn the loss of  Sam. May his memory and sacrifice be a reminder of his love for family  and community. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.                            ____________________
