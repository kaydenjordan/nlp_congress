 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 100 years of  stellar performance of an exemplary company in Michigan's First  District, F.O. Barden & Son Lumber.   Since its founding in 1922 by Frank Barden, the company has become a  vital component in helping Boyne City and northern Michigan grow and  adapt to needs in all aspects of daily life.   This centennial milestone represents the years of service that Barden  Lumber has dedicated to contributing to the economic well-being of the  area and the lives of countless residents.   In reflecting on the company's 100-year history, it is clear that  they have continually chosen to not only make decisions for the good of  the company in the wake of a changing marketplace, but they have also  proven capable of looking beyond the balance sheet to include the ideas  and the ideals of its people and community.   Even as our cyclical Michigan economy has presented obstacles to its  growth, F.O. Barden & Son Lumber has sustained itself through  dedication and innovation.   We are grateful for the company's contributions to Boyne City and to  all of Michigan. Thank you, F.O. Barden & Son.                            ____________________
