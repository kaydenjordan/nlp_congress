 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, look at this  picture. Where are the women?   Yesterday, the President signed an executive order affecting and  restricting health care for millions of women across the world while no  woman was present. Clearly, he did not hear the voices of the millions  of women who marched for their rights and for their health care this  past weekend. Reinstating the global gag rule will cut off funding for  global healthcare organizations that offer reproductive health care for  women from some of the poorest and neediest countries in the world.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the global gag rule and  any other assault on women's rights in America or around the world.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank my good  friend from the great State of Massachusetts for his extraordinary  leadership on this issue and so many others and for standing up for  women. The right to speak is a very special one.   Madam Speaker, the right to choose is meaningless without the access  to choose. That is what this bill is about. It is cutting off access to  choice. That is why the anti-choice movement is so strongly behind this  bill.   H.R. 7 is a cynical attempt to use the Federal Government's power of  the purse to restrict a woman's access to her constitutionally  protected right to an abortion.   I oppose the Hyde amendment and believe that we should be increasing  access to comprehensive health care, not reducing it. But this bill  makes the Hyde amendment permanent. It goes further. It prohibits the  Affordable Care Act tax credits for individuals and employers who  choose plans that cover abortion.   H.R. 7 would restrict abortion coverage or make such coverage too  burdensome or expensive for many Americans to afford. It is a step back  towards a dark and ugly time when anti-abortion laws took a substantial  toll on women's health and, in many cases, cost them their very lives.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on this rule and the  underlying bill.    MALONEY of New York (for herself,               Mr. Brendan F.
