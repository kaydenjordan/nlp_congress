 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to amendment  No. 1911. It is an amendment that claims to be about protecting free  speech but that could actually have a very chilling effect on speech at  our institutions of higher education.   I share the goal of fostering campus environments that protect free  speech and the free exchange of ideas, but I have multiple concerns  with the way this amendment goes about advancing those goals. It is not  the role of the National Science Foundation or the inspector general of  the National Science Foundation to police speech on campuses.   Deciding what is appropriate regulation of speech should not be left  to agencies that are not experts in constitutional analysis or in  issues related to First Amendment protections at our institutions of  higher education.   I believe it would be a mistake to use today's amendment to make  substantial change without the opportunity for input from students,  educators, and stakeholders. I have heard from many institutions of  higher education, as well as civil rights groups, who strongly share my  concerns.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.    Madam President, I was just here yesterday reminding my  colleagues that this is a bipartisan bill to help families across our  country by boosting American's competitiveness. I have said it already.  I will say it again. That means we have to ensure that American  research is guided by science, not ideology.   This amendment does the exact opposite and undermines scientifically  significant research that could actually help develop new treatments  and ultimately lead to lifesaving organ transplants.   If we are serious about bipartisan commitment to American innovation,  we have to stop these ideological attacks on medical research and focus  on the science and ultimately the health of our patients.   I urge a ``no'' vote. Thank you.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1771
