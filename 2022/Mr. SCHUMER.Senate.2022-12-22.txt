 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it was very late last night for those of  us who were here and the staff. At 2 a.m. is when we finished, 2:01, to  try to reach an agreement on finishing the omnibus bill. We are getting  ever closer to reaching an agreement, but we are still not there. I  hope that we will lock in an agreement sometime later this morning.   In the meantime, we will start today with a vote on the confirmation  of Franklin Parker to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Navy.   I want to thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for their  cooperation. I thank the clerks for being here late, late last night as  we waited and waited and waited for an agreement, which hasn't yet  come, and for showing up early this morning.   And I hope we can finish the omnibus today. There is no reason why we  can't. The bill is so important to get done because it will be good for  families, for veterans, our national security, even for the health of  our democratic institutions. To go to a CR or, even worse, a government  shutdown, would be a huge disservice at any time, but particularly in  the holiday season, to the American people.   To ensure that we minimize any delays, I ask Members to stay near the  floor and be ready to get voting when the time comes. If we can keep  this process moving, we can finish in time for Members and staff to get  home for Christmas safely, before the blizzard wreaks havoc across much  of the country.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Parker  nomination?   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following be the only matters remaining in order to the House message  with respect to H.R. 2617; that the amendments be called up en bloc,  reported by number, and considered in order: Paul, No. 6561, and a  motion to waive; Johnson, No. 6555; Johnson, No. 6559; Sinema-Tester,  No. 6621; Lee, No. 6563; Lee, No. 6576; Lankford, No. 6577; Braun, No.  6569; Cassidy, No. 6558; Padilla-Cornyn, No. 6588; Graham, No. 6596;  Merkley, No. 6595; Klobuchar-Lee, No. 6597; Gillibrand, No. 6607;  Menendez-Cotton, No. 6617; that the Senate then proceed to the  immediate consideration of the Scott of Florida bill that is at the  desk; that the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate vote  on passage of the bill; that if the bill is passed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that upon  disposition of the Scott bill, the Senate resume consideration of the  House message; further, that the Senate then vote on the motion to  waive, if made, and in relation to the amendments in the order listed;  that upon disposition of the amendments, the motion to refer be  withdrawn, amendment No. 6571 be withdrawn, and the Senate then vote on  the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment No.  4 to H.R. 2617 with amendment No. 6552, as amended, if amended, with 2  minutes for debate equally divided between each vote and all votes  after the first vote be 10-minute votes, with 60 affirmative votes  required for passage of the Scott bill, the motion to concur with  amendment, and the adoption of all amendments except No. 6555, No.  6577, No. 6563, and No. 6576; finally, that if the motion to concur  with amendment is agreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table, without intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, we have an agreement now. We will vote on  all of the amendments in order and then vote on final passage. It has  taken a while, but it is worth it. And I appreciate the cooperation of  everyone here.   The first vote will take a while, until the Members can assemble. But  after that, I hope, we intend that everyone will sit in their seat and  we vote through the amendments quickly. As we know, the storm is  coming. We want to have people vote, get the bill done, but then be  able to go home once we have done our work.   So please cooperate, and no appointments far away. We are going to  vote quickly, 10-minute votes on each, and, hopefully, Members will sit  in their chairs.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.    Madam President, now, may I have the attention of  everybody, please?   OK. I urge everybody to stay in their seats. We are having 10-minute  votes. We have to get out of here as quickly as possible, so we need  cooperation from everybody, OK? Thank you.    Can I have the attention of the Chamber? That was a 12- minute vote. We can do 2 minutes better. Please stay in your seats.    Mr. President, that one was 11. We are making progress.   Will Members please sit in their seats when called and speak loudly  so the clerk can hear how you vote. That will speed things up a little  more. Maybe we can even break the 10-minute mark.  [[Page S10067]]     Mr. President, that was 8\1/2\ minutes. Let's keep it  up. Stay in your seats.   (Applause.)   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.                              Amendment No. 6559     Mr. President, that was 9 minutes. Let's keep it up.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will now  be 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote in relation to the Sinema- Tester amendment No. 6621.   Who seeks recognition?   The Senator from Arizona.                              Amendment No. 6621     Mr. President, this is a great example--this very  important bill--of how this body can work in a bipartisan way and get  things done. I want to salute Senators Casey and Cassidy for their  diligence and relentlessness. I want to thank Senators Murray and Burr.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act makes a simple assertion: If you  are pregnant, if you are working during your pregnancy, you should have  the right to basic workplace accommodations.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is one of the most significant  improvements to workplace protections in years. Tens of millions will  be covered under this legislation, especially millions who work low- income jobs, long hours, and get little support.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6558     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote  threshold be vitiated with respect to this amendment so that we can  have a voice vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6588    The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Amendment No. 6596, as Modified    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is now 2  minutes of debate prior to the vote on the Graham amendment No. 6596,  as modified.   The Senator from South Carolina.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote  threshold be vitiated with respect to this amendment.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.   The amendment (No. 6596), as modified, was agreed to.                              Amendment No. 6595    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is now 2  minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to Merkley amendment No.  6595.    One final appeal for a voice vote? It is going to win.  OK.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6597     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, first, I want to thank my friend and  colleague Senator Gillibrand for the great work she has done  championing the 9/11 responder and survivor health fund.   We know how many people sacrificed. We know how they ran to the  towers when they were still smoldering, and then they contracted  terrible diseases. For a while, this country left them high and dry. It  would be like leaving our veterans high and dry. But, no, we stepped up  to the plate with a very good and successful health funding program.  Unfortunately, it runs out very soon. This amendment will extend it so  it now can last another full 5 years. And the worry that firefighters,  construction workers, police officers, and others who ran to the towers  and are now beginning to contract diseases they never should have  gotten--they will be taken care of.   I hope we can get everybody to vote for this patriotic, important  bill that remembers those who helped us in a great time of need.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.    Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Menendez and  Senator Cotton--another good example of bipartisan progress. Families  have been left out, in several different instances, who are victims of  terrorism, who have had relatives who were victims of terrorism. We are  saying: We stand by you.   Let's vote. Let's vote by voice.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote  threshold be vitiated with respect to this amendment.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?    I ask for the yeas and nays.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6617    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, we are about to have a vote on final  passage. Senator Leahy will speak for no more than 2 minutes; Senator  Shelby, for no more than 2; I will speak for less than a minute.   Members should be advised, there may, may not, be a vote on three  military appointees after final passage.   It will need unanimous consent to get it done. Right?   Some people are trying to do it. We will see what happens. It is not  me doing it.   Let's go to the statements now. Senator Leahy.                             Amendments Withdrawn     Mr. President, this is one of the most significant  appropriations packages we have done in a very long time. The range of  people it helps is large and deep. After a lot of hard work and  compromise, the Senate is funding the government with an aggressive  investment in American families, workers, and national defense.   Here is who it helps: working families, parents who can't afford  childcare, pregnant workers, students, and so much more. It is one of  the most significant packages for women across America, including  protections for pregnant workers, part of the Momnibus and new moms who  will now get 1 year of postpartum care. And it is fitting we are ending  the 117th Congress by protecting our democracy through reforming the  Electoral Count Act.   I want to thank the great staff of the Appropriations Committee:  Chuck Kieffer and Chanda Betourney. I want to thank all of those who  worked so hard and the members of the committee. And I think it is only  appropriate to conclude with a round of applause for our two great  leaders, Senators Leahy and Shelby, who have done a great job through  the years on the Appropriations Committee.   (Applause, Senators rising.)                           Vote on Motion to Concur     I ask for the yeas and nays.   This will be, by the way--we couldn't work out that military thing-- this will be the last rollcall vote.   Merry Christmas and a happy new year to one and all.  [[Page S10077]]    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the motion  to concur with amendment No. 6552, as amended.   The yeas and nays are requested.   Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Well, Madam President, as you know, there are a lot of  good things that occur at the end of the year. We have our holidays-- our Christmas and Hanukkah holidays--with our families. We passed a lot  of good legislation, and that is a job well done. A feeling of pride  swells in all of our hearts that we were able to help so many American  people in so many different ways and make our country and our world a  better place.   But it is also a moment of sadness in a certain sense for those of us  who some of our great staff members are leaving. I have a few, and I  would like to talk about two today, two of the top people.   I am blessed. I have a great staff. I know how good you all think  they are, our Senators, because you are always talking to my staff, and  that shows the respect that they have for them and the respect I have  for them as well.   One of the nice things about my staff is they are with me for many,  many years. In fact, Mike Lynch, my chief in New York and Washington,  who I think is the best chief for a leader that anyone has ever had,  and Martin Brennan, my chief in Washington, have been with me virtually  since I began in the Senate 24 years ago. So people stay awhile.   And these two have. I am going to miss them dearly.   First, let me begin with my Director of Economic Policy, Anna Taylor.   How did I meet Anna Taylor? Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a Senator from  Arkansas, had just lost her race. She came into my office, and we  hugged and cried a little bit because she was such a great person and  we knew we would miss her in the Senate.   But she said: I want to give you a gift. And she said: Anna Taylor.  Anna Taylor--that is how they would say her name. They are from  northeast Arkansas. They call it the rice country. That means rice.   And she has been the best tax staffer--trade, economic policy--on the  Hill. Every Senator on our side of the aisle and many on other sides of  the aisle, when they have problems on tax policy, the watchword is: Go  to Anna.   I don't know. Are they here? Are they--no. Well, I hope they are  listening. Anyway: Go to Anna. She knows it better than anyone.   And she is brilliant. She is hardworking. She takes the most complex  problems and figures out how to solve them in a substantive way but in  a way that could be acceptable politically to a broad and diverse  Senate. And she just knows it all. When there are these complicated  economic issues that need explaining, she explains them in a way that  is totally accurate and deep but also makes us able to understand them.   And, of course, she knows she is number 38 on my speed dial on my  well-known famous--or infamous, whatever way you look at it--flip  phone. She takes my calls from about 6 in the morning until about  midnight because I so depend on her.   She is also such a decent person. She is amazing. She is kind. She is  nice. She is caring. And she is so dedicated. Let me tell you, during  the IRA, one of the most important pieces of legislation passed in  decades--and she, more than anyone else, had written the tax parts of  it, trying to take the diverse views of everybody--she was having her  baby, her first baby. She got married while she was working on our  staff. And she had little Posey. What a nice name. She kept working. I  said: Anna, don't come here. Don't get on the phone. You just became a  new momma.   But, no, there she was being a great momma as well as somebody  helping get us past this historic legislation.   So now Anna is moving on. It will be a little less frenetic life and  a life where she can enjoy Posey and her husband. And all of us--not  just Chuck Schumer, not just all of my wonderful staff, but the whole  Senate--she leaves a huge hole, a huge cavity of knowledge, of  dedication, of reliance.   We will miss you, Anna, but you deserve the best. And you will  always, always, always be a member of the Schumer family.   And she is not the only one who is leaving. Another great one is  leaving too--my chief counsel--and that is Reggie Babin. He, too, is  from the South. This kid from southern Brooklyn is hiring a lot of  southern Americans--not southern Americans--people from the South of  the United States.   Reggie is from Louisiana. He still loves LSU and many other  Louisiana-type things. And he is my departing chief counsel.   When I became leader--then minority leader--I needed a really good  counsel. The minute I interviewed Reggie, who had worked on the House  side for Cedric Richmond and in the Black Caucus, I said: Whoa, this  guy has got it all. We have got to hire him.   And sure enough, my faith in that initial meeting was totally  vindicated. Reggie is deep. He is a thinker. And when you have a  problem, he has always turned it over six different ways with many  different sides of the prism. He sees them all. And he is careful, and  he is thoughtful.   I am sort of a ``yes'' person. I like to get everything done. He is a  little bit more of a ``no'' person and has stopped me from doing things  that I am glad I never did. And he is just amazing.   And he has had such dedication in so many pieces of legislation that  we have passed. And probably at the top of the list is judges. As  Senator Durbin, the chairman of Judiciary knows, we have appointed so  many good people on the bench. And Dick and his committee did a great  job, but so did Reggie Babin--who worked with the White House, who  worked with the Judiciary Committee, who worked with everybody. And we  have a record number of judges, and I would say it is the finest cohort  of judges that has ever come before the Senate in 2 years. And it is in  good part because of Reggie.    There are a couple of things that he didn't get done--his goal to  help us decriminalize marijuana, one of his passions because he had  seen how badly it had hurt communities throughout the country. We came  close, but we didn't make it. But, Reggie, a pledge to you. We are  going to continue your work and your legacy next year. You have built a  great bipartisan coalition, and I believe we can get it done.   So, Reggie, just like Anna, we will miss you. You have left your mark  on this institution, both Anna and Reggie. They have both left their  mark on our country. There are millions of Americans right now whose  lives are better because Reggie Babin and Anna Taylor trod the Halls of  Congress and did great work for all of us.   So I want to thank them for their sacrifice. I want to thank them for  their good will. I want to thank them for their friendship. We got to  know each other on a personal basis.   And I want to say to both: You are always members of the Schumer  family. We will always be in touch. We miss you, wish you Godspeed, and  know you will continue to have great success with your families and in  making the world a better place.   We have a little housekeeping business, the last bit of the season,  of 2022, a great year for us. Not the last bit. OK. Not the last today,  but we don't have to do anything tomorrow. OK. Good.
