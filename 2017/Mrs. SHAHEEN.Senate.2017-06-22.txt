 Mr. President, last month, Republicans in the House of  Representatives passed a healthcare bill. They call it the American  Health Care Act. It has been widely described as cruel and poorly  crafted. Last week, President Trump described it as ``mean.''   The House bill, by design, would take health coverage away from tens  of millions of Americans. It ends the guarantee of affordable coverage  for people with preexisting conditions. It cuts Medicaid, which is the  principal program for ensuring children, people with disabilities, and  seniors in nursing homes. It cuts Medicaid by more than $800 billion,  and to compound that cruelty, the same legislation gives an enormous  tax cut--over $30 billion--to those at the top of the income scale.   We just heard this morning some of what is in the Senate bill, the  Senate version of the American Health Care Act. In fact, not only does  it not do what President Trump claims the Senate was working on--it  doesn't address the mean aspect of it--but it actually makes it worse.  In a State like New Hampshire, it provides for even deeper cuts to our  expanded Medicaid Program, a bipartisan program that provides for  treatment for substance use disorders for people dealing with the  heroin and opioid epidemic. It would tax older Americans more than  younger Americans for their health insurance and defund Planned  Parenthood. There are all kinds of reasons. It would eliminate the  requirement that people with preexisting conditions are able to have  healthcare coverage. And all of this was done in secret behind closed  doors.    My office has been deluged with messages from constituents who oppose  the Republican leader's bill. This shows whom we have heard from in  recent weeks. I have received more than 5,400 messages opposing the  bill and 108 in support, so 5,461 are in opposition, and 108 are in  support.   I am sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle must be  receiving similar volumes of mail and phone calls from their  constituents, and they are hearing what I am hearing from my  constituents: that if we go forward with this legislation that the  House passed and that the Senate is considering, we are going to have  people lose their access to healthcare and many people will have to pay  more.   So I appeal to Republican leaders. I urge you to stop and reconsider  what you are doing. I want you to listen to some of the people we have  heard from in New Hampshire, everyday Americans whose lives would be  devastated by this legislation.   Several months ago, I asked people across the State of New Hampshire  to tell me their stories about the Affordable Care Act, to tell me  their concerns, to let me know how it has made a difference for them.   Here we see one of the people I heard from. This is Deodonne  Bhattarai and her son Bodhi. They live in Concord, NH. As you see,  Bodhi is in a special chair. Deodonne writes:         Our three-year-old son is a bright, curious, funny little       boy who also has Spinal Muscular Atrophy.    That is a degenerative neuromuscular disease that causes his muscles  to be very weak.         Our insurance initially denied coverage for his wheelchair,       but because of the Affordable Care Act--    The ban on discrimination against those with preexisting conditions--       my son is now able to explore his world independently.    She goes on to say:         I have [read news reports about the Republican       legislation], and I fear for our ability to maintain not just       insurance coverage but the type of quality coverage my son's       life depends upon.    Next we have a picture of the McCabe family. They are from Kingston,  NH, and this is their story:         Our daughter, Ellie, was born with a rare and serious heart       defect called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.    You can see Ellie there. She looks like a healthy, inquisitive little  girl, and she is looking healthy because she underwent her first  surgery when she was just 3 days old.   The McCabes go on to say:         It terrifies us to think about what would have happened to       our family if Ellie hadn't been protected by the pre-existing       conditions protections in place thanks to the Affordable Care       Act. Without those protections, either we would be in serious       debt for the rest of our lives or Ellie would not have had       her life-saving surgeries.    Next, this is Dr. Marie Ramas. She serves at the Lamprey Health Care  Center in Nashua, NH. That is a clinic I recently visited. She wrote to  me:         I have a 24-year-old patient who was born with a congenital       condition that did not allow his leg bones to grow       completely. This patient was unable to afford proper care and       had been walking with an old prosthetic for the last 3 years.    Imagine not being able to get your prosthetic replaced for 3 years.         Thanks to expanded Medicaid and to the ACA protections for       those with pre-existing conditions, he's now getting quality       care and can afford a new prosthetic.    So his life has been changed by the Affordable Care Act.   I have also heard stories from scores of entrepreneurs and small  business owners who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act.   This is Steve Roll of Keene, NH, and he wrote:         In late 2015, I left my job to start my own business. I've       built a profitable business and expect to hire employees       within a year or two. Before the ACA, I wouldn't have taken       the risk to start a business because I have a pre-existing       condition and I wouldn't have been able to get an individual       health insurance policy. If the ACA is repealed, I'm       concerned that I'll need to put my business on hold in order       to go back to a corporate job just to get the healthcare       benefits.    Well, the healthcare legislation that has been produced by the  Republican leadership in the Senate would take away the requirement  that people with preexisting conditions have to have access to  healthcare.   We have another businessperson here, Dave Lucier. He is the owner of  Claremont Spice & Dry Goods in western New Hampshire. Dave wrote this:         Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance costs were more       than a third of my business expenses. Now they're less than       an eighth. The ACA made it possible for me to go out on my       own and realize my dream of starting a small business here in       Claremont.    And his business is doing well.   Many women have written to me about how the Affordable Care Act has  [[Page S3712]]  ended discrimination against them by the health insurance industry-- discrimination because of their gender. In particular, they are  grateful that the Affordable Care Act includes maternity care and  contraception among the law's essential health benefits.   This is Maura Fay of Exeter, NH. I talked about her last night when I  was talking about the impact of this Republican bill on women's health.  Maura wrote:         My husband and I are self-employed. Before the ACA, we were       paying rates that were simply unsustainable for a middle-      class family like ours. When I was pregnant in 2013, we were       forced to pay a maternity rider of an additional $822 a       month. I'm worried about the rollbacks in regulations around       essential health benefits, especially since so many of them       impact women. Maternity coverage shouldn't come with an       additional $800 a month price tag.    Here in Washington, some folks seem to think that repealing the  Affordable Care Act is all about politics, that it is about winning  this debate. But for ordinary people in New Hampshire--people like  Maura, like the McCabe family, like all the people I have shown  pictures of this afternoon--for ordinary people in New Hampshire and  across America, repealing the Affordable Care Act isn't about politics.  For so many of them, it is about life-and-death. It is about the kind  of lives they are going to lead. It is about whether they are going to  be able to continue to afford healthcare, whether they are going to  continue to pay their mortgage and buy prescription drugs. We need to  listen to these ordinary people in each of our States whose lives and  financial situations will be turned upside down if the Affordable Care  Act is repealed.   This process has really not been in keeping with our democratic  process in America. For the Republican leadership here in the Senate  and before that in the House to pursue a partisan approach to  healthcare, to deny Democrats and even deny many of my Republican  colleagues the ability to engage in the writing of this bill--it is  deeply misguided to deny the public access, to deny a hearing on this  bill, legislation that we know is going to hurt tens of millions of  Americans.   There really is a better way forward for both the Senate and for our  country. If we put ideology and partisanship aside, if we work  together, we can strengthen the parts of the Affordable Care Act that  aren't working. We can continue Medicaid expansion so it can help  people with substance use disorders, so it can help kids with  disabilities, so it can help elderly people in nursing homes. We can  fix what is not working, and we can improve on this law and make it  better, but we can't do that if we continue to be divided up on our  partisan sides, if we are not willing to talk about the issue, not  willing to work together.   The American people want us to work together here in Washington to  address their concerns. Well, it is time to respect their wishes. Let's  strengthen the Affordable Care Act so that it works even better for all  Americans.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.
