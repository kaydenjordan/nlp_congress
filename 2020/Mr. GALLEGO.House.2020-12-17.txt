 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6535) to deem an urban Indian organization and employees  thereof to be a part of the Public Health Service for the purposes of  certain claims for personal injury, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6535         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DEEMING AN URBAN INDIAN ORGANIZATION AND EMPLOYEES                     THEREOF TO BE A PART OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH                     SERVICE FOR THE PURPOSES OF CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR                     PERSONAL INJURY.         Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25       U.S.C. 1651) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 519. DEEMING AN URBAN INDIAN ORGANIZATION AND                     EMPLOYEES THEREOF TO BE A PART OF THE PUBLIC                     HEALTH SERVICE FOR THE PURPOSES OF CERTAIN                     CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY.         ``Section 102(d) of the Indian Self-Determination and       Education Assistance Act shall apply--        ``(1) to an Urban Indian organization to the same extent       and in the same manner as such section applies to an Indian       tribe, a tribal organization, and an Indian contractor; and        ``(2) to the employees of an Urban Indian organization to       the same extent and in the same manner as such section       applies to employees of an Indian tribe, a tribal       organization, or an Indian contractor.''.       SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6535, the Coverage for Urban Indian Health  Providers Act, is a bipartisan bill authored by myself and  Representative Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma.   This bill would uphold our trust responsibility, provide long-overdue  parity to the Indian Health System by extending Federal Tort Claims Act  coverage to urban Indian organizations, and direct their scarce  resources to saving lives instead of bureaucratic overhead.   This broadly supported policy change was also included in the  President's fiscal year 2021 budget proposal.   As part of our trust and treaty responsibilities, the U.S. Government  has a legal responsibility to provide healthcare to Native Americans  and Alaska Natives. Congress created the Indian Health System to carry  out this obligation.   The Indian Health System is made up of the Indian Health Service;  Tribal health programs; and urban Indian organizations, known as UIOs.   UIOs play a pivotal role in upholding the trust responsibility by  providing culturally competent care to the over 70 percent of American  Indians and Alaska Natives who live in urban areas, like my district in  Phoenix, Arizona.   However, despite the pivotal role they play, UIOs are the only branch  of the Indian Health System that are not currently eligible for  liability coverage under the Federal Tort Claims Act, known as FTCA.   As a result, each UIO is forced to spend up to $250,000 per year on  individual medical liability policies. If we pass this bill today, that  quarter of a million dollars will instead be spent directly on patient  care and the resources these clinics need to fight COVID-19. That is  why passing H.R. 6535 is especially critical now, in the midst of a  pandemic that has hit Native populations the hardest, and UIOs have  been disproportionately the ones servicing them and also hit hard.   This year, over 80 percent of UIOs have cut services due to the  resource shortages they are experiencing, and at least three have had  to shut their doors during the first wave of the pandemic. Cuts to  services are devastating for the vulnerable Native communities and the  UIOs that serve them. I know because I have heard from my constituents  what a critical role UIOs, like Native Health of Phoenix, play in the  daily lives of urban Indians.   From free food deliveries during the pandemic to seniors and low- income families, to COVID testing, primary care, and social services,  UIOs and their staffs are pillars of the communities they serve and  they save lives.   These heroic frontline staffs should not be singled out for exclusion  from coverage under FTCA merely due to which part of the Indian Health  System they serve in. Passing H.R. 6535 would immediately make these  health providers eligible for FTCA coverage, and it would create a  financial lifeline for these cash-strapped health clinics serving on  the front lines of the pandemic.   I urge my colleagues to support frontline health workers, support  Native communities, and support upholding our trust responsibilities by  voting ``yes'' on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3250) to require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a  special resource study of the sites associated with the life and legacy  of the noted American philanthropist and business executive Julius  Rosenwald, with a special focus on the Rosenwald Schools, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3250         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Julius Rosenwald and the       Rosenwald Schools Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3250, the Julius  Rosenwald and Rosenwald Schools Act, introduced by Representative    Danny Davis.   This bill directs the National Park Service to conduct a study of  sites associated with the life and legacy of Julius Rosenwald.   Julius Rosenwald was an American businessman and philanthropist, who  is well known for his role as part owner and president of Sears,  Roebuck and Company.   In the early 20th century, Rosenwald used his wealth to fund  Progressive Era projects and causes, particularly those with a focus on  enhancing the lives of African Americans.   Rosenwald was instrumental in the construction of 25 YMCAs across the  country, including Chicago's historic Wabash Avenue YMCA, which  provided African Americans with housing and job training during the  Great Migration.   Through his efforts with the YMCA, Rosenwald developed a relationship  with Booker T. Washington and was invited to serve on the board of  directors of the Tuskegee Institute.   At Tuskegee, Rosenwald funded a pilot program that helped build six  schools for African-American children in rural Alabama. This  partnership ultimately sparked the creation of the Rosenwald Fund,  which constructed more than 5,300 Rosenwald Schools and related  buildings across the South.   By 1928, one in every five rural schools in the South was a Rosenwald  School, providing education to one-third of all African-American  children in the South through the 1940s.   Many Americans are unaware of the tremendous contributions that  Julius Rosenwald and the Rosenwald Schools made to our country. I would  like to thank Representative Davis for this effort to elevate this  incredible part of our Nation's history.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7460) to extend the authority for the establishment by the  Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation of a commemorative work to  commemorate the mission of the Peace Corps and the ideals on which the  Peace Corps was founded, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7460         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Peace Corps Commemorative       Work Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF                     COMMEMORATIVE WORK TO COMMEMORATE THE MISSION                     OF THE PEACE CORPS AND THE IDEALS ON WHICH THE                     PEACE CORPS WAS FOUNDED.         Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, United States       Code, the authority to establish the commemorative work under       section 1(a) of Public Law 113-78 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note; 128       Stat. 647) shall continue to apply through January 24, 2028.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to  [[Page H7249]]  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the  measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7460, the Peace Corps  Commemorative Work Extension Act, introduced by Representative  Joe  Kennedy.   Representative Kennedy served as a Peace Corps volunteer in the  Dominican Republic from 2004 to 2006. Unfortunately, he is not able to  be here for today's vote, but I know how much this means to him and the  entire Returned Peace Corps Volunteers community.   In 2014, the bipartisan Peace Corps Commemorative Act was signed into  law to establish a commemorative work to celebrate the Peace Corps and  its founding ideals. That legislation authorized the Peace Corps  Commemorative Foundation to establish the memorial in Washington, D.C.,  but the authorization for the project is set to expire in January 2021.   The Peace Corps' roots and mission date back to the 1960s. Since  then, more than 240,000 Peace Corps volunteers have served in 142 host  countries to train local communities across the world in technologies  and skills such as agricultural protection, environmental protection,  and basic education.   Since its establishment, the Peace Corps has helped promote world  peace and friendship by improving the lives of countless individuals  across the world.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Kennedy for his  efforts to honor these incredible volunteers.   The planned memorial will be a lasting tribute to the legacy of the  Peace Corps and its mission. This bill simply provides the foundation  with more time to raise money and pick an appropriate design.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Madam Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to be able  to yield time to someone who I grew up in his district as his  constituent. It is a great honor to be here and to hear more about,  obviously, Sears, Roebuck and Company and an area that I grew up in and  know very well.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5472) to redesignate the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site  as the ``Jimmy Carter National Historical Park''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5472         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Jimmy Carter National       Historical Park Redesignation Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF JIMMY CARTER NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.         (a) In General.--The Jimmy Carter National Historic Site       shall be known and designated as the ``Jimmy Carter National       Historical Park''.        (b) Amendments to Public Law 100-206.--Public Law 100-206       (54 U.S.C. 320101 note; 101 Stat. 1434) is amended--        (1) in section 1(a), in the matter preceding paragraph (1),       by striking ``National Historic Site'' and inserting       ``National Historical Park'';        (2) in section 3--        (A) in subsection (a), by striking ``provisions of law       generally applicable to national historic sites'' and       inserting ``provisions of law generally applicable to units       of the National Park System''; and        (B) in subsection (d), in the second sentence, by striking       ``National Historic Site'' and inserting ``National       Historical Park'';        (3) in section 6(2), by striking ``National Historic Site''       and inserting ``National Historical Park'';        (4) by striking ``historic site'' each place it appears and       inserting ``historical park'';        (5) by striking ``historic site'' each place it appears and       inserting ``historical park''; and        (6) by striking ``Historic Site'' each place it appears and       inserting ``Historical Park''.        (c) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation,       document, record, map, or other paper of the United States to       the  [[Page H7250]]       Jimmy Carter National Historic Site shall be considered to be       a reference to the ``Jimmy Carter National Historical Park''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5472, the Jimmy Carter  National Historical Park Redesignation Act, introduced by  Representative Sanford Bishop from Georgia.   Established by Congress in 1987, the Jimmy Carter National Historic  Site and Preservation District protects and shares the stories of key  sites associated with the life of President Jimmy Carter.   Today, the site consists of President Carter's boyhood farm; Plains  High School, which the Carters attended; the Carter home and compound  where the Carters currently live; and the Plains Railroad Depot, which  served as Carter's campaign headquarters during the 1976 Presidential  campaign.   H.R. 5472 would redesignate the National Historic Site as the Jimmy  Carter National Historical Park to conform with the Park Service's  standard pattern of nomenclature and to help promote increased  visitation to the area.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Bishop for his  efforts to elevate the life of Jimmy Carter, and I urge my colleagues  to support this bill. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5852) to redesignate the Weir Farm National Historic Site in  the State of Connecticut as the ``Weir Farm National Historical Park''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5852         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Weir Farm National       Historical Park Redesignation Act''.       SEC. 2. WEIR FARM NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.         (a) In General.--The Weir Farm National Historic Site shall       be known and designated as the ``Weir Farm National       Historical Park''.        (b) Amendments to the Weir Farm National Historic Site       Establishment Act of 1990.--The Weir Farm National Historic       Site Establishment Act of 1990 (54 U.S.C. 320101 note; Public       Law 101-485; 104 Stat. 1171; 108 Stat. 4756; 112 Stat. 3296;       123 Stat. 1190) is amended--        (1) in section 2(2)--        (A) by striking ``historic site'' and inserting       ``historical park''; and        (B) by striking ``National Historic Site'' and inserting       ``National Historical Park'';        (2) in section 4--        (A) in the heading, by striking ``historic site'' and       inserting ``historical park'';        (B) in subsection (a), by striking ``Historic Site'' and       inserting ``Historical Park''; and        (C) by striking ``historic site'' each place it appears and       inserting ``historical park'';        (3) in section 5, by striking ``historic site'' each place       it appears and inserting ``historical park''; and        (4) in section 6--        (A) in the heading, by striking ``historic site'' and       inserting ``historical park''; and        (B) by striking ``historic site'' each place it appears and       inserting ``historical park''.        (c) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation,       document, record, map, or other paper of the United States to       the Weir Farm National Historic Site shall be considered to       be a reference to the ``Weir Farm National Historical Park''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H7252]]    I rise in support of H.R. 5852, the Weir Farm National Historical  Park Redesignation Act, introduced by Representative  Jim Himes.   In 1882, American artist Julian Alden Weir traded a still life  painting he had acquired in Europe for a 153-acre farm in Branchville,  Connecticut. Inspired by the farm's rural setting, Weir spent the next  36 years developing a new approach to landscape painting and gained a  reputation as a leader of the American Impressionists.   In 1990, Congress established the Weir Farm National Historic Site to  preserve the structures and rural landscape that inspired Weir's  transition into American Impressionism. Today, the 68-acre site  includes more than a dozen structures, as well as historic gardens,  orchards, fields, and hundreds of historic painting sites. The National  Historic Site also maintains a museum collection containing more than  200,000 archives and objects, including original paintings, sculptures,  and prints.   H.R. 5852 would redesignate the Weir Farm National Historic Site as  the Weir Farm National Historical Park to conform with the National  Park Service's standard pattern of nomenclature and to help promote  increased visitation to the area.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes).    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
