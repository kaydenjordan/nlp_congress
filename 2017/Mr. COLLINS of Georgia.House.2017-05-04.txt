 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 308 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 308         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2192) to       amend the Public Health Service Act to eliminate the non-      application of certain State waiver provisions to Members of       Congress and congressional staff. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill  [[Page H4115]]       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  During further consideration of the bill (H.R.       1628) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of       the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2017,       as amended, pursuant to House Resolution 228, the further       amendments printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on House Resolution 308, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to bring  forward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee.   Over the past few weeks, the Rules Committee has had the opportunity  to hear from numerous stakeholders, from the chairs and ranking members  of committees of jurisdiction to the Members who have offered  amendments.   Most recently, last night we heard testimony from Mr. MacArthur and  Mr. Upton to explain their amendments and address any questions from  the committee members, and from Ms. McSally to explain her legislation.                                time  0915    This rule provides for further consideration of H.R. 1628, the  American Health Care Act, and incorporates three amendments--the  Palmer-Schweikert amendment, the MacArthur amendment, and the Upton  amendment--that strengthen the underlying bill.   It also provides for consideration of H.R. 2192, legislation authored  by Representative McSally, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce.   Mr. Speaker, all across our country, the Affordable Care Act  continues to strip hardworking Americans and families of access to  affordable, quality medical care and offer them skyrocketing premiums  and anemic provider networks in return.   Democrats smuggled ObamaCare through with little regard for the  procedure, left lofty and empty promises that benefit simply a  bureaucratic machine. Seven years later, we have seen these promises  evaporate as ObamaCare patients lose access to their doctors and lose  the very insurance plans they were promised would remain intact.   Our friends across the aisle claim that coverage has been expanded  and individuals who never had quality health care before now have  access. Mr. Speaker, I wish that were true, but it is not. I wish my  colleagues and I didn't hear from neighbor after neighbor who can't  find a doctor to accept ACA insurance or who avoids medical care  altogether because their deductibles reach higher than the clouds. But  we do hear from them because Americans are suffering as insurance  providers flee from the not-so-free market.   You see, coverage doesn't mean access to care. Unfortunately, we have  heard all too often that individuals may have health coverage, but they  can't use it because their premiums and deductibles are too high for  them to actually afford the care.   What good does the coverage do a woman who earns $22,000 a year and  has a $5,000 deductible?   What good does it do a young family to have insurance that no  provider in their community accepts?   What good does it do to say we want to grow the economy and create  jobs when American businesses are struggling to keep their doors open  due to the ObamaCare mandate?   We have witnessed insurers dropping out of the exchanges and seen  premiums climbing while consumers are left with less and less choice.  Five States have one option and no choice for health insurance, and  nothing guarantees that their residents will keep that much.   ObamaCare has hijacked the free market, and it has taken some  Americans' liberties with it. We must remember that exchanging freedom,  choice, self-determination for securities at the hands of Big Brother  too often leaves us with neither liberty nor security.   We know that ObamaCare was designed to make a single-payer system  inevitable. And to the extent that a single-payer system means a zero- choice system, the prophecy has already come true.   Families can no longer choose to save for retirement or pay their  mortgages because premiums suck up all the oxygen in their budget.  Individuals who want to purchase a PPO cannot because their county only  offers HMO plans. Disabled Americans who depend on Medicare find that  ObamaCare has given more Federal funding to able-bodied Americans than  our more vulnerable neighbors.   In my district, a young mother who wants to take her young son to the  family doctor post-ObamaCare can't because she can't find a physician  who accepts her new insurance.   Brittany Ivey and her husband have struggled under the consequences  of the Affordable Care Act. Mrs. Ivey was working part-time at a small  business that provided her family with health insurance until the  effects of ObamaCare on the insurance market raised her premiums  sharply. This drove the Ivey family into the individual market, where a  midlevel plan took 65 percent of her monthly gross income, even after a  small Federal subsidy. Unable to afford insurance through her employer,  Mrs. Ivey turned to the Federal exchange, where she obtained a plan  that neither she nor her children's doctor would accept.   The Affordable Care Act robbed Americans of the ability to choose  health care that worked for them, and the Affordable Care Act destroyed  the insurance market along with the benefits that competition and  innovation offer all of us. The American people deserve better.  ObamaCare replaced our doctors with bureaucrats because that is what  socialized medicine does.   The American Health Care Act is our last chance to get off the  Federal ferris wheel before we are locked into a healthcare system that  takes us nowhere and offers neighbors nothing but heartburn.   The American Health Care Act guts the most egregious provisions of  ObamaCare, rolls back the law's taxes, restores flexibility to the  States, and helps to make quality care more accessible and affordable.   Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons I came to Congress is to repeal and  replace ObamaCare and rein in our Nation's bloated, ballooning  entitlement system. The American Health Care Act does that by, for the  first time, making major reforms to an entitlement program--Medicaid.  It rolls back the Medicaid expansion under ObamaCare, one of the  fundamental pillars, and it makes structural changes to the program to  ensure it only goes to the individuals it was intended to help.   The American Health Care Act allows States to establish work  requirements for able-bodied adult Medicaid enrollees. It lets States  choose between the per capita cap and a flexible Medicare block grant,  and it increases the growth rate to cover disabled and elderly Medicaid  populations.   The bill enacts patient-centered reforms, increases access to  healthcare savings accounts, and creates a Patient and State Stability  Fund to help stabilize insurance markets that have contracted during  ObamaCare.   Over the course of the last several weeks, we have worked in this  House to strengthen the bill. We have listened to feedback from  constituents, neighbors, stakeholders, and each other.    Importantly, coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions is  maintained as a baseline within the bill. An  [[Page H4116]]  amendment from Mr. MacArthur further protects individuals' preexisting  conditions from being denied coverage.   While the amendment provides States with additional flexibility by  allowing them to seek a waiver, individuals with preexisting conditions  will not be left out to dry. In fact, there are conditions attached to  the waiver that ensure States use funds provided by the bill, should  they receive a waiver, to set up high-risk pools for those very  individuals. With the addition of the Upton amendment, the bill  provides $108 billion to help States fund programs such as high-risk  pools.   Mr. Speaker, my home State of Georgia has very different needs than  California. That is why I think it makes sense to give States more say  in what works for their populations. Our plan does this, but it does so  in a way that ensures protections exist for vulnerable populations like  the elderly, disabled, and children.   The rule also provides for Representative McSally's legislation to  ensure that Members of Congress are treated the same as all Americans.  I fully support this bill and firmly believe elected officials should  be required to live under the same laws as those they were elected to  represent.   President Trump has made his support of the American Health Care Act  and its strengthening amendments clear, and I stand with him in  supporting this legislation to gut ObamaCare and rescue the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, average premiums rose by 40 percent or more in 11 States  just this year. The statistics and the stories speak for themselves. We  must act to dismantle ObamaCare, and the Affordable Care Act does that.   I support the rule before us today to provide for further  improvements to the bill and look forward to supporting both the rule  and the underlying bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  0930     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   At this time, I think one of the interesting things is, as discussed,  the criticism of this. I think it was just a reminder, Mr. Speaker, of  what happened 7 years ago when our healthcare market, which could have  been helped by many good ideas, was decided to be taken on a very  unhealthy bent. We are now paying the price for that. We are going to  continue to see that unless we change it. We are changing that for the  better.   One of the strongest voices that we have had in this body is someone  who has actually taken it as his living to take care of people. Dr.  Burgess not only came to this Congress with a strong voice of not only  what doctors and the medical profession have, but I think it gives us  an insight into what patients need as well. He has been a clarion voice  through this whole process, before ObamaCare, during the disaster of  ObamaCare, and now as we look to fix the problems that have existed.   I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Burgess).    Will the gentleman yield?    I thank the gentleman for yielding. As a  wonderful manager of time, he will be able to parse the time as best he  may see fit. I have other speakers who probably will be coming by, so I  will just encourage the manager to manage his time well.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I think it is interesting today  since we would not be here today if there was not the problems that  you, Mr. Speaker, and I have seen.   One-third of this country has one insurer, premiums with double-digit  increases, people who can afford--maybe even with subsidies the amount  of their plan can't afford the deductibles and co-pays. They go to  doctors who won't take their insurance.   We are not here by mistake, Mr. Speaker. We are here because  ObamaCare is an abject failure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if I had to defend ObamaCare, I would go into hysterics,  too.         Since ObamaCare went into effect, the insurance choices and       coverage have gotten lower and the costs have gotten higher.       Virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance so I'm       left to change doctors who I've seen for over 30 years and       switch to ``new'' doctors who I don't trust, and who cannot       provide the same healthcare benefits I've received in the       past. I have a brain tumor that I have monitored by a very       skilled neuro-oncologist. Not anymore. The three choices I       was given via healthcare.gov aren't even honored forms of       insurance for this doctor.   [[Page H4130]]     Yes, it left them out again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Messer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, even with, again, the muddled hysterics, there is  nothing in this bill, even if you have preexisting coverage now, there  is nothing that says you lose it. Let's at least get the facts  straight.   Also, let's talk about families and why we are here.         Despite Obama's promises, my plan was canceled at an       affordable $450 a month when ObamaCare was implemented. My       new plan has gone up every year and for 2017 will be over       $1,300 a month. My husband and I cannot keep up with these       increases. Soon it will be a choice between food and housing       or health care.    Virginia from Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have been waiting also for my friends across the aisle  to stand up and say that ObamaCare is a failure. I guess they can't.  For the last 7 years, the voters have.   Small business owners and American entrepreneurs:         As an entrepreneur with two special needs children, the ACA       is an expensive nightmare. Both my husband and I are small-      business owners and must pay for individual insurance. We are       on the highest deductible plan offered to us, a monthly       premium over $1,000, and outstanding medical bills that we       are struggling to pay off. We have seen our premium go up at       least 14 percent and the expenses of care, lab, et cetera.       With all exceptions, to the President, he is offering to his       corporate friends. We are the ones who get ignored.    That is the true face of ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Barton).   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I believe probably the reason  they won't vote for it is they don't understand it, because preexisting  conditions  [[Page H4134]]  are covered. If you have coverage now, nothing in our bill, no matter  what would come from the State or anyone else, would lose the  preexisting conditions. I guess it is just easier to talk your talking  points and have your poster and go from there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Mast).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, our friends across  the aisle put partisan interests above the health of the American  people, and we are seeing the results of that today. In fact, a small- business owner from Missouri says:         I recall the days before the ACA when we would receive a 2-      inch notebook that contained multiple quotes from different       health insurance companies. Now our options are listed on a       single legal-sized sheet of paper. We only received three       quotes for 2017, and just two of them were adequate for our       region. In 2013, our insurance cost $180,000 for 92 lives       with a $2,000 deductible. In 2016, we paid $252,000 for just       61 lives who face a $5,000 deductible. Our options are       dwindling, our costs are skyrocketing, and our employees are       ultimately suffering because of the ACA.    Again, a defense of the defenseless or a positive solution for  America; that is what we are offering.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate it, but it is  amazing the concern for rural health care now under ObamaCare when much  of rural America has been down to one provider. That is not a choice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I am still waiting on a couple  more speakers, but I am ready to close whenever the gentleman is.    Mr. Speaker, I will tell Mr. McGovern, it is  his time to manage.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   What we have seen for the last few minutes, I would probably get up  and cheer, too. Because now you look at it this way. What they want to  claim as a disaster or recognize as a disaster, they didn't recognize 7  years ago. They chose to cram it down America's throat, and for 7 years  the American people have said: No. Stop it. We don't want a healthcare  system from government that takes freedom away from us and that removes  it from us.   We have been presented with a list of letters from folks who are  against this bill. Well, it is just a quick reminder to those, Mr.  Speaker, who may be wanting to remember. Some of these same folks were  the same folks who said ObamaCare was great, and who gave letters of  support. I guess they are trying to cover up for 7 years of their first  mistake.   When we understand this--let's go to some experts. I will just  clarify them as experts, Mr. Speaker.   President Bill Clinton calling ObamaCare, last year, the craziest  thing in the world. He summed it up pretty well. Because what summed up  here is they forgot the American people.   Republicans have decided that we are going to put the American people  back in control. We are not going to continue to hear from Pam in  Nebraska, who is self-employed and lost her insurance four times under  ObamaCare and twice because of the Nebraska failed startup.   If we are going to talk about misleading the American people, it  started 7 years ago, and it ends today. It ends today. The American  people deserve better. They have been thrown under the bus for 7 years.  They deserve an insurance market that is open, that is accessible, and  that does cover preexisting conditions.   If you want the deception, follow the other side. If you want the  truth, follow this side.   Mr. Speaker, if I had to defend the last 7 years and offer nothing  into the faces of these, yeah, I would have been hysterical on the  floor this morning, too. And that is exactly what we have seen.   So for those who may be, it is time to vote ``yes'' on the rule,  ``yes'' on this bill, and start giving back to America the liberty and  freedom for a healthcare system that is the best in the world and has  been attacked for 7 years. Again, that ends today.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment To H. Res. 308 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 3. Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following       new clause:       RESTRICTIONS ON CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS                           RELATING TO HEALTHCARE         13.(a) It shall not be in order to consider a bill, joint       resolution, amendment, or conference report which includes       any provision described in paragraph (b).''        (b) A provision referred to in paragraph (a) is a provision       which, if enacted into law, would result in any of the       following:        (1) The denial of health insurance coverage to individuals       on the basis that such individuals have a pre-existing       condition or a requirement for individuals with a preexisting       condition to pay more for premiums on the basis of such       individuals having such a preexisting condition.        (2) The elimination of the prohibition on life time limits       on the dollar value of health insurance coverage benefits.        (3) The termination of the ability of individuals under 26       years of age to be included on their parent's employer or       individual health coverage.        (4) The reduction in the number of people receiving health       plan coverage pursuant to the Patient Protection and       Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and Education Affordability       Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-152).        (5) An increased cost to seniors for prescription drug       coverage pursuant to any changes to provisions closing the       Medicare prescription drug `donuthole'.        (6) The requirement that individuals pay for preventive       services, such as for mammography, health screening, and       contraceptive services.        (7) The reduction of Medicare solvency or any changes to       the Medicare guarantee.        (8) The reduction of Federal taxes on the 1 percent of the       population with the highest income or increase the tax burden       (expressed as a percent of aggregate Federal taxes) on the 80       percent of the population with the lowest income.        c) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or matter       proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection and       Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the HealthCare and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union unless an easily       searchable electronic estimate and comparison prepared by the       Director of the Congressional Budget Office is made available       on a publicly available website of the House.        (d) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or       matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the Health Care and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union, that is called up       pursuant to a rule or order that makes an amendment in order       or considers such an amendment to be adopted, unless an       easily searchable updated electronic estimate and comparison       prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office       reflecting such amendment is made available on a publicly       available website of the House.        (e) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraph (a), paragraph (b),       paragraph (c), or paragraph (d). As disposition of any point       of order under paragraphs (c) through (e), the Chair shall       put the question of consideration with respect to the order,       conference report, or rule as applicable. The question of       consideration shall be debatable for 10 minutes bythe Member       initiating the point of order and for 10 minutes by an       opponent, but shall otherwise be decided without intervening       motion except one that the House adjourn.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the  [[Page H4137]]       consideration of the subject before the House being made by       the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous question is to       give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the       House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920,       to the effect that ``the refusal of the House to sustain the       demand for the previous question passes the control of the       resolution to the opposition'' in order to offer an       amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party       offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous       question and a member of the opposition rose to a       parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R.-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
