 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 872, I call  up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 57) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection relating to  ``Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act'', and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which many of  us know as perhaps the single, most powerful, unaccountable agency in  the history of our Republic, a few years ago, issued guidance that  essentially outlawed the practice of auto dealers in America being able  to take wholesale finances from third parties and charge retail rates.  They did this because the Bureau claimed that the practice potentially  violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, known as ECOA.   Mr. Speaker, there were several different problems with this  approach, not the least of which is at section 1029 of Dodd-Frank,  which forbids the Bureau from regulating auto dealers. It is in the  law, and so many of my friends on the other side of the aisle come to  this very floor to jealously, religiously, and unrelentlessly, defend  the Dodd-Frank Act.   I am anxious to hear their voices today, because to defend the Dodd- Frank Act, you must vote to overturn the Bureau's guidance because this  was absolutely trampling upon the sacred ground of Dodd-Frank.   Now, I didn't support Dodd-Frank, but it is the law of the land, Mr.  Speaker. And if there is anything, shouldn't lawgivers in this Chamber  be committed to the rule of law, the laws that have been passed by the  United States Congress and signed into law by the President of the  United States? So no less of an authority than Dodd-Frank says: Bureau,  thou shalt not regulate auto dealers. But they attempted to do it. So  that was sin number one.   Sin number two: they didn't engage in rulemaking. This was guidance.  Now, guidance is supposed to tell a market participant: Okay, we  understand what you are trying to do, and what you are trying to do is  permissible. But, instead, the Bureau flipped it on its head and said:  No, you are not allowed to do X, Y, and Z, which is essentially  rulemaking, Mr. Speaker.   And so what the Bureau did was they violated the Administrative  Procedure Act, which is there to assure that market participants  receive due process; that they are allowed notice; that they are  allowed to comment; that they are allowed to participate in the  democratic process by which rules are promulgated.   So, again, what the Bureau did was, as opposed to engaging in formal  rulemaking as demanded by the Administrative Procedure Act--by the way,  which was essentially defined by the Clinton administration--but they  violated that. They just threw it out.                                time  1515    The third problem here, Mr. Speaker, is the Bureau claimed under its  former Director, Mr. Cordray, now gubernatorial candidate Mr. Cordray,  that they were a data-driven bureau. Well, guess what? They couldn't  come up with any data of this purported violation of the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act.   They claimed that somehow there was unconscious discrimination on  racial basis, known as disparate impact. But where was the data? Auto  dealers, by law, cannot keep records on the racial characteristics of  their customers.   So what did the very enterprising Bureau do, Mr. Speaker? They  guessed. Now, they came up with a great academic name for it: Bayesian  Improved Surname Geocoding system. Do you know what that means, Mr.  Speaker? They guessed. They looked at somebody's last name. They looked  at a ZIP Code. They scratched their heads.   Oh, that person must be of Asian heritage.   Oh, that person must be of European heritage.   Oh, that person must be of African heritage.   They made it up. They had no data; so they made it up.   Now, because of all this, in the previous Congress, Mr. Speaker, this  body voted overwhelmingly--overwhelmingly--to overturn the guidance.  The vote was 332-96. Unfortunately, the Senate did not act then.  Fortunately, today the Senate has now acted; so this body has the  opportunity to overturn these many wrongs.   And let me end with this wrong: consumers are being hurt. An analysis  by The Wall Street Journal showed that  [[Page H3816]]  many creditworthy borrowers, because of what the Bureau has done, will  have to pay up to $586 more--$586 more--for their auto loans because of  what the Bureau has done. Because of that, under the Congressional  Review Act, it is time for Congress to say: We said what we mean. We  are going to protect consumers. We are going to overturn the Bureau's  guidance, and we are going to do it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin), an outstanding advocate for all the working  people of New York, a member of the Financial Services Committee, and  the author of the House companion bill.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say  that the study that my friends on the other side of the aisle allude to  from the NFHA wasn't even in existence when the Bureau promulgated  their guidance, number one.   Number two, it is based on 2 people, 2 people out of 325 million.  This is beyond junk science. It is a mockery, an absolute mockery of  the Equal Credit Opportunity Act when we are here today to ensure that  working Americans of all colors and races and creeds get credit.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer),  the chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial  Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), a senior member of the Financial Services  Committee and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), chairwoman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the majority whip of the House  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of the Financial  Services Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), a very hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  [[Page H3821]]  from New York (Ms. Tenney), an outstanding member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), an outstanding member of the Ways and Means  Committee and chair of the Congressional Auto Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   It is rare, but I have found common ground with the ranking member;  and the common ground is I have never heard such outrageous comments on  the House floor as other Members of the other side of the aisle come  and accuse us of defending discrimination?   Number one, almost half of her caucus supported S.J. Res. 57 to get  rid of this in the last Congress.   And I hope every single car dealer in America is listening to my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have come down here on  the House floor to accuse them of racism. With what? The proof of a  report that has a universe of two?   Again, it makes a mockery of the Equal Opportunity Credit Act.   And for those to come to the House floor and say they are appalled by  discrimination? Well, where were they when the Bureau of Consumer  Financial Protection was accused of having a pervasive culture of  retaliation and intimidation? They were found to engage in  discrimination, but what did we hear from the other side of the aisle?  We heard crickets. We heard crickets, Mr. Speaker.   Now, what is next? What are we going to hear from our friends on the  other side of the aisle next? Are we going to hear that every  pharmacist in America is a Fascist? Are we going to hear that every  single doctor in America is engaged in spousal abuse? Where is the  proof?   People are trying to sell cars and help them get into transportation.   And, oh, by the way, Mr. Speaker, almost every American now has one  of these. Go to your smartphone and Google ``auto finance.'' And guess  what? At least on mine, it comes up State Farm, Lending Tree, Bank of  America, Chase, RoadLoans. Nobody forces you to take the financing  package of the dealer, even though often it is a better choice than  other lenders.   It is so easy, Mr. Speaker, to come to the floor and say, My Lord,  the charge is serious; therefore, you must be guilty until proven  innocent.   This is an embarrassing day for the House, Mr. Speaker, absolutely  embarrassing, and we ought to stand for the rule of law.   When my friends on the other side of the aisle so jealously guard the  sanctity of Dodd-Frank, why haven't we heard their voice today? Why  aren't they defending Dodd-Frank today? Because Dodd-Frank, itself, as  coming down from Mount Sinai said, Thou shall not regulate auto  dealers.   And so now we are throwing Dodd-Frank overboard. We are calling auto  dealers racists. It is, indeed, outrageous comments. And to come here  to the House floor and so recklessly make that accusation is an  outrage, and it is why we need to ensure that S.J. Res. 57 is voted on  affirmatively today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 234,  nays 175, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 18, as follows:                               [Roll No. 171]                                 YEAS--234       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Cooper      Correa      Costa      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Cuellar      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Curtis      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Gonzalez (TX)      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Green, Gene      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
