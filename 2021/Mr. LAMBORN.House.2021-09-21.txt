 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  [[Page H4800]]    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4350. We have  maintained the bipartisan tradition of the Armed Services Committee.   Now, while this administration promotes weakness abroad and tyranny  at home, robust support for defense in this bill ensures that our  adversaries understand that our military has the resources required to  stymy their aggressive ambitions which will guarantee that our military  will succeed if called upon.   This legislation will enhance readiness by funding the unfunded  requests of the services and the co-coms. It will maintain our  commitment to the nuclear triad and modernization and aggressively  enhance our space capabilities. It protects our troops against  punishment for personal politics, prohibits dishonorable discharge for  COVID vaccination refusal, and requires a plan for exemptions. And it  begins to hold the Biden administration accountable for Afghanistan.    Now, while this bill fosters U.S.-Israeli cooperation, including $300  million for multiple collaborative programs, anti-Israel Democrats have  stripped the continuing resolution of $1 billion for the Iron Dome  missile defense system.   What does it say about the Progressive Caucus that they object to  Israeli citizens defending themselves from missile attacks?   It is reprehensible and anti-Semitic.   Nevertheless, this bill as it currently stands is a bipartisan bill.   I thank the chairman and ranking member for maintaining the  collaborative nature of our committee. I want to thank especially the  chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee,   John Garamendi, for his  leadership and commitment to bipartisanship. I thank my readiness team,  Ian, Dave, and Whitney, for their invaluable hard work during this  process.   Madam Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in opposition to this amendment to add a package of unrelated  lands bills to the National Defense Authorization Act. Collectively,  this pair of bills, this one and the next one, amendments, would impose  unnecessary and harmful restrictions on more than 2\1/2\ million acres  of lands in Colorado, California, and Washington, including nearly 1\1/ 2\ million of acres of new wilderness designating many miles of wild  and scenic rivers and creating 100,000 acres of national monument  expansion.   These restrictions will have the effect of greatly reducing  opportunities for multiple uses of these lands and will restrict forest  management practices that will render these lands more prone to  catastrophic wildfires.   In Colorado alone, this amendment would designate approximately  570,000 acres of new wilderness areas, 23,000 acres of expanded  wilderness, and 14,000 acres of potential wilderness.   Now, we already have 3.5 million acres of public lands in Colorado  that are designated as wilderness, so that protection is already there.  [[Page H4846]]                                     time  2320    Now, I do commend my colleague for her efforts to work with local  stakeholders to address some of their concerns over the years that she  has been working on this issue. But this package, unfortunately, does  not come close to the kind of balance and consensus that should be  required for a package of this magnitude. Many of the local communities  impacted by this amendment and that I have heard from have raised  significant concerns, including the loss of motorized access and  recreation, which would threaten their local economy.   A wilderness designation also makes it much more difficult or even  impossible to remove excess fire hazards or invasive species. There is  no real management of the land. Future generations lose access to the  land, at least for average, everyday people. In a true wilderness area,  you can't even ride a bicycle.   This bill is inconsistent with previous designations and existing  land uses by arbitrarily adding wilderness areas and wild and scenic  river designations where those designations are not really appropriate.  Supporting the declaration of areas that do not actually possess these  characteristics undermines the integrity of the Wilderness Act and the  Wild and Scenic Rivers Act for what was originally intended.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), who has a district where, actually, this  designation would take place.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   I rise in opposition to this amendment because it restricts  approximately 400,000 acres of land in Colorado, and although the  stated goal of the language is to protect and enhance outdoor  recreation--and I agree with that goal as stated--the practical effect  of this amendment would not be that at all.   For one thing, the active management of land that is under wilderness  designation to prevent wildfires is much restricted, if not made  impossible. In a State with a lot of wildfire risk, that is simply not  acceptable.   Rural county commissioners have talked to me and other opponents of  this bill and have raised concerns about negative economic impact of  the withdrawal of 200,000 acres of oil and gas land and what effect  that would have on their communities.   This amendment would also lock away approximately 1 million acres of  public lands in Arizona and permanently ban mining and other multiple- use activities in that State. This misguided and mistitled land grab  has nothing to do with protecting the  [[Page H4856]]  Grand Canyon. Instead, it seeks to ban development of one of the  largest tracts of uranium deposits in the country.   The result of this is to make us more reliant on adversaries such as  Russia. We already import 97 percent of our uranium from foreign  sources, and that would only become more precarious if this took  effect. Since 2018, the majority of uranium imports have come from  adversarial nations such as Russia.   What this amendment is doing in the National Defense Act makes no  sense at all.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let's actually hear from Representatives  who live in these areas.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert). The gentlewoman is from the western part  of the State where this would actually take place, and I believe she is  in touch with the people in her district.    Madam Speaker, just like the previous amendment, this  amendment was successfully added to last year's NDAA, but the conferees  properly dropped it from the final conference report, so it ultimately  failed. It is simply unacceptable that we would add an amendment to the  National Defense Authorization Act that not only has nothing to do with  national defense, but this actually hurts our national defense by  empowering adversaries like Russia with their uranium production while  limiting our own domestic national production of uranium.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
