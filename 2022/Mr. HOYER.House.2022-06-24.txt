 Mr. Speaker, for years, the gun violence epidemic in our  country has forced us to cope with immeasurable grief and loss.   Throughout America, many communities have begun to erect memorials to  remember those they have lost through gun violence. These monuments are  not much different than those right outside The National Mall that  honor Americans killed in war.   Just last week, people in San Bernardino, California, unveiled the  Curtain of Courage made of steel and bronze to pay tribute to the 16  people who were murdered at a mass shooting there in 2015.   In Newtown, Connecticut, a planned memorial will feature a spiral of  granite inscribed with the names of 20 children and 6 teachers killed  at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012.    Memorials are being built or planned, as well, to honor those who  died in shootings in Charleston, Orlando, Las Vegas, El Paso, Buffalo,  Uvalde, and many others.   The best way to honor those we have lost to gun violence, however, is  not with bronze, steel, or granite. Rather, it is with meaningful  action to prevent others from suffering the same fate.   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was overwhelmingly passed  by the United States Senate, and which I am pleased to bring to the  floor today, is a step in the right direction to take action.   This legislation includes measures that will reduce the threat of gun  violence and save lives across the country. It will help implement red  flag laws that empower law enforcement officers to keep guns out of the  hands of people at risk of using them to harm themselves or others.  Closing the so-called boyfriend loophole in this bill will prevent  people convicted of domestic abuse in a dating relationship from  possessing deadly firearms. If they have displayed violence, they ought  to be prohibited from getting weapons  [[Page H5908]]  that will make mass violence more probable and possible. It will also  require more thorough background checks for Americans under the age of  21 who seek to purchase a gun.   We passed expanded background checks through this House, and 85  percent of the American people say they are for that--and that is the  minimum--but no action has been taken in the United States Senate. They  have taken some action, and some action is better than no action.   Additionally, this legislation includes $250 million in funding for  community-based violence prevention programs.   Do we not want to see community violence diminished?   It will also crack down on those who make straw purchases, purchases  of guns that otherwise, under the existing system, could not be  purchased by the ultimate user of those guns.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator Murphy, Judiciary Committee Chairman  Jerry Nadler, Representative Lucy McBath, Representative Robin Kelly,  Chairman   Mike Thompson of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and  those Republicans who said that ``NRA'' does not stand for ``no  Republican action.'' They took action. They stood up, even in the face  of boos from their own party.   This legislation, as I said, is a step forward. That is how we make  progress in America, a step at a time.   None of us have had the opportunity ever to vote on a perfect bill in  this House. We vote on good bills that we feel will move our country  forward. This is that kind of bill, a step forward but not enough.   Many of us feel that we need to do more. We need to do comprehensive  background checks. We need to close the Charleston loophole. We sent  those bills to the Senate.   We can and must do more.   Yesterday, the Supreme Court issued a ruling that will weaken  commonsense gun safety laws all over the country. Yes, we can return to  the O.K. Corral and everybody having a six-shooter on their hip.  Anybody who thinks that would make us a safer, more civil community I  think is sadly mistaken. That fact ought to disturb all of us very  deeply.   The Court's decision to make it even easier for bad actors to carry  dangerous concealed guns without restrictions should serve as a  reminder that we need to take additional active steps to protect our  communities and our kids, actions that are supported by the  overwhelming majority of the American people.   If we fail to do that, if we allow this legislation to be the end  instead of the beginning, parents will continue to receive that  dreaded, unfathomable call that they will never see their children  again, and new monuments honoring victims will continue to pop up in  communities across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my House colleagues, Republicans and Democrats,  conservatives and liberals, we don't need additional memorials. We need  action, and we need new laws.   If we can follow today's legislation with action on comprehensive  background checks and further gun safety measures, however, future  generations--perhaps it is not guaranteed, but it is certainly worth  the effort to reduce the gun violence and to reduce the need for  memorials.                                time  1200    If we do not, then those who come after will wonder why their  forebears allowed such violence to be perpetrated uniquely in America.   Mr. Speaker, you don't find this in other countries--democratic  countries and free countries--that protect individual rights.   Mr. Speaker, today, in just a few minutes, let us begin to end the  cycle of tragedy and inaction. Let us pass this bill and say: No more.   Let us pass it and then do more. Vote ``yes.''
