 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the NOTAM Improvement  Act.   I thank my friend from the great State of Minnesota, my friends  across the aisle, George, everyone here. I thank you all so much for  being here today.   Nearly 3 million people every day count on flights in the United  States to safely get them to where they need to go.   The Notice to Air Mission System is how we make sure that that will  happen. The system is how we tell pilots about possible hazards.   When the system gets all jacked up, flights can't take off. It is  just that simple. Back in January, planes across the country were  grounded for the first time since 2001 because of a damaged file in our  Notice to Air Mission database.   We need to prevent this from happening, Mr. Speaker. We need to  prevent it from happening again and also look at what other  improvements could be made.   Safety isn't a joke. It should be one of the Federal Aviation  Administration's top priorities, not worrying about over 4 ounces of  honey in your baggage.   This bill has bipartisan support, and there isn't any reason that it  shouldn't pass with overwhelming support now.   The reason the press isn't here is mainly because we are agreeing on  something, and we are working together, which is what this body is  supposed to be doing, dadgummit.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you all so much for allowing me to be here.
