 Mr. Speaker, today, I congratulate Virgin Islander  Aliyah  [[Page H4161]]  Boston, a college basketball player for the South Carolina Gamecocks,  on her win against UConn in the NCAA championship, leading the  Gamecocks to their second national championship.   Aliyah was also named the Wade Trophy winner, AP Women's College  Basketball Player of the Year, Naismith Defensive Player of the Year,  as well as the Women's National Player of the Year.   Go ahead, Aliyah. Thirty consecutive double-doubles.   Her love for basketball was inspired by her sister, nurtured by her  mother and father, the sacrifices that they have made and that she has  made to be the player that she is.   Hats off to her. We love her. The Virgin Islands is rooting for her  next year and every year to come.                            ____________________
