 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the  life of Bryan A. Strong, a caring husband, loving father, and dedicated  police officer with the Chicago Police Department.   Mr. Strong passed away from a heart attack on March 27, 2014. We  remember him for his compassion, sympathy, and love of life. As a  policeman, Mr. Strong put the needs of others above his own. He served  his community with pride, selflessness, and honor.   Mr. Strong leaves an admirable legacy in his community and family.  His son, Brian, and wife, Janette, remember him as their adventurous  best friend who filled their lives--and many others--with excitement  and love.   I am grateful for Mr. Strong's service. May his life and legacy serve  as an inspiration to all.   Thank you.                            ____________________
