 Mr. Speaker, I rise, again, today to demand that  Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg resign.   As we have outlined over the past weeks, Secretary Buttigieg is  simply not interested in doing his job as head of the DOT.   A leader's job is to roll up their sleeves, do the hard work, and  complete the mission for the people he is supposed to serve. Instead,  Mr. Buttigieg is focused on advancing woke, identity politics inside  that agency and in our culture.   As a trucker, I know that safety is a top priority, and Secretary  Buttigieg needs to be held accountable for neglecting that safety in  favor of a leftwing social agenda.   The industry this agency oversees doesn't work inside four walls. Our  offices are in the airways, the waterways, the railways, and out on the  roadways with you and your families. The Secretary doesn't even go  outside to visit with folks. Instead, he stays inside or goes on  vacation to think about skin color and gender instead of what matters.   It is not the place of the Secretary to carry out his social agenda  at the DOT. It is time for him to resign and to take that social agenda  outside of government.                            ____________________
