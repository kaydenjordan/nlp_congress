 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in support of my good friend and colleague's commonsense  measure, and I want to thank Representative Lee for her leadership and  her moral courage.   I also would just say we have heard a lot with respect to objections  around the process. Long before I got here, Representative Lee, as I  understand it, secured a similar amendment in an appropriations bill  just a few years ago. In the dead of night, the prior Speaker of the  House struck that amendment out of the bill, and I didn't hear many  process objections at that time from so many of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle. If folks want to have an honest debate, let's  have that honest debate.   For my part, I support this measure and what it represents. I believe  it is ultimately about the need to underscore to this administration  the constitutional limitations placed on its authority, a reminder that  is necessary because of this President's reckless foreign policy and  his refusal to engage Congress in the authorities placed with us by the  Founders.   This Chamber is often referred to as the ``people's House,'' elected  by the people, charged to represent the people and to govern for the  people. The Founders, the Framers, in their infinite wisdom, decided to  rest the solemn power to declare war with the Congress as the people's  House, and yet, for the better part of the last 18 years, this Chamber  has abdicated its traditional role.    Administration after administration has used this  authority to engage our Armed Forces in various conflicts around the  world.   It is time for Congress to return to its traditional role under our  constitutional structure. I support this measure. I encourage my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
