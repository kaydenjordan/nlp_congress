 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Captain  Gregory Ferry of Hooksett as November's Granite Stater of the Month for  his leadership m strengthening the partnership between New Hampshire's  law enforcement and the Special Olympics.   Captain Ferry recently retired from the New Hampshire State Police  after 25 years of dedicated service to the people of New Hampshire.  Known for going the extra mile to support his fellow officers in the  line of duty, Captain Ferry led outside of work as well. Throughout his  career, even while carrying out the full duties of a New Hampshire  State Trooper, Captain Ferry volunteered with the Special Olympics. He  has been involved in everything from handing out medals to the athletes  to the Law Enforcement Torch Run.   The Law Enforcement Torch Run helps bring awareness to the Special  Olympics. Captain Ferry would help his fellow officers run what is  called the ``Flame for Hope'' all across New Hampshire, for a total  distance of 550 miles. Since the run's inception 35 years ago, New  Hampshire law enforcement has raised more than $5.5 million for Special  Olympics, and for 25 of those 35 years, Captain Ferry was at its helm.   After 17 years of participating in the program, Captain Ferry decided  to get even more involved and was chosen as State police liaison to the  Special Olympics.   In this role, Captain Ferry oversaw the expansion of law  enforcement's partnership with the program, which included recruiting  more liaisons, expanding law enforcement's participation in the Summer  and Winter Games, and increasing fundraising efforts.   As a symbol of Captain Ferry's strong relationship with the program,  he was selected to represent New Hampshire at the 2019 Special Olympics  World Games in Abu Dhabi, where he participated in the Torch Run across  the United Arab Emirates. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity for  Captain Ferry to represent both New Hampshire law enforcement and the  Special Olympics program on the world stage.   Captain Ferry has said that the most rewarding part of his  involvement in the Special Olympics has been the special bonds that he  has formed with the athletes, which extend beyond the playing field. He  continues to keep in touch with some of the athletes on social media  and makes sure to give them a hug whenever he sees them outside of the  program.   Captain Ferry's daughter, Jillian, also happens to be a Special  Olympian. Her favorite event is bowling, and she has beaten dad on a  few occasions.   From serving as a public safety officer who went out of his way to  support his fellow officers and protect his community, to providing a  sense of security for the athletes in the Special Olympics program who  have learned to trust him, Captain Ferry has demonstrated what it means  to be a dedicated public servant.   Thank you, Captain Ferry, for your service to our great State, and I  wish you all the best in your future endeavors.                            ____________________
