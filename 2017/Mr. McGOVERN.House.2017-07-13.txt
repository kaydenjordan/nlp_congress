 Mr. Speaker, as the House considers the fiscal year  2018 National Defense Authorization Act this week, I would like to draw  attention to one provision that was left out of the bill: the Military  Hunger Prevention Act.   It is shameful that military families like lower ranking enlisted  servicemembers with larger households are among the 42 million  Americans suffering from food insecurity.   While up to 22,000 military households rely on SNAP, many military  families are unable to receive modest benefits due to an unintended  provision that counts certain housing allowances as income when  determining eligibility for SNAP.   To address this issue, I have joined with my friend, Representative  Susan Davis, on the bipartisan Military Hunger Prevention Act. I am  disappointed that this commonsense technical fix was left out of this  year's NDAA, and I plan to continue working with my colleagues and our  advocacy partners like MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger to move this  legislation forward.   We owe it to the families who have sacrificed so much for our country  to do all that we can to end hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama  for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, last night, the majority on the House  Rules Committee once again decided to exclude from debate 230  amendments to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act. That  means that half of the amendments submitted were rejected.   I can never understand why these amendments are denied the chance to  be debated by the full House. When I first came to Capitol Hill as an  aide to our former friend and colleague, Congressman Joe Moakley, the  Defense Authorization bill would often take up to a week for debate.  But even back then, it was one of the largest and most complex bills  debated, and certainly one of the most important from a national  security point of view.   The NDAA rule was also structured back then, but more in terms of the  amount of time permitted for debate. And many amendments receive 1  hour, half an hour, 20 minutes, even 2 hours of debate. Why? Because  they were about the important decisions and priorities facing our  national defense policy at the time.   But that is not the case today. Amendments are lucky to get 10  minutes of debate equally divided if they are lucky enough to be  debated at all. And the Defense bill takes up a total of maybe 2 days'  worth of debate, if that. No wonder, no wonder Members are frustrated  by this process.   This year, like every year for the past several years, important  issues, especially on war and peace, were left on the chopping block by  the Republicans.   They decided that the House should not debate two bipartisan  amendments that would make sure that nothing in the NDAA could be  construed as authorization to use force against the governments of  North Korea or Syria.   The Republican majority decided it is okay to debate a bigoted  amendment that prohibits medical treatment for transgender  servicemembers who are in transition, but they will not let the House  debate an amendment that just calls for a study, Mr. Speaker, on blood  donations from gay men.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, did you know that there is a provision in the NDAA that  sets up an entire new military service branch, the Space Corps? The  Pentagon doesn't want it; the Air Force doesn't want it; they say it is  premature, but an amendment by Mr. Turner, a Republican, to require the  Pentagon to report on the need to establish a Space Corps is not  included in this rule. I guess the Republican leadership doesn't want  the House to have a say and a debate on such a major change.   Mr. Amash led a bipartisan amendment to block the sale of cluster  munitions to Saudi Arabia. Last year, this amendment failed by just a  handful of votes. I guess that is why the Republicans on the Rules  Committee aren't about to let it come up for a debate and a vote this  year.   When it comes to sending our uniformed women and men into war, into  danger, where their very lives are at risk, the Rules Committee decided  that such amendments were not worth the House's time to debate.   Last night, Republicans on the Rules Committee denied the opportunity  for debate on a bipartisan amendment offered by myself and  Representatives Walter Jones, Barbara Lee, Tom Massie, John Garamendi,  Dan Kildee, and Peter Welch.   The amendment is very straightforward. If the President decides to  increase the level of U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan in fiscal  year 2018, then he would report to Congress on the purpose and mission  of those troops, how many were required, and how long they would be  there, and then Congress would vote to approve or disapprove that  escalation.   This would give the American people the voice they deserve when it  comes to sending our men and women in uniform into battle.   Mr. Speaker, the President and General Mattis just decided to send an  additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban, on top of  the 8,400 U.S. troops already there. That will bring the total number  of American troops there to more than 12,000.   Now, if they should decide that they want even more troops in  Afghanistan in fiscal year 2018, Congress should know why, and vote on  it.   We can't keep giving the administration a blank check and allow  America once again to go down the slippery slope of incremental  escalation over the next year or two. Congress needs to step up to the  plate and either approve or disapprove any renewed escalation in  Afghanistan. Isn't that amendment worth debating?   We are in year 16 of the war in Afghanistan. It is the longest war in  American history. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. Afghanistan is the  longest war in U.S. history. The costs are already in the hundreds of  billions of dollars, and the human cost to our troops, our veterans,  and their families have been enormous, yet Congress has not taken a  single vote, has not taken a single stand on this war for 16 years.  Most of the Members of this House weren't even here when that one and  only vote was taken.   So in the absence of debating an updated AUMF for Afghanistan, the  very least we can do is debate whether we will once again escalate our  military footprint in Afghanistan, but the Republican leadership of  this House doesn't agree.   Each year, the Republican leadership does everything it can to stop  any debate on these wars, and this year is no different. They will  allow some amendments on reports and a sense of Congress here and  there, but any amendment of substance that requires Congress to act is  denied.   Mr. Speaker, I want to advise my colleagues of one thing, and that  is, we are not an advisory commission. We are a legislative body. We  need to start doing our job.  [[Page H5776]]    Mr. Speaker, I have no problem with a report, but it won't be the  first time we have seen a report, whether on Afghanistan or Iraq or  Syria. Even the underlying bill calls for a strategy report on  Afghanistan and other conflicts, but Congress avoiding taking any  responsibility for continuing to send our servicemen and -women into  harm's way is absolutely shameful. Mr. Speaker, it is cowardice.   Every day, military families say good-bye to their loved ones as they  go into battle, placing themselves in harm's way to keep our country  safe, and Congress does nothing. All we do is kick the can down the  road and call for another report and then another report.   Mr. Speaker, we don't even act when the President actually does send  us an AUMF, the way President Obama did on Iraq and Syria and the war  against ISIS. We did nothing. We said we didn't like it, but we did  nothing. The Republican leadership complained that they didn't like it,  but then they never even tried to act on it or to write their own AUMF.  They would rather just stand on the sidelines, complain and criticize,  but do nothing, absolutely nothing, except stop other Members from  taking any action that might require the House to debate these wars.  Shame on all of us for allowing this to continue over and over and over  and over again.   Now, I am guessing that whenever the House takes up the Defense  appropriations bill, the Republican leaders will find a way to make  sure that the bipartisan-supported provision in that bill to sunset the  2001 AUMF on Afghanistan and vote on a new one within 8 months will  somehow disappear without a single Member of the House at large having  a chance to vote on it. Maybe we will get another report. And so it  goes on and on.   Mr. Speaker, there is nearly $700 billion authorized in this bill for  wars, for weapons systems, for military equipment, and for personnel,  all because Congress refuses to make hard choices. We can never seem to  find the money to take care of our own neighborhoods and schools. We  can't find the money to provide our citizens with better, more  affordable healthcare, or make sure that all our families can put food  on the table. We don't invest nearly enough in our roads and our  bridges, railways and transit systems. There is never enough money to  invest in a 21st century manufacturing base, provide training to  support the jobs of the future, or raise the Federal minimum wage to a  livable wage. We are told we don't have the money to take care of our  parks or to make sure that our air and water are drinkable and  breathable. We can't even seem to find the money to take care of our  senior citizens and our children, but when it comes to spending on war  or building more nuclear weapons, then magically we find trillions of  dollars to operate and spend.    We need to pay more attention, Mr. Speaker, to the choices we make  each year on how much spending our Nation really requires for its  national defense. I believe, at a minimum, Mr. Speaker, that Congress  needs to debate and vote on whether to keep sending more and more of  our military men and women to fight in endless wars.   And I have to say, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues, what the Rules  Committee did last night by shutting out debate was shameful.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.

Stated against:    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    When asked about this process that we are now dealing with this  morning, with respect to the Hartzler amendment, Speaker Ryan said:  ``It's a free process. It's open process. She can bring an amendment to  the floor if she wants to.''   Really? This is an open process? She should be able to bring an  amendment that we all think is discriminatory and, quite frankly,  bigoted, to the floor; yet amendments that we have tried to bring to  the floor that deal with the issue of war and whether or not we should  be in these endless wars are denied.   What kind of free process is that? Maybe it is a free process in  Russia, but it is not a free process in the United States of America.   This process is a sham. Fifty-two percent of the amendments that were  brought before the Rules Committee were rejected. You might want to  defend that process, but I don't.   The gentleman says that mission creep has occurred, and that we have  a responsibility here in this House. You are absolutely right we have a  responsibility. When are we going to live up to it?   And the Cole amendment, which I am happy to support, is a report. We  have had reports up to here that have been brought before the NDAA  process over the years. Enough. Time to do our job.   This is why people are cynical about Washington when they hear this  kind of doubletalk. Yeah, we get it. We are worried about mission  creep. Congress ought to do its job. And so what are we going to do?  Not do our job, but we will issue a report.   Come on, enough.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous  question, and I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative Pocan's Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild  National Skills Act, H.R. 2933, which will promote effective  apprenticeships that will give  [[Page H5778]]  students and workers the skills they need to find well-paying jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous materials, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss that proposal, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that I agree with  the gentleman from Alabama. This bill is about our national security  and about protecting our country, which makes it all the more puzzling  that the Republicans think this is an appropriate place to be debating  amendments on transgender issues. But anyway, they are in charge, so  they can do whatever they want to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), and I also congratulate him on becoming a new  dad.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to just take 1 minute to address something  the gentleman from Alabama raised a while ago, and that is: Why would  we be raising the issue of apprenticeships and workforce training as  part of the Defense Authorization bill.   There are a couple of reasons why. One is because we are routinely  blocked from bringing any meaningful legislation to the floor, and we  are routinely blocked from bringing amendments to the floor that I  think can help with this issue.   The gentleman mentioned the action we took in a bipartisan, unanimous  way on the issue of Perkins loans and a few other programs. Those are  important. But it is the beginning. We need to do much, much more in  this country. We need to be able to prepare a workforce that can meet  the needs of our manufacturers and be there for the jobs of tomorrow.  That is why we brought this up. That is why we are bringing it up in  this fashion.   I would just go one step further to say, when we talk about national  security, I think we ought to broaden that definition to include not  just the number of bombs we have, but the quality of life that our  people in this country enjoy: whether or not people have the security  of a job, whether they can afford a college education for their kids,  whether they can afford to buy a home, whether they can afford to put  food on the table.   We live in the richest country in the world, and there are 42 million  Americans who are hungry, and yet we somehow can't get the political  will to address that problem or fix some of these challenges.   We are going to take any opportunity we have to bring to the floor  serious ideas that we think will benefit the American people, uplift  the American people, and that is why I think that this bill that we are  trying to bring up, H.R. 2933, authored by my colleague, Mr. Pocan, is  appropriate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there is a theme that is developing on the Republican  side. We can always take it up at another time, at another time in the  future. We can do the NDAA bill and this. That is the whole point of  defeating the previous question. You can still debate the National  Defense Authorization Act, and you can bring up this other thing that  we think is of great value to workers in this country. It doesn't have  to be one or the other.   It is that same thinking when it comes to war. As I began this debate  talking about the war in Afghanistan and the fact that it is the  longest war in American history, we don't even talk about it here. We  don't even debate it here.   We ought to respect the men and women who we put in harm's way enough  to make it a priority in this Chamber, and we don't even talk about it.  We can't even bring amendments to the floor to deliberate on that. What  we are told is: Well, we will vote on a study, another study. After 16  years? That is the best we can do? Or we are told that it falls under  the jurisdiction of another committee.   Well, my friends on the Republican side are in charge. I am sorry to  say that, but you are.                                time  1345    And I don't know what is standing in your way from asking the  committees of jurisdiction or multiple committees to come together and  to actually present to this Chamber an AUMF for these wars. There is  nothing, other than the fact that you want to avoid an uncomfortable  vote for your Members.   Well, that is just too bad. War is a big deal. It ought to be a big  deal, and we ought to treat it more seriously than we are. And I will  repeat what I said at the beginning of this debate: What the Rules  Committee did last night was shameful; blocking germane amendments,  blocking serious amendments, to address an issue that, quite frankly,  we should have been talking about a long time ago.   Again, I regret that this is the rule that my Republican friends have  come up with. They can say they are proud of it. Quite frankly, I am  ashamed of it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, the war and the authorization that  the gentleman was talking about is 2001. We have been there for 16  years. In 2001 we were going after al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is gone. We are  now fighting the Taliban and propping up one of the most corrupt  governments in the world. Our mission continues to change.   The idea that we should be operating in Afghanistan under an AUMF  from 2001, that somehow nothing has changed, is ludicrous. And the idea  that we are using that authorization to justify our military operations  in Syria and a whole bunch of other places in the world is ludicrous.  Enough. Enough.   This Chamber needs to do its job, and this leadership needs to get  out of the way, and Members of Congress--Democrats and Republicans-- need to come together and debate these issues seriously.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Speier), a distinguished member of the Armed Services Committee's  Subcommittee on Military Personnel.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Congressional Record a letter from 14  conservative and liberal national organizations opposing a defense bill  that busts the budget caps.                                                      July 10, 2017.        Dear Representative McGovern: As organizations representing       Americans across the political spectrum, we are writing to       voice our strong opposition to attempts by Members of       Congress to increase the Pentagon's fiscal year 2018 budget       above both the budget caps set by the Budget Control Act and       the President's budget request. The Pentagon is currently       funded at a higher level than at almost any time since World       War II, and the budget problems it faces should be solved by       better fiscal management, not by adding more money to an       already bloated and wasteful department.        The challenges facing our military are partially the result       of years of failing to make the necessary, tough choices our       nation's security requires. Rather than prioritizing basic       needs of the warfighter, lawmakers have pursued huge,       expensive weapons systems that fail to meet technical       specifications and may never be ready for combat. Waste and       unnecessary overhead abound, with a Defense Business Board       study showing that the Department of Defense could save up to       $125 billion over five years just by eliminating excess       bureaucracy and inefficiencies.        Claims of a so-called ``readiness crisis'' are exaggerated.       As former DoD Comptroller Robert Hale said in February, these       claims are just the services ``putting their worst foot       forward'' in the hopes of securing funding increases. General       David Petraeus has also said that this idea of a readiness       crisis is a myth. By opposing important cost-saving measures       like base realignment and closure which could save several       billion dollars a year just by closing excess infrastructure,       Congress is demonstrating that it is not prioritizing fiscal       responsibility or making the choices that will actually keep       us safe. Moreover, the Pentagon cannot be sure what it is       spending as it is the only federal agency that has never       passed an audit.        Budgets necessitate tradeoffs. Pentagon spending increases       shortchange other important priorities, from domestic needs       including education, health and nutrition and affordable       housing, to paying down the national debt. Further increasing       the Pentagon's budget by tens of billions of dollars without       a clear strategy will do little to solve national security       challenges. Rather, it will simply guarantee further wasteful       spending at the Pentagon. We hope that you will oppose any       attempts to increase the Pentagon's budget for fiscal year       2018.            Sincerely,        American Friends Service Committee; Center for       International Policy; Coalition on Human Needs; Council for a       Livable World; Freedom Works; Friends Committee on National       Legislation; Iraq Veterans Against the War.

Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter to  all Representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union in  opposition to the Hartzler amendment, which it deems as discriminatory  and unconstitutional.                                 American Civil Liberties Union,                                      Washington, DC, July 13, 2017.      Vote NO on Hartzler Amendment No. 315 to the NDAA--          Discriminatory and Unconstitutional.         Dear Representative: The American Civil Liberties Union       (ACLU) is strongly opposed to Hartzler Amendment No. 315 to       the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018       (NDAA), H.R. 2810. This amendment would bar transgender       members of the Armed Forces and military families from       receiving appropriate and medically necessary health care.       This is a discriminatory, unconstitutional attack on       transgender service members and their families, plain and       simple. It should be overwhelmingly rejected by members of       the House of Representatives.        Barring access to appropriate and medically necessary       health care, including transition-related care, for       transgender service members and their families is not only       discriminatory, but runs counter to scientific evidence and       contemporary medical standards of care. It also puts the       health of certain service members at needless risk and       undermines the ability of military medical professionals to       provide necessary care for their patients.        There is a clear and overwhelming consensus among the       leading medical organizations--including the American Medical       Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the       American Psychological Association--that transition-related       care is safe, effective, non-experimental, and medically       necessary. If a military doctor determines that transition-      related care (e.g. hormone therapy) is medically necessary       for a transgender service member, then that treatment should       be provided just as it would be for any other medical       condition for any other service member.        Members of the House of Representatives should       overwhelmingly reject this discriminatory attempt to deny       necessary health care to certain service members and their       families. All of the members of our Armed Forces willingly       put their lives on the line in defense of our nation. The       least that Congress can do is ensure that the health care       needs of our service members and their families are being       met.        Accordingly, the ACLU is strongly opposed to Hartzler       Amendment No. 315 to the NDAA and urges all members to vote       NO on it.        Please contact Ian Thompson, legislative representative.            Sincerely,      Faiz Shakir,        National Political Director.      Ian Thompson,        Legislative Representative.     Mr. Speaker, it is ironic to me that we have time to  debate a bill that discriminates against transgender members of the  Armed Forces and military families, but we can't find the time to  debate war. It really is sad. It is a sad commentary on the way the  Rules Committee conducted itself last night.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman believes that what we are doing in  Afghanistan is consistent with what was envisioned 16 years ago, he can  go on thinking that, but it isn't. And if he thinks it is okay that  that authorization is used to justify every military involvement we  have all around the world, he can go ahead and think that way. I think  he is very much mistaken.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has to stop kicking the can down the road. It  is unconscionable that the Republican leadership continues to prevent  meaningful debate on these wars. But let me say one thing about why our  House colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, keep bringing these  issues up, despite the opposition from the Republican leadership. And  that is because it is our job.   The American people sent us to Washington to debate the uncomfortable  issues and to take difficult votes. Now, there were some in Congress-- maybe my friend is included in that--who think that it is acceptable to  give this administration a blank check to continue these endless wars.  Why anybody--no matter who is President, but especially with this  President--would feel comfortable giving him a blank check is beyond my  comprehension.   There are others who would like to end them and bring our servicemen  and -women home. And then there are others who look for a different  policy somewhere between these two positions. This is why we need to  debate these wars. This is why we need to bring updated AUMFs to the  floor for a vote.   If that is a debate that you would rather not have, if that is a vote  that you would rather not take, then Mr. Speaker, let me suggest that  you should look for a new job. You should go into a different vocation.   I am sure that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that  protecting the lives and well-being of our uniform men and women is one  of the highest priorities, if not the highest priorities, of this  Congress. But they deserve more than a ``thank you'' on Veterans Day.   We do not respect their service and sacrifice and that of their  families when we refuse to debate and take any responsibility for  sending them year after year into war. They deserve a thoughtful,  reasoned, and engaged debate. They deserve a debate. They deserve a  little attention in this Chamber, not excuses and not more reports and  not more, ``We will get to it in the future.''   And that is why, along with many of my Republican and Democratic  colleagues, we will continue to demand that the Republican leadership  of this House allow a debate and a vote on the future of these wars.   I just want to say, finally, Mr. Speaker, I have been raising this  issue not just when Republicans have been President, but when Democrats  have been President. I really believe that Congress has forfeited its  constitutional responsibilities. We have abrogated our constitutional  responsibilities. We have acquiesced time and time again to Democratic  and Republican administrations when it comes to war.   We can't allow that to happen. That is not responsible governing. We  have an obligation to make sure that whatever we are doing with regard  to our military, that it is the right thing to do.   The idea that we once again come to the floor with the National  Defense Authorization bill and we are told we cannot debate any of  these things, we can't vote on any of these things, I mean, give me a  break. What are you thinking? Why is this such a big, difficult thing  to overcome with the leadership?   Again, if my friends don't want to take uncomfortable votes, then do  something else. Don't vote. But it is not the right thing to do. We  should be ashamed of this process. There is no justifying shutting out  debate on war.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to defeat the previous  question and vote ``no'' on the underlying bill, and vote ``no'' on the  rule, too.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I will not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Cole amendment.  I am a great admirer of the gentleman from Oklahoma. We have worked  together on several bipartisan letters to Speaker Ryan asking that the  Speaker bring to the House floor an AUMF to address the fight against  the Islamic State in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. I value the  gentleman's leadership and desire to find common ground with Members on  both sides of the aisle.   But it is frustrating, Mr. Chairman, to know that this amendment was  made in order while every other amendment to require the House to take  concrete action on these wars were denied their right to debate.   Maybe my good friend from Oklahoma is right and Congress has to take  baby steps. It needs yet another report on Afghanistan, Iraq, and  Syria. Its Committees on Foreign Affairs and Armed Services need to be  ordered to hold hearings with the Secretaries of Defense and State to  review these matters.   But what then?   According to this amendment, nothing.   Now, I have had my fill of Congress doing nothing. I admire the  gentleman from Oklahoma. I support his amendment. But I am sick and  tired of reports. After 16 years in Afghanistan, we need a debate on  the future of U.S. military engagement there, and we need it now.   The gentleman said ``sooner or later.'' Well, after 16 years, we have  already arrived at sooner and later. After  [[Page H5807]]  6 years of military operations in Iraq and Syria, we need to vote on an  AUMF to address the fight against the Islamic State, and we need it  now.   How much longer will Congress keep sending our brave servicemen and - women to war while it sits on its hands back here in Washington safe  and sound?   So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, but I demand that  the House Republican leadership find the courage to act on these  matters now. Our troops and their families deserve more than silence  from a Congress that has no qualms about sending them to war but fails  to have the political courage to take a vote.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), who is the distinguished ranking member of the  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff).    Mr. Chairman, I always enjoy hearing the gentleman talk  about this. When we agree on things, it is always pleasant. I commend  the gentleman from Oklahoma for this amendment because I think it is  important that we move forward, even if it is a small step forward.   As I said initially, I am frustrated. I know Mr. Schiff is  frustrated, and a lot of other people are frustrated who had amendments  that were perfectly germane to this bill that I think should have been  debated and that many of us think they are long overdue.   Mr. Chairman, 16 years in Afghanistan is an awful long time. Some of  us fear that these wars are becoming endless. They are essentially on  automatic pilot. We don't give the attention that I think is  appropriate to what is happening, especially given the fact that so  many brave men and women have their lives on the line on behalf of our  country.   But beyond that, this AUMF in Afghanistan that has now been going on  for 16 years has also been used to justify what we are doing in Syria,  what we are doing in Iraq, in Somalia, and I could go on and on. This  is ludicrous.                                time  1815    As the gentleman from Oklahoma knows, before we began to get sucked  in militarily in Syria, some of us tried to have a debate on an AUMF in  Syria, because we thought the time to debate an AUMF, the time to  debate military action, actually should be before we get involved.   Once we are involved, it is a lot harder to have these debates and to  raise the questions that are so important as to whether or not some of  these interventions are actually the right thing to do. But we skirted  that issue, and we continue to put this on the back burner.   As I said, I have no objection to this amendment. I support this  amendment. I just think we are at a point where we should be doing much  more. We are much further along than to just require a report or to  mandate hearings. I am concerned that after these reports and these  hearings are done, then what? The gentleman's amendment doesn't require  that Congress take up an AUMF or that we actually have to have a vote  in so many days or so many months.   So I look forward to working with the gentleman to make sure that not  only are these reports and these hearings conducted as we all want them  to be, but to continue to press this leadership to do the right thing:  to not give away Congress' constitutional responsibilities and to do  what is right by the men and women who sacrifice so much for our  country.   There are only a small group of people who are directly impacted by  these wars, and that is the men and women who are fighting and their  families. The rest of us are asked to do basically nothing. I think  that Congress has shirked its responsibility. We can't tolerate that.   I hope there is a big, strong bipartisan, if not unanimous vote, for  the gentleman's amendment, but this is just the first teeny step in  what we need to do. I promise him that he has my cooperation in any  efforts to get it to the point where we actually debate these wars and  develop AUMFs where people, as he said, can vote for them or against  them.   My view of what we should be doing, I know, is very different from  the gentleman from Oklahoma, and perhaps even different from the  gentleman from California, but that is the kind of genius and the  wonder of this place. We can all have different points of view, and we  can even differ, but at the end of the day, the majority decides.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Cole amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
