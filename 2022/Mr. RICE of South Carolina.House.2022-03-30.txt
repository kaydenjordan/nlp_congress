 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  my bill, H.R. 5343, the FEMA Caseworker Accountability Act.   South Carolina's Seventh District is still recuperating from disaster  after disaster. We experienced four flooding events in 8 years.   Over the years, I have learned some tough lessons. We have  continuously heard and seen how case management staff turnover rates at  FEMA have extended the process for our communities to receive the  assistance they need after a disaster.   Sometimes it takes 4 or 5 years for FEMA to get people back in their  homes, and it is far too long because, unfortunately, the people who  are disproportionately affected by these disasters are people of low  income and minorities. They lose everything that they had, what little  they had, and they can't wait for 5 years for the government to  respond.   I have heard complaints from disaster victims to local officials  about the lack of coordination due to the high turnover rates at FEMA.  This disorganization causes significant delays in processing claims and  reimbursement of essential funds.   This bill will increase the transparency at FEMA following a disaster  by requiring a report on their employees' turnover rate. It also  requires a report to include the average length of employment for staff  who are assigned to work on disaster recoveries.   FEMA must be held accountable to our communities and our taxpayers  who rely on them following a disaster.   I thank Representative Mace and Resident Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon  for their support on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.
