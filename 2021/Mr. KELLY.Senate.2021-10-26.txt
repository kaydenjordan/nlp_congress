 Madam President, as you know, in Arizona, we have always  admired Cindy McCain's dedication to service and to our country. I know  she believes deeply in the power of America to promote peace, security,  and health around the world, which will serve her and our country well  in her next position.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider Calendar No. 457 and  that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or  debate.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all without intervening action  or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that  any statements related to the nomination be printed in the Record; and  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
