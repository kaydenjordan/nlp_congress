 Madam President, today the Senate will begin  considering the VA MISSION Act. It marks a major step forward for the  VA system and the millions of heroes who rely on it for services.   The bipartisan reform legislation before us builds on the earlier  progress of the Veterans Choice Act of 2014 and reaffirms a clear  message: Delays at the VA cannot stand between veterans and the medical  care they need. The shortcomings of a Federal bureaucracy do not free  our Nation from its promises to our All-Volunteer Armed Forces.  Veterans deserve prompt, thorough care, period.   In the few short years since the creation of VA Choice, the program  has seen important success. More than 2 million veterans have taken the  opportunity to see private providers when the VA system couldn't meet  their needs. In Kentucky, it helped more than 23,000 veterans in 2017  alone.   Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Isakson, this new legislation  builds on this significant progress, continues it, and improves it in  ways that will help veterans even more.   The VA MISSION Act will clear the path for veterans to receive  greater healthcare choices. It will eliminate the wait time and  distance requirements that keep veterans out of the driver's seat and  empower them, in consultation with their respective physicians, to take  charge of their own care. It will help prioritize and speed  improvements to existing VA facilities. It will direct $5.2 billion to  fund the Veterans Choice Program, and it will establish more  streamlined delivery of care through the veterans community care  program.   The bill before us passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan  margin. It carries the support of the President and 38 veterans  advocacy organizations. It is based on a simple idea: Promises made to  those who sacrifice for our freedoms must be promises kept. Let's make  good on these promises this week.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, this morning, the  Environment and Public Works Committee is concluding its work on  America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018.   Chairman Barrasso has led an open, bipartisan process that has  generated a strong proposal. It builds on President Trump's  infrastructure approach, encouraging local control over local  priorities and leveraging Federal resources to ensure that each dollar  spent goes to major water infrastructure improvements. It cuts redtape  and empowers the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to break through  bureaucratic backlogs.   Thanks to Senator Boozman, it enhances the investments in our  Nation's failing drinking water and waste water infrastructure.   My State of Kentucky contains more than 1,900 miles of navigable  inland waterways. Our water resources support more than 13,000 jobs in  the maritime industry. Paducah, KY, serves as the heart of America's  inland waterways system, and Western Kentucky is also home to major  water civil works projects like the Olmsted Locks and Dam and Kentucky  Lock.   This bipartisan legislation is good news for communities throughout  the Commonwealth. One provision, the Freedom to Fish Act, will help  safeguard an important part of Kentucky's cultural heritage.  Generations of Kentuckians have fished the Cumberland River and the  tailwaters of the Barkley and Wolf Creek Dams.   I remember my dad and his friend taking us to fish there at a young  age. They were experienced fishermen. The last thing they needed was  advice from Federal bureaucrats on where to cast their lines, but, in  2012, in a typical display of Obama administration overreach, the Army  Corps threatened to restrict access to these cherished waters. I didn't  know anyone in Kentucky who thought it was a good idea. The farmers  didn't, the anglers didn't, the area businesses relying on fishing  tourism didn't. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife certainly  didn't. So I worked with community leaders like my friend Lyon County  [[Page S2802]]  judge executive Wade White and my colleagues in the Kentucky and  Tennessee congressional delegations to put a stop to this government  interference. We introduced legislation to prevent the Army Corps from  robbing our fishers and anglers of this beloved pastime and damaging  this key component of the local economy. The measure passed with  overwhelming support and was signed into law. It has been successful,  but its provisions are set to expire soon.   That is why I worked with Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper,  and the committee to secure a new  5-year extension of the Freedom to Fish Act in this year's water  infrastructure bill. It is just another achievement among the many  victories this bill will deliver for communities across the country.   I am grateful to the supporters of this legislation, such as the  National League of Cities and the National Rural Water Association, and  the bipartisan coalition of Senators who worked to craft it. I look  forward to the committee's vote today and to supporting this bill once  it reaches the Senate floor.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, one final matter. This week,  survey data showed that more Americans say it is a good time to find a  quality job than at any point in the last 17 years.   Let me say that again. More Americans say it is a good time to find a  quality job than at any point in the last 17 years.   Under President Obama, this number got as low as 8 percent. It never  broke 50 percent during his administration, but today 67 percent of  Americans say it is a good time to find a quality job.   Optimism has taken off for all groups since this President was  elected and the Republican Congress was sworn in, but the injection of  new hope has been felt the most among working-class Americans. This is  a major distinction between the economic policies Democrats spent years  putting in place and the new approach this Republican government has  taken.   For nearly a decade, Democrats followed the standard liberal  playbook: tax more, regulate more, and pile up more money and power  right here in Washington. They cracked down on American businesses,  imposed one new regulation after another, and looked to the Federal  Government to pick winners and losers.   It is a familiar, old set of ideas. Here is what it produces: an  economy that works very well for a few but leaves many more behind.   The Obama era was just fine for our Nation's biggest coastal cities.  Roughly, three-quarters of all the new jobs created between 2010 and  2016 poured into the country's largest metropolitan areas, but outside  of these places, taxes and regulations created an anti-business climate  that hurt American manufacturing, American coal communities, and small-  and medium-sized businesses throughout our country.   So Republicans charted a new course. We understand that middle-class  families know how to spend their own money better than the government;  that American workers thrive when American job creators are expanding,  hiring, and raising wages. We passed once-in-a-generation tax relief  for American families and small businesses and are working at every  turn to roll back runaway regulations. The result is an economic  comeback that is reaching all kinds of communities, not just a favored  few.   A record-high percentage of American manufacturers have said they  have a positive economic outlook for their enterprises. Rural  communities outpaced everywhere else in relative job creation last  year. The total amount spent on employee compensation grew faster in  2017 than in any calendar year under President Obama.   This is what happens when Republicans implement a pro-growth, pro- opportunity agenda that gets Washington out of the way. Everyone shares  in the prosperity.                            ____________________     Madam President, as our Nation pauses on Memorial Day  to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our Nation  safe and to protect the liberties we hold dear, I would like to join  the residents of Park Hills in recognizing one distinguished  Kentuckian. John H. Klette, Jr., a centenarian veteran of the Second  World War, will be honored as the grand marshal in the community's  Memorial Day parade.   Soon after the United States entered World War II, Klette enlisted at  the age of 24 to help defeat Nazi Germany. A practicing attorney and a  licensed pilot, he chose to join the Army Air Corps--the precursor of  the Air Force--and passed the necessary exams that same day. After  months of training, he was assigned as a pilot in the 32nd Bombardment  Squadron of the 301st Bombardment Group and was sent to southern Italy.  Klette's first mission to Bucharest, Romania, saw significant enemy  resistance, and his aircraft suffered serious damage. That fight would  [[Page S2828]]  not be the last time Klette saw danger in the line of duty.   To this day, he remembers what he calls the worst mission of his  career. Overcome by dozens of persistent enemy craft, Klette's plane  was in a dire state. With low oxygen and fires onboard, the crew  resisted wave after wave of enemy fighters destroying or damaging  several of the enemy craft. Showing tremendous courage in the face of  incredible danger, Klette and his team completed their mission and  returned to their base.   In recognition of their intrepid actions, the entire crew was awarded  the Silver Star, the third highest combat decoration awarded by the  Armed Forces. Klette was only 25 at the time. Throughout World War II,  Klette flew 51 missions, finishing his last on Thanksgiving Day in  1944.   As a member of the Greatest Generation determined to serve his  Nation, Klette entered the Reserves after World War II. He was called  back to Active Duty and served for nearly 2 years in Korea. Flying 50  combat missions in that conflict, Klette totaled more than 100 missions  during his military career.   After officially leaving military service in 1952, Klette returned to  northern Kentucky to practice law with his father in Covington. Still  practicing law to this day--now with his daughter as a partner--Klette  has been an active member of his community, serving on the board of  multiple civic organizations.   As the grand marshal of the Park Hills Memorial day parade, Klette  will receive the recognition and gratitude that he deserves. Because of  his years of dedication to our Nation in uniform, I am proud to join  with the Park Hills community to honor his gallant service and  sacrifice. I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to help me thank  John Klette.   (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing the production of testimony and representation  by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for  testimony in a criminal action pending in Colorado State court. In this  action, the defendant is charged with trespass for refusing to leave  Senator Gardner's Colorado Springs office. A forthcoming evidentiary  hearing and trial is expected to be scheduled shortly in the Municipal  Court of Colorado Springs, Colorado.   The defendant in this case is seeking testimony from Andrew Merritt,  Senator Gardner's State Director, who was present during some of the  events at issue. Senator Gardner would like to cooperate with this  request.   The enclosed resolution would authorize the production of testimony  from Mr. Merritt and representation by the Senate Legal Counsel of  current and former Members, officers, and employees of the Senate.                            ____________________
