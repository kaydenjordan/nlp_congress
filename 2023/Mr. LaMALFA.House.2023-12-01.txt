 Madam Speaker, if you want to look in the dictionary  under the word ``boondoggle,'' you would probably find the California  High-Speed Rail project.   It was passed in 2008 by a narrow majority with $9 billion worth of  State funding by the taxpayers for this project to connect L.A. to San  Francisco.   Fifteen years later, they still haven't laid any track. They have  interrupted the flow of towns up and down the Central Valley and have  put some causeways in so far, but many billions have been spent, and it  is woefully over time. It was supposed to be completed by 2020.   They are going to seek more and more Federal funding. It started out  to be a $33 billion project, and now it is a $128 billion project. At  most, they would identify $20 billion worth of funding. They are going  to come here looking for the rest of it.   Instead, why don't we invest in something that can help all  Americans, such as food supply and building water storage in  California. That would help all Americans, not a boondoggle running up  and down the valley stopping at an almond orchard near Bakersfield.  That is why I am seeking to get help for Sites Reservoir, raising  Shasta Dam, and other water projects that will grow the food that  Americans use from California.                            ____________________
