 Mr. President, first, I was saddened by today's news  that our former colleague, the Senator from North Carolina, Kay Hagan,  had passed away. During her time representing the people of North  Carolina, Kay was exactly that--a gentle lady. She paired an earnest  commitment to public service with a friendly and collegial approach. I  know Members of both sides of the aisle will fondly remember serving  alongside her in the Senate, and her perseverance in the face of  serious illness these recent years was inspiring.   Today the prayers of this entire body are with Kay's husband, Chip;  their children, Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie; and with all of their  family and friends at this extremely difficult time.                        Death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi    Mr. President, on a completely different matter, on Sunday morning,  we woke up to a better and safer world because one monster was no  longer in it. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was the founder and leader of ISIS.  In recent years, that made him the single most important target in the  fight against radical Islamic terrorism.   His band of fanatics has committed heinous crimes, shed an  unimaginable amount of civilian blood, and destabilized an entire  region. ISIS has been party to a civil war in Syria that has claimed  hundreds of thousands of innocent lives. They have run slave auctions  of women and girls and effected a genocide of the Yazidi people.   Across a swath of Syria and Iraq, ISIS established a so-called  caliphate, imprisoned entire communities, slaughtered vulnerable  minority populations, destroyed priceless cultural relics, and imposed  their will through brute force on anyone they deemed insufficiently  pious. Across the globe,  [[Page S6180]]  their message of hate has spurred further acts of violence--in Europe,  in Africa, and even here on American soil.    So Americans applauded President Trump's announcement yesterday  morning that a heroic mission had eliminated the chief instigator of  all this violence. We owe a debt of thanks to the men and women of our  intelligence community for taking grave risks, cultivating key  partnerships in the region, and laying the groundwork for a swift and  precise operation.   Of course, we are hugely grateful to the U.S. military personnel who  executed the strike. Our Nation calls upon elite Special Operations  units to take on missions of the utmost sensitivity. Their bravery and  professionalism continue to make us all proud.   My fellow Kentuckians and I are especially proud of Lt. Gen. Scott  Howell, a Cadiz, KY native, is currently leading the Joint Special  Operations Command and oversaw this daring mission.   Lieutenant General Howell is a career Air Force pilot who has spent  his career deploying with and commanding Special Operations forces. Our  Nation is lucky to have this son of the Bluegrass serving where he is.   I commend President Trump, Secretary Esper, and the entire  administration team for making the tough call to act on our  intelligence and send U.S. Forces into the breach. That decision is  never easy, but it was the right one. It was a total operational  success.   This victory offers us an important strategic reminder about the  value of our Nation's investment in advanced military capabilities,  American military presence abroad, and deep relationships with foreign  allies and local security partners. Without such factors, operations  such as this become much more risky.   The name of this terrorist is now headed straight for the trash bin  of history. There are other names I would like for us to remember today  instead:   Peter Kassig, born and raised in Indianapolis, a former Army Ranger  turned humanitarian worker in the Middle East. ISIS beheaded him in  2014. He was 26 years old.   Steven Sotloff, a grandson of Holocaust survivors born in Florida and  a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel. He was a journalist who worked  with refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. He was kidnapped by ISIS  and beheaded in 2014.   James Foley grew up in New Hampshire. He spent 4 years as an embedded  correspondent in Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria before his capture by  ISIS. After 2 years of captivity and torture, he, too, was beheaded in  2014.   Kayla Mueller from Arizona, whom ISIS kidnapped in Aleppo in 2013.  Kayla's Christian faith had led her to humanitarian work. She was  brutalized by ISIS leaders and then killed in 2015, at the age of 26.  This weekend's operation was code-named in Kayla's honor.   Today we remember these brave Americans and all the courageous U.S.  servicemembers and DOD civilians who gave their lives to fight ISIS. In  their memories, we are glad justice has been done. In their memories,  we resolve not to back down but to persist in this fight until we have  secured the enduring defeat of this dangerous and determined enemy.                             Trump Administration    Mr. President, on another matter, on Thursday, the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee and I introduced a resolution, which quickly gained  dozens of Republican cosponsors. Our resolution states two things,  which are very obvious. No. 1, any process as serious as an impeachment  inquiry, which seeks to cancel out the American people's vote in a  Presidential election, must adhere to the highest standards of fairness  and due process, and, No. 2, what we have seen on display from House  Democrats has been anything but that.   Here is the way House Democrats have conducted their inquiry so far.  Committees at the center of the inquiry have denied President Trump  important rights and protections that President Nixon and President  Clinton enjoyed. They have impeded his right to have counsel attend  hearings and depositions, call and cross-examine witnesses, and even  access the evidence they are producing.   Democrats are also flouting past practices that gave minority parties  basic procedural rights during past impeachments. House Republicans  have not been granted subpoena power, and their participation in  closed-door proceedings has been severely limited.   It is no secret that Washington Democrats have been looking for a way  to remove President Trump since his inauguration, but that does not  remove the basic requirements of fairness and due process.   That is what our resolution makes clear. I am proud to sponsor it,  along with Chairman Graham.                                Appropriations    Mr. President, on a related matter, Washington Democrats have been  insisting that their 3-year-old impeachment journey will not keep them  from attending to the people's business. Well, we will have an  opportunity to find out later this week when the Senate votes on  advancing funding for our Armed Forces.   You will recall that last month, our Democratic colleagues made the  stunning decision to filibuster legislation to fund our national  defense. They blocked resources for our men and women in uniform. They  blocked the funding our commanders need to keep us safe in this  dangerous time. And that wasn't enough. They blocked a pay raise for  the men and women in uniform. Democrats filibustered all of this for  the sake of picking a fight with the White House. Think about that. Can  our colleagues be so ruled by partisan politics that they would rather  leave the U.S. military in limbo than get along with President Trump  for 2 minutes--for 2 minutes?   Obviously this cannot continue. Our commanders need funding. Our men  and women in military need support. Congress needs to do its job. So  later this week, the Senate is going to vote again, one more time, to  advance defense funding. We will complete the domestic appropriations  we are currently considering, including voting on certain amendments,  and then we will turn back to defense. This will present a crystal- clear test: Do our Democratic colleagues mean it when they say they  want to legislate or not--there is no more important legislation than  this--or is their impeachment obsession crowding out critical  priorities?   Imagine the spectacle if the same Senate Democrats who give lengthy  speeches criticizing the administration's actions in Syria and the  Middle East literally block the funding our commanders need to keep up  the missions. Imagine the embarrassment if Senate Democrats filibuster  funding for our men and women in uniform just days after this past  weekend's heroics, just days after the whole country was reminded that  our brave servicemembers risk everything every day, and their missions  do not wait for Washington politics. Imagine the supreme irony if the  same Democrats who want to impeach the President for supposedly  delaying military assistance for Ukraine literally themselves delay  military assistance for Ukraine by blocking the funding legislation.   I urge my friends across the aisle to do the right thing. The whole  country knows that Washington Democrats are not members of President  Trump's fan club. We get that. We understand that. But there is no  reason why money to fight ISIS, money to pay and supply our  servicemembers, and, yes, money for military assistance for Ukraine  ought to be used as Democrats' political pawns.   Enough is enough. We need to move forward with the Defense funding  bill this week.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the Shelby substitute amendment No. 948.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the underlying bill.    I move to proceed to Calendar No. 140, H.R. 2740.    I send a cloture motion to the desk for the motion to  proceed.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  calls be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session and the consideration of the following  nomination, Executive Calendar No. 467.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order; and that any statements relating to the  nomination be printed in the Record and the Senate resume legislative  session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  S. 134 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the Toomey amendment at  the desk be agreed to, and the bill, as amended, be considered read a  third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked,  the filing deadline for the first-degree amendments to the Shelby  substitute amendment No. 948, and the underlying bill, H.R. 3055, be at  2:30 p.m. tomorrow.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  October 29; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in day,  morning business be closed, and the Senate resume consideration of H.R.  3055; finally, that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m.  to allow for the caucus meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:54 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, October 29, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
