 Mr. President, I do appreciate the leadership on the  Intelligence Committee and for the leadership that has been there.   I would concur. You have a spot to be able to lead and a task to be  able to be done. You have studied this, so that must mean you know it.  We look forward to your leadership in the days ahead. I appreciate that  very much.                                National Debt    Mr. President, I do want to speak on a very different subject as  well, and it is a subject that we are all going to face in the days  ahead. It is this wonderful issue of a government shutdown.   We seem to forget, at times in this body, the issues that press  around us, but the one that seems to get slipped under the rug most of  the time is that of national debt: where we are and how we are going to  try to address this in the days ahead. The conversation comes up--it  seems to be on a regular basis now--about are we going to have a  government shutdown; and the conversation of a government shutdown ends  up being a very small portion of the very large debt that we face.   The challenge is, how do we actually address that based on its size?  Well, let me just give you a little bit of context as to what I am  talking about.   We are, right now, preparing, within days, to cross into $33 trillion  in total Federal debt--$33 trillion. To give some context of that  acceleration of Federal debt and what is happening during this time  period, from the time of Andrew Jackson--who was the last President who  was President when we had no debt at all. From the time of Andrew  Jackson until Ronald Reagan, our Nation accumulated $1 trillion in  total debt. From Andrew Jackson to Reagan, there was $1 trillion in  total debt. From Reagan to the present, now we are $33 trillion in  total debt. We are in a rapid acceleration of debt that has not slowed.   To give you again the picture of where things have gone just in the  last several years, if you go back 20 years ago to 2003, our total  spending was just over $2 trillion. If you go back to 2013, which was  10 years ago, our total spending was less than $3.5 trillion. Our  spending this year will be right at $6.5 trillion. So in the past 20  years, our spending has increased from just over $2 trillion to $6.5  trillion.   To give you the acceleration in spending just in the last few years,  if I were to go back to 2018--before COVID, the 2018 time period--our  total spending was just over $4 trillion. This year's estimated  spending is just under $6.5 trillion. That is $2.5 trillion of  accelerated spending just from 2018 until now. Again, to set this in  context, the revenue that is coming into the Federal Treasury this year  is estimated at $4.8 trillion--$4.8 trillion. We are spending an  estimated $6.4 trillion.   Now, I know these are a lot of numbers, but let me give you one just  as a takeaway. We have almost $1.5 trillion of deficit--that is,  overspending--just this year. By some estimates, depending on what  happens in the next few weeks, it could be almost $2 trillion in total  overspending just this year.   To put this in context, with the record revenue that is coming in  this year at about $4.8 trillion, if we were spending the same this  year as we did in 2018, which is a short 5 years ago--if we were  spending the same this year as we were in 2018, prior to COVID, we  would have a $700 billion surplus this year rather than an almost $2  trillion deficit this year. Because of the record amount of revenue  coming in this year compared to what our spending was 5  [[Page S4513]]  years ago, we would have been in surplus this year; but we are not, and  it is $1.5 trillion over that.   We have a very serious issue. We should have very hard conversations  about our revenue, about our spending, about the direction in which we  are actually heading, and about how we get out of a $33 trillion debt.  This is not going to take 1 year or 2 years.   There are folks I have talked to recently even who have talked about  the time in the early nineties--when we were at a balance of around  $100 billion--of the work that was done by the Bush administration and  the Clinton administration--two administrations in a row--to be able to  get us back to a balance. Two administrations in a row had to work on  that. But here is the frightening thing: Our overspending this year is  more than the total spending during the Clinton administration--just  our overspending this year. This is not going to be a simple process to  be able to come out of. This is not even going to be two  administrations in a row making agreements to be able to get back to  balance. This is going to take decades. My concern is that many here  are not willing to start the first year of decades of work to be able  to get us out. So we have work to do on this.   Myself and Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, sat  down several years ago and started having a conversation about how do  we end government shutdowns and actually get into a real dialogue about  how do we actually deal with debt and deficit issues. From those  productive conversations, she and I created a piece of legislation that  is designed just to prevent government shutdowns. All of the  conversation right now among the media seems to be about if a  government shutdown is coming at the end of this year. We should not  have one at the end of this month, at the end of the fiscal year. We  should continue to be able to keep going, but we should also have a  debate of what direction we are going to go.   So Senator Hassan and I came up with a very simple proposal. It is  not a partisan proposal. It is a completely nonpartisan proposal. It is  a simple proposal, quite frankly, that is equivalent to two things I  had growing up. One was, if you don't finish your homework at school,  you have to actually stay after class to be able to finish it. If you  don't finish all of your work that you had to get done there, stay  after class; keep finishing it; and when you are done, you can leave.  The second one was, when my older brother and I would get into an  argument--which, of course, as brothers, we never did get into an  argument--but in that rare moment we got into an argument, my mom would  put the two of us in a room and say: You guys settle this, and when you  are done, you can come out.   We slammed those two ideas together into one simple proposal on how  to end government shutdowns. If we get to the end of the fiscal year  and the appropriations work is not done, like it is this year, we stay  in session 7 days a week, and the only bills that can actually come up,  that actually can be called up during that time period, are  appropriations bills. The second part of it is, there is no travel for  anyone, so we couldn't fly home and fly back. No official or campaign  funds could be used to be able to travel.   So we are in session 7 days a week. The only bills that are allowed  to be brought up are appropriations bills. There is no travel.   The next part of it is simple. There is what is called a continuing  resolution to maintain the government to be open so that the American  people and Federal workers are held harmless. It puts the pressure on  this room, not on Federal workers who are working for FAA, not on  people who are working for the Housing Administration, not on our  Border Patrol. Those individuals don't get a vote on this. They should  not feel the pressure of a government shutdown.   We can keep the system moving while we still have our arguments to be  able to resolve those things.   Why is this so important? A couple of reasons. One is, we are the  United States of America. We should actually have an organized system  because the rest of the world watches us to try to figure out how to do  government. When we look dysfunctional, the rest of the world says: How  are we going to figure this out if even the Americans can't figure this  out? We, as Americans, lose track of that at times, but the rest of the  world is watching us.   We should have our arguments. We are a representative republic. Every  single voice counts, and we don't all agree. Great. Bring it. That  demonstrates us at our best. But let's actually resolve those issues  rather than having government shutdowns and chaos ensuing, because we  need to set a better example for the world.   The second issue is much closer to home. We need to stop having  government shutdowns because the American people are calling Federal  Agencies and expecting someone to answer the phone, expecting to get  help with passports or permits or whatever process it may be that they  have to interact with the Federal Government. They need to be able to  get somebody to answer the phone to be able to resolve that. This puts  the American people struggling to be able to just get basic answers.   The third is the Federal workforce. We have millions of people who  work in the Federal family. They work all over the country. When there  is a government shutdown, there are two sets of things that actually  occur. If you are a contractor, you are just out. Those contractors may  be doing janitorial services in one of our buildings or they may be  supplying food services to someone. They are just out. They don't get  repaid; they just lose money, period.   Those who are actually on the Federal payroll--they don't get their  check during that time period. They have this crazy, weird, essential,  nonessential, some people laid off, some people not, but everyone is in  chaos in that process.   For those folks who are in the Federal family, even though they may  be declared essential or nonessential, do you know what--their car  payments still come in, their mortgage still comes in, they still have  to put food on the table, but they are not getting a check during the  time of a government shutdown. So those individuals who live paycheck  to paycheck, like many Americans do, suddenly have a gap--not by fault  of their own but because this body couldn't resolve what we were going  to do on the budgeting issues.   The fourth issue I have already partially mentioned, and that is the  contractors. Let me just give you an example of what this means. Our  southern border right now has the worst border crisis that we have ever  faced as a nation. To give you a perspective on it, in the last few  days, we have had up to 9,000 people illegally crossing our border a  day--a day in the last few days. We have one border crossing area just  in Tucson where they had 2,000 people who crossed in a day. Those folks  are being cut loose and released into the country. It is chaos along  our border.   Our Border Patrol and CBP and all those folks who are in law  enforcement are doing their best to be able to help watch for safety  and security of Americans while literally thousands of people are being  cut loose into the country. They depend on some folks who are  contractors in that area to help sometimes with transportation, with  processing, with food, with medical care--all those things. Those  contractors are very important to be able to help our Border Patrol in  the chaos of what is actually happening. When there is a government  shutdown, those contractors aren't going to be there, and the chaotic  border we have now will be even more chaotic at that moment. That  should not happen because we can't resolve our differences here. We  need the national security on that.    I would yield to Senator Cornyn.    That is possible.    That is possible.    If the current rate sustains, yes.   Yielding back my time for Senator Cornyn and for others as well, 2  weeks ago, our Nation crossed a threshold that most people just missed.  We have just over 6 million people who have illegally crossed our  southern border in  [[Page S4514]]  less than 3 years under the Biden administration--just over 6 million  people. That 6 million number is the same as both terms of the Obama  administration and the Trump administration combined. The Biden  administration has allowed more people to illegally cross our border in  less than 3 years than the previous 12 years along our border.   Border Patrol needs help right now. They don't need a government  shutdown; they need help coming alongside them.   So what Senator Hassan and I have done is proposed a very simple  proposal. Let's stop government shutdowns. Let's end those. Let's not  have the drama and the countdown clocks on 24-hour cable news TV. Let's  have the arguments we need to have. Let's talk through the  appropriations that need to be done. That is work we are required to  do. But let's hold the Federal workers harmless in the process, and  let's hold Federal contractors harmless in the process so we can settle  the issues and do real planning.   This ending-government-shutdowns bill is very straightforward. We  just want to prevent government shutdowns. We just want to be able to  stop the chaos and actually show the American people that this body can  have the arguments, resolve our differences, and move forward.   This is something we should be bringing to a vote. This is something  that has wide bipartisan support. Let's resolve this piece while we  still have more to be done.   I yield the floor.
