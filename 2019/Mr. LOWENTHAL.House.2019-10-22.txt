 Mr. Speaker, in late 1965, a C-123 transport was shot  down over Vietnam. The flight's four American crewmen were identified  and their remains returned home.   The 81 South Vietnamese soldiers also on board were never identified,  their remains never properly interred. The current Vietnamese  Government has twice refused to allow the soldiers' remains to return  home.   This Saturday, October 26, the remains of these 81 soldiers will be  finally laid to rest in the Little Saigon community of Orange County,  California, in my district.   I thank Senator Jim Webb, the Lost Soldiers Foundation, the Republic  of Vietnam Airborne Division's national and local chapters, and  everyone involved in making it possible to finally honor and properly  inter these 81 soldiers.                            ____________________
