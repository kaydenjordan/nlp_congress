 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow will be a great day. We will  introduce the reauthorization of the historic Violence Against Women  Act. We are excited about this introduction because so many women had  an opportunity for almost a year and a half, close to 2 years, to  discuss, to invest, to make suggestions, and to bring together this  collaboration endorsed by the national task force, a bipartisan group  of 35 organizations, from religious organizations, to Native American  organizations, to organizations that have been on the front lines of  protecting women or seeking to stop the violence against women.   We have expanded the rape prevention section, for the rising need for  that section as it relates to the #MeToo movement, sexual assault, and  sexual harassment.   We are excited by the confidentiality provisions that indicate that  Federal and State agencies that are receiving grants must maintain the  confidentiality of those who have been victims.   Mr. Speaker, we invite the entire House of Representatives to join us  on this historic occasion and support the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act, which will be introduced in the very near  future, tomorrow.                            ____________________
