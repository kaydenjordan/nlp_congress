 Madam Speaker, it is an old definition of abuse of  power: ``Rules for thee, but not for me.'' That is exactly what is  happening here today.   House Democrats are preparing, once again, to break another precedent  of the United States House of Representatives.   It is an open secret that the American people are facing substantial  challenges today. Many of these challenges are Washington-inflicted, of  one-party rule, caused by the Biden administration's incompetence and  radicalism.   Absolute chaos on the southern border; out-of-control crime; record- breaking gas prices and inflation; a broken supply chain; a historic  labor shortage; a failing education system and, of course, the  humiliating surrender in Afghanistan.   Will this Congress be remembered as the Congress that addressed those  serious challenges? Not a chance?   Instead, I believe this Congress will go down in history as the  broken Congress.   For nearly 4 years, as the House Republicans have been voicing the  needs of millions of Americans, House Democrats have broken nearly  every rule and standard in order to silence dissent and stack the deck  for their radical, unpopular agenda.   They broke the motion to recommit, the first time in the history of  Congress. They broke impeachment, not once, but twice. They broke in- person voting and replaced it with proxy voting, for the first time in  history. And they broke the minority's right to appoint members of its  own choosing to committees.   The Speaker is burning down the House on her way out the door.   What's worse, we got to this point on the basis of a double standard.  Democrats want to change the rules but refuse to apply them to their  own caucus.   I listened to the Speaker talk about the highest standards.   Madam Speaker, when a Democratic chairwoman flew to Minneapolis and  told an angry crowd during the trial to ``stay on the streets,'' ``get  more active,'' ``get more confrontational.'' ``We've got to make sure  they know we mean business.'' That high standard, the Democrats refused  to take action.   The trial judge actually singled her out on her comments on an  ongoing basis, which he said could become an issue on appeal.   But this wasn't the first time. No. This is three times.   At a rally in Los Angeles, that same chairwoman, she told a mob: ``If  you see anyone from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department  store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And  you push back on them. And you tell them that they're not welcome  anymore, anywhere.''   She later defended that comment in another speech in L.A., saying-- this same chairwoman, of the high standards--         I did not threaten Trump constituents and supporters. I do       that all the time, but I didn't do it that time.    This side of the aisle didn't ask that chairwoman to lose her  committee. We simply asked for an apology.   Meanwhile, with that high standard, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer  defended her. When asked about her Minneapolis comment, Leader Hoyer  described her as ``passionate--she believes in her issues.'' She  believes she should get in your faces.   And Speaker Pelosi, oh, what did she do with that high standard? She  compared her comments in Minneapolis to Dr. King's civil rights  movement. You see, why would they do that? Rules for thee, but not for  me.   Just this month, the dossier's principal source was arrested by  Special Counsel Durham for lying to the FBI. Think about everything  that dossier put this country through for 2 years, based on fabricated  evidence. The infringements to due process; the spying on the  Presidential campaign; and, of course, the $32 million spent by  hardworking taxpayers for a Mueller investigation.   And yet, the Democratic chairman says, ``I don't regret it.'' Why?  Rules for thee, but not for me.   When the Speaker of the House, on this very floor, engaged in  personalities, the floor shut down for 3 hours because no one wanted to  take it to the top. Her entire caucus that believed in the higher  standard voted to keep her words in the Record rather than strike them  down. Why?   Rules for thee, but not for me.   The Speaker said: ``I stand by my statement. I'm proud of the  attention that's being called to it.''   Never happened before in the history of this body. Why? Because it is  a broken Congress that believes in rules for thee, but not for me.   This is part of a larger pattern. When a Congressman on the  Intelligence Committee was targeted by a suspected Chinese Communist  Party agent for years, the Democrats kept him on the committee. Why?  Rules for thee, but not for me.   When a Democrat Congresswoman said: ``Israel has hypnotized the  world,'' supporting Israel is ``all about the Benjamins,'' and that 9/ 11 was ``some people did something,'' Democrats actually defended her.  Why? Rules for thee, but not for me.   And when a Member of the Democratic leadership tweeted a week ago,  ``Lock up Kyle Rittenhouse and throw away the key,'' in an attempt to  sway an ongoing trial, the Democrats said nothing. Why? Rules for thee,  but not for me.   Let me be clear: I do not condone violence, and Representative Gosar  has echoed that sentiment. The video was deleted. Democrats won't  listen because they will do anything to distract from the failures of  one-party rule in 1 year destroying a Nation.                                time  1430    For Democrats, this vote isn't about a video; it is about control.  That is the one and only thing Democrats are interested in--not  condemning violence, not protecting the institution, not decorum or  decency, just control.   The Democrats want control, and they don't care about the  consequences. They are destroying this institution, silencing the  minority, and, therefore, silencing millions of Americans.   When I talked to Democrat leadership when they told me what they  wanted to do, I asked a simple question: Have you seen the video? No,  haven't seen it. But they knew exactly what they wanted to do. It is  interesting. Without even watching, they decide the punishment. Why? No  need. Rules for thee but not for me.   What they have started cannot be easily undone. Their actions today  and in the past have forever changed the way the House operates. It  means that the minority rights that have served this body so well are a  thing of the past. Furthermore, it means that, under the Pelosi  precedent, all the Members that I mentioned earlier will need the  approval of a majority to keep those positions in the future.   What was interesting is, it is not just the Speaker who is making  those decisions. When the chairwoman incited those ideas three times,  everyone in the Democratic Party had the ability to vote what they  thought. Because of those high standards, they all voted to table. They  all voted to table, not to remove this chairwoman from committees or  ask for an apology. Why? Because you all believe in rules for thee but  not for me.   That legacy is a real culmination of Speaker Pelosi's career. Make no  mistake, the House is weaker, more partisan, more self-focused today  than when Speaker Pelosi became Speaker less than 4 years ago. Future  Congresses will suffer for it. More importantly, the American people  have needlessly suffered because of it. They won't soon forget it.   It is about control. It is not about a standard that everybody lives  by. It is a standard you enforce on one but not  [[Page H6339]]  upon yourself. You encouraged your own side to engage further when you  all took a vote to table.   It would be interesting to see, if your leadership hasn't watched the  video, how many of you who vote today have watched it.   When it was requested, I contacted the Member. He took the video  down. He put out a statement that he does not believe in violence to  anyone.   But, you see, when others on the other side of the aisle incite  violence, it is okay because it is rules for thee but not for me.   Unfortunately, this body has suffered greatly, and a new standard  will continue to be applied in the future.
