 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business, and if the leader doesn't come, I may  ask for an additional 3 minutes.    Madam President, yesterday, I gave the details of  historic police reform that passed unanimously in both houses of the  Republican-controlled legislature. Surely, if Democrats in Iowa can  work with Republicans to find unanimity, we shouldn't have any problems  here in the U.S. Congress passing something unanimously as well. Let's  not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.   This morning, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, Senator Tim Scott,  and other Members of the Republican task force unveiled a piece of  legislation that goes by the title of Just and Unifying Solutions to  Invigorate Communities Everywhere, or the acronym JUSTICE, for short.   I applaud their leadership on this issue. Democrats should stop  partisan attacks and instead spend their time with us working together  to find solutions. It is pretty simple for me. If the Iowa legislature  can do it in a bipartisan and unanimous way, we can do it here as well                            ____________________     Madam President, while there are reports of plans to  remove troops stationed in Germany, I am reluctant to comment on a  proposal that I have not seen.   What I can say, however, is that Congress will have a say. What I can  also say is that the U.S. commitment to NATO and our European allies is  rock solid. That said, it is not in the American character to project  power for power's sake.   Since World War II, we have reluctantly accepted the lesson that our  geography and good will alone cannot protect us in the United States  from being dragged into other things around the globe, particularly  conflicts.   The U.S. military presence in Europe since World War II has preserved  the freedom of half of Europe and contributed to the eventual freedom  of the other half of Europe. Yet, despite enjoying economic and  security benefits, polls show our presence is unpopular with a large  segment of the German population. Combine the American public's  reluctance to station troops abroad with the sense that they are not  wanted or appreciated by their hosts, you can expect some second  thoughts.   This isn't the whole story. I know many German political leaders who  treasure the friendship between our two countries, and their voices are  needed now more than ever before. Moreover, our bases in Germany are  not there just for the Germans. They provide critical support to troops  in harm's way in the Middle East and are vital for NATO deterrence.   The people of Poland and the Baltic countries are among the most pro- American that you can find anywhere in the world, and the governments  representing them put their money where their mouth is when it comes to  NATO. Our mere presence in Europe reduces  [[Page S3026]]  the likelihood of Russian aggression against these friends and a repeat  of their past oppression.   America will not abandon our allies. Our credibility and national  honor demand it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have notified the Senate majority  leader of my intent to object to proceeding to S. Res. 625, a  resolution encouraging the Government and the people of the United  States to ``Buy American.'' The resolution, though well-intentioned,  would have implications on trade and manufacturing policy that require  further study. It could further invite our trading partners to take  similar actions that would negatively impact U.S. farmers, businesses,  consumers, and workers.                            ____________________
