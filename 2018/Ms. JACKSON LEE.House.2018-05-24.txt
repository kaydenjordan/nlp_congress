 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member and the  chairman of the Rules Committee for listening to both my concerns and  the amendments that we have offered. We are very pleased to have at  least 10 amendments to deal with this important legislation.   Mr. Chair, I rise to thank the chair and the ranking member of the  Armed Services Committee for the en bloc amendments.   I would like to draw particular attention to a few Jackson Lee  amendments as the Congress prepares to adjourn for Memorial Day. I want  to thank the men and women who serve in the United States military.   The Jackson Lee amendment offered in this year's NDAA will provide  oversight with information or guidance on efforts at K-12 schools on  Federal military facilities to maintain safety and security from active  shooters. Just coming from my district and in the neighboring area, the  Santa Fe tragedy, of which I attended vigils over the weekend and  listening to children talk about being fearful of guns and going to  school, has been a very difficult set of circumstances.   So the Jackson Lee amendment would, in fact, seek an assessment from  the Secretary of Defense of the strategies that may be used to reduce  the security threats posed by active shooter incidences at public  schools and secondary schools.   Today, the DOD operates 60 schools in seven States, 26,000 military  connected students, and that is a process where I think the Pentagon  and the Defense Department can be very, very helpful.   Jackson Lee amendment No. 91 seeks to have a report 180 days  following enactment from the Secretary of Defense, which will include  the Coast Guard, on maternity mortality rates among members of the  Armed Forces and the Department.   For every 100,000 births in the United States in 2013, the Centers  for Disease Control estimated that 17.3 percent of mothers died, the  highest mortality rate of all industrialized countries by several times  over.   I believe we can be very effective in having solutions.   My amendment No. 68 considers the vital role in the National Guard  and reservist field when called to service. I work with the National  Guard. Mr. Chair, I thank the Texas Guard and the National Guard. I  have seen them in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I believe it is an  important assessment to continue to remind us of the work that they do,  civilian soldiers, of course.   Jackson Lee amendment No. 89 provides a report 220 days after  enactment on the DOD's capacity to provide survivors of natural  disasters--we are still  [[Page H4703]]  experiencing the suffering of Hurricane Harvey, and I believe this is a  major important time.   It is important as well to deal with cybersecurity, and so I have an  amendment that seeks an assessment that would consider what occurred in  1992 following Hurricane Andrew when the DOD stood up emergency  housing, and to look at those options.   The same thing with dealing with cybersecurity: I believe that it is  important for the DOD to deal with the feasibility of creating an  apprentice program to address the agency's shortages of qualified  cybersecurity persons.   Let me just simply say that this legislation will be helpful in  defining how we answer a lot of hard questions.   I do want to take note of the fact that I would like to see in the  State Department and the DOD that we work on better relationships with  Pakistan and try to discern how we can weave through some of the  difficult issues that we are addressing and develop that alliance  again.   My other amendments deal with raising awareness among students  traveling abroad; expanding the report required by the bill to include  information on the opportunities dealing with artificial intelligence,  dealing with cybersecurity, sharing of Navy desalinization technology  for civilian applications.   Something that I have been working on for a number of years: I just  was in a meeting dealing with the impact of Boko Haram and as well its  far-reaching impact throughout Africa, north Africa, and the death that  it has been engaged in. My amendment will be providing for DOD  assistance to the Nigerian Government in developing a missing persons  database to report on missing, exploited, and trafficked persons. The  DOD has provided the kind of assistance that has been allowed by our  laws, but it is a horrific circumstance.   Then finally, I have an amendment addressing dangers associated with  man-made space debris in low Earth orbit to manned and unmanned  missions.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support our amendments. I thank  those who have managed this legislation.   I think the important point I want to make sure is the active  shooter; the mortality rates dealing with mothers, maternal mortality  rates and the loss of mothers and the loss of children in the instance  of child birth. I would ask that my amendments be accepted.   Mr. Chair, I rise to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules  Committee for the inclusion of Jackson Lee Amendments in the Rules for  H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2019.   I also thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Armed Services  Committee, and their staffs for working with me and my staff to include  Jackson Lee Amendments in the Amendment En Blocs for H.R. 5515, the  National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2019.   As a Member of the House Budget Committee, I am keenly aware of the  budget pressures caused by Sequestration and repeated government  shutdowns that have plagued defense and non-defense agencies.   It is past time for the Congress to engage in an authentic bipartisan  budget process that puts the national interest over party interest so  that we can complete the annual appropriations process by September 30,  2018, and prevent any further government shutdowns.   I have several amendments to H.R. 5515, the National Defense  Authorization Act for FY 2019, which will be addressed in my submitted  statement.   I would like to draw particular attention to a few Jackson Lee  Amendments because of their importance to the people whom I serve in  the 18th Congressional District of Texas, or they are of significance  to the people who rely upon the resources provided by the National  Defense Authorization Act to defend our nation.   As the Congress prepares to adjourn for Memorial Day weekend, I want  to thank the men and women of the Armed Services, and the dedicated  civilian professionals of the Department of Defense and its branches  for their sacrifice and service to our nation.   I hope that in some small measure that the passage of this bill will  convey to them the heartfelt respect and appreciation this body has for  what they do each day to keep our nation and its people safe from harm.   The Jackson Lee Amendments offered to this year's NDAA will provide  oversight with information or guidance on:   1. Efforts at K-12 schools on federal military facilities to maintain  safety and security from active shooter situations;   2. Reporting on maternity mortality rates among service women, and  female dependents of all service members, including the Coast Guard;   3. Raising awareness among students traveling abroad about  recruitment tactics used by foreign intelligence agencies seeking to  snare them into spying against the United States;   4. Readiness of the National Guard and Reserve for disaster response;   5. Defense Department's capacity to provide emergency short-term  housing to disaster survivors;   6. Development of a cybersecurity apprentice program to provide on  the job training for certain cybersecurity positions and to support the  acquisition of cybersecurity certifications;   7. Expanding a report required by the bill to include information on  the opportunities and risks associated with advancements Artificial  Intelligence and its sub-discipline of machine learning;   8. Reports on cybersecurity threats posed by the achievement of  stable quantum computing;   9. Sharing of Navy desalinization technology for civilian  applications;   10. Condemning Boko Haram; and providing for DoD assistance to the  Nigerian government in developing a missing persons database to report  on missing, exploited and trafficked persons; and   11. Addressing dangers associated with man-made space debris in low  earth orbit to manned and unmanned missions.   The Jackson Lee Amendments that I would like to emphasize include:   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 159, which seeks an assessment, from the  Secretary of Defense, of the strategies that may be used to reduce the  security threats posed by active shooter incidents at public elementary  schools and secondary schools located on the grounds of Federal  military installations.   Our nation's military provides for the needs of military families  including the education of their children.   Since 1816, a Military Service, the Department of War or the  Department of Defense has operated schools on military installations.   Today, the DoD operates 60 schools in 7 states: Alabama, Georgia,  Kentucky, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia.   There are 26,000 military connected students attending Domestic  Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools, which are operated by  Department of Defense Education Activity, which is located in the  Office of the Secretary of Defense.   Local Education Agencies operate about 150 public schools on military  installations throughout the United States, educating about 80,000  students.   As you already know, on Friday, May 18, 2018, the community of Santa  Fe, Texas became the most recent school to experience an active shooter  gun violence, which took the lives of eight students and two teachers.   No parent should have to endure the loss of a child.   Over the last year we have seen deadly active shooter attacks carried  out by a lone gunman at K-12 schools, where the shooter was often a  student.   The safety and wellbeing of children of our active duty personnel are  our responsibility.   This Jackson Lee amendment seeks information on what is being done  and what can be done to increase school security against activity  shooters situations in K-12 schools on military installations.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 91, which seeks a report 180 days following  enactment from the Secretary of DoD, which will include the Coast  Guard, on maternity mortality rates among members of the Armed Forces  and the dependents of such members.   For every 100,000 births in the US in 2013 the Centers for Disease  Control estimated that 17.3 mothers died, the highest maternal  mortality rate of all industrialized countries--by several times over.   Between 1990 and 2015 it is reported that maternal mortality rates  around the world fell by 30 percent while at the same time in the US,  the ratio went up nearly 60 percent.   A 2012, Pentagon report states that mothers delivering at military  hospitals are more likely to hemorrhage after childbirth than mothers  at civilian hospitals.   More than 50,000 babies are born at military hospitals each year, and  they are twice as likely to be injured during delivery as newborns  nationwide.   This Jackson Lee Amendment would provide a clearer understanding of  the mortality rates of mothers: who were pregnant, undergoing delivery,  or had delivered a child less than 1 year before their deaths.   Jackson Lee amendments No. 68 and No. 89 provide additional attention  to DoD disaster response.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 68, considers the vital role the National  Guard and Reservist's fill when called to service in disaster response.   I thank the Texas Guard, National Guard, and Reservists as well as  the active duty military personnel, including the Coast Guard who  [[Page H4704]]  came to the aid of victims of Hurricane Harvey.   You saved thousands of lives and Texans will be forever grateful that  you answered the call to serve our nation as members of the armed  forces.   Hurricane Harvey's impact in Texas is still being felt nine months  later.   The storm's footprint covered over 9,000 square miles, including the  city of Houston, Texas.   Hurricane Harvey dropped over 52 inches of rain in the Houston area  an over 60 inches were recorded elsewhere in the state.   At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third of Houston, our nation's  fourth largest city, was underwater leaving 34,575 evacuees in shelters  across Texas.   Before the flood waters had receded in Houston two other monster  hurricanes were bearing down on citizens living in the U.S. Virgin  Islands and Puerto Rico.   The scope and magnitude of these dueling disasters tested the  National Guard and Reservists in ways that were new.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 68 requires a readiness report on the  National Guard and Reservists to make sure they have what they need to  assist communities in need of disaster assistance during the 2018  Hurricane Season which begins June 1st.   Many Texans are still recovering from Hurricane Harvey, and the same  is true of Puerto Rico residents who are attempting to recover from  Hurricane Maria.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 68 improves the bill's ability to support  the important mission of the National Guard and Reservists to engage in  disaster response.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 89 provides a report 220 days after  enactment on the DoD's capacity to provide survivors of natural  disasters with emergency short term housing.   Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S.  in our nation's history.   During Hurricane Harvey over 300,000 structures flooded in  southeastern Texas, where extreme rainfall hit many areas that are  densely-populated.   At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third of Houston, our nation's  fourth largest city, was underwater with 34,575 evacuees in shelters  across Texas.   The storm and resulting flooding damaged 203,000 homes, of which  12,700 were destroyed.   Port Arthur residents were living in tents, after 80 percent of the  city's housing was flooded by Hurricane Harvey rains, which led to  acute housing needs.   The city of Beaumont lost its fresh water supply leading to the  closure of hospitals and evacuation of patients to hospitals in other  cities.   There were significant delays in the provision of enough hotels for  all of those impacted by the storm.   However, within weeks hotel rooms were sufficient to address most  housing needs for those displaced by the storm.   Unfortunately, the number of hotel rooms in Jefferson County Texas  was insufficient for the demand for housing, which left residents  living in tents until housing options could be found.   This Jackson Lee amendment seeks an assessment that would consider,  what occurred in 1992 following Hurricane Andrew, when the DoD stood up  emergency housing in the State of Florida for thousands of Floridians  who lost their homes to that storm.   Earlier this year, the House passed H.R. 3202, the Cyber  Vulnerabilities Disclosure Act, which I introduced to address the need  for effective and aggressive action to deal with the threat of Zero Day  Events.   A Zero Day Event describes the situation that network security  professionals may find themselves when a previously unknown error or  flow in computing code is exploited by a cybercriminal or terrorist.   The term ``Zero Day Event'' simply means that there is zero time to  prepare a defense against a cyberattack.   H.R. 3202 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a  report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber  vulnerability disclosures.   I have previously introduced legislation to address the cybersecurity  workforce shortage in the Federal government.   On that bill, H.R. 1981, Cyber Security Education and Federal  Workforce Enhancement Act, establishes the process for looking outside  of DHS and within its ranks to solve the shortage of cybersecurity  professionals.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 97 seeks an assessment from the DoD on the  feasibility of creating an apprentice program to address the agency's  shortages of qualified cybersecurity professionals for certain  cybersecurity positions.   There is a growing shortage of cybersecurity professionals with over  a quarter-million positions remaining unfilled in the U.S. alone and a  predicted shortfall of 1.5 million cybersecurity professionals by 2019.   There are additional Jackson Lee Amendments included in this bill  that provide reports to the authorizing committees on a range of  security and safety issues related to technology and innovation, with  an eye toward the future.   The world is on the verge of significant breakthroughs in computing,  space exploration, medical advancements, and innovations in medicine,  engineering, and know how.   At the same time we are seeing extreme weather events that are  causing significant shifts in rainfall patterns in this country and  around the world that require that we invest in water management and  desalinization technology to assure reliable access to abundant fresh  water.   Artificial intelligence (AI), and quantum computing are rapidly  changing areas of computing science that will have direct and  significant implications for our economy, national defense, and our  nation's security.   I have two Jackson Lee Amendments that have been adopted in En Bloc  Amendments that will provide additional scope to an existing report on  AI, and another report on the implications for the security of  computing networks should quantum computing innovation establish more  stable systems.   The current stage of computing innovation is akin to the Age of  Flight at the time of the Wright Brothers.   We are in the infancy of the Computing Age, the best is yet to come,  but we should be mindful of the rewards as well as the risks.   We will have aggressive programs to meet the challenge of achieving  stable quantum computing because if we are not on the bleeding edge of  this innovation curve, there could be dire consequences for the  security of defense, civilian, private sector, and academic computing  networks, challenges to our leadership in computing advancements, and  we run the risk of negative economic impacts.   At best we are the first to achieve these advancements in computing,  and at worse we are in second place.   I thank the Committees for including Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 126  and 193 in the Amendment En Blocs for H.R. 5515.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 90 directs that the Secretary of DoD will  provide a report 240 days from enactment of this bill on the risks  posed by man-made space debris in low-earth orbit, including  recommendations on remediation of such risks, and outlines of plans to  reduce the incident of space debris.   Space debris encompasses both natural and artificial particles.   This Jackson Lee Amendment would address the risk of man-made space  debris.   Man-made objects in Earth's orbit that may no longer serve a useful  function can include nonfunctional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicle  stages, mission-related debris and fragmentation debris.   Space debris travels at speeds up to 17,500 miles per hour is fast  enough a small piece of man-made debris to damage to a satellite or a  spacecraft.   There are more than 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball or  orbiting the Earth.   There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger.   There are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they  can't be tracked.   NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of man-made space debris in  Earth's orbit.   Jackson Lee Amendment seeks a report from the Secretary of Defense on  the risks posed by man-made space debris, solutions for reducing risks  and strategies for reducing the incidence of more man-made space debris  being introduced into space.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 61 on the Rule for H.R. 5515, directs the  following Secretary of Navy to submit reports to Congress on the  feasibility of applying desalinization technologies to provide drought  relief in areas impacted by sharp declines in water availability for  both military as well as civilian purposes. (listed as No. 482 on the  Rules Committee Roster)   In 2010, the United States consumed about 355,000 million gallons of  water per day.   Worldwide, some 700 million people do not have access to enough clean  water.   In 10 years the number is expected to more than double to 1.8  billion.   Two-thirds of the Earth's surface is water, but in fact less than 1  percent it is available for human use.   The rest of the water on our planet is either salt water found in  oceans, fresh water frozen in the polar ice caps, or too inaccessible  for practical usage.   While population and demand on freshwater resources are increasing,  supply will always remain constant.    And although the water cycle continuously returns water to Earth, it  is not always returned to the same place, or in the same quantity and  quality.   This is why I offered this Jackson Lee Amendment No. 61.   It is time to plan for the future water needs of our country.  [[Page H4705]]    There are serious water shortages in some regions of the country and  the prospects that sustained water shortages due to regional growth and  climate factors may make it necessary to develop alternative sources  for water intended for human and agricultural uses.   If we can harness the technology to convert ocean water into fresh  water the future of cities and rural communities that depend on water  can be much brighter.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 88 on the Rule for H.R. 5515, Requires the  Secretary of Defense to report to Congress programs and procedures  employed to ensure students studying abroad through Department of  Defense National Security Education Programs are trained to recognize,  resist, and report against recruitment efforts by agents of foreign  governments.    The number of U.S. students studying abroad for credit during the  2015-2016 academic year totaled 325,339 students.   This represents just over 1.6 percent of all U.S. students enrolled  at institutions of higher education in the United States and about 10  percent of U.S. graduates.   Study abroad provides opportunities to students and helps nation's  economies.   A recent survey found that almost 40 percent of companies surveyed  missed international business opportunities because of a lack of  internationally-co competent personnel.   However, the opportunities to study in another country come with some  risks.   In 2014, the FBI released a 28-minute spy film called ``Game of  Pawns, '' which was based in part on the real life story of Glenn  Shriver, who in 2004 was a 22-year-old studying in Shanghai.   The Michigan native found a seemingly innocent job online--writing  papers on U.S.-China relations.   Over time, the job description changed.   Glenn Shriver accepted $70,000 from Chinese operatives and agreed to  apply for U.S. government jobs in order to gain access to classified  information. By then, the FBI was on to him.   He was arrested in 2010 and pleaded guilty to one count of attempting  to spy.   He was sentenced to serve a four-year prison sentence.   At the time FBI did not say how many students had been turned into  spies but said they are increasingly being targeted.   Destinations for U.S. students studying abroad include: Africa; Asia;  Europe; Latin America; Middle East; and Oceania.   When 95 percent of consumers live outside of the United States, we  cannot afford to ignore this essential aspect of higher education.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 88 will provide the tools and education  needed to U.S. students studying abroad to help them protect themselves  from attempts the recruitment tactics of foreign agents.   Thank you to the Committee for the inclusion of these Jackson Lee  Amendments in the final bill.    Mr. Speaker, as we come upon this weekend, I want to  certainly offer my respect for the men and women in the United States  military and those who have fallen in battle.   In this last authorization bill for the defense, I want to emphasize  important amendments that I had approved dealing with active shooter,  dealing with the violence against our children and having that  explained or researched; and, as well, the maternal mortality rate will  be included, along with 10 other of my amendments.   At the same time, I wish to speak about something that saddens me on  the breach of the rule of law and the breach of the Constitution that  our President is engaged in: the maligning of the special counsel and,  of course, the attempt to expose a confidential source.   So let me hold up this picture of Rudy Giuliani who, in 1998, said in  another investigation of a President: ``He's got to do it. He's got to  do it.''   So I would offer to say that the President of the United States needs  to sit down with the special counsel and tell the truth. That is what  our men and women fight for overseas and around the world: democracy  and the rule of law. That is what the President should do.                            ____________________
