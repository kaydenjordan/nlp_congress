 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and to  mourn the passing of a truly larger-than-life figure from my community  in northern California, Mr. Steve Nettleton, pictured here with his  wife, Kathy, appropriately out at the ball game.   A well-known philanthropist and lover of baseball, Steve passed away  recently due to complications of Parkinson's disease at the age of 79.   Originally from Iowa, Steve grew up with a passion for America's  pastime: baseball. Now we know that Steve also attended San Diego State  University. His love for the game drove him to try out for the SDSU  baseball team. While he didn't quite make the roster, he never left the  sport behind.   In 1971, Steve and his family relocated to Chico, a small town in  northern California he never heard of--and he never left. More than 20  years later, he built a multimillion-dollar business as a grocer but  said his best day in the business was the day he sold it in 1995.   If you lived in or near Chico, it would be hard to miss the Nettleton  name, as Steve's generous philanthropy resulted in many buildings and  many projects bearing his name: Enloe Medical Center's Nettleton Mother  and Baby Care Center and the Nettleton Gym at the Boys and Girls Club  of Chico are just a couple of those examples that were named in his  honor due to his work.   Perhaps even more notably, Steve and his wife, Kathy, generously  donated $2 million to transform Chico State University's humble  baseball diamond into a modern, 4,100-seat stadium, which was soon also  adorned with the name Nettleton Stadium. The ``Nett,'' as they call it,  helped revitalize the baseball program at Chico State, which then  became home to two national championship baseball teams, among the many  more regional and conference titles the Chico State Wildcats went on to  win.   Steve also brought the joy and family fun of minor league baseball to  town as the owner of the Chico Heat franchise. Throughout the club's  existence, Steve's limitless passion for baseball shone through in  every facet of the organization. They wanted to win games, but they  also wanted to give the community something that was unifying and  entertaining. Indeed, it is and was.   It should come as no surprise that Steve was awarded Chico Sportsman  of the Year in 1999 and was inducted into the Chico Sports Hall of Fame  in 2016.   His generosity was not limited to baseball. Steve was deeply  passionate for the community he learned to call home. As I mentioned,  he was also a known contributor to the Boys and Girls Club of Chico,  the American Red Cross, the American Cancer Society, United Way, the  Salvation Army, and many more.   For all of his efforts and contributions on behalf of a university  which he did not attend, Chico State awarded him an honorary doctorate  degree of humane letters--only the second person in school history to  receive such a degree.   It is indeed clear that Steve deeply cared for his community. In  return, it deeply cared for him. Through his selfless generosity over  the years, Steve Nettleton built a legacy that will far outlive his  time on this Earth. But still, those who remember it will miss the  nightly opportunity to shake Steve's hand after a baseball game as he  showed his appreciation to those fans in attendance.   Steve brought much joy and fun to his hometown and to its people. He  will be greatly missed. God bless the Nettleton family at this time.                            ____________________
