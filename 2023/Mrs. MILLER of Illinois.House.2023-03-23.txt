 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Foxx for  yielding, and I thank my Republican colleagues for taking up this very  important bill.   Mr. Chair, there has been a push by powerful teachers' unions,  leftwing politicians, and, most concerning, the Biden Justice  Department to silence parents throughout our country. The Biden  administration used the FBI--the most powerful law enforcement agency  in the world--to intimidate parents for showing up to school board  meetings to oppose Biden's radical agenda.   Parents' rights are nonnegotiable. Parents are the decisionmakers for  their child's education, which includes their child's curriculum.  Parents want schools focused on reading, writing, and math, not woke  politics.   The radical left in our country seeks to silence parents and use  public schools and colleges to indoctrinate our youth. They don't want  to teach children how to think. They want to teach them what to think.   I am grateful that several of my bills are included in the Parents  Bill of Rights Act to protect children from radical gender ideology and  to ensure parents are informed when information is being collected  about their children through surveys or documents.   Parents have the right to know what is being taught to their child,  and they have the right to opt their child out of any discussion about  sexual orientation and gender ideology.   Mr. Chair, I am proud House Republicans are keeping our commitment to  fight for parental rights, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
