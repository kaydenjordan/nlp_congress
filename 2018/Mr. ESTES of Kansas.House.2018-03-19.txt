Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4176, the Air Cargo  Security Improvement Act of 2018.   The Transportation Security Administration is responsible for  securing all modes of transportation, and implicit in this  responsibility is the security of air cargo. Air cargo represents more  that 35 percent of global trade by value, which translates to  approximately $6.8 trillion worth of goods annually.   Given the impact that air cargo has on the U.S. and global economy,  it is not surprising that this sector remains an appealing target for  terrorists. Several incidents have demonstrated that terrorists may  seek to target U.S.-bound shipments by exploiting weaknesses in air  cargo security overseas.   In 2010, explosive devices concealed in packages bound for the United  States from Yemen went undetected by initial screenings. Authorities  indicated that the explosives were probably intended to detonate mid- flight over a U.S. city.   More recently, in July 2017, bomb-making materials were transported  undetected from Turkey to Australia in an air cargo shipment.   H.R. 4176, the Air Cargo Security Improvement Act of 2018, is a  timely and necessary step towards a more secure and resilient industry.   This legislation establishes an air cargo security division within  the TSA to carry out all air cargo security policy and stakeholder  engagement. Unlike the TSA's operational role in passenger screening at  checkpoints, the TSA functions in an oversight and regulatory capacity  with respect to air cargo screening.   Initiatives like the Certified Cargo Screening Program and the Known  Shipper Management System enable the TSA to leverage key partnerships  with manufacturers, shippers, freight forwarders, passenger airlines,  and all cargo airlines to meet the 100 percent screening mandate of all  freight on passenger aircraft.   H.R. 4176 requires the review of the Certified Cargo Screening  Program and the Known Shipper Program to ensure that applicable  regulations enhance program effectiveness. These initiatives are aided  by cargo screening technologies designed to meet the logistical demands  of the industry.   H.R. 4176 requires the TSA Administrator to conduct a feasibility  study and a subsequent pilot program on expanding the use of computed  tomography--CT--and other emerging technologies for air cargo  screening.   Through October 2017, air cargo activity increased more than 10  percent from 2016 levels, the largest year-over-year growth in more  than a decade, with the largest growth seen among international  shipments to and from the United States.   In coordination with the cargo industry, the Customs and Border  Protection--CBP--and the TSA have been pilot testing a risk-based  approach to vet air cargo shipments known as the Air Cargo Advanced  Screening system, with an emphasis on improving inspections on overseas  shipments. Accordingly, H.R. 4176 requires the full deployment of ACAS  for inbound international air cargo.   The Air Cargo Security Improvement Act of 2018 is a sensible and  progressive solution that will help to modernize the security of air  cargo shipments and operations while ensuring the flow of commerce.   I thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Thompson, for  advancing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this common  sense piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5099) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish in the Department of Homeland Security a fusion center  technical assistance program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5099         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing DHS' Fusion Center       Technical Assistance Program Act''.       SEC. 2. FUSION CENTER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.         Section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       124h) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsections (j) and (k) as subsections       (k) and (l), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after subsection (i) the following new       subsection (j):        ``(j) Fusion Center Technical Assistance Program.--        ``(1) Establishment.--The Secretary, in consultation with       officials from the National Network of Fusion Centers and, to       the greatest extent practicable, other relevant stakeholders,       shall establish a fusion center technical assistance program.        ``(2) Elements of program.--In carrying out the fusion       center technical assistance program established under       paragraph (1), the Secretary shall--        ``(A) provide technical assistance to fusion centers       regarding--        ``(i) grants administered under sections 2003 and 2004;        ``(ii) terrorism prevention activities; and        ``(iii) intelligence and information sharing;        ``(B) provide to fusion centers notice of any changes to       the activities referred to in subparagraph (A);        ``(C) make available best practices regarding--        ``(i) fusion center operations;        ``(ii) information sharing and analysis of homeland       security threats, including cyber threats;        ``(iii) protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil       liberties; and        ``(iv) such other best practices as the Secretary       determines appropriate; and        ``(D) carry out such other activities as the Secretary       determines appropriate.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 5099, the Enhancing DHS'  Fusion Center Technical Assistance Program Act.   Today, the Nation is facing a complex and evolving threat. Terrorist  attacks, like the New York City vehicle attack and the Pulse nightclub  shooting, have been carried out by individuals inspired by ISIS and  other terrorist organizations. These type of lone wolf attacks appear  to be the new normal.   This means that now, more than ever, it is imperative that we have  strong preventive activities in place, including intelligence and  information sharing.   Since 9/11, States and major urban areas established fusion centers  to build up the preventive activities by creating an avenue for greater  collaboration between Federal, State, and local governments with  regards to terrorism and information sharing.   These State and locally owned fusion centers have largely evolved  from terrorist-focused centers to all-crimes, all-hazard centers  working on a range of relevant Homeland Security issues, including  cybersecurity.   I was able to see the work of one of these fusion centers firsthand  when I visited my home State's fusion center, the Kansas Intelligence  Fusion Center--KIFC--earlier this year. I was very impressed with their  operation. I want to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is  fully supporting this center and the other 78 fusion centers across the  United States.   That is why I was troubled to hear about a key fusion center resource  in the DHS not living up to its potential.   In 2009, the DHS created a fusion center technical assistance program  to provide fusion centers with assistance on a range of topics,  including suspicious activity reporting and other relevant trainings.  However, based on the findings from the committee's recent fusion  center report and my meetings with fusion center personnel, this  program is not meeting the needs of the National Network of Fusion  Centers.   This is why I introduced H.R. 5099, the Enhancing DHS' Fusion Center  Technical Assistance Program Act. This bill provides formal  authorization for the DHS fusion center technical assistance program  and a clear set of directives on the services to be provided by the  program, including assistance related to available grant funding and  DHS terrorism prevention programs, as well as intelligence and  information sharing.  [[Page H1666]]    The bill expands the role of the program to include being a  repository of best practices relevant to fusion center activities,  including cybersecurity. This is a commonsense bill that should help  strengthen the Nation's ability to prevent and protect against  terrorist attacks and other Homeland Security relevant events.   Earlier this month, this legislation was passed out of the Committee  on Homeland Security by a voice vote. I would like to thank Chairman  McCaul and Mr. Gallagher for cosponsoring this legislation. I urge all  my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the ranking member for his support  on this legislation. I would once again urge my colleagues to support  this commonsense bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4227) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security  to examine what actions the Department of Homeland Security is  undertaking to combat the threat of vehicular terrorism, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4227         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.          This Act may be cited as the ``Vehicular Terrorism       Prevention Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. STRATEGY ON VEHICULAR TERRORISM.         (a) In General.--Not later than six months after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland       Security shall--        (1) assess the activities the Department of Homeland       Security is undertaking to support emergency response       providers and the private sector to prevent, mitigate, and       respond to the threat of vehicular terrorism; and        (2) based on such assessment, develop and submit to the       Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a strategy to improve the       Department's efforts to support the efforts of emergency       response providers and the private sector to prevent,       mitigate, and respond to such threat.        (b) Contents.--The strategy required under subsection (a)       shall include the following:        (1) An examination of the current threat of vehicular       terrorism.        (2) Methods to improve Department of Homeland Security       information sharing activities with emergency response       providers and the private sector regarding best practices to       prevent, mitigate, and respond to the increasing threat of       vehicular terrorism.        (3) Training activities the Department can provide,       including possible exercises, for emergency response       providers to prevent and respond to the threat of vehicular       terrorism.        (4) Any additional activities the Secretary of Homeland       Security recommends to prevent, mitigate, and respond to the       threat of vehicular terrorism.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Emergency response providers.--The term ``emergency       response providers'' has the meaning given such term in       section 2(6) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       101(6)).        (2) Vehicular terrorism.--The term ``vehicular terrorism''       means any action that utilizes automotive transportation to       inflict violence and intimidation on individuals for a       political purpose.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4227, the Vehicular Terrorism  Prevention Act, introduced by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta).   H.R. 4227 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to examine the  threat of vehicular terrorism and develop a strategy to improve DHS  support for the efforts of emergency responders and the private sector  to prevent, mitigate, and respond to such a threat.   Terror groups, including ISIS and al-Qaida, have urged supporters to  carry out attacks in their home countries using any means necessary,  including vehicle ramming. Terrorists and inspired homegrown extremists  have heeded this directive and have carried out vehicle-based attacks  in the past several years, including in France, England, Spain, Ohio,  and, most recently, New York City.   The majority of prevention, mitigation, and response activities  related to vehicle attacks are carried out by first responders and the  private sector. DHS has existing resources and programs that can be  better utilized to prepare frontline personnel in local communities to  address this threat. This includes guidance related to the use of  existing grant programs, increased information sharing, promoting  suspicious activity reporting, increasing available exercises and  training programs, dedicated research and development targeting  mitigation measures, and utilizing critical infrastructure protection  programs for vehicle ramming prevention.   H.R. 4227, the Vehicular Terrorism Prevention Act, requires the  Secretary to develop a plan on how to improve and increase those  capabilities. This bill passed by voice vote in the Committee on  Homeland Security in early March.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Latta for his work on  this important measure, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ranking Member Thompson.   I once again urge my fellow colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
