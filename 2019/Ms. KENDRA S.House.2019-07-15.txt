 HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  another Oklahoma trailblazer in space.   Astronaut John Herrington is a retired United States naval aviator  and former NASA astronaut. Born in Wetumka, Oklahoma, Herrington made  history in 2002 as the first Native American to fly in space.   A citizen of the Chickasaw Nation, Herrington earned a bachelor's of  science degree in applied mathematics from the University of Colorado  Colorado Springs, a master's of science degree in aeronautical  engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School, and a Ph.D. from the  University of Idaho.   As a mission specialist on the STS-113 Endeavour mission, it was the  11th American assembly mission to the International Space Station. Dr.  Herrington spent more than 330 hours in space and conducted three space  walks, totaling nearly 20 hours.   Dr. Herrington then served as a capsule communicator, supporting  shuttle and space station training and operations, and he was later  chosen to become the chief engineer for safety and mission assurance at  the Johnson Space Center.   I am proud of Dr. Herrington's achievements and barriers broken for  Tribal citizens in space exploration.                            ____________________
