 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler, I thank Ms.  Jayapal for advancing this important resolution.   Last week I visited the Irwin Detention Center in Georgia along with  a dozen of my colleagues.   I have visited some of these ICE detention centers before, and I have  seen the horrible conditions that immigrants and refugees face across  the country. We all remember the unspeakable stories about how children  were separated from their mothers and fathers and how they cried for  them in the middle of the night and how they were separated thousands  of miles apart.   Mr. Speaker, I came to the United States from the Dominican Republic  as a young boy knowing this Nation was a beacon of hope and  opportunity.   Never in my wildest dream did I ever think that I would be a Member  of Congress. But I also never had the nightmare that I would be  summoned, that I would be asked to investigate this horror story that  has manifested itself at Irwin.   While there, I spoke to a handful of women whose stories made me so  angry about this country, the country that I had grown to love, angry  about how our laws have been twisted by a sick administration that  treats innocent women so cruelly, women who want nothing more than the  same freedom and opportunities that I once sought myself, women who put  their lives on the line to get here.                                time  0945    I spoke to a woman from the DR who crossed el Canal de la Mona with  30 men and 3 other women, 7 days in the Caribbean Sea only to have,  later on, her health and well-being put in great risk by the U.S.  Government itself.   One of them told me that she was treated like an animal, that the  appropriate instruments that needed to be used for her tests were not  used, that there were invasive and aggressive tests. She told me that  the doctor stuck his hand on her private parts, Mr. Speaker.   I am told one woman has been bleeding for more than 2 weeks.   Let's shut down this center. Let's arrest the doctors and anybody  that was involved in perpetrating this crime.   Let's shut down Irwin right now, Mr. Speaker.
