 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Andre Mathis to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Mathis  is an outstanding nominee with extensive litigation experience and deep  ties to the Tennessee legal community.   Over the years, he has litigated hundreds of civil cases and has  defended approximately 150 criminal cases as a member of the Criminal  Justice Act panel in the Western District of Tennessee. Mr. Mathis has  tried 19 cases to verdict or final judgment and has briefed 23 appeals.  And if confirmed, he would be the first Black man to sit on the Sixth  Circuit from Tennessee. Mr. Mathis was rated unanimously ``well  qualified'' by the American Bar Association, and he received a  bipartisan vote in committee. Despite his extensive experience, some on  the other side have questioned Mr. Mathis' credentials, as well as his  confirmation process itself.   Let's set the record straight. Mr. Mathis is highly qualified for  this job. And any claim that there was no meaningful consultation  between the White House and the Tennessee Senators on this vacancy is  simply false. Over a period of 6 months, the White House asked the  Tennessee Senators for proposed candidates, interviewed one such  candidate, and made Mr. Mathis available to the Senators to conduct  their own interviews. There is a clear record of good faith  consultation regarding this vacancy, consultation that far exceeded  that afforded by the Trump White House to several Democratic Senators.   Remember, under the former President, Senate Republicans regularly  supported circuit nominees who were nominated, even though the Trump  White House did not seek any input from home-State Democratic Senators.  I have said it many times: There cannot be one standard for Republicans  and another for Democrats.   With Mr. Mathis' nomination, this Senate has an historic opportunity  to confirm a lifelong Tennessean and a person of outstanding  credentials and integrity to serve the community that raised him. I  look forward to supporting him and urge my colleagues to do the same.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), and the Senator from  Nevada (Ms. Rosen) are necessarily absent.    Socialism. This is all about socialism. I listened very  carefully to my friend from Texas, and he is my friend--we work  together on many things--and he believes the downfall of America is the  advent of socialism. Well, I am not sure what that label means to him,  but I want to take a look at some of the areas that he made a comment  on.   He thinks it is socialist for us to expand the coverage of the  Affordable Care Act. We are down to 8 percent of Americans without  health insurance--8 percent. The goal is zero. We may never reach it.  We have dramatically decreased the number of Americans without health  insurance.   Have you ever lived in a situation where you didn't have health  insurance, when you are a new father of a baby with a health problem  and no health insurance? I have been there. You don't want to go to  that place.   We want to give everybody the peace of mind that they have quality  healthcare available to them. Is that socialism? Is that the government  making the decision that you are going to have health insurance? I  don't think so. Right-thinking people across this country, regardless  of political stripe, believe that health insurance is critical for a  happy and healthy family.   He used the term--he said Medicare is a socialist objective. Ha. Try  that one on for size in any State. Run your campaign on getting rid of  Medicare and see how it works. I can tell you what the result will be.  Medicare, over the last 60 years, has liberated senior citizens in  America so that they can live longer and live independently and have  quality care through the later years of their lives. Socialism? The  government knows better? It is a program which people value, just like  Social Security. I hope people won't brand that as socialism. Many did  when it was created. These are programs that families count on, real  families. These programs are not socialist; they are as American as can  be.   The student loan program? I support what President Biden did. I might  have done it a little differently. But the fact that he is tagging that  student loan forgiveness to the wealth of the individual and family is  the right thing to do. A $10,000 student loan forgiven for those with  individual income below $125,000 a year--that is not unreasonable. That  means that middle-class and lower income kids are going to have $10,000  of their student loan forgiven. If they happen to be on Pell grants,  which means they really were low-income families when they went to  school, they get an additional $10,000.   I hear all this lamenting and whining and crying of socialism. Where  in the heck was this comment about socialism when we were giving out  PPP loans all across America by the thousands?   It turns out that some of the harshest Republican critics of student  loan forgiveness took out PPP loans. Do you know what that meant? They  were forgiven. They didn't have to pay them back. It was OK when they  were receiving the money, these conservative Republicans, but the idea  of some student burdened with student loans having loan forgiveness is  socialism. Not where I am standing.   Now, I also want to say something about fiscal responsibility. Do you  know, after the reconciliation bill, after the Inflation Reduction Act,  how much we will reduce the deficit this year? One-point-seven trillion  dollars. How did we achieve this? Well, we achieved it by saying we are  going to establish a minimum tax for certain corporations. Which ones?  Corporations that showed an average of $1 billion a year in net  profit--average of $1 billion in net profit a year--over a 3-year  period of time will finally have to pay some Federal income tax. Is  that too much to ask? Is that socialism? No. It is fairness.   In terms of the EV socialism, this is one where Senators ought to  take care. When they give speeches on the floor about electric vehicles  and electrification, they are basically betting that the future is  going to be a lot different than I see it.   Why do we have so many electric vehicles? Well, it must be a Federal  mandate. No, it wasn't. It was a decision by the private sector to  build electric vehicles and make that the future of transportation in  America.   Take a look at Ford Motor Company. We had one of the Ford family come  and tell us this story. They made a decision that electric vehicles  were part of their future, a big part of their future, and they made a  marketing move  [[Page S4506]]  that I thought was genius. What were the first two vehicles they  electrified and advertised? One was the Ford F-150 Lightning--the most  popular pickup truck in America. A lot of White males drive those  around. I am sure the Presiding Officer knows a couple. I drive one  myself. They are going to electrify that vehicle, and they can't  produce them fast enough to meet the demand.   So the people who many Republicans feel are the national allies on  this subject are waiting in line to buy a Lightning, an F-150.   Then what was the other car they were going to electrify? A Mustang.   Well, I just want to tell you that certain age groups still dream  about Mustangs. I can remember in 1964 when they put them on the market  for the first time. They are going to electrify them. These cars are  wildly popular, and they can't build them fast enough. So the  Republicans who are betting that this is just a fad and it is going to  go away are dead wrong on this. The private sector's production of  automobiles is moving toward electric vehicles in a big way, and it is  going to happen.   I would say the Republicans who believe it is pure socialism to have  electric vehicles in our future should get out of the way because those  electric vehicles are going to run all over you in no time at all.   Also, this idea of 87,000 IRS agents was invented by one Senator who  came to the floor and made his calculation. It was like the death  squads. They pick up a phrase, and they say this is the reality--87,000  IRS agents. That isn't even close to the truth.   What we know is this: The vast majority of Americans and American  families pay their taxes legally and on time, and they should be  respected for doing that. Who we are looking for are the people who  don't do that--either don't pay their taxes or don't pay what they owe.  Those people are not accepting their fair share of responsibility for  this Nation's future.   The IRS has been starved in the past of basic things-- computerization, for example, and agents to do audits. The President  has made it clear that his target is never going to be working  families. His target is those who are defying the law and defying the  system of taxation. He believes they should pay their fair share, and I  couldn't agree with him more.   In terms of this idea--of this socialist mantra--that we know better,  that the government knows better, it is interesting when it comes to  personal liberty and freedom. When you get into another area, like the  reproductive freedom for women, exactly the opposite position is being  taken by many people on the other side of the aisle.   Here is the point I want to make: We considered the reconciliation  bill just a few weeks ago. We had 41 straight rollcalls. I know because  I was on the floor for every one of them. At the end of the day, we  passed the reconciliation bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. What has  happened since? Well, if you want to call it socialism, let me tell you  what our socialist moves have done so far.   Tomorrow, President Joseph Biden is going to New Albany, OH, to join  the CEO of Intel in breaking ground on a new multibillion-dollar  semiconductor plant. It is one of the largest investments of its kind  in American history, and it is going to create thousands of good-paying  jobs for construction workers and engineers. Over the next decade,  Intel plans to transform New Albany into one of the largest  semiconductor manufacturing sites in the world. That is a big shift  from the days when we shipped microchip production overseas to Asia.   Socialism? Is this Joe Biden's brand of socialism to open up a plant  that finally is going to make computer chips, which are absolutely  essential to the growth of our economy?   This investment in America's future was made possible by the CHIPS  and Science Act, and I want to give credit where it is due. There were  some Republicans who stepped forward and joined us in that effort. I  wish there would have been more. I wish they all would have been with  us in this effort. We believed--and the President backed us up--that if  we were going to make this investment in semiconductor chips for our  future, America was going to be there. I don't think that was inspired  by socialism; that was inspired by common sense.   Yesterday, the New York Times reported that, in the weeks since the  Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law--and that is the one with  41 rollcalls--companies throughout the country have unveiled ``a series  of big-ticket projects to kick-start our clean energy future.''   Socialism--a future that will be made in America by American workers?   I would like to remind everyone that we passed that law without a  single Republican vote. Not one Republican Senator would join us in  this effort.   Well, what has happened in the 4 weeks since we passed it?   Well, Toyota announced it is going to invest billions of dollars in  manufacturing batteries for those electric and hybrid vehicles here in  America. That has happened since we passed the bill.   One solar company, named First Solar, announced another billion- dollar investment to build a new facility in the Southeast.   Socialism?   Honda, LG, Samsung--all of them announced billions of dollars in  investments to make components for electric vehicles right here in  America.   In West Virginia, one company plans to build a nearly 500,000-square  foot electric battery factory. And who is going to be working in it?  Well, they are targeting laid-off coal miners. They want to put them to  work first.   Socialism?   Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, these jobs aren't going  overseas anymore. They are staying right here in America.   New manufacturing projects are lighting up across the country, like a  constellation of hope, marking a new era of renewal and renaissance for  American families. I am glad to say that a big piece of it is taking  place in the Midwest.   Earlier this week, in my home State of Illinois, the company T/CCI  announced it is going to invest millions of dollars into retooling its  facility in Decatur, IL, to make compressors for--hold onto your  socialist hat--electric vehicles. Here they come again. And our  Governor, Pritzker, announced that the State will work alongside  Richland Community College to establish a climate center for innovation  and research--an innovation hub.   Socialism?   This is a chance for the Decatur community to play its part in an  electric vehicle revolution. Most importantly, once again, these  investments are going to create good-paying jobs right here in America.  For cities like Decatur, this is a lifeline. It wasn't that long ago  that the city was struggling with population decline. Now it is a new  story.   Under President Biden and a Democratic Congress, we are leaving no  town behind. We are investing in the future of every community from  Chicago to Decatur. In doing so, we are honoring America's history as  the land of opportunity.   There is a statue in downtown Decatur. It is a site where it says  that a 21-year-old, barefoot Abraham Lincoln delivered his very first  political speech supporting the Whig platform. Just 2 years after that  speech, Lincoln announced his first campaign for public office in my  home county of Sangamon. He ran for the legislature.   So, as we celebrate the new funding for jobs and development coming  to cities like Decatur, I find it interesting that one of the first  policies Lincoln supported was known as internal improvements. He  announced at his first run for office:         Time and experience have verified to a demonstration, the       public utility of internal improvements. That the poorest and       most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefitted       by the opening of good roads, and in the clearing of       navigable streams within their limits, is what no person will       deny.    The challenges we face in America today are more sophisticated, but  we also passed an infrastructure bill, the largest in the history of  the United States.   Under the previous President, Donald Trump, he promised every week  was going to be infrastructure week. Unfortunately, his response was so  weak there was never an infrastructure week--never during his  Presidency--and that is a fact. President Biden turned that around, and  we passed an infrastructure bill that is putting America back to work,  as it should. It is about time.  [[Page S4507]]    For decades, the Republicans have prayed to the altar of trickle-down  economics. They call every initiative that we have on the Democratic  side socialism: Social Security, socialism; Medicare, socialism; this  idea of leading into the electric vehicle revolution, socialism; the  government knows best.   Well, I will tell you they are wrong. What we see is leadership and  leadership that is long overdue. We can't leave working families behind  in this country. Four decades of cutting taxes for the rich on some  wild theory that this was somehow going to lift all boats just turned  out to be false.   I will tell you this: Roads and bridges crumbling beneath our feet,  generations of good-paying jobs going overseas, the world's wealthiest  trying to save a few bucks, and skyrocketing economic inequality is not  American. Fixing it is not socialism; it is just fairness.   The last President spent 4 years declaring infrastructure week but  had nothing to show for it. In less than 2 years, President Biden and  the Democrats have delivered on their promise of rebuilding America and  putting American workers back to work. We have had the largest growth  and job creation--ever in the history of the United States--in the last  year and a half under President Biden, and 660,000 of those jobs are  manufacturing jobs--real jobs with a good paycheck. We are investing in  the interest of industries of the future. More importantly, we are  investing in American families.   The policies we have enacted during this Congress are going to help  move America forward. Together, they represent a new vision for  America's future: roads and bridges, microchips, wind turbines, deep  research into advanced technologies like quantum computing. What does  it mean for the American people? Take a look at the auto industry.  Today, the industry, which with Barack Obama as President was saved  despite Republican opposition, is an industry in which major  manufacturers are betting big on its electric future.    Members of the Republican Senate caucus may not see electric vehicles  in the future, but they have closed their eyes if they are in that  position.   With the infrastructure package, we are going to create good, good  jobs--union jobs--of fixing and building our roads and installing  charging stations all across America.   With the CHIPS and Science Act, we are shoring up the domestic supply  of semiconductors so we can assemble the next generation of electric  vehicles in American factories. That chips bill also authorized  billions of dollars in funding for scientific research--laboratories  like Argonne and Fermilab. This research even has the potential to  unlock new discoveries in battery technology.   Now, with the Inflation Reduction Act, we are making life more  affordable for working families. That is not just to bring down costs  of prescription drugs and energy bills; it will help lower the costs of  American-made electric vehicles so more families can buy one.   This is the Democratic platform in action: building products and  components we depend on here at home, pioneering technology  breakthroughs to change the world, and leveling the economy so that  every family has a fighting chance. Thanks to the policies we have  passed so far under the Biden administration, we are rolling.   I do want to tell you this for the record: On my way to catch the  plane at the airport in St. Louis earlier this week, I saw gasoline for  sale at $3.46 a gallon. That is still high, but it is a heck of a lot  better than the $5-plus we were paying just a few weeks ago. Is that  socialism? I think it is the government at work, and this President has  done everything he can to bring down the cost of living that families  face.   It is still a challenge. We haven't conquered it, but we are moving  in the right direction, and this economy is moving in the right  direction. I wish we could have had some Republican support for that  effort.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), the Senator from  Michigan (Mr. Peters), and the Senator from Nevada (Ms. Rosen) are  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I have two request for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:               committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs    The Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is authorized to  meet during the session of the Senate on Thursday, September 8, 2022,  at 10 a.m., to conduct a hearing.                          committee on the judiciary    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, September 8, 2022, at 9 a.m., to  conduct an executive business meeting.                            ____________________
