 Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate Korean American Day  tomorrow.   I am proud to represent Koreatown in Los Angeles, the largest Korean- American community of any congressional district in the country.   Tomorrow, we recognize the landmark 120th anniversary of the arrival  of the first Korean-American immigrants to the United States, and we  honor the enduring legacy, sacrifices, and contributions made by  generations of Korean Americans.   This is why I urge my colleagues to support my resolution to  recognize the ideals of Korean American Day and essential contributions  of Korean Americans to American life.   Madam Speaker, it is a great honor to represent a community whose  history and culture are so valuable both individually, and as a part of  our larger, diverse American identity.   Since coming to Congress, I've made it a priority to ensure the  Korean American community gets the awareness and support it deserves.   That is why I've pushed Congress to recognize the sacrifices of  Korean and Korean American veterans throughout the last century.   It is why I recently fought to secure $7 million for the creation of  the Korean American National Museum, the first museum in the nation  dedicated to honoring over a century of Korean American history and  culture.   And it's why I am leading this year's efforts to recognize the  monumental milestone of 120 years of Korean American culture, and the  countless contributions Korean Americans have made to our country.   As I continue to work every day to represent and uplift the Korean  American community in Los Angeles, I am grateful for the continued  partnership of Korean American organizations in my district.   The Korean American Federation of Los Angeles, led by President James  An, has and will continue to serve as a powerful voice and strong  advocate for Korean Americans in the Los Angeles area. Their programs  and services help form the backbone of Koreatown and have helped keep  the community together and strong, overcoming decades of challenges,  discrimination and titanic changes in our city.   The Koreatown Youth and Community Center, led by their Executive  Director, Johng Ho Song, has spent nearly half a decade serving at risk  youth in Los Angeles as the leading multiservice organization in  Koreatown. Their support for Korean American youth and their families,  especially recent immigrants and the economically disadvantaged is  essential in ensuring everyone in Koreatown has access to healthcare,  housing and education.  [[Page H223]]    These organizations, and many others like them are essential to  sustaining and strengthening Los Angeles' Korean community and I am  privileged to work alongside them every day to make sure Koreatown and  all Korean Americans get the support they deserve from our federal  government.   This Korean American Day, I hope all my colleagues, constituents and  fellow Americans take the time to reflect on and fully honor the  continuing positive influence and impact the Korean American community  has on our Country.                            ____________________
