 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arizona for  yielding to me. I promise to be brief.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about something that Hoosiers back  home are talking to me about every single day, and that is to rise to  express my support for those struggling against burdensome and costly  regulations, those costly regulations that are hurting Hoosier  businesses from being able to get their products to market, from  ultimately being able to grow their enterprises, and from ultimately  being able to hire more Hoosiers.   When Democrats passed the Dodd-Frank Act, they promised a success for  Main Street. Instead, Dodd-Frank has become a nightmare for businesses  on Main Street.   Specifically, while I was back home just a few weeks ago, I met with  two businesses working hard to do right by their customers and  employees but confounded by section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act.   Section 1502 requires businesses to disclose due diligence on the  source and chain of custody of ``conflict minerals,'' as well as hire a  third party to honor their due diligence and subsequently submit a  report to the SEC on those measures. According to its Democratic  authors, this provision would only affect the biggest of companies, but  those companies have to bring in all of their suppliers, all of their  vendors in order to comply, which affects many small businesses across  Indiana's Ninth District.   One of those firms is Best Home Furnishings in Paoli. They  manufacture quality furniture across Indiana, and I was astounded to  learn the lengths they must go through in order to comply with this  regulation. They travel far abroad to verify the wood is conflict-free.  And even after all that time-consuming and very costly travel, they are  left wondering, despite all of their best efforts, if they are making  any impact on those areas that are far from their plants, far from  their customers, and far from their employees.   Another such example is Key Electronics, a manufacturer that is  working on electronics in Indiana to get through opioid withdrawals for  many Hoosiers who are afflicted by this scourge on our communities. It  is a laudable goal, but they are hamstrung by the thousands and  thousands of dollars they pay to ensure the customers that they work  with ultimately get this third-party audit on them and all of their  vendors. This challenging business with very thin margins is being  limited in what they can invest in innovative, desperately needed  therapy for those addicted to opioids.   For every dollar and every moment that a businessowner has to spend  complying with this outrageous and unnecessary regulation, those are  minutes and dollars that are not directed towards job creation, not  directed towards investing in America's future,  [[Page H6034]]  and not directed towards fulfilling their and, ultimately, their  employees' dreams.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in this  Congress to bring an end to the excessive job-killing regulations that  stand between Hoosiers and their entrepreneurial dreams.                 Give Americans Back Their Healthcare System     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about how  regulations and restrictions in healthcare space are preventing new  innovations from being able to deliver better care to Hoosiers back  home.   I recently met with a local business just outside of my district,  Mainstreet Health Investments, who is working hard to develop new rapid  recovery centers that are truly better in matching patients' needs with  services provided.   For example, when a patient has knee surgery, they only need a  hospital for a very limited window during their period of acute care.  They need that hospital for such immediate recovery, but, hours after  that, they can be transferred to a different recovery center, one that  better matches their needs as a patient, enabling them to recover much  more quickly and enabling us all to save significant dollars by  matching that care with the needs that they have.   Frankly, I have been amazed at the quality of these rapid recovery  centers, where the patient is truly focused on, in a holistic manner,  such that they can develop and have physical therapy right there in  that location. It is innovations just like these rapid recovery centers  that they are building that will help deliver better cures to more  Americans.   This is how we make a healthcare system that is not only more  affordable, not only more accessible, but also better for patients in  the long run. I want it to be just as effective, in addition to  affordable and accessible.   What stands in the way? What is standing in their way is certainly  government bureaucracy, a government that is retarding a level of  innovation, retarding their ability to grow and build more of these  facilities across the country despite the demonstrated need and the  demonstrated benefit to those patients.   So I wanted to talk about those regulations and how they stand in the  way of Americans and Hoosiers who are trying to get ahead, trying to  get their companies get ahead, trying to help their fellow employees  get ahead, and, ultimately, that will, together, help America get  ahead.
