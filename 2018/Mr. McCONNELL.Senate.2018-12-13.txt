 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar, under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, the Senate began this week with a long  list of important unfinished business. And make no mistake--that list  remains lengthy. It will require the continued good-faith efforts of  Members on both sides of the aisle to keep up the progress.   We need to confirm more of the well-qualified nominees who remain  waiting on the Senate's calendar. We need to deliver the targeted  resources that are necessary for securing our border and fund the  remaining parts of the Federal Government.   Today, of course, debate will continue on the Sanders-Lee resolution  with respect to U.S. involvement in Yemen. As I stated yesterday, their  resolution is not sufficiently prudent nor sufficiently precise for the  job at hand. Yes, the Senate wants Saudi Arabia to act responsibly. We  want to see a more stable Yemen for the sake of the Yemeni people. We  also want to preserve this 70-year partnership, which serves our  interests and helps stabilize a crucial region.   The resolution before us is a blunt and imprecise measure that would  not advance these delicate goals. To the contrary, it would jeopardize  U.S. support that has actually limited civilian casualties. And I  maintain that since genuine hostilities are not involved, the  resolution should not even be privileged under the War Powers Act.   I urge my colleagues to vote against their resolution and to support  Chairman Corker's more responsible alternative in its place.   Even considering the work still before us, Members should take pride  in the significant milestones we have checked off this week.   On Tuesday, the Senate completed the 30th Federal circuit judge  confirmation of this Congress.   Yesterday evening, the Senate and the House reached a landmark  agreement to reform the process by which Capitol Hill itself handles  claims of sexual harassment, discrimination, and other workplace  violations. It is a bicameral and bipartisan agreement. It strengthens  protections for victims. It ensures that Members of Congress shall be  held responsible for their own misconduct, not taxpayers. It contains a  number of other important reforms to  [[Page S7532]]  create more transparency and accountability in the process. I am very  glad Congress will be taking this important step. I want to thank  Chairman Blunt and Ranking Member Klobuchar and their counterparts in  the House for working hard to get this across the finish line.   That wasn't the only milestone we cleared yesterday. Yesterday  afternoon, the House of Representatives joined the Senate in passing  the farm bill conference report. Now it is on its way to the  President's desk.   The boost this bill delivers couldn't come soon enough. It is no  secret that these are tough times in farm country. Falling prices and  volatile markets make it harder to make ends meet. Net farm income  continues to decline. The threat of natural disasters is a constant  fear for even the most skilled and prepared farmers.   Families in my home State of Kentucky are all too familiar with these  challenges. Months of heavy rain and severe weather this year have  damaged crop yields and increased the burden on producers. We are home  to more than 75,000 farms. They produce everything from soybeans and  poultry to horses and corn. These families are looking to us for help  and stability, and when President Trump signs our farm bill into law,  more stability is just what they will get.   I would like to share some of the bill's highlights that will support  farm families in the Blue Grass State, by way of example.   In need of certainty and predictability, this farm bill extends a  strong commodity safety net and protects crop insurance.   It contains policies to encourage future generations of farmers to  plant their own roots--particularly important in States like mine with  aging agricultural populations.   To preserve our land for the future, the legislation promotes  conservation programs, outdoor recreation, and upgraded watershed and  drinking water infrastructure.   For our rural communities, it expands broadband deployment and  dedicates further resources to combat the opioid epidemic.   For hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians faced with food insecurity,  the farm bill increases funding for emergency programs at food banks.   The legislation provides continued funding for groundbreaking  agricultural research at universities and research institutions.   For producers looking for markets abroad, it strengthens our trade  programs to develop new opportunities for Kentucky around the globe.   Of course, each of these important victories for Kentucky farmers  comes in addition to the new opportunities available with the full  legalization of industrial hemp, as I have discussed extensively here  on the floor.   All in all, this legislation is a big win for farmers in Kentucky and  across our country. I am proud to have played a part in delivering that  victory.   It has been my privilege to represent Kentucky farmers on the  Agriculture Committee every day I have served in the Senate. The  multiyear bill we produced is a credit to the leadership of Chairman  Roberts and Ranking Member Stabenow, and now the fruits of their labor  are finally on the way to the White House.   I would like to express my gratitude to my follow conferees,  especially my colleague from Kentucky, Congressman Jamie Comer.   I would also like to thank the Kentucky Farm Bureau, which has been  my partner every step of the way. Earlier this month, the farm bureau  announced the beginning of its centennial year. I would be hard-pressed  to think of a better way to celebrate that 100th birthday than with a  new farm bill.   There is a reason this bill passed both Houses with overwhelming  bipartisan majorities. There is a reason this has been a big priority  for Congress and the administration. Farming families deserve more  stability. Once the President signs this farm bill into law, that is  precisely what they will have.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to close by paying tribute  to another Member of this body whose retirement in the Senate is fast  approaching. This particular Senator, in his own words, grew up on a  dry, dusty ranch in Northern Arizona. You might be surprised at that  description if you knew only the name of his hometown--``Snowflake.''  But this Navajo County town of a couple of thousand residents wasn't  named for its meteorology; it was named for its founding families. It  was set up back in 1878 by two wagon train pioneers: Mr. Snow and--that  is right--Mr. Flake. It would still be 34 years until Arizona became  the 48th State, and 134 years later, that Mormon pioneer's great-great- grandson would be elected to the U.S. Senate.   Jeff Flake is the son of cattle ranchers, so he learned all about  ``earmarking'' from an early age. Back when Jeff was serving in the  House, he explained in an op-ed that back on the ranch, earmarking was  an unsavory way to brand your cattle. Apparently, the practice involves  a pocketknife.   Well, Jeff moved on from that cattle pen. He wound up leading a  statewide think tank. Then he won election to the House. By the time he  arrived here in Washington--filled with equal parts fiery resolve and  smalltown collegiality--``earmarks'' had come to mean something very  different to him, but, as his House colleagues would soon find out, he  found the new meaning just as unappealing.   Jeff's take on fiscal responsibility and good government ruffled some  feathers over in the House, but his star kept rising. He didn't seem to  mind that lonely feeling that we have all known here in Washington from  time to time--the occasional sense that you have wound up on a bit of  an island. I mean, Jeff really didn't mind this feeling. This is not a  political metaphor, by the way; it is literally one of the man's  hobbies.   Starting back in 2009, and several times since, our colleague had  decided a ``dream vacation'' means a rugged survival trip where he is  marooned on a remote island with just a couple tools. In one eloquent  reflection, Jeff described this predilection as ``a long bout of  `Caruso envy.' ''   That first time, he traveled alone. To pass the time, there was the  standard activities--dodging sharks; spearfishing for breakfast, lunch,  and dinner; starting fires with coconut husks and a magnifying glass;  befriending the hermit crabs--you know, typical tourist fare.   In fairness to our friend, maybe a solo getaway has a special appeal  to anyone who grew up as one of 11 children or, for that matter, I can  see why it might tempt a Member of the House, but apparently the appeal  was somewhat broader than the alone time because on subsequent trips  Jeff actually brought company.   A few years ago, he talked our colleague Martin Heinrich into coming  along on one of these adventures. It was just the two of them--and some  TV cameras. This was prime time stuff now. The network called the show  ``Rival Survival.''   That title actually reminds me of something Jeff said to his former  colleagues in the House in his farewell speech, while he was preparing  to come over here. He said coming to the Senate was like entering  ``enemy territory.'' That is a funny phrase, ``enemy territory.'' It is  funny because vitriol and hostility are so precisely not how Senator  Flake will be remembered.   Instead, there have been warm and genuine friendships with colleagues  on both sides of the aisle and shared work on policy accomplishments  that have already made a difference for millions of Americans.   Jeff has cast votes for landmark accomplishments that have tangibly  made life better for middle-class families in his home State and across  the Nation. We don't have enough time here to name them all.   As part of this majority on behalf of the people of Arizona, Senator  Flake gave his vote to start historic tax cuts and tax reform for the  American people and to enact major regulatory reforms and to pass  bipartisan achievements on every subject from the opioid crisis to  caring for our veterans.   So Jeff has achieved much in this high office. He has had a hand in  numerous consequential policy victories. A few years back, he was named  by The Hill newspaper as the No. 1 most beautiful person on Capitol  Hill. Talk about an achievement that few of us can even aspire to.  [[Page S7533]]    Seriously, I think we all know that nothing Jeff has done in these  hallways will rank as his proudest accomplishment. That has to be  persuading Cheryl to marry him and the beautiful family they have built  together, five kids--Alexis, Austin, Tanner, Ryan, and Dallin--and now  grandchildren.   Almost a decade ago, after his first island adventure, Jeff wrote:  ``I will never see a sunset as peaceful as [the ones] I saw there.''   Well, I am not so sure. I suspect that when Jeff is back home with  his lovely family by his side--well, with company like that, I expect  the Arizona sunsets will give those Pacific nights a run for their  money after all.   So we bid farewell to our colleague. We thank him for his service,  and we wish him and his family much happiness in the next chapters they  will be writing together.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, before the chairman on Foreign  Relations Committee leaves, I want to thank him for his extraordinary  leadership. This is a bit of a thicket here with different points of  view, but as a result of what the chairman has just offered, it is a  clear, unambiguous message about how we feel about what happened to  this journalist.   I want to thank him.    Mr. President, I understand that the Senate has  received a message from the House to accompany S. 756.    I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the message  to accompany S. 756.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 756) entitled       ``An Act to reauthorize and amend the Marine Debris Act to       promote international action to reduce marine debris, and for       other purposes.'', do pass with an amendment.
