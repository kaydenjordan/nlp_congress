 Mr. President, Senators are moving forward this week on  two major legislative initiatives: infrastructure and voting rights.   Bipartisan infrastructure talks continue in our Senate committees and  among our Members.   Remember, discussions about infrastructure, both physical and human,  are proceeding along two tracks. The first track is bipartisan, and I  understand there has been some progress. The second track pulls in  elements of President Biden's American Jobs and Families Plan and will  be considered by the Senate even if it does not have bipartisan  support.   Today, we are going to start moving the trains down the second track.  I will convene a meeting with all the Members of the majority party on  the Senate Budget Committee to begin the important work of producing a  budget resolution for the Senate to consider. This is something we have  planned for quite a while, but we are moving forward today after having  individual discussions which I have had with many members of the Budget  Committee.    It is a diverse committee. Senator Sanders is the Chair. Senators  Warner and Kaine are on it as well.   There are many items to discuss, but one subject is not up to debate.  I will instruct members to ensure that any budget resolution puts the  United States on track to reduce carbon pollution at a scale  commensurate with the climate crisis. We need significant reductions in  emissions through clean energy and electric vehicles, as well as  funding to help manufacturers and farmers be a part of the solution in  fighting climate change.   The American Families Plan, as well, is essential to the forthcoming  budget resolution and must be robustly funded.   The Senate will also vote on major voting rights legislation before  the end of June.   Yesterday, the Democratic caucus hosted a group of Democratic  lawmakers from Texas who led the dramatic walkout to prevent the Texas  Republican legislators from passing one of the most draconian voting  laws in our country. It was a powerful meeting. We heard moving  testimony from five different lawmakers about the vicious, nasty, even  bigoted attacks against voting rights in their State.  [[Page S4558]]  The actions taken were totally partisan, just like those in all the  other legislatures. So the idea that this can have some kind of  bipartisan solution befuddles me, because every action taken in the  legislature is done just with Republican State Senators, Republican  assembly members, with no Democratic participation or input. In fact,  the Texas legislators told us they were deliberately excluded from  certain meetings and conference committee hearings.   Speaking for our caucus, we were all taken by the courage of the  Texas legislators, their fortitude, and, most importantly, by their  mission to defend the right of every American to be able to access the  ballot, not just in Texas but across the country. These lawmakers in  one State put everything on the line to protect voting rights in their  State. The Senate should put everything on the line to protect voting  rights in this country.   Now, tomorrow, Senate Democrats will hold another special caucus  meeting to continue discussing the best path forward to achieve voting  rights legislation.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration and the  Senate now proceed to S. Res. 248.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to consideration of S. Res. 273, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, June 17; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be  [[Page S4598]]  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed; further, that upon the conclusion of morning business, the  Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the  Beaudreau nomination, postcloture; further, that the cloture time on  the Beaudreau nomination expire at 11:30 a.m.; that the Senate recess  following the cloture vote on the Tien nomination until 1:45 p.m.; that  if cloture is invoked on the Tien nomination, all postcloture debate  time be expired at 1:45 p.m.; finally, that if any of the nominations  are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's actions.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:25 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, June 17, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
