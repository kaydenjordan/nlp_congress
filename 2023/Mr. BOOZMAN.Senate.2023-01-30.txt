 Mr. President, today I rise to honor the life of  Qubilah Jones who passed away on December 31, 2022, after a long battle  with lymphedema.   Raised in Marianna, AR, Qubilah was called to serve others. She lived  in Jonesboro, AR, but her heart touched people far beyond the city  limits. Qubilah dedicated herself to her family and her community. She  was an active member of Mount Zion Baptist, a published poet, and a  passionate community service advocate.   Qubilah launched her broadcasting career as a radio host at the  nonprofit radio station KLEK in 2016, where she became known as the  Voice of Jonesboro. In this role, she worked to inform the community by  conducting hundreds of interviews with nonprofit, faith-based, and  government leaders in the region.   Even through her battle with lymphedema, those who knew Qubilah best  said she never let the disease stop her from making a positive  difference. She led by example. In 2017, Qubilah was named Volunteer of  the Year for the more than 2,000 hours of community service she  provided, as well as encouraging others to get involved.   She was an inspiration to many with an official proclamation of  Qubilah Jones Day in Jonesboro and her alma mater, Arkansas State  University, having lit its library tower pink in her honor serving as  evidence of her impact. Her advocacy for awareness and treatment of  lymphedema, helped lead to passage of the Lymphedema Treatment Act days  before her passing. This law will help support the needs of others  living with this condition.   I join Qubilah's family, friends, and countless others in mourning  her passing. She has left a tremendous legacy that will last for years  to come.                            ____________________
