 Madam Speaker, obviously, most of the newspapers,  insofar as people still read newspapers, most of the TV shows in the  last month have focused on the impeachment hearings. And we all know  that, at the end of the day, impeachment or no impeachment, President  Trump is not going to be removed in the next year.   So the question is: Why are we spending so much time on impeachment?   I have felt, in the long-term future of America, the most significant  thing going on right now is what is going on with immigration policy in  the United States; and as long as this impeachment hearing has taken  the top of the page in the newspaper, immigration is at the bottom of  the page.   I believe one of the primary reasons for keeping immigration from the  public is they don't want the public to know what is going on in  immigration or what isn't going on in Congress with regard to  immigration.   At its worst, we allowed over 140,000 people in this country in May.  President Trump has been asking for help in this crisis, and he has  gotten no--or virtually no help from Congress. Nevertheless, things  that President Trump has done on his own have reduced that figure, if  only temporarily.    I mention again, 145,000 people caught and processed in May and  probably over another 10,000 people not even processed. That number has  gone down to around 45,000 in September, and we believe it will be even  lower in October. This is largely because of things that President  Trump has done on his own.   He has negotiated with the Mexican Government--to a certain extent,  under threat of tariffs--to put Mexican troops on the southern border.   The Mexican Government is patrolling the interior of its country for  people trying to work their way north, and President Trump has reached  agreements with the triangle countries of Central America, the  countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, and they are  currently taking people coming from farther south who need asylum.   President Trump has also--we wish he was doing more here, but he  began building a wall, and we are working our way toward adding another  450 miles of wall by the end of next year. This is a significant  improvement toward what it should be, but we are still well short of  where we want to be.   What should Congress be doing, or what should we be focusing on while  Congress is spending time debating impeachment?   First of all, we have a shortage of detention beds. So, when ICE is  trying to remove people from this country, there are a lack of beds to  place people in. There is no reason why, given the amount of money we  are spending here, that should not be taken care of.   There have been requests for another 5,000 people in the Border  Patrol, and there are still, unquestionably, people streaming across  this border every month who aren't even counted because we are not  taking care of them.                                time  1700    But there are other things that can be done as well. There is the  Trafficking Victims Protection Act.   Some people talk about children being separated from their parents.  This is something that Congress can solve on its own.   Right now, if children try to come here, single children from Mexico  and Canada, they are returned to their parents to make their families  whole. In a loophole in the law, if children come here from countries  other than Canada and Mexico, we are bound to keep them and separate  them from their families.   Congress should act, and the same law that applies to Mexico and  Canada should apply to Venezuela or Honduras or Guatemala. We have no  business allowing the current law to continue in  [[Page H9291]]  which people are coming here while their parents are in another  country.   We have the Flores settlement in which, right now, people have to be  released after being detained for 20 days. Given the slowness of our  court system, it is not unusual for people to have to be released prior  to the time when a hearing takes place. Again, Congress should act and  spend time on that rather than continue to spend time on impeachment.   We continue to have a problem with sanctuary cities in which, when we  want to remove people even from incarceration types of facilities or  from jails, particularly from jails, sanctuary municipalities are not  allowing us to remove people, even criminal people.   Congress should act, and Congress has not acted, so that we do not  allow these sanctuary cities to forbid access to the jails for ICE to  remove people from this country.   Another thing that should be done is something should be done about  the credible fear standard and when people are allowed in this country  and when people are not allowed in this country. But, again, Congress  has refused to act.   I want to point out that we can do all these things without being  anti-immigrant.   And something that hasn't been noticed in the most recent year: Over  800,000 new people were sworn into this country, and President Trump is  doing nothing to reduce that figure. As a matter of fact, that 830,000  figure is well over the 700,000 figure of the relatively recent past.   President Trump is a friend of legal immigration, but we have to stop  being a friend of illegal immigration.   In other things that encourage people to come here, Secretary Carson  is going to bat and trying to keep our limited, low-income housing  stock available for our own citizens and not people who are here  illegally. It would be good if Congress stepped up to the plate and  said we are going to put our homeless veterans ahead of people who are  in this country illegally.   President Trump is also trying to put work requirements in the SNAP  program. And let's be honest: If we have a program giving away free  food without a work requirement, that is an inducement for people from  other countries to come here.   Congress should, again, convene and bring bills to the floor that put  a work requirement with the SNAP benefit. A work requirement with a  SNAP benefit, making it a less advantageous welfare program, would stop  sending the message for the rest of the world to come into the country.   So, in summary, there are a variety of things that have to be done  and that Congress should be acting on and that the mainstream media and  even the conservative media should be paying attention to because they  are going to affect the future of this country for the next 10 or 20 or  30 years, unlike the impeachment inquiries which we know are going  nowhere, although the impeachment inquiries are keeping other things  off the page.   We need more detention beds.   We have to change the credible fear standard so that less people are  able to come in this country without doing something, without having a  genuine fear.   We have to change the 20 days in the Flores settlement so we are not  required to release people in the country.   And above all, we have to change the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act so that we can remove children from this country and send them back  to their parents in Central America.   I don't know why, with so many people in this institution purporting  to claim that they want families together, we do not amend our current  laws and do with other countries what we already do with Mexico and  Canada, and that is tell an unaccompanied minor: You belong with your  parents. We are not going to separate you from your parents.   However, Congress is not acting. And I think one of the reasons they  are able to get away with not acting on this is because the papers are  filled with impeachment, impeachment, impeachment all day long.   So, in summary, I hope we pay attention to the number of people  coming in this country.   I hope we congratulate President Trump on the things he was able to  do without Congress doing anything, congratulate him on the reduction  of--I will play with my mind here a little bit--reduction of over 70  percent, about 75 percent reduction in the number of people who are  processed in this country compared to 4 or 5 months ago.   But I also think we have to pay attention to the things that we are  not finishing at this time, and I hope the media and the American  public does not take its eye off the immigration ball while we focus on  the impeachment hearing.   And I really hate to say it, but I do believe one of the reasons why  some people want to keep impeachment in the news is, as long as  impeachment dominates the news, we are not talking about Congress'  neglect in doing what they should do to secure our border and to make  sure that the people coming here are people coming here for legal green  cards, legal work visas, and, eventually, to be sworn in as legal  citizens.
