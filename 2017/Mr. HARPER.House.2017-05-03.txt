 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Matthew  McClanahan.   Matthew was a loving and devoted family man, a friend to so many, a  respected employee who worked among our congressional community for the  Office of the Architect of the Capitol. Born in Annapolis, Maryland,  Matthew made his home in Glen Burnie, Maryland. As part of the  maintenance division team of the Capitol Grounds, he was only 30 years  young when he passed away.   Respected by his colleagues and exemplifying hard work and dedication  to his trade, he was known as being good-humored and someone always  ready to lend a helping hand. Our entire congressional community mourns  the loss of one of our own, following the terrible accident that took  place last month on April 18.   Later today, I will stand with my House colleagues in a moment of  silence to honor and remember Matthew McClanahan. My entire staff and I  join with the Architect of the Capitol team in offering his family,  especially his wife, Lauren, and children, Evie and Matthew, our  prayers and deepest sympathies.                            ____________________
