 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment, which affirms  President Biden's budget request of $2 million for the purposes of  supporting the planning for the 2025 World Expo in Osaka, Japan.   My amendment sheds light on a win-win situation for both our country  and my home State of Minnesota.   When I took my oath of office 2\1/2\ years ago, my team and I set out  on an ambitious goal to visit every city and town in Minnesota's Third  District within the first 6 months of my service to listen and learn  from the local leaders who know our community best because I believe  representation begins with listening.   In the city of Bloomington, home of the famous Mall of America, we  learned that city leaders were determined to bring the eyes of the  world to Minnesota by bidding for host city of the 2027 World Expo, and  there is good news. I am proud to share with you that Bloomington was  selected as the United States' designee to compete on the world stage  for hosting rights.   Bloomington, the Twin Cities metro area, the State of Minnesota, and  the United States will benefit from showcasing American innovation on  the world stage. With the funds highlighted in this amendment, we will  ensure that Bloomington has the financial support it needs to put the  full strength of American ingenuity on display.   I want to take a moment to thank the city of Bloomington, Global  Minnesota, and the entire Minnesota delegation for supporting efforts  like these. This is how democracy should work, Democrats and  Republicans in Congress working together with constituents and  government agencies to craft legislation to benefit localities and our  entire country.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with the Biden  administration, just as we did with the Trump administration, to bring  the World Expo home to Minnesota.                                time  1530
