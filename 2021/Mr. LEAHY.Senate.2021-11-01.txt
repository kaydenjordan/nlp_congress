 Mr. President, the Senate today is going to vote on the  confirmation of Vermont's own Justice Beth Robinson, a vote to confirm  her to serve as a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.   As an advocate, Beth Robinson has been rightfully hailed as a  tireless champion for equal rights and equal justice, but more  importantly, her record as a Vermont Supreme Court justice clearly  demonstrates her fairness, her impartiality, and loyalty to the rule of  law above all else.   We Vermonters overwhelmingly support her nomination, including  elected officials--both Republicans and Democrats--the entire Vermont  Supreme Court, and the Vermont Bar Association; they overwhelmingly  support her.   Justice Robinson will fill Vermont's seat on the Second Circuit, and  I believe she is the best, strongest candidate for this position. She  deserves bipartisan support in this Senate, as she got last week on a  vote.   Beth Robinson was appointed to the Vermont Supreme Court by Governor  Peter Shumlin in November 2011. To give you some idea of the bipartisan  support she has had over the years, the Vermont Senate, Republicans and  Democrats, have to vote on her nomination, and they voted unanimously  to have her on the Vermont Supreme Court.   All current Vermont Supreme Court justices, appointed by both  Democratic and Republican Governors, have signed a letter supporting  her nomination to the Second Circuit. For the past decade, she has  served on the court honorably. She has also participated in nearly  1,800 decisions.   Now, I am a member of the Vermont bar, and I pay attention to what  happens, and I see her tenure as being a display of a commitment to the  rule of law. Her unwavering, decade-long dedication as a jurist and her  loyalty to the law above all else has made Beth Robinson an outstanding  Vermont Supreme Court justice. No Vermonter doubts she will carry that  approach to justice with her in the Second Circuit.   Let me talk a little bit about before she was on the bench. Prior to  the time on the bench, Justice Robinson dedicated her legal career to  pursuing liberty and justice for all. She spent the beginning of her  legal career defending workers' rights and advancing discrimination  cases. It was during this time that she worked pro bono as cocounsel to  the plaintiffs in the case Baker v. State that challenged Vermont's  then-protection on same-sex marriage.   She successfully litigated this landmark decision in which the  Vermont Supreme Court upheld equal protections for same-sex couples and  actually led Vermont to become the first State in the Union to enact  civil unions in the country.   As a litigator, her work served as a blueprint for LGBTQ advocacy  across the country. She successfully represented an employee at the  University of Vermont, who sought recognition of his Canadian marriage  to a same-sex partner for health insurance purposes; another, a couple  seeking recognition of their out-of-State marriage in the context of  second-parent adoption; and  [[Page S7529]]  a same-sex partner seeking Social Security survivor benefits for her  child after her civil union partner died.   In every case, she fought to secure legal protections and equality  under the law. In fact, Beth changed the trajectory of LGBTQ rights in  this country. Her tireless work has led our Nation toward justice.   Unfortunately, in what is becoming more and more of a toxic  atmosphere, Justice Robinson's path to confirmation has faced baseless  attacks. At her confirmation hearing, Justice Robinson's commitment to  religious liberty was called into question. Now, these attacks are  simply not grounded in reality. Any honest reading of her record proves  that Justice Robinson is committed to protecting religious liberty.  Some members argued that Robinson's work representing a Catholic woman  who believed she had been discriminated against due to her own  religious beliefs was, astonishingly, evidence of Robinson's hostility  toward religious liberty.   At Justice Robinson's hearing, other members of the Judiciary  Committee quoted her out of context in what I saw as an attempt to  support a false narrative. One member of the committee read part of a  sentence from a marriage law symposium that Justice Robinson  participated in and suggested that it was proof of her hostility toward  religious liberty.   I said ``read part of'' it, but the attack line falls apart the  moment you bother to read the full sentence. In the full quote, Justice  Robinson states:         I've always said that if somebody tried to force the       Catholic Church to do a gay wedding, I would represent the       Church pro bono.    You can't construe that as hostility to religious freedom.   Justice Robinson has a long record of supporting the fundamental  right to religious liberty, both as a judge and as an advocate.   The Vermonters I have heard from--regardless of party or ideology,  regardless of their religion--are delighted that President Biden  nominated Beth Robinson to fill the Vermont seat on the Second Circuit.  Our leading Republicans, our leading Democrats agree with that.   If confirmed, she knows she will become the first openly gay woman to  serve on a Federal circuit court of appeals.   I would urge all Senators to evaluate Justice Robinson's record. And  I hope that Senators of both parties will see, as I have, that she  possesses exactly the right qualities, skills, and experience to excel  as a judge on the Second Circuit.   Before I was in the Senate, I had the privilege to argue cases before  the Second Circuit. I saw it as a court where you never thought of  whether they were Republicans or Democrats; you thought about their  abilities, and I always felt comfortable arguing there. Justice  Robinson, when she becomes Judge Robinson, will give that same view to  anybody who is a litigant before that court.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, the situation in Tigray continues to  deteriorate. Recent bombings by the Ethiopian Government of Tigray's  densely populated capital city, Mekele, has reportedly killed  civilians, including children. Millions of people have been displaced,  and many in Tigray are facing famine. Combatants on both sides of the  conflict have committed atrocities.   The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian  Affairs reported recently that only 14 percent of trucks with relief  aid were getting through to the people of Tigray, due to roadblocks and  lack of fuel. Lifesaving medications have been blocked from getting  into Tigray, which cripples the ability of the UN and their NGO  partners to respond to urgent health needs. If the government does not  permit deliveries of humanitarian aid, more and more people will  needlessly starve to death.   The United States has imposed sanctions against the government in  Addis Ababa. The Congress has also acted. The Fiscal Year 2022  Department of State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill was  introduced in the Senate on October 26, and it would prohibit U.S.  military aid to Ethiopia. It would also require the Department of the  Treasury to oppose international bank loans to the Ethiopian  Government, except to meet basic human needs, until the government  ceases offensive military operation, takes credible and sustained steps  toward a genuine political dialogue to end the conflict, implements  measures to protect human rights, allows unimpeded humanitarian access,  and cooperates with independent investigations of violations of human  rights.   Ethiopia is a country facing every imaginable problem, increasingly  exacerbated by climate change. There is no military solution to the  ethnic rivalries that have divided the country for generations. Any  sustainable solution will only be achieved through negotiation and  compromise. The international community, including the United States,  can help support such a dialogue, but it is the Ethiopian Government's  responsibility to create the conditions for that to occur. Rather than  squander the country's scarce resources on a fruitless, brutal campaign  to dominate Tigray by force, Prime Minister Abiy would be well advised  to listen to the international community  [[Page S7536]]  and support a diplomatic solution. The alternative is famine,  displacement, and unending misery for the people of Tigray, and for  this Nobel Peace Prize winner to be held accountable for crimes against  humanity.
