 Mr. Speaker, in reviewing this censure measure, I  am reminded of Will Rogers' quip: ``I don't make jokes. I just watch  the government and report the facts.''    This month, despite the pressing needs of the American people, we  have spent a week and a half arguing about gas stoves. Next week it  will be about toaster ovens.   Today, we are voting on a joke of a measure to censure Adam Schiff, a  true public servant and patriot. I urge a strong ``no'' against this  resolution targeting a true American hero.
