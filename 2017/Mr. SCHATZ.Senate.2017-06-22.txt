 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, there are two things Americans need to  know about this Republican healthcare plan. The first is that it is  going to make insurance more expensive, and the second is that it is  going to make it harder to get healthcare in the first place. That is  the bottom line of this bill: higher costs for less care--and all for a  tax cut for the rich. That is what we are doing.   We are taking about $800 billion worth of revenue, eviscerating it,  eliminating it. Those tax revenues were basically tax increases passed  under the Affordable Care Act. They were tax increases on the  wealthiest among us. What we are doing is getting rid of all those tax  increases in order to cut Medicaid. That is what this bill does. That  is not what Americans had in mind when they said on a bipartisan basis,  on a majority basis--when they asked Congress to fix healthcare. When  you read the fine print, you see that it gets worse every moment, and  you realize how bad this plan is.   The Senate version did something extraordinary: It actually moved to  the right. And that is a real legislative achievement. Look at  Medicaid. This is a program that helps one out of every five Americans,  two out of every five children in the United States. It helps one out  of every two families who have a newborn baby. And it covers three out  of every four long-term nursing home residents.   This program literally saves lives--nursing home patients; people  struggling with opioid addiction; people who are working two jobs but  still don't make enough to cover their own healthcare insurance--but  with this bill, Medicaid as we know it will be destroyed, all so that  people at the top of the food chain can pay less in taxes.   This bill actually has a certain symmetry to it. There are at least  $800 billion worth of cuts to Medicaid--probably more but at least $800  billion--and it just so happens that there are also around $800 billion  worth of tax cuts for the wealthy. So insurance executives will be OK.  Don't worry about them. What we should worry about is women who need  Medicaid for maternal health services. We should worry about seniors  and people with disabilities.   Activists for disability rights are appropriately freaked out about  this bill. People in wheelchairs protested outside of a Senate office  earlier today,  [[Page S3722]]  and some of them said that they would literally die if this bill  passes. It was an intense protest. And we hope everybody is OK, but it  is intense because these are intense issues.   These are personal issues. These are healthcare issues. People are  worried--not about some abstract public policy or political debate;  they are worried about their own lives. And they are not wrong. Because  of Medicaid, people now have access to physical therapy and  immunizations. They can see a counselor for mental health problems and  opioid addiction. They can afford the medication they need instead of  relying on free samples from clinics. Medicaid has changed everything  for them.   This is not just good for patients, it is also good for taxpayers. By  giving preventive care, we save money. And if TrumpCare becomes law,  those services will go away, thanks to $800 billion in cuts.   This bill also lets insurance companies opt out of covering essential  health benefits. I want to be very clear about this. This is a term of  art. It is a piece of jargon. I am going to go slowly here and not  assume that if you are not in politics, you would understand what an  essential health benefit is.   Basically, if you are getting a healthcare plan, there are 10 things  that, under Federal law, a healthcare plan has to cover. It just makes  sense. I will list them. They are ambulatory patient services;  emergency services, so ER visits; hospitalization--if you have to stay  overnight in the hospital, it has to be covered in your healthcare  plan; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance abuse  services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs;  rehab; laboratory services; preventive wellness and wellness services;  chronic disease management; and pediatric services.   So I want you to imagine a world where you can get an insurance  plan--a so-called insurance plan--but under the law, they can tell you:  By the way, we don't cover hospitalization. By the way, we have this  great insurance plan, but if you need any prescription drugs, those are  out-of-pocket--not a copay; you have to pay all of it. By the way, we  will give you an insurance plan, but if you have mental illness, you  are on your own. By the way, if you get pregnant, we don't cover that.   It is a healthcare plan, which is why we have a statute, a Federal  law, that says ambulatory patient services, emergency services,  hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and  substance abuse services, prescription drugs, rehab, lab services,  preventive and wellness services, and pediatric services have to be  covered. Otherwise, it is not insurance. Every one of these benefits is  covered full stop under the current law, but what the proposal does is  it eviscerates essential health benefits.   I don't know what the CBO is going to say, because they got rid of  the individual mandate, and it is going to be unclear. There is a real  possibility that there will actually be an increase in the number of  people who are covered, but that coverage is going to be nonsense. Can  you imagine having a health insurance plan that doesn't cover maternity  care? Can you imagine--especially nowadays, when half the time when you  go to the doctor, they give you a prescription--so you go to the  doctor, and they say you need this, and you say OK, and then you have  to pay out-of-pocket? What is the point of insurance if none of the  things you need are covered by the insurance? That is what this bill  does.   I am also worried about the distractions in this bill. It defunds  Planned Parenthood and doesn't provide nearly enough for opioid  addiction programs. I want to be clear about what I mean by  ``distraction.'' It is my supposition--I don't know for sure that these  things were intentionally either omitted from the bill or put in the  bill to allow some of my Republican colleagues to get well  legislatively. What do I mean by that? Opioid treatment was tens of  billions of dollars in the House version. They brought it down to less  than $1 billion. That puts somebody on this side of the aisle in a  position to say: Even though I am for $800 billion of Medicaid cuts,  which will eviscerate opioid treatment across the country, I am going  to introduce an amendment and we are going to increase opioid  treatment. Once we get a ``yes'' vote, well, you know, I was really  concerned, but with my amendment, we have more money for opioid  treatment.   Don't fall for that trick. It is a trick. The way to fund opioid  treatment is to fund opioid treatment. Medicaid is both the best way to  do it clinically and the best way to do it fiscally. So I am afraid  they intentionally left that out so somebody can go in and be the hero  on the other side, while not actually solving the problem--likewise  with Planned Parenthood. The way you fund opioid treatment is through  Medicaid.   We had 13 men working in secret without input from any women or  Democrats or experts or advocates.   Part of the thing about healthcare, as the President says, is nobody  knew it was so complicated. But you really need hearings. You really  need to understand how all of the parts of a system interact with each  other. Let me give an example. You cut Medicaid, and somebody who is  Medicaid-eligible but also a veteran--you don't know for sure whether,  if Medicaid services are not available, they are going to go back into  the VA system and cost the VA system more money. If you cut preventive  treatment, you don't know if you are going to end up having to pay on  the back end with more ER services. So the reason you have hearings is  you have to have some rather technical expertise in the room to say:  Hey, if you do this, this might happen. If do you that, this might  happen. If you do this, we are not quite sure what might happen.   But the idea that 13 men with very little expertise in healthcare  policy--they are not unintelligent, they are not unqualified to be  public policy makers, but the whole thing about being in the Senate is  that, for the most part, we are supposed to be, as they say--Jack or  Jane--Jack of all trades, master of none. We are supposed to be pretty  good at receiving information, kind of distilling it, asking the right  kinds of questions, listening to our constituents, and then  crystallizing all of that into a bill.   The problem with this process is they did about one-third of that.  They talked to each other, and they talked to Republican lobbyists, but  they didn't talk to the people back home. They didn't talk to people  who run community health centers. They didn't talk to mental health  advocates.   We have people who come from Hawaii and across the country who  advocate for every specific disease treatment and disease research.  These people usually are touched personally by their issues. They come  in, and most of us receive them and talk to them and think about how to  get them more funding or more reimbursements through NIH or CDC or the  Department of Defense or wherever we can find resources for them.   That is the process of being in a legislative context if you are not  personally an expert on healthcare policy. If you do it in the dark of  night, if you do it literally without any women, if you do it literally  without any people from the other party, you are going to get a bad  product. They knew they were going to get a bad product, but they made  a judgment. They made a judgment.   They decided that the longer this bill sees the light of day, the  lower the chances it has of passing, and I think they are right. I  mean, if this thing is subjected to real sunshine, it will just wither.  That is just a fact. This is why they didn't have any hearings in the  House, this is why they are not only not having any hearings in the  Senate, but they are going to allow for I think it is 20 hours of  debate under this silly vote-arama procedure.   What they will do is, I think, yield back a lot of their time. What  does that mean? That means 20 hours will become 10 hours because they  don't want to defend their bill.   They are absolutely happy to trash the Affordable Care Act and say it  has a series of problems and all the rest of it. You know what, the  Affordable Care Act has a series of problems. No doubt about it. I will  tell you it is way better than this. I will also tell you it is way  better than the situation we had before the act was passed.   The No. 1 cause of bankruptcy in the United States was getting sick.  Think about that. Before this act, people  [[Page S3723]]  would not be just afraid for themselves when they got sick, when  something catastrophic happened to them, either a chronic disease or  something that imperiled their lives or an accident, but you would have  dual anxieties, right? You wondered whether you were going to be OK,  but you also wondered whether you were going to be able to make it  financially.   So we are sort of beyond that, and now we have a law that has been on  the books that does need fixing. I know the Presiding Officer and the  Senator from Missouri, who is waiting to speak, would be pleased-- really would be pleased to participate in a bipartisan process.   I think about the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee, one of the best statesmen in the U.S. Senate, Lamar  Alexander, a Republican with whom I disagree on a lot, but he and Patty  Murray did a bill on public education that got--I don't know--84 votes  or something. Liberal Patty Murray and conservative Lamar Alexander did  a deal. Orrin Hatch, President pro tempore of the Senate, is someone  who worked with my predecessor, who worked with Teddy Kennedy, who did  bills and did deals.   So I understand we are kind of in this squabble about whether there  is good faith or there was good faith. Our view of this is you went  into the reconciliation process before even, in any serious way,  pursuing bipartisan legislation. You decided you wanted 51 votes, not  60 votes, and that was sort of poisonous fruit from the tree. Fine.  That is our view. Your view is that you serially tried to reach out to  us, and we have rebuffed your overtures. I have my view; the  Republicans have their view.   Right now, you are about to walk one-sixth of the American economy  off a cliff, and you are also about to harm tens of millions of  individuals in all of our home States--not Republicans or Democrats or  Greens or Independents or Libertarians or people who don't vote or  whoever it may be, but people are going to really be hurt by this bill.  People are really going to be hurt by this bill.   Forgetting the politics, I think we have an opportunity to avert the  harm. If this bill does come crashing down, then I think we have an  opportunity to work together on healthcare. I, for one, pledge that if  we are in a position to sit down on a bipartisan basis and come up with  improvements to the existing statute, I will be the first person to say  yes to that kind of process. It is not too late. All we need are three  Republicans to say: Let's slow down. Let's have a hearing. Let's work  with Democrats. Let's do this the right way.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Senate recently passed the Department  of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act.  This legislation is intended to improve the VA by strengthening the  process of holding nonperforming VA employees accountable, but it does  this by removing certain due process protections that are currently in  place to protect VA employees from unlawful discrimination or  retaliation. Dr. David Shulkin, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,  asked for this authority to reform the personnel system, and the Senate  obliged his request.   In Hawaii we have a much different and more pressing problem that  this legislation does not address, and that is the challenge we face  with recruitment and retention of VA leaders and filling vacant  positions at the VA.   Nowhere is this challenge more evident than in the VA's yearlong  search to recruit a new executive director for the Pacific Island  Health Care System in Honolulu. During this time, six executive  directors from six different VA healthcare systems on the mainland  rotated through Hawaii on an interim basis. The VA said that its search  dragged on for so long because it faced a shortage of individuals with  the right skills to fill these medical director positions, but that is  no excuse. The VA should have been doing more to develop a pool of  qualified people to fill vacant medical director positions. Failure to  find long-term, stable leadership undermines accountability not only at  the highest level, but across the entire healthcare system.   I am also bothered by the decision to rotate medical directors in  from other healthcare systems, even on an interim basis. This stopgap  measure failed to ensure the proper leadership required to provide  long-term direction for the Pacific Island Health Care System and to  make sure that there was someone to hold accountable for the delivery  of services to the more than 120,000 veterans that the VA is  responsible for in the Pacific. Those veterans and their families  deserve better.   Leadership recruitment is not the only staffing issue we face. In its  September 2016 report on the Pacific Island Health Care System, the  VA's Office of the Inspector General specifically noted that  recruitment and retention of staff is an ongoing challenge across our  neighbor islands, in large part due to cost of living, distance, and  physical isolation. At the time of its report, the OIG noted that there  were 75 unfilled positions at community-based outpatient clinics across  Hawaii. These are vacant positions at clinics that directly affect  veterans' access to healthcare.   I worry that removing important due process protections for VA  employees will only make this problem worse, because, where there are  already issues in physician recruitment and retention, the VA could  compete through the promise of a stable job, in an environment free  from unlawful discrimination or retaliation. Knowing that those  protections are in place is not only helpful to attracting recruits,  but it is helpful to promoting a culture free of inequity and  intimidation because people know they will be held to account for their  actions. That kind of culture is critical to recruitment and retention  because the last thing the VA wants is hard-working employees to search  for  [[Page S3729]]  jobs that offer better working conditions elsewhere.   At our recent subcommittee hearing on military construction and  veteran affairs appropriations, Secretary Shulkin acknowledged that the  VA has seen cases of documented whistleblower retaliation, and that is  important, because it means that Secretary Shulkin is going to have to  be vigilant so that this new legislation is not abused. In his mind, he  is not seeking this legislation so that the VA can fire employees  without any reason or to allow supervisors to abuse them, and I hope  that is how this plays out in practice across the country, but there is  going to be more risk for a workforce of 360,000 that is decentralized,  where decisions are made locally, and so we will be vigilant with him  and will hold Secretary Shulkin accountable for any wrongdoing.   We are still left grappling with the challenge of recruitment and  retention, and unfortunately, this legislation does not address it, and  it may make addressing it even harder. With nearly 50,000 vacant  positions across the VA workforce, Congress needs to get a handle on  this issue because these vacancies risk undermining the delivery of  services and care to our veterans who rely on the VA. We can and need  to do better by them.   Thank you.                            ____________________
