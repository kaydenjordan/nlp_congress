 Mr. Speaker, when Americans pay their taxes, as millions  did yesterday, they expect, rightfully, that their tax dollars will be  used to benefit the many, not just the few; however, that has not been  this Republican Congress' approach.   The tax law Republicans enacted does little to help the middle class  working families and gives 83 percent to approximately 10 million  people, of the benefits, and to 300 million people 17 percent.   According to the independent, nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the  Republican tax law will give the richest Americans an average tax cut  of $33,000, while those who are struggling the most will get maybe $40.   Their tax law is also a breathtaking exercise in its fiscal  irresponsibility, handing our children and our grandchildren a $1.8  trillion bill they will have to pay.   Thanks to the Republican tax law, the CBO now projects a $1 trillion  debt every year for the next 10 years. Somebody is going to have to pay  that bill, and it is our children and our grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, the American taxpayers deserve a system that is fair and  promotes fiscal sustainability. The new Republican tax law does the  opposite.                            ____________________
