 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know why Democrats are so afraid to allow people  to exercise the full extent of their constitutional rights. In my  State, we have got 1.7 million concealed carry permit holders.  Concealed carry permit holders in Florida are eight times less likely  to commit crimes than members of law enforcement.   I think the American people see that, if they had their way, we would  take the bad acts of people who break the law and we would use that as  an excuse to deprive law-abiding people of the full exercise of their  rights.   So I rise in support of the Constitution and to correct a common  mistake. The rights that are enumerated in the Constitution are not  granted to the American people by government. These are God-given  rights, and it is the government's duty to protect them for all  citizens.   For too long, the government has failed to protect the Constitution  and has stripped law-abiding citizens of their freedom. States  recognize driver's licenses from other States, but nowhere in the  Constitution are they mentioned; yet States routinely deny carry  permits from other States, including neighboring States, even though  the Constitution explicitly states that the right of people to keep and  bear arms shall not be infringed.   Mr. Hudson's good bill restores constitutional liberty. I am proud to  join in sponsoring this legislation and to stand with the Constitution  and against those who wish to dismantle it.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to remember the oath that they  swore to uphold and defend the Constitution, and I would encourage them  to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 38.
