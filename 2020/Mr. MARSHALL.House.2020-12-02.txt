 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   American-grown grain is known around the world as the safest, most  reliable, and the highest-quality product in the world. This reputation  remains unchanged and unchallenged, thanks in part to the USDA's  Federal Grain Inspection Service authorized by the U.S. Grain Standards  Act.   The Kansas economy is dependent upon continued strong agriculture  exports and the certainty that comes with strict grain quality and  inspection standards.   Kansas exported almost $4 billion in farm goods to over 96 different  countries this past year, and Kansas remains the seventh largest State  for agriculture exports.                                time  1615    Strong demand for Kansas grain and feed products ensures a strong  Kansas economy.   Through rigorous standards set by our Federal inspection system,  grain and feed products grown by Kansas farm families are eagerly  accepted around the globe. It is because of this predictability,  transparency, and certainty of our Nation's grain inspection system  that the world continues to look to the U.S. for agricultural and food  products.   These high standards are yet another reason the USTR has been so  successful--in fact, renegotiating successfully over 50 percent of our  ag export markets over the past 4 years.   I applaud the passage of the U.S. Grain Standards Act and will remain  [[Page H6031]]  dedicated to removing barriers and leveling the playing field for  agriculture exports. As part of these efforts, it is essential that the  U.S. maintains its reputation and its credibility for safe, high- quality crops and food products.   Through reauthorization of this bipartisan legislation, Congress is  ensuring the continuation of the USDA's grain inspection services and  supporting farmers and ranchers across the country.   Finally, I want to salute and say thanks to two of my great friends  who are mentors and leaders in the ag world. Our current chairman of  the Agriculture Committee, Collin Peterson, I thank the gentleman for  his great leadership and for his friendship. Of course, I salute our  current ranking member and our past committee chairman as well, Mike  Conaway. The chairman has done a great job as well. It has been an  honor to work with the gentleman. I wish both gentlemen Godspeed and  health to all their families.
