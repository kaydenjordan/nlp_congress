 Madam Speaker, today in America, women still make only  $0.80, on average, for every dollar a man makes, and that disparity is  even greater for women of color.   Women are the sole or co-breadwinners in two-thirds of American  families with children. When we pay women less, we hurt American  families, and we hurt our economy.   The pay gap isn't a myth. It is math. For a woman working full time,  the current wage gap represents a loss of more than $400,000 over the  course of her career.   Tomorrow, the House of Representatives has a real opportunity to tell  women in America that they deserve equal pay for equal work. Tomorrow,  we can send a message that when women succeed, America succeeds.   Let's bring America into the 21st century. Let's pass H.R. 7, the  Paycheck Fairness Act.                            ____________________
