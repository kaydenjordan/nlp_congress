 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of National Police  Week and to honor the brave men and women in blue who selflessly serve  in law enforcement across our Nation.   I want to extend my sincere gratitude to the officers back in central  Arkansas, throughout the country, and right here in the U.S. Capitol  who fearlessly defend our families and communities. Our communities  could not run smoothly without the service and sacrifice that law  enforcement officers make for us on a daily basis.   The best way to ensure better community-based policing is to support  our law enforcement agencies with the proper training and the proper  funding that they need. I will always support our law enforcement here  in Washington, and I hope that our country can bond where all our  communities are proud like I am to back the blue.   Once again, I thank all of our dedicated officers in this important  week for their sacrifices and, importantly, their families' sacrifice  as they serve all of our families on a daily basis.                            ____________________
