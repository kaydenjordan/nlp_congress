 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Fireside Winery of Marengo, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Husband and wife Bill and Rona Wyant have always had a passion for  wine. In 2007, they decided to start a winery of their own,  establishing Fireside Winery in Marengo. Fireside Winery allowed the  Wyant family to get back into agriculture but in a new way for their  family farm. The Wyant family farm has been producing Iowa staples like  corn and soybeans in Eastern Iowa for five generations, and the winery  was an excellent opportunity for the Wyants to diversify their family  business. Fireside Winery produces red, white, and sparkling wines from  Iowa-grown grapes on their 22-acre vineyard. Fireside Winery offers  wine tastings in their tasting room, winery tours, live music, and a  beautiful venue for weddings.   The Wyant's hard work has paid off. In 2020, the Iowa Wine Growers  Association awarded Fireside Winery's Storyteller white wine the Best  of Show/Governor's Cup. Bottled in 2018, the Storyteller White was  named silver at the Finger Lakes International Wine Competition in  2018, silver at the Jefferson Cup Invitational in 2018, and gold at the  Mid-American Wine Competition in 2017. In June 2023, the Fireside  Winery's Marengo sparkling wine made history when it was chosen to  christen the USS Iowa SSN 797 nuclear submarine. The christening was  held in Groton, CT, and Fireside Winery was represented by operations  manager Bill and Rona's daughter Cassie Bott and her husband, winemaker  Zach Bott.   Fireside Winery is actively involved in the Marengo community,  hosting the Wine Run 5K. Rona Wyant serves on the board of Iowa County  100+ Who Care, an organization that supports local Iowa County  charitable causes like the Hope For All Foundation, a cancer support  group. Bill and Rona Wyant are members of the Wine Growers Association  and the Iowa Wine Growers Association.   Fireside Winery's commitment to providing quality wines in Iowa is  clear. I want to congratulate Bill and Rona Wyant and the entire team  at Fireside Winery for their continued dedication to the Iowa wine and  agriculture industry. I look forward to seeing their continued growth  and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
