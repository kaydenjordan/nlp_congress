 Madam Speaker, I rise this morning to mourn the loss of  an explosive ordnance disposal warrior.   On Friday, March 22, EOD Sergeant Joey Collette was killed in action  in Afghanistan. At the time, Collette was participating in a joint  U.S.-Afghan special operation.   Sergeant Collette deeply wanted to deploy overseas. He did all he  could and gave his all to serve his country in Afghanistan. He was  loved and respected by his brothers in arms.   He is survived by his wife, Caela, whom he had married only 2 weeks  prior to deploying, and by his beautiful young daughter.   I offer my most sincere condolences to Joey's family and friends. I  ask the rest of Congress to join me in ensuring that Sergeant Joey  Collette and his sacrifice will not be forgotten.   Rest in peace, Sergeant Collette.                            ____________________
