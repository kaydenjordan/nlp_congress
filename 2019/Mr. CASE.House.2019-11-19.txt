 Madam Speaker, I deeply appreciate my friend and colleague  from New Mexico leading this Special Hour and yielding me time to join  in recognizing November as Native American Heritage Month, a time for  us to reflect on and celebrate the rich histories and diverse cultures  of our Nation's indigenous peoples.   It is said that cultural heritage is the sum total of the unique ways  of living of a culture handed down from generation to generation, be  they customs, practices, places, objects, artistic expressions,  language, and values, all amounting to a distinct identity and  integrity as a people.   By that measure, most Americans have some familiarity with the rich  cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the continental United  States and Alaska. It is indeed gratifying to listen to my colleagues  speak of the rich diversity within our continental United States, from  New Mexico to Florida to Washington and Wisconsin.   As we celebrate the heritage, identity, and integrity of these great  peoples this month, I want to highlight that of another indigenous  peoples of our country, the Native Hawaiians.   Because of Hawaii's geographical distance from the U.S. mainland and  our unique history with the United States, most Americans are not aware  of the almost 600,000 among us who identify, in whole or in part, as  Native Hawaiian. Some 50 percent still live in my home State of Hawaii,  and I am deeply humbled to represent a native group with such a deep  and rich heritage all its own.   Today's Kanaka Maoli are descendants of the original voyagers who  made the incredible journey from Kahiki, today's Tahiti and the  Marquesas, somewhere around 1,500 years ago, a full 1,000 years before  the universally recognized indigenous peoples of New Zealand, the  Maori, arrived in Aotearoa.   By the arrival of the West through Captain Cook in 1778, Native  Hawaiians had already long developed, practiced, and handed down a  truly unique cultural heritage, from their own language, dance, and  music to customs and practices, values, and religion. They were truly  their own people, in every sense of the word.   However, like virtually all other indigenous peoples throughout our  country and world, the Kanaka Maoli endured cultural marginalization  and discrimination to the point that, by the middle of the 20th  century, their cultural heritage was at risk for extinction, as has  happened with most other indigenous cultures throughout our history.   Beginning in the mid-1960s, though, a renewed interest in traditional  Hawaiian arts and culture began to emerge, driving deep cultural pride  and resurgence. The ranks of prominent Native Hawaiians include figures  such as George Na'ope, a kumu hula who, with others, brought back the  study and practice of ancient hula. I had the honor of presenting  ``Uncle George'' as a 2006 National Heritage Fellow here, our Nation's  highest honor in folk and traditional arts.   The Hawaiian language itself had virtually disappeared after  statehood. But in 1982, a small group of Hawaiian language educators  came together and formed the Punana Leo preschools, which focused on  nurturing a new generation of Native Hawaiian speakers through  education in the Native Hawaiian language, the Olelo. The first school  was established in 1984 in Kekaha, Kauai. Today, there are many such  schools and thousands of Native Hawaiian language speakers.   Another ancient practice prominent in the Hawaii renaissance was the  art of Polynesian voyaging. Hundreds of years had passed since the last  voyage, and the ancient ways of navigating had been lost. But in 1975,  the Polynesian Voyaging Society built the Hokule'a, a traditional  outrigger canoe first captained by Elia Kawika David Ku'ualoha, whose  mission was to follow in the footsteps of Native Hawaiians and sail  unaided across Polynesia.   Today's voyaging canoes sail freely across the Pacific and even  around the world in the ancient ways, an amazing symbol of cultural  recovery.   These kanaka are just a few of the tens of thousands of Native  Hawaiians and others who simply decided that the rich cultural heritage  of the indigenous peoples of Hawaii would not die but would be carried  forward into generations to come. Their stories, and the story of all  Native Hawaiians, should not be left unrecognized by this Congress,  either today or in the laws of our country focused on indigenous  peoples.   I am honored to recognize them and their special contributions and  legacy to our great country and to join all of my colleagues who  advocate so forcefully for our indigenous peoples.   Madam Speaker, again, ``mahalo nui loa,'' thank you very much, to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico for bringing us together to celebrate  Native American Heritage Month. May all Americans reflect on the  diverse cultural legacy gifted to all of us by all indigenous peoples  of our Nation.                                time  1700
