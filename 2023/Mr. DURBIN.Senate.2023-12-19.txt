 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it has been 2 months since the horrific  Hamas attack that killed 1,200 innocent Israelis and saw another 240  people taken hostage--some of them Americans, including Hersh Goldberg- Polin with family in my State of Illinois.   For anyone who watched 60 Minutes this past weekend, the ordeal  shared by one of the released hostages was harrowing and almost  unimaginable. These hostages have been subjected to brutal physical and  psychological torture. Some 115 hostages are believed to still be held,  and I have long called for a humanitarian pause by both sides that  includes the release of all the hostages as quickly as possible.   I believe this remains the right path forward, and I hope our  government will pursue this goal. But make no mistake, this Hamas  attack was a reminder that there are still those who do not recognize  Israel's right to exist. I do; and I understand their right to self- defense.   But what has happened since October 7 raises larger questions about  how Israel should defend itself, how it should retaliate and address  the long-term need for two neighboring people to learn to live in  peace.   Early in this conflict, I urged Israel to learn from our mistakes in  the United States after the deadly attacks on September 11, to not make  the mistakes in the fog of their rage and pain that we made. I fear  some of the important lessons we learned the hard way may not have been  heeded by this Israeli Government.  [[Page S6035]]    While Israel has every right to defend itself, the humanitarian toll  inflicted on the people of Gaza has been of historic magnitude and  increasingly becomes counterproductive to Israel's long-term security.   We are nearing an estimated 20,000 deaths in Gaza. A significant  majority of those are not Hamas fighters--they are innocent women and  children.   Last week, the leaders of some of the world's top relief  organizations wrote in the New York Times:         More children have been reported killed in this conflict       than in all major global conflicts combined last year.    Hospitals have had to try to treat civilians without the most basic  medicines, using only Tylenol for pain management--even in  amputations--and vinegar as a disinfectant of last resort.   There are growing fears that disease outbreaks will soon replace the  war as the primary cause of death in Gaza. This is simply not an  acceptable strategy.   Over the last few weeks, I have spoken to UN Secretary General  Antonio Guterres, UN Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs  Martin Griffiths, and Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry about  reopening hospitals under third-party monitoring.   I have also raised the humanitarian toll directly with Israeli  officials. Basic medical needs, beyond treating the wounded, are  staggering and include curbing a potential infectious disease outbreak  and caring for thousands of expectant mothers.   As such, I again call on Hamas and Israel to stand down from all  military actions around Gaza's hospital and allow them to function and  be resupplied under a credible, third-party monitor.   I also continue to remind our Israeli allies that any U.S. military  assistance must be used in accordance with the laws of war; and, as  such, I have joined Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland on an  amendment to the proposed National Security Supplemental reinforcing  this basic point.   The burden is higher in times of war for democracies, but adherence  to such norms is what makes democracy distinct.   This horrible conflict has caused so much suffering and is a wake-up  call to the need for a two-State solution that allows for a viable  Palestinian State living in peace side by side with a secure Israel.   For years, I have warned that despite heroic efforts at such an  agreement, spoilers on both sides have repeatedly undermined progress.  So we have two challenges, one very immediate: End the suffering and  release the remaining hostages immediately; and the second, finally  commit to finding a two-State peace agreement.   This will take leadership from both Palestinians and Israelis. And  let me be blunt: I do not see the current leadership of either having  the vision or political will to take this desperately needed step.   But it is the only way forward. It is the only way that the region  and international community will fully commit to helping rebuild Gaza  and support a unified Palestinian leadership. It is the only way to end  the threat of violence and bring a future of hope to both Israel and  the Palestinian people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mr. Padilla)  and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Chirstopher Charles Fonzone to serve as Assistant Attorney General for  the Office of Legal Counsel, OLC.   After graduating from Cornell University and Harvard Law School, Mr.  Fonzone clerked for Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and later Justice Stephen Breyer on the  U.S. Supreme Court. Subsequently, Mr. Fonzone held a number of roles in  the Obama administration: attorney on the appellate staff in the Civil  Division at the Justice Department, special counsel in the Office of  the General Counsel at the Department of Defense, attorney-adviser in  OLC, special assistant and associate counsel in the White House  Counsel's Office and Deputy National Security Council--NSC--Legal  Adviser, and deputy assistant and counsel in the White House Counsel's  Office and NSC Legal Adviser.   After working in private practice at Sidley Austin for several years,  Mr. Fonzone returned to public service as the general counsel for the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI. In this role,  Mr. Fonzone provides advice and counsel to the Director of National  Intelligence and other senior ODNI leaders on a range of legal issues  facing the Agency, including intelligence law, employment matters,  administrative matters, and budgetary and fiscal issues.   Mr. Fonzone's demonstrated track record advising the U.S. Government  and clients on a range of complex legal issues will serve him well when  he is confirmed to lead OLC.   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Fonzone's nomination.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mr. Padilla)  and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mr. Padilla)  and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Sara Hill to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of  Oklahoma.   Ms. Hill has deep ties to Oklahoma. Born in Tahlequah, OK, she  received her B.A. from Northeastern State University, cum laude, and  her J.D. from the University of Tulsa College of Law. She then began  working for the Cherokee Nation in Tahlequah, where she served as an  Assistant Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Secretary of  Natural Resources, and Attorney General. She also served as a special  assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern  District of Oklahoma in Tulsa. Since leaving her role as Attorney  General, Ms. Hill has worked as a solo practitioner at Hill Law, PLLC  in Tahlequah. She also serves as a voting, at-large member of the  Tribal Issues Advisory Group of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Ms.  Hill has significant litigation experience in State, Federal, and  Tribal court. Over the course of her career, she has tried 43 cases to  verdict, and as Attorney General for the Cherokee Nation, she had  constitutional responsibility for all litigation of the government and  its businesses.   Ms. Hill is strongly supported by both of her home State Senators, as  well as by the Oklahoma and Native American legal communities. The  American Bar Association unanimously rated her as ``qualified'' to  serve on the Northern District of Oklahoma. If confirmed, she will be  the first Native American woman to serve as a Federal judge in  Oklahoma.   When Senator Lankford introduced Ms. Hill at her confirmation  hearing, he called her ``an exceptionally impressive nominee'' and said  that he and his staff ``have found her to be one of the smartest people  in the room in just about any room she walks in.'' I agree on both  counts. I am proud to support this nominee, and I urge my colleagues to  join me.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mr. Padilla)  and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mr.  Padilla), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from  Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent.
