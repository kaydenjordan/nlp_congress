 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to confront a cancer that has  been rapidly spreading, and that cancer is anti-Semitism, here at home  and around the world.   It is unsettling, and it is downright appalling. Day after day, I see  new headlines about disparaging rhetoric and violence against the  Jewish people.   The Anti-Defamation League reports that 80 percent of European Jews  feel anti-Semitism in their country is increasing, and 40 percent live  in daily fear of physical attack.   In 2018, here at home, there were 1,879 reported anti-Semitic  incidents in the United States. Our Nation was founded on freedom of  religion and diversity, and we must do everything necessary to preserve  it.   To that end, today, the House passed H.R. 943, the Never Again  Education Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. It funds Holocaust  education programs around the country.   Mr. Speaker, America cannot and will not become a breeding ground for  hatred.                            ____________________
