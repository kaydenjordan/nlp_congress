 Mr. Speaker, prescription drug prices are skyrocketing.  Every day, constituents tell me about outrageous prices they are forced  to pay for medications just to stay healthy.   Janice from Albany, in my district, wrote me last year about a drug  she takes to manage her mental illness. Her monthly cost went from $9  to $342.   Irene from Hagaman has said her monthly prescriptions have jumped  from $35 to $250.   Regina from Rexford saw the monthly cost of her rheumatoid arthritis  medicine jump from $2,800 to $3,700 in just one year. That is a bad  deal.   Every Member of this body has heard these stories. Despite these  cries for help from our constituents, Congress has failed to act.  President Trump made lowering prescription drug prices a centerpiece of  his campaign. What has he done about it?   America leads the world in developing new and innovative lifesaving  cures, something we should be proud to continue; but many of our own  citizens don't have real access to those innovative treatments. That is  a bad deal. Drug pricing is complex, but in the richest Nation on  Earth, no one should have to go bankrupt to obtain lifesaving medicine.  We have to do better.  [[Page H3890]]  We need greater transparency, more aggressive negotiation, no more pay- for-delay on generic drugs, and more. Democrats have a better deal to  offer the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste  Policy Amendments Act.   First, let me recognize the hard work done by Mr. Shimkus on this  bill. He has been tireless in this effort. And to his and his staff's  credit, he has worked with us to make what I believe are a number of  improvements to the given bill. Regardless of your position on nuclear  energy, we have to acknowledge the reality that tens of thousands of  tons of waste already exist. This is a problem for over 120 host  communities across our country, and it will not be solved by continuing  to ignore it.                                time  0915    But even if you do not represent one of those communities, all of our  constituents are paying for this waste. Decades ago, the Federal  Government entered into agreements to remove it from nuclear plants.  Deadlines have been missed, and now all taxpayers have a legal  liability of over $34 billion, which is being paid from the Treasury's  Judgment Fund.   In my view, the most important thing this bill does is set up a path  forward on interim storage, which will allow spent nuclear fuel to be  stored in a consolidated location on a temporary basis while a  permanent repository is pursued.   The bill includes language based upon a proposal developed by our  colleague, Doris Matsui, to allow the Secretary of Energy to enter into  an agreement to establish an interim storage pilot program, which can  move forward directly after enactment.   Consolidating waste at a small number of sites instead of 121  communities across our country will help ensure waste is managed more  safely and securely while allowing those 121 sites to begin to be  redeveloped for other purposes.   I know a number of our colleagues have concerns with this bill, and I  understand their position. And many Members that support this bill,  including myself, have not passed judgment on the merits or final  disposition of the Yucca Mountain project. That is why Members of the  minority demanded a number of troubling Nevada-related provisions be  removed from the bill during the committee process.   This bill will not rubber-stamp the Yucca permitting application. The  Nuclear Regulatory Commission will still need to adjudicate the many  remaining issues with the application, and it will need appropriations  in order to do so.   I know we will hear about the challenges of transporting spent fuel  to a final repository, but the reality is nuclear material is already  moved around our country today without incident due to strict safety  requirements. The only alternative to not moving this waste is keeping  it spread out in 121 locations for tens of thousands of years.   Overall, this bill is a step in the right direction toward beginning  to address our Nation's very difficult nuclear waste issues, which is  why it was reported out of committee by a vote of 49-4.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), our outstanding ranking member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Nevada.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada  (Mr. Kihuen).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Rosen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gene Green).    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, it is very rare that we consider a perfect bill. This  is not the bill Mr. Pallone or I would have written on our own, and I  do not think it is a bill Mr. Shimkus would have wanted on his own  either, but that is the nature of compromise.   I again want to thank Mr. Shimkus and his staff for their willingness  to work with us to address a number of our concerns with the initial  bill.   And I want to acknowledge the hard work done by Tuley Wright, Rick  Kessler, and other members of the Energy and Commerce Committee  minority staff, who worked so diligently on this legislation.   I truly understand the concerns raised by my colleagues in  opposition, especially those from the Nevada delegation, and I  sympathize with many of their arguments, but the reality is our Nation  has a substantial amount of nuclear waste, and we as a Nation need a  plan to address it.   We are dealing with the constraints of legislation passed some 30  years ago, and within those constraints, I believe this bill is a step  in the right direction to address our Nation's nuclear waste issues.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I know that this  takes the issue and the response of this bill and makes it even  stronger. With that in mind, I thank my colleague and those with whom  he worked on this amendment for their input, and for, again, an  amendment that makes the response so much stronger.   With that, I plan to support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for  yielding, and I stand in support of the amendment.   I thank the gentleman from Illinois and the gentlewoman from New York  for their hard work on the amendment and for the sensitivity shown the  people in host communities for our nuclear facilities across our  country.   Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment and encourage our colleagues  to do likewise.
