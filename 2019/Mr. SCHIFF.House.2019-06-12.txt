 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment in  support of vaccines and their medical effectiveness. Specifically, my  amendment would direct $5 million to amplify a public health campaign  to promote vaccine usage and combat hesitancy.   These funds would support the work of the National Vaccine Program  within the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy, which  provides a framework for pursuing the prevention of infectious diseases  through immunizations.   It is the Nation's leading roadmap in articulating a comprehensive  strategy to develop new and improved vaccines, enhance the vaccine  safety system, and support communications to enhance vaccine  decisionmaking.   Each year, vaccines are estimated to save 2 to 3 million lives  worldwide. Due to effective vaccination campaigns, what were once  referred to as the usual diseases of childhood are now considered  vaccine-preventable diseases.   Unfortunately, vaccines are a victim of their own success. These  monumental public health achievements have contributed to a false  perception that disease threats are minimal, and that routine  vaccination is no longer necessary.   This year alone, we have witnessed numerous outbreaks of measles  across the country, a disease that was once considered eradicated in  the United States.   Declining vaccination rates pose an imminent threat to public health.  In fact, the World Health Organization has identified vaccine hesitancy  as a top global health threat for 2019.                                time  2000    There is strong evidence to suggest that at least part of the source  of this trend is the degree to which medically inaccurate information  about vaccines surfaces on websites where many Americans get their  information.   Repetition of information, even if false, can often be mistaken for  accuracy, and exposure to antivaccine content via social media may  negatively shape user attitudes towards vaccination.   The emergence of vaccine hesitancy as an increasingly common theme in  healthcare settings demands attention, and it is imperative for public  health officials to take a necessary and critical step to flip the  script from vaccine hesitancy to vaccine confidence to protect and  bolster the public health.   The scientific and medical communities are in overwhelming consensus  that vaccines are both effective and safe. There is no evidence to  suggest that vaccines cause life-threatening or disabling diseases, and  the dissemination of unfounded or debunked theories about the dangers  of vaccination pose a great risk to the public health.   Support for the national vaccine program and coordinating a national  public health campaign to fight vaccine misinformation is imperative.  It is essential, now more than ever, that we fund vaccine communication  research to strengthen the evidence base for what works in fighting  vaccine hesitance, combating misinformation, and encouraging  responsible vaccine decisionmaking.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), the chairwoman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.    Madam Chair, I thank the chair for her support.   This amendment sends a clear message to the American people that  Congress recognizes the importance of vaccination and immunization in  the  [[Page H4564]]  United States and urges individuals to follow the advice of their  doctors in favor of timely vaccinations for themselves and their  children.   Madam Chair, I again ask my colleagues to support this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.
