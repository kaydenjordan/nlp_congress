 Mr. Speaker, tonight in Bismark, there is an event  honoring the State senate career of Nicole Poolman.   Elected in 2012, Nicole served in the North Dakota State senate for a  decade. She used her career as a teacher to educate members of the  Senate on how to govern with intelligence, competence, and grace.   Mr. Speaker, I know this better than most. She was my seatmate on the  floor of the State senate for 6 years. Because of her friendship, I  have become a better public servant, and more importantly, I have  become a better person.   She is retiring from the senate to continue to focus on her true  passion, teaching.   This year marks her 25th year as an educator. In that time, she has  taught in three high schools and has had such a positive impact on  thousands of North Dakota students. The North Dakota State government  is going to miss her dearly. But their loss is her students' gain. I am  so very proud to call her my friend.                            ____________________
