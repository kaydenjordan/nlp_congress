 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Reschenthaler), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am confused, Mr. Speaker, because after months of hearing from  Republicans that they want to address bread  [[Page H591]]  and butter issues, that they want to do something about the issues  facing everyday people in this country, the issues that we hear about  when we go home, we are here instead wasting the time of this body with  two useless, stupid, political stunts which are about dividing people,  distracting people.   Make no mistake, these are FOX News talking points, Tucker Carlson  sound bites, press releases. That is what they are. And the reason why  is clear.   When Democrats were in charge, we had one of the most productive  Congresses in history. We passed the biggest climate change bill ever.  We passed the biggest infrastructure bill since the interstate highways  were built. We passed a bipartisan gun violence bill, stood up to  greedy corporations, lifted kids out of poverty, and brought jobs and  manufacturing back to America.   What are Republicans doing? What are they pushing instead of kitchen- table issues?   Conspiracy theories, nationwide abortion bans, a 30 percent national  sales tax on groceries and gas, cuts to Social Security and Medicare,  giveaways to billionaire corporations so they can cheat on their taxes;  that is the kind of garbage that they are wasting the American people's  time on.   H. Con. Res. 9 claims to denounce the horrors of socialism. What is  this, the Red Scare?   I have to say, this is about the stupidest bill I have ever seen.  Just a stupid, stupid, stupid bill.   Let me just say to my Democratic colleagues, vote however you want on  this. It doesn't matter because it does nothing at all.   Oh, it denounces Pol Pot. Of course, we denounce Pol Pot. I have  never heard anyone say anything nice about him.   We denounce Stalin. I didn't know that that needed a resolution.   We denounce Kim Jong-Un. Well, not all of us actually, because, in  fact, if I remember correctly, it was the leader of the Republican  Party, Donald Trump, who said he fell in love with him, who talked  about how talented he was, who called him a great leader, who bragged  about their chemistry.   Did any of my Republican colleagues speak up when a brutal tyrant  named in this resolution was applauded on the world stage by the  President of the United States? Did they denounce that?   What is interesting, Mr. Speaker, one name I notice was missing from  this list: Vladimir Putin. What is up with that?   I mean, we condemn Lenin and Stalin but not Putin? Is that a Trump  thing? Did he put in a call? Seriously, why is Putin left out?   By the way, this isn't just a stupid bill, it is a badly written  stupid bill. It lays out all of these awful people and then says, ``We  are rejecting the implementation of socialist policies in the United  States of America.''   Nobody, not a single person so far, has been willing to clarify for  me what exactly that means, what the hell they are talking about.   Are we talking about public schools here? Fire departments? Roads?   What about Medicare and Social Security?   Republicans have called Medicare and Social Security socialist  programs for years.   We would just like a little clarification here, and we got none last  night in the Rules Committee. None. We even tried to include an  amendment to clarify that the language here does not imply cuts to  Social Security and Medicare. Every Republican, every single Republican  on the Rules Committee voted ``no.'' There is our answer. There is our  answer.   Here is what I think: I think this is about scaring people, and it is  about dividing people, and it is about distracting people.   That brings me to our next resolution, which removes our colleague  Congresswoman Ilhan Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I  mean, the hypocrisy here is staggering. It literally takes my breath  away.   Congresswoman Omar has apologized for the things that she said. She  said she wants to be an ally in the fight against anti-Semitism. She  even voted to condemn anti-Semitism. Every Democrat did, as well.   You know who voted ``no''? Twenty-three Republicans. Twenty-three  Republicans voted against condemning anti-Semitism. Maybe the gentleman  can explain whether or not they should be removed from their  committees.   Then we gave our colleagues on the Rules Committee the chance to add  an amendment to their socialism resolution condemning the mass murder  of 6 million Jewish people by the Nazis, also known as the National  Socialist German Workers' Party.   Guess what? They all voted ``no.'' They all voted ``no.'' Oh my God.  Wow.   I keep hearing this both sides stuff, trying to make false  equivalencies, saying the Democrats opened the door to removing her.  Give me a break.   Congresswoman Omar never posted a video pretending to kill another  Member of Congress. She never advocated putting a bullet in the head of  the Speaker of the House of Representatives. She never had dinner with  Neo-Nazis Nick Fuentes and Kanye West. She never spoke at a white  supremacy conference. She never said that she would have won January 6  because she was armed. No, those are things Republicans have done and  have said.   I will ask again, why aren't those Members being removed, too?   Please, to my friends on the other side, please spare us the absurd  comparisons and lectures about anti-Semitism. Republicans refuse to  condemn anti-Semitism. Republicans refused to add an amendment  condemning Nazis to this socialism resolution. Republicans have been  silent while members of their Conference say things that are blatantly  anti-Semitic and appear beside Holocaust deniers and bigots.   These are awful, awful bills designed to divide and distract people.  I get it. I mean, I get why. I would want to divide and distract  people, too, if my agenda was as extreme as the agenda that the Speaker  of the House is now advocating for.   They have spent their entire time in power so far pushing for higher  gas prices, higher middle-class taxes, higher inflation, and higher  drug costs. They are screwing working families, screwing poor people,  and using stupid BS like this to distract from their plans to reward  billionaire corporations and hurt working families.   In the middle of it all, they are threatening to trigger a default if  we don't cut Social Security and Medicare. We can waste all the time in  the world on these resolutions--and on the socialist resolution, again,  I don't even care. This is such a waste of time. People can vote any  way they want. I have just made it a habit to always vote ``no'' on  stupid bills. This is a waste of our time and a waste of the American  people's time.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H593]]    I listen to this debate, and I get more and more confused.   The gentleman from Pennsylvania said that Vladimir Putin was not put  on this list because he is a Communist, yet the gentleman mentioned  communism several times.   The gentlewoman just talked about the Communist Manifesto, and I am  looking at the list of people that are mentioned. Among them is Pol  Pot, who I think everybody believes was viewed as a Communist.   So again, I am trying to figure out why wasn't Putin included on this  list. Did somebody get a call from the Mar-a-Lago prison line that you  couldn't put Putin on this list? I don't quite get it.   Again, I am also just stunned that last night, I mean, we offered the  Gottheimer amendment. The language basically said that fascism led to  the murder of 6 million Jewish people by the Nazi regime.   Everybody on the Republican side voted ``no.''   Again, we asked for some clarification on really what the guts of the  bill were, which is the resolved clause.   What are you talking about? What policies are you against here in the  United States? We asked to make the Takano amendment in order, which  would have basically said that Social Security and Medicare would be  exempt from any cuts if this was not what the intention was. Every one  of the Republicans--every one of them--voted ``no.''   There was a gentleman who just came down on the floor saying, ``I  don't know why everybody is saying Republicans want to cut Social  Security and Medicare.''   You know why? Because of what happened last night in the Committee on  Rules.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, last night in the Committee on Rules,  the Democrats offered an amendment that would clarify that any  opposition to socialist policy implementation in the United States does  not include existing Federal programs such as Medicare, Social  Security, TRICARE, VA Healthcare, the VA Home Loan program, VA burial  benefits, and VA homelessness programs.   My Republican colleagues voted against it. We want to give them a  second chance to get this right.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to this rule to include this important amendment and give  every Member on the floor the opportunity to clarify that existing  Federal programs like Social Security and Medicare are not under attack  by this new Congress. Forgive us if we are concerned by rhetoric from  many Members on the other side of the aisle past and present, give us  pause.   Republicans have called Social Security a socialist program. I  remember when Newt Gingrich wanted Medicare to wither on the vine.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous materials  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, Social Security is the bedrock of our  Nation's social safety net. Since its inception, it has lifted millions  of our seniors out of poverty. Protecting the benefits it and other  programs provide, should be a priority for this Congress. As my  Republican colleagues demand reckless cuts in exchange for paying for  our Nation's bills, we on the Democratic side are going to remain  unified in doing everything we can to protect these important programs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano), the amendment sponsor, to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a strange debate. I am glad the gentleman said  that he personally condemns Vladimir Putin, but it still doesn't  explain why Putin is not on this list.   I mean, if everybody condemns Vladimir Putin, then why isn't he on  this list? There are other communists on this list. If we are going to  condemn communism, fine, but communism isn't mentioned in this  resolution.   People were talking about supporting capitalism, and capitalism isn't  even mentioned in this resolution.   This is a stupid resolution that was written poorly to begin with.   Again, I would say to my colleagues that we gave you an opportunity  to expand the list to include the National Socialist German Workers'  Party, which is the Nazis, who are responsible for the killing of 6  million Jews, and everybody voted ``no'' on the Republican side. I just  can't get my head around why that was such a controversial addition.   This is an interesting back and forth on history. By the way, when I  go home, people are not bringing up Stalin and Lenin and Pol Pot all  the time. They are bringing up Putin, and they are concerned about what  he is doing in Ukraine.   Maybe the reason Putin is not on this list is because the other side  of the aisle is divided in their support to help protect the  sovereignty of the Ukrainian people. Maybe that is what we are going to  see coming down the road, in terms of budget cuts.   I include in the Record a piece by Roll Call titled: ``House GOP  overlooks internal anti-Semitism, points at Democrats.''                       [From Roll Call, Dec. 1, 2022]       House GOP Overlooks Internal Antisemitism, Points at Democrats                             (By Rachel Oswald)         House Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are declining to       condemn and punish antisemitism within their own party,       preferring instead to argue that Democrats have the prejudice       problem.        This comes amid the rise and mainstreaming of antisemitic       rhetoric in the United States in recent months, including by       major entertainers and top athletes, not to mention a sharp       uptick in the last year of assaults on American Jews. Hate       speech, threats and violence against American Jews are at       their highest documented level in decades.        The issue came into focus in the last week after former       President Donald Trump welcomed to his Mar-a-Lago club in       Florida for dinner the well-known white power leader and       antisemite Nicholas Fuentes, an organizer and speaker at many       ``Stop the Steal'' protests after the 2020 presidential       election.        ``Anyone who engages in antisemitic tropes or makes       antisemitic remarks should face the consequences of his or       her actions. It's not enough to just call out someone on the       other side of the aisle when it meets your political aims,''       Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said       in a statement. ``Frankly, what we need to see more of, is       leaders of both parties standing up to antisemitism within       their own ranks.''        Some Republican leaders like Senate Minority Leader Mitch       McConnell of Kentucky denounced Trump's dinner with Fuentes       while others, such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of       California, offered milder criticism.        ``I don't think anybody should be spending any time with       Nick Fuentes. He has no place in this Republican Party,''       said McCarthy to reporters outside the White House on       Tuesday. He went on to defend Trump, claiming the former       president was ignorant of Fuentes' well-known racist and       antisemitic views when he had him over for dinner.        At the same breaking-bread affair, Trump also hosted the       hip-hop superstar Kanye West, who now goes by Ye and drew       national scorn in recent weeks for verbal attacks on Jews on       social media.        ``I condemn his [Fuentes'] ideology. It has no place in       society at all,'' said McCarthy, who is struggling to lock       down the votes he needs from his caucus to become the next       House speaker in January. Like other Republicans, McCarthy       has stopped short of directly saying Trump has supported       antisemitism with his actions.        In part to boost support for his candidacy with the       conservative House Freedom Caucus, McCarthy has promised if       he becomes speaker he will hold a House floor vote to remove       Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from the Foreign Affairs Committee.       As a freshman lawmaker in 2019, Omar was roundly criticized       for comments that elevated common antisemitic tropes about       dual loyalty and Jewish influence over American politics.        Notably, however, House Democratic leaders led the       criticism of Omar and she apologized. Though there have been       other moments of tension in the ensuing years between Omar       and the House's Jewish Democrats over her criticism of       Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, she hasn't repeated       the antisemitic tropes she made in early 2019.        The expected next chairman of the House Foreign Affairs       Committee, Michael McCaul, said he would likely support       Omar's removal from the panel.        ``The Foreign Affairs Committee has always been very pro-      Israel, pro-Jewish, and I don't think she's a perfect fit,''       the Texas Republican said on Tuesday.        Omar in a statement rebuked McCarthy and House Republican       leaders.        ``Whether it is Marjorie Taylor Greene holding a gun next       to my head in campaign ads or Donald Trump threatening to       `send me back' to my country . . . this constant stream of       hate has led to hundreds of death threats and credible plots       against me and my family,'' she said of Taylor Greene.        ``Instead of doing anything to address the open hostility       towards religious minorities in his party, McCarthy is now       lifting up people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Emmer and so       many others,'' Omar said. ``If he cared about addressing the       rise in hate, he would apologize and make sure others in his       party apologized.''        In contrast to Omar, some House Republicans haven't       apologized, repeating antisemitic conspiracy theories and       amplifying Holocaust deniers--including in the last year.  [[Page H595]]                                 `Keeping that promise'         McCarthy indicated he sees removing Omar from the panel as       fair play for the treatment Taylor Greene and Gosar received       from House Democrats. . . .        ``Last year, I promised that when I became Speaker, I would       remove Rep. Ilhan Omar from the House Foreign Affairs       Committee based on her repeated antisemitic and anti-American       remarks. I'm keeping that promise,'' McCarthy said in a Nov.       19 Twitter post.        Gosar was also removed from his committee assignments a       little over a year ago as punishment for circulating an       animated video depicting him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-      Cortez, D-N.Y. . . .        Though he reportedly privately reprimanded Gosar for       publicizing the video, McCarthy didn't support taking away       his committee assignments, nor did the rest of the GOP House       caucus save for two members.        Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who earlier this month won a       contested caucus election for the position of majority whip       in the next Congress, made a similar reference in a letter he       sent as National Republican Congressional Committee chairman       that accused Bloomberg, Soros and Steyer of having ``bought''       control of Congress for Democrats.        ``One of the most popular unfortunately antisemitic tropes       is the idea that Jews are pulling the strings,'' said Rabbi       Jill Jacobs, the executive director of T'ruah: The Rabbinic       Call for Human Rights.        ``People aren't expected to know everything about       antisemitism, but when something gets called out the right       response is, `Thank you for letting me know. I didn't know       that. I won't do that again.' We have not seen that from       McCarthy and others. We have just seen deflecting and       rejecting,'' she added.        And Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., the No. 3 House       Republican, this year ran a series of Facebook ads through       her campaign committee that accused Democrats of supporting       citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in order       to ``overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent       liberal majority.''                              hate and violence         That phrasing echoes the ``great replacement theory,'' a       far-right idea that is itself rooted in antisemitic tropes.        ``When you look at white nationalist online chatter, it's       very much all about this supposed Jewish plot. We saw it in       the person who murdered Jews in a synagogue in Pittsburgh,''       said Jacobs, referring to the 2018 antisemitic terrorist       attack at the Tree of Life synagogue that killed 11 people.       ``His rationale was that Jews were bringing in refugees to       destroy America.''        Antisemitism has been rising among both the far right and       the far left, although experts said it is the far right that       is statistically more likely to commit violent acts against       Jews.        Last year, the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks and       condemns antisemitism, documented 2,717 antisemitic incidents       in the United States, a 34 percent increase over the prior       year and the highest number recorded since the organization       began its monitoring work in 1979. That figure included 88       incidents of violent assault, a 167 percent increase from       2020.        In New York City last month, police arrested two young men,       one of whom said he ran a white supremacist Twitter group and       had been posting threats to imminently shoot up a synagogue.       According to news reports, the duo appeared to have recently       been gathering weapons and ammunition for the thwarted       terrorist attack.        Democrats and progressives are still divided over how to       calibrate criticism from their side of the aisle about the       Israeli government's human rights abuses of the Palestinians       without crossing the line into antisemitic tropes.        ``To fight antisemitism, you really need people from across       the political spectrum. If you look at the violence against       Jews in the last three or four years, it mostly comes from       the extreme right. But if you know anything about       antisemitism you know that it could someday come from other       parts of society,'' said Ira Forman, a former special envoy       to monitor and combat antisemitism in the Obama       administration. ``Democrats should be calling out Democrats       and liberals and Republicans ought to be calling out       conservatives.''    Mr. Speaker, House Republican leaders have repeatedly  declined to condemn and punish anti-Semitism, hate, and violence pushed  by Members within their own party.   Again, I don't care how people voted. This is a meaningless,  ridiculous waste of time, but my particular concern with this  resolution is not all the whereas clauses. It is the resolved clause.   Many of us are concerned because of the rhetoric on the other side of  the aisle because so many of you have referred to Medicare as a  socialist program and Social Security as a socialist program.   We asked you last night simply to reassure us, and we had an  amendment. You heard the amendment--Mr. Takano spoke about it--that  none of this has anything to do with Social Security and Medicare.  Guess what, everybody? They all voted ``no.''   That is what our concern is about, and people can say whatever they  want on this. I mean, I can't believe, with all that is going on in the  world, we are spending a day talking about this, but whatever.   This is the new Republican list of priorities, and there is no wonder  why a poll just came out showing that the majority of American people  do not share the views, values, and priorities of this current  Republican House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   To the gentleman who just spoke, who talked about record debt, yes,  we worry about that, as well. I would remind him that 25 percent of  this Nation's debt was accumulated in the 4 years of Donald Trump.   Let me repeat that: A quarter of our Nation's debt in all of our  history was accumulated in the 4 years of Donald Trump.   If increasing debt is the standard where you say a President failed,  then there is no question that the previous President, Mr. Trump, was a  miserable failure.   Let me say to my colleague from Pennsylvania who brought up China-- again, I am having trouble following this debate. I will not be  lectured by anybody on commitment to human rights in China. I co- chaired the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. I co-chair the  Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.   I authored the bill, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, by the  way, which died in a Republican Senate. We managed to get it passed in  a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate.   I have passed major legislation on behalf of the Tibetan people.   By the way, this is all happening now under President Xi of China. I  am looking in this resolution, and there is no mention of President Xi.   We are debating issues that aren't even in this resolution. I mean,  this is nuts.   I do want to get back to the other bill, the bill that my colleagues  are bringing to take Representative Ilhan Omar off the Foreign Affairs  Committee.   I read in some of the publications that, to get votes, the Republican  leaders apparently promised some of their Republican Members who were  concerned about this process that there would be some due process put  in place.   I include in the Record the statement released yesterday by  Representative Spartz about what supposedly is in this resolution.                       [Press Release, Jan. 31, 2023]   Spartz Issues Statement on Omar: I Will Support Resolution With Equal                   Treatment Under Rules and Due Process         Washington, D.C.--Today, Rep. Spartz issued the statement       below on the resolution to remove Rep. Omar from the Foreign       Affairs Committee.        ``I appreciate Speaker McCarthy's willingness to address       legitimate concerns and add due process language to our       resolution. Deliberation and debate are vital for our       institution, not top-down approaches,'' Spartz said. ``The       rule of law, freedom of speech, and due process are       fundamental to our Constitutional Republic. Our founding       fathers understood that pure democracy is dangerous and can       lead to the tyranny of majority, mob rule and dictatorship.       As to my fellow conservatives, I think setting a precedent of       allowing an appeal process for the Speaker's and majority-      party removal decisions is particularly important to freedom-      loving legislators who usually are on the receiving end of       issues like this.''    The statement touts due process language that was  supposedly added to the resolution. I have to admit, I am completely  lost here.   There is nothing--let me repeat that, nothing; one more time,  nothing--in this resolution that provides due process.   Don't take my word for it. I have a nice quote here for people to  follow along with me. There is a quote in Politico today: ``The whereas  clause added merely references an existing process and in no way begins  an appeal procedure or guarantees her committee seat will be  reconsidered. It is non-binding and not actionable.''   That is according to a senior GOP aide in a comment that they made to  Politico. To whoever that senior GOP aide is, let me just say thank you  for your candor. I think it is appreciated.   To people like the gentlewoman from Indiana and others who somehow  think that they negotiated some sort of due process here, you didn't  get anything. If you think you did, then you are a cheap date.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am not going to reiterate the long list of reasons  that these resolutions are a waste of time. Quite frankly, they are an  insult to the intelligence of the American people.   Let me be clear: The socialism resolution is useless. It does  nothing. It does not matter. Who the hell cares how anybody votes on  it?   We are here for one reason, and we are here for one reason only. My  Republican colleagues are pushing an extreme far-right agenda that  benefits the rich and powerful and screws over working families and  everyone else.   They are not paying attention to the problems of everyday people, and  that is clear based on the recent polling that has come out that shows  just how out of touch they are with where people are at all around this  country.   They are not paying attention to the kitchen table issues that people  anguish over every night. I can assure you, and I don't care what part  of the country you come from, people aren't sitting around the table  talking about Pol Pot.   Anyway, that is what my Republican friends think is a national  priority. I mean, we are talking about socialism in this resolution,  but we are not talking about a definition or what it is. Are we talking  about public schools? Are we talking about roads? Are we talking about  Social Security?   I mean, give me a break. We have been hearing this stuff for decades  and decades, Republicans saying Democrats want socialism. It is always  some big, scary takeover that is just over the horizon that everyone  needs to be afraid of.                                time  1315    When you don't have any good issues on your side and fear is all you  have, that is what you run with, I guess. That is the Republican  playbook.   You know what is funny is that the same Republicans who decry  anything that government does as socialism never seem to have a problem  when it comes to huge handouts for billionaire corporations. They want  socialism for the rich but capitalism for the poor.   Call me crazy, but here is what I think: This resolution is not about  socialism. It is about scaring people. It is about dividing people and,  quite frankly, I think, based on what happened in the Rules Committee  last night, it is about setting the stage to go after the social safety  net in this country, which includes Social Security and Medicare.   If that wasn't the case, why in the world would my Republican friends  not allow a clarifying amendment to make it clear that that was not the  intent? They all voted ``no.''   When it comes to Congresswoman Omar, a good Congresswoman who fights  hard for her district and for her values, this isn't about punishing  her for anything she said. It is about scoring political points.   If this was about condemning anti-Semitism, Republicans would be  condemning the folks on your side who dine with Holocaust deniers and  appear at white supremacy rallies.  [[Page H597]]    If this was about condemning anti-Semitism, Republicans would have  accepted our amendment to condemn the Nazis who slaughtered 6 million  Jews during World War II; and every one of them voted ``no.''   So please spare us the false equivalence. This is total BS, and I  urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.   This is, really, a sad day for this Chamber. With all that needs to  be done, with all that needs to be done, this is the priority. This is  the priority, and, I should add for good measure, all of this is being  brought to you under closed rules.   All the amendments that were offered, all the suggestions that were  brought on this and other bills by Democrats and Republicans, were all  ruled out of order. Some of this is noncontroversial stuff, all closed.   The issue with Congresswoman Omar was brought to the Rules Committee  as an emergency. An emergency? Really? I don't get it.   You shouldn't be surprised because the last time the Republicans were  in charge they brought a bill to the floor as an emergency to deal with  cheese curd, so I get it. Everything is an emergency, especially when  it comes to messaging and making political statements.   But look, we have to get back to the people's business, Mr. Speaker.  We have to get back to focusing on kitchen-table issues, the stuff that  people worry about every night. This is not it. This is not it.   I really regret that we are wasting this time on these poorly crafted  bills that do nothing to help anybody in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
