 Mr. Speaker, I want to say three things about this budget:   First, deficits matter. Deficits matter. This budget explicitly  raises the deficit. It admits to $1.5 trillion, more likely $2.5  trillion. That means that  [[Page H8251]]  our children and our grandchildren are going to be the ones paying for  the deficit that is added.   Second, process matters. We are hearing a lot of talk about tax  reform, but there has been no process. There is no bill, and we are  about to vote on a so-called tax reform package that has not been  explicitly printed to paper. This is no way to do any business. We are  making it up as we go along, and it is the same process that was used  on healthcare. We went into committee with no bill and came out, 27  hours later, with 24 million people losing healthcare. There has been  no process on this.   And third, details matter, and the details that are leaking out are  very punishing to the middle class. Anybody who is an income tax payer  in a State, a property tax payer in a State, is going to lose that  deduction.   It is very tough on middle class efforts to save for retirement. That  is in play. Folks' deductions on their Keogh plans, their 401(k) plans,  are very much a part of the process that is going to lower this.   Reject this plan.
