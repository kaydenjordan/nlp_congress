 Mr. Speaker, every day on Capitol Hill, we have heroes  among us, our Capitol Police. Five weeks ago, three of these heroes  saved lives. They killed a deranged man who opened fire on the  Republican baseball team. Two heroes were wounded, Crystal Griner and  David Bailey. Our brave Capitol Police prevented a massacre.   Another massacre was prevented by the Capitol Police on June 24 of  1998, 19 years ago today. My hometown of Sugar Land, Texas, still hurts  over a hero we knew well, Detective John Gibson. He was killed a few  feet from where I am standing.   Like Crystal and David, Detective Gibson was assigned to protect a  member of House leadership, my neighbor, and my predecessor, Majority  Leader Tom DeLay. Gibson heard Officer Jacob Chestnut being killed by  an intruder. He shot the attacker, despite being mortally wounded.   Our Capitol Police are true heroes. May we always remember two  special heroes, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson.                            ____________________
