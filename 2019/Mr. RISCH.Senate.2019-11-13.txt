However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11, this month I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military.
