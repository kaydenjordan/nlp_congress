 Madam President, I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his  help and his leadership in this effort. We simply have to support  America's healthcare providers, farmers, and ranchers. Doctors and the  entire medical community are still struggling after being unable to  perform nonemergency procedures during the pandemic.   With an aging population and more physicians not accepting Medicare  because of insufficient payment, Medicare beneficiaries would face a  reality of less access to quality care. That is why I introduced my own  legislation to prevent these damaging cuts from harming our physicians,  our providers. Our agriculture community is also struggling, and we  must protect our farmers and ranchers by ensuring their operations can  stay afloat and keep producing the most abundant and safest food supply  in the world.   For all of these reasons, I support Senator Kennedy's bill.   I understand that my fellow Senator from Missouri also has some  concerns, and so I yield to him.    Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the  100th anniversary of Riceland Foods.   Riceland's success story mirrors the growth of rice production in  Arkansas. The first rice crop grown in Arkansas was produced in 1904.  As more Arkansas farmers embraced this new crop, they found that  relying on buyers from Texas or Louisiana, who passed through Arkansas  infrequently, made sales difficult. That led farmers to build Arkansas'  first rice mill in Stuttgart in 1907.   Stuttgart would soon become the center of Arkansas' burgeoning rice  industry. In the years around World War I, rice crop prices fluctuated  wildly, leading Arkansas producers to meet in Stuttgart to find a path  to ensure continued viability. The Arkansas Rice Growers Cooperative  Association was born out of this gathering.   The cooperative began as only a rice sales organization. As rice  farming became more popular in Arkansas, the Arkansas Rice Growers  Cooperative Association began leasing and eventually purchasing mills  to process rice grown by area farmers.   In 1946, the cooperative began marketing its products under the  Riceland label. In 1960, it diversified by merging with the Arkansas  Grain Cooperative, which shared soybeans with neighboring soybean  processing plant in Stuttgart. Shortly thereafter, Riceland Foods  became the official name for the cooperative, which would remain  headquartered in Stuttgart.   Today, Arkansas is the Nation's leading rice producer, and Riceland  has grown into the world's largest miller and marketer of rice, as well  as one of the Mid-South's major soybean processors.   Riceland has its own signature brands for home cooking and is also a  major industrial supplier for companies such as Anheuser-Busch, General  Mills, Gerber, and Kellogg's. They also supply to the food service  industry nationwide.   The rice the cooperative's farmers grow is turned into products that  reach consumers in more than 75 countries in North America, Central  America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, and the Middle  East.   At a recent celebration to mark Riceland's 100th anniversary,  chairman of the board Roger Pohlner spotlighted the cooperative's  greatest assets: its members and employees. He told attendees, ``Our  founding members knew we were stronger together.'' The cooperative's  100 years of success is evidence of just how true that statement is.   I congratulate Riceland for reaching this historic milestone and wish  them many more centuries of success.                            ____________________
