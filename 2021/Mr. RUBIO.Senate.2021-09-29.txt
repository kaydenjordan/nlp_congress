 Mr. President, I recognize Patrick Collins, a pillar of  Belen Jesuit Preparatory School in Miami, FL, for his 50-year  commitment to the edification of thousands of young men in the  community. Throughout his tenure, Mr. Collins served as a teacher,  chair of the social studies department, founder and moderator of Close  Up and Founding of a Nation, tennis coach, and cofounder of the  overseas study program.   Mr. Collins' decades of service shaped numerous generations of  students and are evidenced by his students' testimonies. From his  students, one can learn how Mr. Collins complemented their civic  education with the values of citizenship, patriotism, responsibility,  and leadership. Ultimately, his passion and love for his country has  created a legacy that has positively impacted the Miami community,  State of Florida, and country at large through the moral compass that  he worked to instill in every single one of his students.   I admire Mr. Collins' virtuous character and am grateful for the  fruit of his work. I look forward to continuing to learn of the impact  that his students have on our communities and know that he serves as an  exceptional example to educators across the country.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Miami  Herald dated September 23, 2021, about Patrick Collins be printed in  the Record.   The material follows:   For 50 Years, Belen Educator Has Given Flight to Students' Passion to                                   Serve                            (By Rafael A. Yaniz)         Patrick Collins, a beloved and influential educator at       Belen Jesuit Preparatory School, will be honored on Sept. 25.       Belen Jesuit Preparatory School        ``Before you stand up, you must know the first word that is       coming out of your mouth.'' This was the first piece of       advice that Patrick Collins--Belen Jesuit Preparatory       School's social studies department chair and 11th-grade U.S.       government teacher--gave me.        Decades later, I think of his advice whenever I am about to       speak in any formal setting.        And I am not alone in remembering him and his guidance, for       which, after five decades, he will be honored at Belen on       Saturday, and most deservedly so.        ``All prayers in the world can be condensed into two       words,'' he told me. ``Thank you''        ``I've tried to instill in students a sense of gratitude to       say Thank you, when they walk through Arlington National       Cemetery, through the halls of Congress, through their       cities, to find a niche in their lives to do something that       benefits another citizen. That way, we can continue on to the       betterment of ourselves and our country.''        Collins' career has had a lifelong impact on generations of       Belen Jesuit students during the course of his 50 years at       Miami's storied all-male prep school, who have applied his       lessons to make our community and our country better.        ``In my era, we were rambunctious,'' said Jose Cil, CEO of       Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Burger       King, ``but he set a really high bar and drove us to excel--      even if you weren't an excellent student.''        Collins' passion for teaching beyond the textbook inspired       him to succeed.        Former U.S. Congressman Joe Garcia agreed. ``Mr. Collins'       addition to Jesuit pedagogy is the insight that being a `man       for others' requires you to engage in the broader society       without cynicism--without hatred--but always with an openness       to engage in critical thought,'' Garcia said. ``In the ideal       republic, he is the ideal citizen.''        Carlos Trujillo, former U.S. ambassador to the Organization       of American States, said, ``The impact Mr. Collins has had as       a U.S. government teacher producing government servants, very       few teachers across the country have had that kind of impact       in their careers.''        ``To this day, I still apply the lessons I learned from       Coach Collins inside and outside of the classroom,'' said       Cesar Conde, chairman of NBCUniversal News Group, who played       tennis under Collins' coaching.        ``I first began to understand the importance of a free       press and the role of great journalism in our democracy while       studying in his government classes. And, during a Close Up       Foundation trip to Washington, D.C. that he led, I was       directly exposed to the federal government, which inspired me       to apply to the White House Fellows Program years later.''       Conde subsequently served under then-Secretary of State Colin       Powell.        ``He taught me to dream big and then work hard to achieve       those ambitions,'' explained Mr. Conde.        Eddy Acevedo, chief of staff and senior advisor to the CEO       of the Wilson Center, astutely observed, ``Anyone who grows       up in Miami thinks about getting involved in politics, in       government, in public service.''        Former U.S. Congressman Carlos Curbelo was one of those       students with an innate desire to serve.        ``He provided us with a thorough understanding of what       government is and how it works, the way the system is       designed to impede the passage of legislation, and what       people have to do to overcome those challenges.''  [[Page S6776]]         Garcia, who lost to Curbelo, added, ``Mr. Collins teaches a       realistic understanding of the political process, but he       provides the inspiration to make working through that       difficult process an act of service for society's most       vulnerable members.''        That sentiment was not lost on Manny Diaz, chair of the       Florida Democratic Party.        ``Mr. Collins asked us on the first day of class if we knew       what our rights were if we found ourselves on a country road       in Alabama and a big sheriff arrested us because we looked       Hispanic. I wanted to know the answer to his question.''        Collins' influence led Javi Correoso, Uber's public affairs       senior manager, to pursue his passions.        ``He instills in you that the meaning and purpose of public       service is not the shining moments like running for office or       photo ops, it's about rolling up your sleeves and helping       citizens get a response from their government,'' Correoso       said.        He also credits Collins for connecting him with former U.S.       Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. ``It was the middle of football       season, and I needed the 10 points extra credit wiggle room       in my grade that semester.'' He was able to snag those extra       credits by volunteering in her campaign office.        ``I couldn't tell you what political party he belongs to,''       Ros-Lehtinen said of Collins, ``but he belongs to the       fellowship of man. We need to clone him. He's always been a       voice of reason and commonsense in my life.''        Collins is clear about what drives him: ``I'm influenced by       the experience of my great grandfather. He was an Irish       immigrant who struggled, through perseverance and grace, he       was able to succeed,'' he said. ``I'm a beneficiary of that       generation of Irish Americans who feels it would be selfish       to solely benefit from the opportunities in this country. I       feel like I owe it to him and to my family that the notion of       civic responsibility continues to those I have met through       the Cuban immigration experience that is Belen Jesuit.''
