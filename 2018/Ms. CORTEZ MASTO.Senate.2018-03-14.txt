 Mr. President, along with my colleagues today, I  rise to address what has unfortunately become the norm for our kids in  schools and across the country.   On October 1 in Las Vegas, we saw the worst mass shooting in the  history of this country--innocent concertgoers attending an  entertainment venue outdoors. There were 58 killed and 500 injured at  the hands of a madman with an assault weapon.   In the past 5 years, we have lost an average of 10 children each year  to gun violence in Nevada alone. Today I speak in memory of the 50  children from my home State who will never get the chance to grow up  and graduate from high school, pursue their dream job, or even have  children of their own.   The names I am about to read aloud were beloved sons, daughters,  friends, and classmates whose lives were tragically cut short in the  last 3 years:   Clemente, 17 years old, from Las Vegas; Jovanni, 16 years old, from  Las Vegas; Terry, a 17-year-old from Reno; Tiris, 17 years old, lived  in Las Vegas; Marcus, 3 weeks old, lived in Las Vegas; Anthony, 17  years old from Laughlin; John, 11 months old, from Las Vegas; Anthony,  16 years old, from Las Vegas; Bradley, 4 years old, lived in Las Vegas;  a young male victim, 16 years old, from Reno; Giovanni, 14 years old,  Las Vegas; another young victim, 16 years old, lived in Las Vegas;  Luis, 16 years old, from Las Vegas; another young victim, 15 years old,  from West Wendover; Sincere, 12 years old, from Las Vegas; Ethan, 17  years old, from Las Vegas; Angelo, 15 years old, lived in Las Vegas;  Benjamin, 17 years old, lived in Las Vegas; a young female victim, 3  years old, from Las Vegas; another male victim, 4 years old, lived in  Las Vegas; Jhronne, 17 years old, from Las Vegas; Joshua, 17 years old,  from Las Vegas; Xonajuk, 14 years old, from Las Vegas; Anhurak, 9 years  old, from Las Vegas; Dalavanh, 15 years old, from Las Vegas; Robert, 17  years old, from Las Vegas; another young female victim, 17 years old,  from Reno; and Fabriccio, 13 years old, from Las Vegas.   Across the country students are saying ``Never again'' to another  child lost to gun violence, and I ask that this Congress do the same  thing.   I yield the floor.
