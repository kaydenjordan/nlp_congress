 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Madam President, recent research by historians has  identified a person participating in the raising of the flag at Iwo  Jima.   That iconic photograph of marines raising the American flag at Iwo  Jima is a testament to American strength and sacrifice.   The Marine Corps has identified another one of the marines pictured  in this photograph as Cpl Harold Keller of Brooklyn, IA.   Keller never sought recognition or fame. He never mentioned to his  children that he had helped raise that flag. He died in 1979, so he  doesn't know we now know it is he in the photograph.   Seventy-four years later, I am proud that this Iowan is finally  recognized for his role in making history.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
