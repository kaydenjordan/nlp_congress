 Mr. President, I have come to the floor today and will  shortly ask for unanimous consent on H.R. 2420, the National Museum for  the American Latino Act.   Let me just thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, Mr.  Cornyn, who has been a great partner throughout this entire process, a  strong advocate who helped us navigate some of the challenges we have  had along the way. I am also thrilled to be on the floor with Senator  Collins, who will shortly make a motion on the Women's History Museum,  which I strongly support, and I appreciate her support for the American  Latino Museum.   Today the Senate stands at the precipice of history. We have before  us an opportunity to set in motion a process that will eventually  culminate in the establishment of a national museum devoted to the  history, struggles, and achievements of Latinos and Latinas in the  United States. This is long overdue.   Some colleagues say: Well, why do we need another museum? Well, it  was in 1994 when the Smithsonian Task Force on Latino Issues published  its report entitled ``Willful Neglect''--a report acknowledging the  Institution's own glaring omission of Hispanic history and culture.   This is what the report found:         The Smithsonian Institution, the largest museum complex in       the world, displays a pattern of willful neglect towards . .       . Latinos in the United States. Because of both indigenous       roots and Spanish heritage, Latinos predate the British in       the [United States]. They have contributed significantly to       every phase and aspect of American history and culture. Yet       the institution almost entirely excludes and ignores Latinos       in nearly every aspect of its operations.        Latinos are absent from positions of power and authority       within the institution, which helps to perpetuate the       exclusion of Latino history and culture from the museum's       collections, exhibitions, and programs.    The report also acknowledges how the Smithsonian's exclusion of  Latinos and Latinas has not only harmed Hispanic Americans but all  Americans.   The report says:         The failure of the Smithsonian to reflect and represent       Hispanic contributions is twice damaging. It denies Latinos       their right to feel recognized and valued as part of the       country's heritage. At the same time, it perpetuates among       the general population the inaccurate belief that Latinos       have contributed little to our country's development or       culture, rather than reflecting the multicultural history . .       . of the United States.    Without treading into politics, I think it is important we  acknowledge that this misconception is alive and well today. In recent  years, we have heard Hispanic Americans, immigrants, and their families  used as scapegoats for every economic ill facing our Nation. We have  witnessed the rise of nativism and xenophobia. We have seen these  hateful statements propel acts of horrific violence like the tragic El  Paso shooting.   But we Latinos and Latinas are not invaders. We have been here from  the beginning. The oldest city in America, well before Pilgrims and  Jamestown, is St. Augustine, FL, over 500 years ago founded by a  gentleman named Pedro Aviles de Menendez. And our stories must be told.   Who here does not emerge from the Smithsonian Museum of American  History more informed about the many movements that have shaped our  country? Who does not emerge from the Museum of the American Indian  more aware of Native American history and more appreciative of their  cultures? Who does not emerge from the Museum of African American  History inspired by the perseverance and the power of our Black  community? We all do. The Smithsonian Institution is truly a national  treasure.   But I am not White or Black or Native American. I am Latino. I am one  in five Americans today. My grandchildren are one in four  schoolchildren today. But when we walk through the National Mall--or  should I say when anyone walks through the National Mall, no one is  inspired by the story of Latinos and Latinas in this country because  that story is not being told.   Walk outside these halls and ask someone who Bernardo de Galvez was,  the former Governor of Louisiana before Louisiana was a State, who led  an all-Spanish division against the British as they were approaching  Washington and helped in the Revolutionary War? The Congress gave him  U.S. citizenship. His portrait was supposed to be hung in the Congress  of the United States, so much was the battle that he  [[Page S7414]]  led. His portrait finally hangs in the Senate Foreign Relations room.   Go to Farragut metro station and ask a rider who it was named for.  David Farragut, the Spanish captain who led during the Civil War on  behalf of the Union.   Visit a school and ask a child where the first settlers to this  country hailed from. They won't say St. Augustine, FL.   I guarantee these questions will go unanswered because the history of  the American Latino remains unknown.   It has been nearly 30 years since the Smithsonian Task Force on  Latino Issues recommended that the Institution immediately begin laying  ``the groundwork needed to assure the establishment of one or more  museums portraying the historical, cultural, and artistic achievements  of U.S. Hispanics.'' Thirty years. For nearly 30 years, those words  have echoed on empty ears. My friends, that silence and inaction must  end today.   We Hispanics are not a monolithic community. Our families are as  diverse as they come. We are Puerto Rican, Mexican, Cuban, Colombian,  Spanish, Salvadoran, and more. We are Brown, Black, and White, left and  right, and everywhere in between. Some of our ancestors settled here  long before the dawn of our Republic; others arrived alongside  generations of immigrants around the world searching for freedom and  opportunity. Some of us grew up along our southern border in cities and  communities born out of blended cultures.   Some of us, myself included, are first-generation Americans. Our  parents courageously uprooted their lives and came to this country with  no connection at all in order to give their children a brighter future.   Indeed, that story of hard work and boundless optimism is the common  thread that runs throughout our Latino community--all 60 million of us  living in the United States. And I would argue that story is as  American as they come.   So let us ensure that the story is told right here in the Nation's  Capital, where it belongs. Let us pass H.R. 2420. Let us ensure that  someday in the near future, Latino and Latina children and other  children who walk through our National Mall will no longer wonder why  the story of their families are missing. I know I cannot wait for the  day that I can take my granddaughters to the National Museum of the  American Latino.   So it has been a long and winding road for this bill, one which I  hope will complete its path today in Congress. This has already been  passed by the House of Representatives by voice vote--no opposition.  This passed the Rules Committee in a unanimous voice vote.   Now, we have been asked to make some changes to accommodate my  colleague, the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and  while I personally do not believe that these changes are fair to the  Latino community or required or necessary for the bill, I am committed  to making them to pass this bill and finally moving one step closer to  the construction of the museum.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 600, H.R. 2420. I ask unanimous  consent that the Murkowski amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the  bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, 60 million Latinos in this country are  watching tonight because this is a much expected moment--Univision,  Telemundo, affiliates across the country, national organizations, and  others. They have been waiting for this moment, a moment that everybody  in the  [[Page S7415]]  Congress of the United States agrees to except for one colleague. The  House of Representatives passed this on voice. The Rules Committee  passed it on voice in a bipartisan manner. And tonight, one colleague  stands in the way--one Republican colleague from Utah stands in the way  of the hopes and dreams and aspirations of seeing Americans of Latino  descent having their dreams fulfilled in being recognized--just being  recognized.   Now, the Smithsonian is a collection of museums. Let's be honest with  that. Did we need an Air and Space Museum? Do we need a museum of the  Native Americans? Did we need an African-American Museum? I would say  yes to all of them because they are part of the mosaic. They are  brought together under the rubric of the single most significant  cultural institution in the Nation, which is the Smithsonian.   I don't know if these arguments were made against the Native  Americans. I don't know if these arguments were made against African  Americans, but I don't see them as being separate and apart. I see them  as part of the collective history mosaic that is coming together under  the Smithsonian. More than half of the Nation's population are women.  Are we to deny them that their history in our country is not being  told? It is not. It is beyond Betsy Ross, who I appreciate very much.   And, talk about funding, this bill requires that 50 percent of all  the funding be coming from private sources. So we will fuel the  development of programming, as well as the physical structure, as well  as the other elements by the community and communities who want to see  this become a reality.   It is 30 years of willful neglect. Nobody cared, nobody made any  effort, and nobody did anything about it. And in the one chance we  have, since this has been a 20-plus year journey to try to make this  museum possible, one Republican colleague stands in the way. One  Republican colleague stands in the way. It is pretty outrageous. It is  pretty outrageous.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I just have to say: We have been  systemically excluded. We, who founded the oldest city in America  before there was a United States of America; we, who ultimately were  used as farm workers and discriminated against in the Bracero program;  we, who were discriminated against when we voluntarily joined the Armed  Forces of the United States to defend the Nation--we have been  systematically excluded, not because this Senator said so but because  the Smithsonian itself said so.   And yet we are supposed to entrust the willful neglect that has taken  place for more than three decades--taken place longer but acknowledged  for three decades. Oh, no, we are somehow not systemically excluded.  Believe me, we have been, and the only righteous way to end that  exclusion is to pass this bill.
