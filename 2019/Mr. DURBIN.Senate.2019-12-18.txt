 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week we are going to be voting on  some appropriation bills. They are rather large. They call them  minibuses. But there will be six or eight appropriations bills bunched  together, and they will include things other than strictly spending  measures.   One of the areas that will be addressed is the age that you must  reach to purchase tobacco and vaping materials in the United States. It  is known euphemistically as T-21, and I have supported it for years.  The notion of raising the purchasing age to 21 for these products, to  me, just makes sense.   We know that they are addictive. Both cigarette tobacco and vaping  materials have nicotine in them, a highly addictive chemical. Raising  the age of purchase across the United States to 21 makes sense.   But I am disappointed as well. Although I originally sponsored this  bill, there have been several revelations in the last few months, which  call for us to move far beyond the idea of establishing a new age for  purchasing these products, and let me be specific.   One of the things we have been working on is trying to address the  shocking increase in the use of vaping materials and e-cigarettes by  young people across America. It has been called a public health  epidemic, not by a politician but by the Commissioner of the Food and  Drug Administration. That Commissioner told us, as well as the Surgeon  General of the United States, that this is an issue that cannot be  ignored.  [[Page S7124]]    Today, we estimate that nearly 30 percent of school-age children are  vaping--more than 5 million kids across America.   A group of young high schoolers came in to see me from New York last  week and said: Senator, you are all wrong. In our schools it is a  majority.   A majority of the students are vaping, not only outside of the  school, but even in the classroom. They have hooked up vaping devices  to the clothing that they are wearing, and when the teacher turns his  or her back on the class, they are puffing on their vaping materials-- their Juuls--and blowing the white vapor into the air of the classroom.   It sounds incredible, but they told me it is true and it happens all  over the school--in the restrooms, in the cafeteria, in the classrooms.   The reason it is happening is that so many students are vaping now  and it is an addiction. As these students continue to vape, their  appetite for the product grows.   Kids are using these products for many reasons, and I can get into  the psychology of it for a minute, but let me dwell on the obvious.   The flavors that are being sold on these vaping materials are  designed for them--to attract children to Juul's products, to flavors  like Cotton Candy, Unicorn Milk--whatever the heck that is--Cool Mint,  Mom's Sugar Cookies, and, yes, Menthol.   According to the Food and Drug Administration, more than 80 percent  of children who vape start with a flavored e-cigarette.   Now, the vaping industry says: Oh, you have got it all wrong. You  see, this is a non-tobacco product which people can use to get off  cigarettes.   Well, that sounds pretty noble; doesn't it? We want people to move  away from something more dangerous, like tobacco cigarettes.   But when you look at the incidence of people using this product, it  is miniscule in terms of adults with a tobacco addiction moving to  vaping products, and the number of children and young students moving  from non-vaping to vaping is dramatic. As I mentioned, the official  figures are 30 percent of high school students.   According to the Food and Drug Administration, one of the things that  is luring young people to this behavior is the flavoring or the flavor  pods. Does anyone believe these flavors are intended for some 50-year- old chain smoker who wants to give up on tobacco cigarettes--flavors  like Farley's Gnarly Sauce, Bubble Purp by Chubby Bubbles, Blue Razz by  Candy King, Cotton Candy by Zonk? Some 50-year-old is attracted to  Cotton Candy by Zonk?   We know better. These flavor pods are made for kids--to attract kids,  get them started, get them hooked, and make them lifelong customers.   Together with bipartisan colleagues, I have pressed the Food and Drug  Administration and the White House for years to put an end to these  kid-friendly flavor pods.   Well, the tobacco giant Altria--it used to be Philip Morris, if I am  not mistaken--stepped in and bought the lion's share of the stock of  Juul, the most prolific producer of vaping devices in the United  States.   Altria knows this business and how to attract kids because they used  to make Marlboro cigarettes. Remember that cowboy designed to appeal  across the board, particularly to young smokers?   Well, now they have a new gig. It is called vaping, e-cigarettes, and  Altria has bought in in a big way.   They have been taking out ads to support raising the Federal age to  purchase tobacco products to 21.   Wait a minute. A tobacco company wants to raise the age for  purchasing the products?   They do. They see it as inevitable, but it is also part of their  market strategy. That is the same policy I have supported, and I thank  my colleagues Senator Schatz and Senator Kaine for joining in the  effort, along with Senator Romney. But what we have seen is that Altria  has invested $13 billion to acquire a 35-percent stake in Juul, which  controls more than 70 percent of the vaping market. Tobacco is big in  vaping.   Altria and Juul together now believe that if the only thing we do is  just raise the tobacco age to 21, they will be in the clear and they  can avoid the scrutiny for their targeted efforts to hook kids on e- cigarettes.   I disagree. I have made clear that any T-21, ``Tobacco to 21'' policy  must be coupled with meaningful provisions to get rid of the e- cigarette flavors now addicting our kids, but they have turned to one  of their allies, Senator McConnell, on this effort, who was an original  sponsor on T-21. His party resisted the effort to join the banning of  flavor pods for e-cigarettes as part of the T-21 bill in our  appropriations bill.   I fear that the spending bill will come before us and include just  the T-21 policy, and that of course doesn't address what is happening  with vaping among children in America.   If we are serious about sparing Americans, particularly our kids,  from addictions to nicotine, it has to reach beyond tobacco cigarettes  to vaping. It is a mistake not to do so.   The public health community agrees with me on that. Any serious  solution to skyrocketing rates of youth e-cigarette use must include  the removal of kid-friendly flavors--not just the tobacco industry's  preferred policy--and I will continue to work with Members on both  sides of the aisle in pushing to do so.   Finally, let me say on this subject that on September 15, President  Trump held a press conference in the Oval Office on this subject of  vaping. Sitting next to him was the First Lady of the United States,  Melania Trump. She doesn't often stand up on political issues, but she  is the mother of a teenager, and she decided to speak out against  vaping. I thanked her. I praised her along with the President. They did  the right thing, but now we are not sure where the President is on this  subject. We are not sure if he is going to continue his effort to end  the scourge of vaping and e-cigarettes.   I hope the President comes back to the position he announced in  September. We need his help to ban these flavor pods.   The recent appointee as FDA Commissioner, Stephen Hahn, has told me  personally and many of my colleagues that he thinks this is a serious  issue. I believe he ought to be given the authority to exercise his  legal right and power to stop these pods and stop these devices as  quickly as possible.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota  (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota  (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota  (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, it is hard to believe that in this Nation  of immigrants we have such a broken immigrant system, but it is a fact.   We have addressed so many problems in this system over the years. A  few years ago on the floor of the Senate, we passed a comprehensive  immigration reform bill, which didn't survive in the House of  Representatives. So it is no surprise that, on a regular basis, we face  challenges when it comes to our existing immigration laws.   One of the most serious challenges is the green card backlog in this  country. To try to describe it in just the simplest terms, under the  current law, in my estimation, there are not nearly enough immigrant  visas--also known as green cards--available each year. Each year in  America, there are 226,000 family green cards available and 140,000  employment green cards available. That is 140,000 each year for a  nation of 350 million people. So many of those who are aspiring to get  a green card and ultimately move to a permanent resident status and  citizenship wait and wait and wait for the day to arrive.   Children in many of these families who are from workers currently in  the United States on things like the H-1B visa age out when they reach  the age of 21, and they are no longer protected by their parents'  presence. So they are at risk of being deported, even as they go into  their teenage years. It is a horrible situation. It is really a  heartbreaking situation. I have come to meet and know many of the  families affected by it.   We are trying to deal with this green card backlog with the reality  of current politics in Washington. Under the current political  environment, there are limitations on what we can do.   My response is to increase the number of green cards that are  available each year so we have more than 140,000 available. There are  currently at least 800,000 people waiting for 140,000 green cards to  come up each year. As a consequence, we are in a predicament, where we  don't have nearly enough green cards for the people who are waiting for  them.   I would increase that number, but politically that is not going to  happen. The President doesn't agree with that position, and many  Republicans in the Senate and the House don't agree either.   Senator Lee and I have confronted this issue, coming at it from  different perspectives. Initially, we were at odds on how to approach  it. I objected to a bill he brought to the floor; he objected to a bill  I brought to the floor; and then we sat down to talk.   The bill I brought to the floor, as I mentioned earlier, would  increase the number of green cards, would make sure that the families  would be protected from deportation while they are waiting and would  allow them to travel and to change jobs. That is called the RELIEF Act.  I have introduced it. It has been introduced in the House of  Representatives by Congresswoman Shalala. It is a bill I still support  and would like to see pass. That is my preference.   It is not a bill that would pass in the Senate at this time, so  Senator Lee and I sat down to try to find common ground, if we could,  on an approach that might work to deal with the backlog in a humane  fashion and to protect the families during the course of that.   We have come up with a proposal which I think moves us in the right  direction. It is an agreement between us--a bipartisan agreement--which  we are now hoping to offer to the Senate for consideration as quickly  as possible.   I will very quickly state a summary of what it tries to achieve.   It protects immigrants and their families who are stuck in the green  card backlog I mentioned. Immigrant workers and their immediate family  members would be eligible for what is called early filing for their  green cards. Immigrant workers would not receive their green cards  early, but while waiting, they would be able to switch jobs and travel  without losing immigration status.   The amendment includes a critical protection from the RELIEF Act that  protects the children of immigrant workers from aging out of green card  eligibility while the family is waiting so they will not face  deportation.   Green card set-asides for immigrant workers stuck in the backlog  overseas are provided. The amendment reserves 4,600 green cards on an  annual basis for immigrant workers stuck in the backlog overseas and  not eligible for early filing. The number is based on the actual or, at  best, approximate number of the actual number of people who applied for  employment green cards from overseas each year.   Third, it addresses abuses in H-1B temporary work visas. The first  thing Senator Lee and I want to make clear is that we are committed,  first and foremost, to American workers getting jobs.   In those circumstances where American workers with certain skills are  not available, we have what is known as the H-1B visa. Working with  Senator Grassley, what we tried to do is to come up with a bipartisan  way of strengthening that system.   Included in the strengthening of this amendment is a 50-50 rule,  which says that the amendment would prohibit a company from hiring  additional H-1B workers if the company's workforce is more than 50  employees and more than 50 percent are actually temporary workers. I  personally believe those companies are suspect, and this bill raises  that question. The 50-50 rule, as I mentioned, is from a bill Senator  Grassley and I introduced. It was part of comprehensive immigration  reform.   The reality is, there is abuse in the H-1B system. We don't try to  solve every aspect of it, but we do address what we consider to be one  of the starting points of the problem we currently face.   Here is where we are. Senator Lee and I have reached a bipartisan  agreement on what we think is a reasonable approach, and we want to  make sure it  [[Page S7140]]  is acceptable to our colleagues to move forward.   I have been working on the Democratic side; Senator Lee has been  working on the Republican side. We don't believe we can get it done at  this very moment, but we are hopeful to get it done very quickly. The  reason is obvious. These families affected by this backlog are really  going through hardships and concerns no family should face. The sooner  we resolve them, the better.   As I have talked to many of these families, they have asked: Why  don't you sit down with Senator Lee to see if you can reach an  agreement? I did. We have. Now I hope we can move forward.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth), the Senator from California  (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator  from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms.  Warren) are necessarily absent.

Mr. President, every year, 250 Chicago kids form 8 teams  to perform 1,500 shows of acrobatic wonder at major sporting events,  community businesses, and charities. They are called the Jesse White  Tumblers, and for 60 years the troupe has delighted audiences in  Illinois and across the world, including Hong Kong, Israel, and  Croatia. Since 1959, more than 18,000 youths have put in the hard work  and performed in the Jesse White Tumblers. Today, we congratulate this  well-loved Chicago institution on its 60th anniversary.   Jesse White, the man whom the troupe is named after, is the 37th  secretary of State for Illinois. He is the first African American to  win statewide office in Illinois, and he has held the office longer  than anyone else. I am honored to count him as a friend.   Just like the Tumblers, Jesse was an outstanding athlete and student  growing up. He attended Waller High School in Chicago, earning All-City  honors in basketball and baseball. He hoped to play professional  baseball after graduating, but his father insisted on him going to  college first. He went to Alabama State College, majoring in physical  education. He was All-Conference in baseball and basketball. When he  graduated, Jesse signed with the Chicago Cubs. Four days before leaving  for spring training, the U.S. Army drafted him, assigning him to the  101st Airborne Division. In 1959, Jesse returned to Chicago and played  third base in the Cubs minor league system.   During the off-season, Jesse taught physical education at his alma  mater, Schiller Elementary School, and in the Chicago Park District. In  December 1959, the Chicago Park District asked Jesse to create a gym  show for the Rockwell Garden Fieldhouse. The show he developed became  the foundation for the Jesse White Tumblers.   Jesse White has served the people of Illinois throughout his career,  along with being secretary of State for Illinois. He was the recorder  of deeds of Cook County from 1992 to 1999, a legislator in the Illinois  General Assembly for 16 years, and a public school teacher for 33  years. But his favorite role may still be coach of the Jesse White  Tumblers.   Children between the ages of 6 and 20 can find a second family in the  Jesse White Tumblers. Becoming a Tumbler is not an easy task. Thousands  of young people apply every year, and few make it. In addition to  athletic achievement, members must stay in school, maintain a C  average, and stay away from drugs and alcohol. For the hard work,  members get the thrill of performing and develop confidence, structure,  and discipline. The program also helps with homework, study skills, and  can provide financial support through scholarships. The Jesse White  Tumblers have changed the lives of generations of young people.   The Jesse White Tumblers have earned their reputation as a legend in  the State of Illinois. Here is to many more years of success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3096         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Providing Resources to End       the Vaping Epidemic Now for Teenagers Act of 2020'' or the       ``PREVENT Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) High school e-cigarette use increased by 135 percent       between 2017 and 2019.        (2) Middle school e-cigarette use increased by       approximately 218 percent between 2017 and 2019.        (3) Results from the National Youth Tobacco Survey of the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in this section       referred to as ``CDC'') and the Food and Drug Administration       (in this section referred to as ``FDA'') published in       December 2019 show that 27.5 percent of high school students       and 10.5 percent of middle school students reported using an       e-cigarette in the previous 30 days, up from 20.8 percent and       4.9 percent, respectively, in 2018.        (4) In 2019, more than one-third (34.2 percent) of high       school e-cigarette users reported using e-cigarettes products       frequently, on 20 to 30 days in the past month.        (5) The CDC, the FDA, the Department of Health and Human       Services, the Surgeon General, and various State and local       health authorities have determined the skyrocketing e-      cigarette use amongst American youth to be an ``epidemic''.        (6) According to the CDC, the use of nicotine among       adolescents can be detrimental to memory making, learning,       and behavior, and e-cigarette use has been linked to lung       conditions and mysterious illness.        (7) According to data from the FDA's Population Assessment       of Tobacco and Health Study, youth e-cigarette use is       associated with more than four times the odds of trying       cigarettes and nearly three times the odds of current       cigarette use.        (8) The CDC and FDA continue to reiterate that the use of       any tobacco product, including e-cigarettes, is unsafe for       young people.       SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3096         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Providing Resources to End       the Vaping Epidemic Now for Teenagers Act of 2020'' or the       ``PREVENT Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) High school e-cigarette use increased by 135 percent       between 2017 and 2019.        (2) Middle school e-cigarette use increased by       approximately 218 percent between 2017 and 2019.        (3) Results from the National Youth Tobacco Survey of the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in this section       referred to as ``CDC'') and the Food and Drug Administration       (in this section referred to as ``FDA'') published in       December 2019 show that 27.5 percent of high school students       and 10.5 percent of middle school students reported using an       e-cigarette in the previous 30 days, up from 20.8 percent and       4.9 percent, respectively, in 2018.        (4) In 2019, more than one-third (34.2 percent) of high       school e-cigarette users reported using e-cigarettes products       frequently, on 20 to 30 days in the past month.        (5) The CDC, the FDA, the Department of Health and Human       Services, the Surgeon General, and various State and local       health authorities have determined the skyrocketing e-      cigarette use amongst American youth to be an ``epidemic''.        (6) According to the CDC, the use of nicotine among       adolescents can be detrimental to memory making, learning,       and behavior, and e-cigarette use has been linked to lung       conditions and mysterious illness.        (7) According to data from the FDA's Population Assessment       of Tobacco and Health Study, youth e-cigarette use is       associated with more than four times the odds of trying       cigarettes and nearly three times the odds of current       cigarette use.        (8) The CDC and FDA continue to reiterate that the use of       any tobacco product, including e-cigarettes, is unsafe for       young people.       SEC. 3.
