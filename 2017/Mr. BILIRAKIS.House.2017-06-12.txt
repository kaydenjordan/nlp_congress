 Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness  Month.   Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States,  impacting more than 500,000 people in Florida, and 5 million Americans  nationwide. It is also the only top 10 cause of death in America that  cannot be prevented or cured.   Beyond the statistics, finding treatments and cures for Alzheimer's  is a deeply personal mission to so many people, including myself.   In Florida, the Byrd Alzheimer's Institute at USF is one of the  largest freestanding institutes dedicated to Alzheimer's research in  the Nation. Their work brings us closer to cures and treatments every  day.   We are also making great strides in the fight against Alzheimer's  with the 21st Century Cures Act. This historic, nonpartisan  legislation, which was signed into law late last year, creates a  national data collection system for neurological diseases. Better data  will pave the path forward to better treatments.                            ____________________
