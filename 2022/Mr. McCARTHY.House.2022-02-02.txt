 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for  yielding. But more importantly, I want to thank him for his service to  this country.   After ignoring the China threat for years, House Democrats finally  introduced a bill that is allegedly tough on China. They call it the  America COMPETES Act.   But make no mistake: It is a bill that concedes to China. The America  concedes act is Democrats' desperate answer to their stream of self- created crises.   While it contains some provisions supported by Republicans, Speaker  Pelosi is holding these good ideas hostage by using this 3,000-page  bill as a vehicle for the party's far-left agenda.   Almost every page of the Democrats' concedes act has a provision that  helps China but hurts America.   Now, I know 3,000 pages is a lot to read, and my friends may not  always get the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to read it before they vote on  it. So I want to take an opportunity here to actually give you some of  the pages and what it actually does.   Now, here are just a few excerpts. On page 1689, it provides a new,  unlimited green card program for the Chinese Communist Party to  exploit.  [[Page H810]]                                     time  1500    It also allows research funds to freely flow to colleges and  universities that host Confucius Institutes which are essentially CCP  propaganda centers. They literally censor our colleges and campuses.   These policies would make our Nation more vulnerable to Chinese  espionage. In fact, the threat of Chinese spying in America is so  widespread that the FBI has 2,000 active cases. Think about that. There  are 2,000, almost as many pages as this bill is. They open a new case  every 12 hours. So as we debate this bill for the next few days, there  will be six new cases opened.   I wonder what they would do. How far would the Chinese spy? I have  watched a lot of Hollywood movies. I don't know. Could you imagine?  Would they go as far and as deep to even meet somebody and spy on them  when they are on the city council?   Would they develop a friendship through a college like we see here  with Confucius? Maybe they would even help if the city council person  wanted to run for Congress. Maybe they would go as far as, if this  person runs for Congress and they had developed this long relationship  from meeting in college, to offer to put people in their office, to  help them work in that office, the interns. It would be good.   Could they go as far as this person that got elected to Congress may  be just in their second term to get on one of the most influential  committees, the Committee on Intelligence? Could they go that far? With  the FBI opening up cases every 12 hours, if this person got on the  Committee on Intelligence, they would probably warn leadership here  about that, I would imagine, because they wouldn't know. If leadership  was warned about it, instantly that Member probably would not be on a  committee where they could hear secrets that Members here don't get to  know. Surely that person would not still be on that committee. I don't  know if this is Hollywood or not.   Mr. Speaker, what if that Member even wanted to run for President  after that? That would be shocking to me. It is probably too Hollywood.  It couldn't be true. It couldn't happen in today's world. I don't know.  The FBI has 2,000 active cases, and they open a new one every 12 hours.   So what are you doing to stop that? Oh, we are going to help them. We  are going to give them more money. We are going to give them a green  card program. I am sure, when the FBI warns of the next, maybe that  person could even become a subcommittee chair on the Committee on  Intelligence. That couldn't happen in America. I just know with new  leadership it won't be allowed.   On page 995, it requests a toothless report from the Biden  administration on the origins of COVID. Instead of taking action to get  real accountability, it is going to ask for a report. Now this  leadership could open a lot of select committees. They do that quite  often. Why don't we have a select committee on the origins of COVID?   I know we are going to debate this bill for a couple of days. Today,  I just got a notice we were going to have a memorial this week on the  steps of the Capitol like we had before, because 900,000 Americans have  now died because of COVID. That got postponed. I don't know if you know  why it was postponed. Was it postponed because we were debating this  bill and we didn't want to put them together at the same time? I am not  sure of that. I don't know. It is a question I would wonder.   Mr. Speaker, the bigger question I would wonder is, instead of just  sitting out there and giving a moment of silence, why wouldn't we give  them more time to explain why those 900,000 in America died, let alone  the millions around the world where it originated from? Don't you think  that would be a better use of our time? I know with the new leadership  we will have that committee.   On page 1396, it directs the American military to train to combat  climate change. How does that compete? I always thought the American  military would be trained to defend America, to protect America. But lo  and behold this Congress on page 1396 is going to direct the American  military to train to combat climate change. If the leadership in this  Congress was different, I know that would not be in there.   On page 1645, this is very important for competing. It creates a  Coral Reef Task Force because, you know, a Coral Reef Task Force,  somebody can cut himself, but 900,000 Americans can die of COVID, but  you can't have a task force on that to know where it originated from.  If anybody gets hurt from a coral reef, we have got the task force  right here in this building. That is going to make America compete like  no other country can.   On page 227, it creates a new Federal program to study plumbing. Mr.  Speaker, I will tell you we don't need any new program to study  plumbing. If anybody here wants to study plumbing, I know Markwayne  Mullin will give you a class day in and day out. Nobody is finer. He  has proven it. This is going to make America compete?   Mr. Speaker, 900,000 Americans can die, but you are not going to do  anything about understanding where the origin was created. We are  getting spied on every single day, all the way down to city council,  but we are not doing anything there. We are actually going to fund it  and let them do more. When it comes to coral reefs and plumbing, we are  going to excel.   On page 1392, it gives $8 billion. Can you imagine $8 billion? How do  we get $8 billion? We take it from the taxpayer. How does the taxpayer  get $8 billion? They wake up in the morning. They work. They are paying  more for gas. They are paying more for their milk, for their eggs, for  their breakfast. They are paying more for the masks they have got to  put on their kids, if the schools are even open. They earn less because  inflation hits them every day, but what we are going to do is take more  of their money.   Mr. Speaker, $8 billion, what would this Congress invest in? Well,  they are going to give it to the unaccountable U.N. Green Climate Fund.   Now what have they done with this fund? Where does this money go? If  it is really worthy, I am sure the American taxpayer would offer $8  billion more for this Congress to decide where they should be able to  send that so their kids can't enjoy maybe a day at Disneyland or  somewhere else or simply to be able to pay their electricity bill that  continues to rise.    Well, the U.N. is very, very accountable for this. They have already  funneled $100 million to China. So how does the America COMPETES Act do  anything to China but provide them more money? Whose money are they  provided? You are taking it from the hardworking American taxpayer to  give to China through the U.N. Maybe they can buy more solar panels and  batteries made by the slave labor in China but paid for by the American  taxpayer. I don't think that does much to help us to compete.   Now, Republicans have offered amendments to prevent China from using  that money. Wouldn't it seem like it would be an easy vote? I think it  would be hands down. I would really be interested in knowing who in  this body has constituents that have raised their hand and said they  will give $8 billion of their hard-earned taxpayer money so we can send  it to the U.N. for the Green Climate Fund that has given China $100  million. I would like to know that district.   We offered the amendment to stop it. Do you know what is so  interesting? There has to be at least 218 districts that want to do  that because it failed. The Democrats said no. They are in the  majority. So it had to be your districts. I am not sure if any of you  have taken a poll on that. Maybe I am wrong.   Mr. Speaker, all of these far-left policies would make America more  vulnerable. We might be stronger in the coral reef, but in everything  else we are going to be more vulnerable when it comes to China.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have spent this debate defending none of them.  Earlier this week the Biden White House never mentioned the word China  in a letter to the House Democrats, urging them to support the America  COMPETES Act.   How is that possible, Mr. Speaker? This is the White House with an  administration that has worked closely with this Democrat leadership.  This bill is all based upon competes, making us stronger against China.  The only thing I could think of is the White House must have read the  bill, because there is nothing in there that actually makes  [[Page H811]]  us stronger against China, only weaker. So I guess they didn't want to  mention it.   Now Democrats seem to be pivoting to talking about the economy. You  should be so proud of what you have done to the economy because you  have changed it. You have changed it drastically. It looks worse today  than it did 1 year ago. We have just passed the 1-year anniversary of  one-party rule. I am not sure you can blame other people for it. You  can show what you accomplished. Some have even said that this $320  billion will help reduce inflation. That is deja vu all over again.   Mr. Speaker, we were on this floor and lo and behold it became a  moment in time where no longer did we want to do anything bipartisan  when it came to COVID because now you had the Senate. You had the White  House. So I guess you think you didn't need to do that. So you came up  with this great idea to spend almost $2 trillion. You know what? I  can't blame you because it is kind of similar to this bill. Title it  COVID but only spent 9 percent on it. Spend $2 trillion. We come to the  floor, and we debate.   Mr. Speaker, we actually warned you. There were moments in time I  thought, should we warn you or should we not? But I care too much about  the country. It is too much pain. If you make this bill go through and  you spend $2 trillion, you are going to create inflation, a tax on  every single American. Oh, no, no, no, you said. Lo and behold, a year  later, we were right again.   Don't make the same mistake twice. Don't bring a bill where even the  President won't mention China. And don't lie to the American public  that it's going to make us stronger. If you are talking about the coral  reef bill, go right ahead.   It is not a surprise that Democrats want to change the subject.  Unfortunately, China is not waiting around for us to act. The real  threats we face should remind all of us about the importance of leading  by example and putting America first. That starts with taking the  threat of China seriously.   Mr. Speaker, I believe personally the two greatest threats to the  future of this country are the size of our debt and China. No matter  what you study in history, every great society that overextends  themselves collapses.   We have $30 trillion in debt, larger than our economy. You are here,  wanting to take more money to give to the U.N. to give to China. You  want to take more money to study plumbing. We all know water goes  downhill. You want to take more money to study the coral reef. You want  to tell the American public that we are going to be better, that we are  going to be able to compete.   Mr. Speaker, I don't sit here just to criticize. I tried to work, to  do it together, to make it better. House Republicans have tried to work  with Democrats on important issues. Three years ago, I remember  traveling to the 75th anniversary of Normandy. It is an unbelievable  location. I remember a lot of the Members went together. I went with  Speaker Pelosi.   I remember walking through the cemetery. You look at those headstones  from the Star of David to the cross. All the names were young men who  died, all about the same age and close in proximity. All died in about  the same timeframe. As you reflect on their life, you begin to reflect  on the position that we currently serve.                                time  1515    What action could have been done that that day never had to take  place? It wouldn't be a week before or a month before; it would be  years before. What position, what policy could we have done then as a  country that D-day didn't have to take place?   In doing so, as I ponder this, as we were sitting on foreign soil and  we were watching as Americans gave the ultimate sacrifice, their  lives--with the Speaker and others--and knowing what I think about our  debt and China, I asked the Speaker, could we create a committee, a  select committee--make it an equal number of Republicans and Democrats  so politics is out of it--to focus on not only making America compete,  but compete against China, from our critical minerals, from our medical  supplies, and others; that we could have a real plan that could come  out united as one.   Now, I didn't give up. I worked on it for like 8 months. I talked to  the majority leader, Steny Hoyer. I will tell you, we finally came to  agreement, and the answer was yes. I was so excited.   We worked on who would we appoint. We wanted to make it right. We  worked hard on it. We even came back, when the Democrats said it had to  be a smaller committee, I said, ``Okay, I will make it smaller just so  we can do it.''   In February 2020, a joint release was ready to go out. This is how  far we came. I don't know if you know the reporter Josh Rogin with the  Washington Post? We even brought him in to interview the Members of  Congress who were going to be appointed to this committee so we could  have a story about it. That is how close we were.   But just as that press release was ready to hit the button to go at  the time, on 2-24, Chairman Engel's staff said some small things needed  to be changed.   March 18, the early days of China coronavirus outbreak, and the  cover-up came out. A study published in March indicated that if Chinese  authorities had acted 3 weeks earlier than they did, the number of  cases could have been reduced by 95 percent. I am sure that committee  could have found a lot of that.   On May 7, 2020, The Washington Post wrote, ``GOP to Launch China Task  Force,'' because I wanted the Democrats to stay with us. We had the  reports; we had the names; we had everything; but they said no. They  said no. Three years ago they said no.   This select committee was not going to study the coral reef, was not  going to study plumbing, was simply going to focus on how does America  compete for the future, what do we need to compete against China. That  is all we were going to do. We were not going to take $8 billion and  give it to the U.N. to give to China. We weren't going to do any of  that.   So we went ahead without you. That was May 7. One week later, Mr.  Speaker, on May 14, the Speaker of this House, Nancy Pelosi, said:  ``Trump's focus on China is an interesting diversion.'' An interesting  diversion. Think about where we are today and if we had acted back  then.   Today, Mr. Speaker, Speaker Pelosi says the only thing is the GOP may  not want the President to have a victory, which is a sad statement on  their part because this is really a jobs issue and a national security  issue. Well, I am not sure, because in reading the bill, if it is a  jobs issue, I guess she takes that from the plumbing study. A national  security issue, I guess making our military trained against climate  change. But why couldn't we have done that 3 years ago, to have a real  committee?   Three years ago the bipartisan talks for the China Task Force, it did  take me a year, but unfortunately Speaker Pelosi walked away. Luckily  for America, the House Republicans started the task force anyway.   We quickly delivered hundreds of specific recommendations that  addressed every part of the China threat. There wasn't one bill on  plumbing or one bill on the coral reef.   In October of 2020 our China Task Force released something no  Congress in history has done before, a comprehensive blueprint to guide  our response to China. I am proud that it is the most thorough report  on China in the history of Congress. I am proud that it is bold,  achievable, and realistic. It identifies the threat of Communist China.  It doesn't reward them with money.   Two-thirds of those recommendations are bipartisan, and one-third  have already passed the House or the Senate. And we did not stop there.   On the issue of COVID, perhaps the greatest offense China has  committed, House Republicans offered eight reasonable solutions to  achieve justice for Americans and to hold China accountable, including  relocating the Olympics from Beijing.   Mr. Speaker, those opening ceremonies are going to be quite  interesting. President Xi and President Putin are probably going to be  arm in arm. I don't know, we might be arm in arm, I don't know the  exact day we are going to go out to pay tribute to the 900,000  Americans who died from COVID. More in the last year than the year  before.  [[Page H812]]    No select committee here to study the origins of it. Wouldn't you  want to know? None of those families can sue the people who created it.  That was one of the recommendations. I kind of think that would be  common sense. I kind of think we both could get to the same place.   Meanwhile, House Democrats picked this week of all weeks to finally  put a weak bill that requests moving the Games. Yeah, if you wait to  that very last day, I bet you could do it then, 2 days before they  begin. Frankly, it is too little and too late. I bet you China laughs  just like they laugh at this bill.   The actions of the majority tell you all you need to know about who  they truly want to help--themselves, their corporate allies, and the  Chinese Communist Party.   Mr. Speaker, I do not know what the Communist Party has on the  majority party here, but it must be powerful. It must be powerful. To  be that close to have a select committee, to have the reporter who  already had written the story to get pulled away, to have 900,000  American lives taken, and you move the date.   I don't know why, but could it be this bill at this time? There is  nothing in this bill to study the origins; there is nothing in this  bill to give those families the right to be compensated for the life  they lost. But there is money in here for China. There is money in here  to give more green cards. There is money in here where the institutes  could be continued.    Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues to take some time and think  deeply about what our country stands for. It certainly isn't this  political stunt by the majority.   Mr. Speaker, I will never question somebody's patriotism. The only  thing I ask is if you were there on the 75th anniversary of Normandy,  and you walked through, and you read those names, and you ever wondered  what could have been done beforehand, I think you would know this is  not the right path. I would hope you would have the political courage  to say so, and I would hope you would have the will to vote ``no,'' not  because your political life depends on it, but because America's future  depends on it.
