 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Inland Port  Dillon's 5-year anniversary.   South Carolina ports are a huge driver to a robust economy in our  State, and I am proud that the Seventh District in the Pee Dee plays  such an integral role in our State's port system through the Inland  Port Dillon.   When I visited there last month, Mr. Speaker, I witnessed firsthand  how the port connects South Carolina businesses to a global  marketplace.   I thank the dedicated team at the Inland Port Dillon for their work  to import and export thousands of container ships every year.   This port is as beneficial to the Pee Dee as it is to the rest of the  State. It is a huge driver for job growth and economic development in  this underserved area of South Carolina.   I look forward to seeing the port's future success and positive  impact in our region.                            ____________________
