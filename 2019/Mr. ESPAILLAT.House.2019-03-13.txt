 Madam Speaker, New York suffered a heartbreaking loss  with the passing of Donald Herbert Eaton, Jr., a Harlem native, a  Korean war veteran, and an accomplished community activist.   His life was marked by selflessness and perseverance, common threads  that guided him to serve his community and his Nation.   He was raised in a tough environment. Discrimination was at its peak.  Yet, when his Nation called on him, he went to war and served honorably  as a member of the 369th ``Harlem Hellfighters'' Infantry Regiment.   Upon his return, Eaton's longstanding commitment to service led him  to spend 20 years leading efforts to help those in need: veterans,  seniors, and the underprivileged.   Madam Speaker, may he rest in peace and may God comfort his children,  Donald Eaton III and Geoffrey Eaton, Sr., and his two grandchildren,  Geoffrey Eric Eaton, Jr., and Geoffrey S. Eaton III.                            ____________________
