Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse) pending which time I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be amended by striking the last sentence in the first  section of the resolution and insert ``All points of order against  provisions in the bill are waived.''.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in  support of the underlying legislation.   House Resolution 614 provides for consideration of three measures:  H.R. 4366, S.J. Res. 9, and S.J. Res. 24.   The rule provides for H.R. 4366, the Military Construction, Veterans  Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2024 to be  considered under a structured rule with 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member on the  Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees, and provides  one motion to recommit.   The rule makes in order 41 amendments.   Additionally, the rule provides for consideration S.J. Res. 9, a  resolution of congressional disapproval related to the lesser prairie- chicken under a closed rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Natural Resources or their designees, and provides one motion to  commit.   Finally, the resolution provides for consideration of S.J. Res. 24, a  resolution of congressional disapproval related to the northern long- eared bat under a closed rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Natural Resources or their designees, and provides one motion to  commit.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4366 fulfills our commitment to America's veterans  by fully funding their healthcare programs and benefits, providing  robust funding for mental health services, and rejecting the Biden  administration's efforts to insert far-left policies into the VA.   As a Navy veteran, I am proud that this bill improves the quality of  life for servicemembers by investing more than $17.6 billion in  military construction and family housing for our heroes.   This includes critical investments in childcare development centers,  upgrades to barrack housing, and billions to counter China in the Indo- Pacific.   Additionally, H.R. 4366 includes a provision prohibiting the closure  of Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and also prohibiting the use of  funds to build detainee facilities on U.S. soil.                                time  1230    As a veteran of the global war on terror and someone who prosecuted  terrorists in the Iraqi court system, I saw firsthand the destruction  and chaos caused by these radical extremists. Bringing these terrorists  to U.S. soil is unthinkable to me, and many of these terrorists were  directly involved in the September 11 terrorist attacks.   Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation also provides important  congressional oversight of the Biden administration.   S.J. Res. 9 and S.J. Res. 24 utilize the Congressional Review Act to  nullify the Department of the Interior's rules related to the lesser  prairie-chicken and the northern long-eared bat.   In both instances, bureaucrats from the Biden administration are  placing red tape on economic development and private land use, and  without warrant. These rules expose farmers to litigation and lawsuits  for routine farming activities, shut down existing conservation efforts  from private industry, and impose new restrictions on farmers and  ranchers.   This is just another example, another instance, of far-left, extreme  Democrats in Washington, D.C., making it more costly for Americans to  make a living, put food on the table, and develop our rural  communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let's just go back and look at what has been said over the last few  months. For the last few months, the administration and extreme  congressional Democrats have been spreading lies that House Republicans  were cutting veterans benefits. These lies were merely designed to  score cheap political points at the expense of our veterans.   Let's go through a few of the quotes from extreme Democrats.    President Biden stated in May: ``Republicans in Congress proposed  budget cuts that would threaten veterans housing services, medical  care, and mental health care.''   It didn't stop there. Ranking Member Takano stated, on April 26, they  are holding veterans benefits ``hostage, again pointing to concerns  about fiscal responsibility.''   In the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Schumer stated, on March 1:  ``Republican proposals would narrow healthcare eligibility for veterans  and cut VA mandatory funding.''   Now we get to this week, when House Republicans will pass a bill that  will fully fund veterans benefits, fully fund veterans healthcare, and  fully fund all other veterans programs. This bill provides the VA $16.4  billion over the fiscal year 2023 enacted level and matches the  President's budget request for fiscal year 2024.   There is no question who was and who was not misleading the American  people. There is no question that our actions today support veterans.  Just watch to see how many of those Democrats will vote ``no''  tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Langworthy), my good friend and a member of the House Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, since we are discussing the Department of the Interior's  out-of-touch rulemaking decisions this week, let's talk about last week  with the Department of the Interior. The Department proposed a new rule  adding barriers to the future of energy production. This decision will  drastically impact oil and gas investments and will raise energy costs  for hardworking Americans.   Let's not forget that under the Trump administration, our Nation was  energy independent, and this rulemaking will only deepen our reliance  on foreign adversaries for energy.   According to a recent Morning Consult poll, 88 percent of Americans  believe we should produce oil and gas here in the United States, and 85  percent agree domestic energy production counters China and Russia.  Again, that is 85 percent. In addition, 88 percent believe that  domestic energy production will help lower costs for families. That is  88 percent. These seem to me like pretty overwhelming numbers.   However, we have a bunch of unelected, career bureaucrats who are  accountable to no one who are making these decisions. It is clear that  Biden's Department of the Interior rulemaking continues to hurt our  national security, our economy, and our energy independence, not to  mention how wildly out of step this administration is with the American  people. It is time that extreme Democrats stop the war on American  energy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is amazing, I guess if you say something to knock  people, you just assume they are going to think it is true.   Let's talk about the facts. Let's talk about the numbers. This bill  provides the VA $16.4 billion above FY23 levels. We are over the levels  the Democrats passed last year. We are actually at the levels that the  President wanted, that he put in his budget request for FY24. We are  fully funding the VA.   My crystal ball is broken today, but I am willing to bet that every  single Democrat will vote ``no'' on this bill which, again, fully funds  the VA and all the programs that they are talking about. Let's just see  where they vote tomorrow. It is quite amazing.   The talk about DEI in the military, under the Biden administration  DEI created a recruiting and retention crisis without any reason for  doing this, and that has weakened our military readiness. I was in the  Navy. I lived through this.   I can tell you that DEI and CRT are plummeting our recruitment  numbers. For what? From 2015 to 2020, the Army went on a witch hunt.  The Army reported 21 of roughly a million soldiers were subject to  disciplinary actions due to participation in extremist organizations.  That was in 2020, they said a million soldiers were involved in this.    In 2021, the DOD did a study on that, and it reported that less than  100 of the over 2 million servicemembers actually participated in  prohibited activity. For those of you without a calculator, that is  roughly 0.00005 percent. That is what we are fighting over here.   The underlying legislation we are talking about actually eliminates  wasteful spending for DEI and CRT, and puts it where we need it, in  veterans' programs and military construction. It also does a lot to  reverse the negative impact on military readiness and what is driving  down our recruitment--just one of the many things that is driving down  our recruitment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We can sit here and talk about the numbers all day because the  Republicans, we have actually increased military construction $800  million over what President Biden requested in his budget. We are $800  million over what the President wanted.   Where are we using that money? Well, we are using it in places like  the South Pacific. Today, China is the global leader in human rights  abuses.   In 2021, the Trump administration determined that the CCP is  committing genocide against the Uyghurs. In the South China Sea, China  is militarizing disputed territory and growing their malign influence.   In 2020, let's not forget that China ended Hong Kong's longstanding  autonomy and a democracy came crashing down.   In 2019, a manmade virus escaped from a Chinese lab in Wuhan, killing  tens of millions around the world. In the near future, the CCP plans to  invade our ally, the free and independent democracy of Taiwan.   That is why I support the underlying legislation which focuses  investment in the Pacific theater by providing $1.425 billion for  infrastructure related to the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and $131  million for U.S. INDOPACOM. That is the Indo-Pacific Command.  [[Page H3973]]    Again, think about those numbers. Think about combating China and  their malign influences. When the Democrats sit here and say they are  going to vote against this bill, they are voting against strengthening  our Pacific theater against the malign influence of the CCP.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this  time, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I thank my good friend from Colorado for the spirited debate. I  always enjoy it.   We are here today because the Biden administration wants to tell the  American people what they can do, how they can live. They want to tell  you what kind of car you have to drive. They want to tell you what kind  of stove that you can buy. They want to tell you what kind of energy  you can use to heat your home.   Now, under these Department of the Interior rules, Biden bureaucrats  want to place further burdens on our farmers and ranchers, our rural  communities, and economic development and on public and private land.   Instead of focusing on the lesser prairie-chicken and the long-eared  bat, maybe the Department should focus on securing our domestic energy  supply chains and supporting American energy independence. Maybe that  is the real purpose of why we are here talking about these issues, to  force this Department to actually focus on what matters to American  security and the American economy.   I urge my colleagues to send that message to the Biden administration  and support the underlying legislation.   Additionally, as a Navy veteran, I support the underlying legislation  that fulfills our commitments to America's veterans, our  servicemembers, and their families.  [[Page H3974]]                                     time  1315    Let's not forget that this MILCON-VA bill is $800 million for  military construction over what President Biden requested in his budget  request for FY24. It is also at the President's requested level of  FY24. Maybe instead of attacking these numbers, my Democratic  colleagues should be attacking their far-left Democratic President who  wanted numbers below what the Republicans wrote for these numbers, and,  again, we are fully funding Biden's requested VA numbers.   It is simple that a ``no'' vote on this is a vote against our  veterans, and that is absolutely horrifying. Our country has sent  generations of heroes around the globe to defend our freedoms and the  freedoms of others. It is essential that we now take care of those who  took care of us.   For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  previous question and ``yes'' on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Neguse is as follows:       An Amendment To H. Res. 614 Offered By Mr. Neguse of Colorado         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 9. Clause 1 (c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
