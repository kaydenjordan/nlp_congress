 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Committee  on Natural Resources from the State of Arkansas.   Mr. Speaker, here we are, yet again, discussing the most important  issue of our day: cats. Not just any cats, but big cats.    My constituents have been hammering my office about this issue.  Thankfully, my Democrat colleagues have been listening.   Of course, I jest.   I shouldn't be allowing this issue to be taking my time, and neither  should you, Mr. Speaker.   My constituents are not talking about big cats. There are some  misplaced priorities here. They are talking about skyrocketing food and  energy prices and the never-ending deficit spending from this  Democratic Congress. That is what is going on in my district.   Here is another big concern for Idaho and across the West: wildfire.   Mr. Speaker, 5.6 million acres--that is million with an M--have  burned just  [[Page H7394]]  this year to date. For those of you who don't live in the West or are  not familiar with it, wildfire is what you get when you choke off  access to your forests and regulate away the ability to properly manage  your land. That is what the current leadership is doing. Yet, here we  are talking about big cats.   Do I dare mention the southern border crisis?   There were 207,416 apprehensions last month alone with who knows how  many got-aways, how much sex trafficking, or how much illegal  narcotics. But don't worry. Congress is working on big cats.   Mr. Speaker, we have had a lot of things on the agenda here for the  last few months, and there are many things that are burning in the  minds of our constituents and the people whom we serve.   The people whom we serve deserve better. The people whom we serve are  not talking about the things that we are. But yet here we are working  through things that simply do not matter in the scheme of everything  else going on right now.
