 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise to offer an amendment  transferring $15 million to the CDC's Opioid-Related Infectious Disease  program.   Madam Chair, one of the deadly consequences of the opioid crisis and  its related use of contaminated drug equipment has been the increased  incidence of blood-borne infections, including hepatitis, HIV, and  bacteria-caused heart infections.   The CDC's infectious disease program works to implement evidence- based drug prevention in schools and community settings.   The opioid crisis has impacted nearly every community in the United  States, rich and poor, rural and urban, and people of all racial and  cultural identities.   In my own home borough of the Bronx, fatal overdoses are now at their  highest rate since official data has even been made public, and 85  percent of those overdoses involved opioids.   In order for us to really approach and solve this issue, we have to  make sure that we are adequately funding programs that are backed by  evidence and backed by studies and funded in a way that reduces the  load and reduces the incidence of fatality.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I think it is important that we  acknowledge and really recognize that this amendment is addressing the  appropriation--it is an amendment to the  [[Page H4612]]  appropriation in health and human services.   The opioid crisis is here, and there is no denying that this is a  crisis on our doorstep. There are multiple levers and multiple  solutions that we can approach in order to treat the amount of pain  that is being experienced across the country.   So with that being said, what we really need to focus on is what  those levers are, and one of these is the fact that infectious  diseases, the rates of hepatitis B, hepatitis C are exploding due to  the injection methods in the opioid crisis and self-administering  opioids.   That being said, we have to address this issue. We are not even  asking for an increased appropriation. We are asking for a transfer of  funds. So it is the same amount of funding, but we are just  transferring it to a place where it is going to be most effective and  treat and impact more families positively.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer this critical  bipartisan amendment that will allow United States researchers to study  and examine the extraordinary promise shown by several schedule I drugs  that have been shown in treating critical diseases, such as MDMA's  success in veteran PTSD, psilocybin's promise in treatment-resistant  depression, or ibogaine's effectiveness in opioid and other drug  addiction. Additionally, this will allow research into marijuana's  impact in cancer relief, seizure treatment, and more.   This amendment strikes a war-on-drugs provision that prohibits any  activity ``promoting the legalization of any drug included in schedule  I of the Controlled Substance Act.'' The problem with this provision is  that it is so vague and broadly interpreted that it prevents scientists  from researching, examining, and exploring avenues of treatment that  could alleviate an enormous amount of suffering from medical  conditions.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa).    Madam Chair, my colleague across the aisle said we  need to research this more, and I agree, and that is why this amendment  is being introduced.   The note was brought up that there is a rider provision saying that  there is an exception for those drugs that have shown medical promise,  but we cannot prove that medical promise unless we fund the research to  actually have it in the first place.   So we have a catch-22, and we have to get rid of it.   There are war-on-drugs provisions in so many Federal statutes beyond  just the one schedule, the one scheduling of these drugs.   I am a strong believer in evidence-based policymaking, and wherever  there is evidence of good, we have a moral obligation to pursue and  explore the parameters of that good, even if it means challenging our  past assumptions or admitting past wrongs.   Thirty percent of all military veterans have considered suicide--30  percent. So if a substance shows promise in treating PTSD, we have an  obligation to study it.   One of the leading causes of death in America today is suicide. So if  a schedule I drug shows clinical promise in treating and in treatment- resistant depression, perhaps it is not the drug we should say is  morally wrong, but perhaps it is the law, the schedule, the statute.                                time  0215    Moreover, I am proud to say that this is a bipartisan amendment. My  colleagues on the other side of the aisle often bemoan the role of  government and promote ideas of choice. Here, in that spirit, I am  happy to agree, to say we should get government and political opinion  out of scientific research that we have seen and has shown promise in  any way that can help people and their medical needs.   Lastly, I understand that the politics of this bill may make it  difficult for some to support right now. But I propose this amendment,  and I urge my colleagues to support it, because politics isn't always  about winning today. It is about fighting for what is right in the  future and for future generations.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
