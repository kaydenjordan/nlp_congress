 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2331, the  SBA Cyber Awareness Act of 2019. This bill has had my full support  since its introduction and I am happy to support its passage today.   I want to first thank my good friend, the gentleman from Colorado,  for his leadership on this effort. It is nice to see Congress attempt  to solve problems not only in a bipartisan manner, but also proactively  before problems occur, rather than waiting until something goes wrong.   This bill addresses a potential weakness within the Small Business  Administration's cybersecurity infrastructure. By passing this bill, we  will proactively guard against harmful and widespread cyberattacks by  bringing the Small Business Administration's cybersecurity defenses  into the 21st Century. This bill will protect the sensitive business  and personal information of millions of small business owners across  the country.   In a rapidly-developing digital age, strong cybersecurity protections  and reinforcements are of the utmost importance. Many small businesses  don't have the defensive infrastructure to deal with cyberattacks, A  threat to cybersecurity is a threat to small businesses' vitality.  that's why this bill is so important.   We, as Congress, must lift up the small businesses of America and  ensure they have the support they need to address this ever-changing  online environment. And this bill is a bipartisan example of that.   Once again, I thank my colleague from Colorado for his proactive  leadership, and I urge the passage of H.R. 2331.
