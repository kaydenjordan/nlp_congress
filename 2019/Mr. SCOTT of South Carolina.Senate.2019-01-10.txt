 Mr. President, each new year brings with  it a range of different emotions. We look back on what we have  accomplished in the last year, what we hope to achieve in the year to  come, and think of ways we can better ourselves.   Some of our objectives may include eating just a little less. For me,  that  [[Page S129]]  means eating a little less sour cream pound cake or sweet potato pie,  which is something I can completely control, and I am trying.   As a nation, though, we need to look at some goals for the new year  that will help us move forward together--goals that may be a little  tougher and require all of us to work together. While we may have some  uncomfortable conversations--and we will--we must recognize that at the  end of the day, we are family, both inside our homes and as Americans,  in the land of the free and the home of the brave.   As we look to 2019, I am hopeful we can take three lessons and carry  them forward. Those who follow me know I have focused my time in the  Senate on an opportunity agenda that focuses on helping people rise  from poverty in distressed communities, helping folks who are living  paycheck to paycheck to experience the greatness that is, in fact, the  American dream, and I will continue to focus on those issues in 2019,  but you will also hear from me in 2019 what I believe are some missing  keys to American progress. Those keys are civility, fairness, and  opportunity.   So when you are having dinner and a family member tries to tell you  that the reigning Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles--lucky, of  course, to be in the playoffs at all--are in fact the best football  team in America, we all know the truth: It is America's team, the  Dallas Cowboys. You will have a discussion with your family friend who  believes otherwise, and I hope you will disagree strongly, that you  will argue with facts, history--the history of Roger Staubach or Troy  Aikman or Emmitt Smith or Tony Dorsett or ``Too Tall'' Jones--and you  argue that with history and with passion, but you know, at the end of  the day, your crazy uncle is still your crazy uncle. You will see each  other next weekend. You will hug, and you will start the same fight all  over again, but you see what you have done is you have agreed to  disagree without being disagreeable. That, at its core, is the civility  our Nation is sorely missing right now.   Too often too many seem too focused on saying whatever they want to  say and saying it more loudly, without any concern for the actual  content. We need to return to civility, where the other side isn't evil  or a traitor or trying to destroy our country, but they simply have a  different vision for how to achieve success.   Second, sometimes we struggle to make sure our loved ones, especially  our kids around Christmastime, are treated fairly. So as they open  their presents, we want to make sure everyone has a chance to play with  everything. This is what we call trying to be fair. As a parent--or in  my case as the giver of cool gifts--we want to make sure the kids are  being fair with their siblings as they play with the new toys. There is  something in each and every one of us that yearns for fairness, but too  often, when we leave the comfort of those mornings, we tend to want  more for ourselves than we want for others. We want people to treat us  in a way that gives us the benefit of the doubt, but sometimes we don't  want to give it in return. Being fair means first seeking to understand  before being understood.   Finally, opportunity. I want to look back at a Christmas tradition in  my hometown of North Charleston, a place where we see amazing things  happen around the Christmas holidays. We see police officers,  firefighters, and community volunteers coming together about 6 a.m. on  Christmas morning to go knock on doors, where they know definitively  there are kids without Christmas trees, much less Christmas presents.  These police officers, firefighters, and community volunteers join  hands and raise a ton of dollars and bring presents to the doors.  Anyone who has experienced this, as I have, cannot fully describe the  joy on a child's face, the emotion and the tears of happiness for  someone who didn't expect a single thing for the holidays, because  opportunity is just not about ourselves and our families. While we  certainly strive to be successful, the true meaning of the Christmas  and the holiday season lies in what we do for others.   For Congress, that means everything we do--everything we do--should  be with an eye toward improving the lives of all Americans. For folks  at home, remember, there are folks in your community who are less  fortunate. This became the greatest Nation on Earth because of our  hearts and our minds, the hearts and minds of the American people, the  power and endurance of the American dream, and the graciousness and  strength of the American spirit; in other words, American  exceptionalism. Civility, fairness, and opportunity are three words  that can help our Nation heal and move us forward toward a better  future.   My hope this year is that we will take some time to think about what  each of us can do to further these goals. Resolutions are good. Being  resolute in our mission to strengthen our Nation is great. Soon I will  speak about my vision for the future, my America 2030 plan.   I want to say happy new year and ask everyone to remember the true  spirit of what makes America great.        Recognizing the Clemson Tigers' 2019 NCAA Championship Victory    Mr. President, before I close, I would like to talk, just for a few  minutes, about an epic celebration in a small upstate city in the great  State of South Carolina--a celebration that is because of a game. Now,  in South Carolina, we have real division. The divisions can be seen  between those who support the Clemson Tigers and those like myself who  support the Carolina Gamecocks. After the Clemson national championship  victory, both sides of the great State of South Carolina--at least most  of us--are celebrating the absolute overwhelming success of the Clemson  Tigers. You can't help but appreciate and admire the amazing leadership  at Clemson University, the leadership of Jim Clements, the President of  Clemson University.   Clemson has been an amazing testament to the goodwill and good effort  of programs focused on character first. As Coach Swinney has created an  absolute powerhouse in Clemson, it is hard to deny that he is not one  of the best coaches in college football in America today. He has  surrounded himself with amazing players such as Deshaun Watson, DeAndre  Hopkins, Vic Beasley, and now Trevor Lawrence, Travis Etienne, and  Christian Wilkins.   I want to extend my congratulations to Clemson University on their  second national championship in just the last 4 years and their third  overall national championship. I wish I could be in Clemson on Saturday  morning at 9 a.m. as they--they don't have to paint the streets orange  because they are already orange--but as they blow out the great city  they live in. I will say that not only am I heartened and excited about  the success of Clemson University on the field, I thought, listening to  Dabo Swinney as he talked about success in life, it reminded me of my  civility, fairness, and opportunity agenda for 2019.   He said something to this effect. When asked about his success and  the greatness of his football team and the wonders of winning a  national championship, what did he celebrate the most? He said it in  this fashion. He said: When I think about being selfless, when I think  about real success, it is in this order. First, it is about honoring  the Lord Jesus Christ, his Lord and Savior; second, it is about  honoring others; and third, finally, it comes down to self. There is  something to learn about putting others before ourselves as we look  toward a more civil society, filled with fairness, brimming with  opportunity.   I yield the floor.    Would the Senator yield for a moment?    I will concede that while I am exuberant  and excited for the enthusiasm for Clemson's success this year, I am  aware that next year Clemson and Alabama may meet again. So the more  you celebrate this year, perhaps the more you will regret it next year.  [[Page S130]]    Thank you, Senator.
