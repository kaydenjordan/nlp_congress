 Mr. Speaker, as August approaches,  reopening schools is now at the forefront of the American agenda.   The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advocates that we should  start with a goal of having students back physically in the classroom.  As an experienced physician of more than 30 years, I concur with the  AAP, and I believe that the science and the data point toward reopening  our schools in America.   This is why I introduced the Open Schools Responsibly Act yesterday,  which provides liability protection to schools that adhere to CDC and  State guidelines. As we want to open schools again, then educational  administrators need to have the confidence that they will not face the  brunt of frivolous lawsuits.   Obviously, schools that reopen without taking the proper precautions  should be held accountable, and this legislation will still ensure that  is the case. We want to protect everyone, from exceedingly low-risk  students up to our higher-risk older teachers.   We simply cannot allow our children, especially our higher-at-risk  children, to fall further behind in their education. So, it is  Congress' duty to pass liability protection to let our kids get back to  school and get back on track.                            ____________________
