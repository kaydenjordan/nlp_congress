 Mr. President, the actions by the Trump administration  regarding undocumented immigrants in this country have been ineffective  and nothing short of heartless. Their priorities have abandoned long- held practices such as the need to focus limited enforcement resources  on those who actually present a public safety risk.   These changes are being felt by families across the country. Last  fall, Rosa Maria Hernandez, a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who  was taken to the hospital for urgent surgery was forcibly taken into  custody by ICE when she was discharged, instead of being released into  the care of her parents as recommended by her doctors. A few months  ago, Jose Fuentes who was fleeing El Salvador with his 1-year-old son,  Mateo, was detained at the border and transferred to a facility in San  Diego while Mateo was held in Texas. These actions are appalling and  run counter to the time honored values in this country. No child should  be separated from their parents in this way. The effect of such a  traumatic experience and disrupted attachments on children, adolescents  and families is longlasting. The cost of these failed policies will not  be fully realized for years to come.   Under current policy, families are supposed to be kept intact while  awaiting a decision on whether they will be deported and held in  special family detention centers or released with a court date. The  Trump administration's proposed policy change sends parents to adult  detention facilities, while their children would be placed in shelters  designed for juveniles or with a relative in the United States.   Wendy Smith recently wrote an article in the Chronicle of Social  Change on the Trump administration's proposed policy of separating  immigrant children from parents entering the United States illegally,  as a means of deterring immigrant families from coming to the United  States. I ask unanimous consent that this January 29, 2018, article  entitled ``Separating Families at the Border Will Multiply Child  Trauma'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            [From the Chronicle of Social Change, Jan. 29, 2018]        Separating Families at the Border Will Multiply Child Trauma                              (By Wendy Smith)         Parents do not uproot their children to make a long and       dangerous journey to an uncertain future in the U.S. unless       the circumstances in their home country are so threatening       that the risks of migration pale in comparison to more       certain risks at home. They leave their homes, other family       members, schools, churches and familiar communities because       they feel they must.        In December 2017, the Trump Administration proposed a new       policy of separating immigrant children from parents entering       the U.S. illegally, as a means of discouraging or deterring       immigrant families from Central America and other countries       from coming to the U.S.        Although the administration has already engaged in this       practice in some cases, this policy would alter the current       standard, which has attempted to keep families intact while       asylum issues are considered and addressed.        As a former psychotherapist, I saw first-hand the long-      lasting effects of traumatic experience and disrupted       attachments on children, adolescents and families. Having       taught courses in child development, I know that development       of the brain and the child are inextricably linked to       environmental opportunities and dangers, and to the       continuing presence of important relationships to mediate the       environment.        Recovery from trauma and attachment loss is possible, but       requires enormous time, effort and care. This knowledge tells       me that a policy of separating families should sound an alarm       for us all.        Advocates, immigration experts, academics and lawyers have       voiced concerns regarding the issues of constitutionality,       deterrence, negative effects and unanticipated consequences,       alongside the undermining of the core American value of       family unity.        The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child--      ratified by every country on the planet except Somalia, Sudan       and the United States--specifies that children, including       immigrant and refugee children, should be treated with       dignity and respect and should not be exposed to conditions       that may harm or traumatize them.        Family unity and reunification is one of the primary stated       goals of the U.S. immigration system, found in many sections       of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952. It is       also a central theme of American identity. In Moore v. City       of East Cleveland, the Supreme Court held that ``the       Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely       because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in       this nation's history and tradition.''        The constitution does not allow the government to detain       one asylum-seeking family for the sole purpose of deterring       that action on the part of other families. And finally,       through both United Nations conventions and protocols and       U.S. law, migrants have rights not to be returned where their       life or freedom would be threatened on the basis of race,       religion, nationality, social group or opinion. If these       factors exist, migrants can seek asylum if they can show       ``well-founded'' fear of persecution.        The impact of such policies on children is severe. Stress       is defined as the result of events or circumstances in which       physical or psychological demands exceed our ability to cope.       A critical buffer to the detrimental effects of stress is a       protective relationship, such as with a parent who can       provide comfort and a sense of safety.        Prolonged exposure to stress in the absence of a protective       relationship causes the human stress response system to       remain activated, preventing rest and recovery of the coping       system, and the child's ability to manage or regain the sense       of safety necessary to move forward in life is severely       compromised.        Trauma, the most extreme form of toxic stress, is the       occurrence of events or situations in which one's physical or       psychological integrity is threatened (such as a  [[Page S1157]]       natural disaster, an assault, or the violent or sudden loss       of a loved one).        Leaving home, making a difficult journey, and arriving in a       new country are circumstances that profoundly affect       children. Separation from parents on the heels of these       overwhelming experiences can be terrifying, and may have       long-lasting effects.        Trauma exposure and disrupted attachment can have similar       negative outcomes; when the two are combined, the negative       effects on children's development and functioning may be       compounded.        Adversity early in life is associated with deficits in such       important functions as cognitive performance, executive       functions, and the processing of social and emotional       stimuli, among others. The nature and severity of deficits is       related to the nature of the trauma, the presence or absence       of protective relationships, and the age and vulnerability of       the child.        A 2010 study that examined effects of immigration raids on       children ages 0-17--during the first six months after the       enforcement activities, and again after nine months--noted       problems with basic functions such as eating and sleeping,       constant crying, and widespread changes to behavior, school       performance, and developmental reversal, or loss of       developmental milestones that had been achieved prior to the       separation from parents. In other words, the sudden and       unexpected loss of parents not only impeded forward       development, but sent children backwards on the developmental       trajectory.        Traumatized and suffering children, disrupted or delayed       development, long-term educational and behavioral problems--      these are neither reasonable nor morally acceptable trade-      offs for the unproven possibility that future families will       be persuaded not to enter our country illegally.        The policy of separating families at the border must be       abandoned in favor of alternatives that are humane,       constitutional and supportive of family unity.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the University of Vermont's College of  Nursing has so much of which to be proud. My wife, Marcelle, who serves  on the college's advisory board, recently showed me a touching article  about Barbara Tennien Murphy. It speaks so much to the value of nurses  and the education they received in Vermont, just as Marcelle did. I ask  unanimous consent that this article, which was published on the  university's website last year, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   UVM Nursing Through the Decades: 1940s         Taking the Lead: Barbara Tennien Murphy '47        In June 1947, the first students to achieve a bachelor's       degree in nursing from the University of Vermont crossed the       lawn in front of the Waterman Building to accept their       diplomas. Of the 267 students graduating UVM that day, only       two were in the new five-year nursing program: Ruby Sanderson       of Winsted, Connecticut and Barbara Tennien, of Pittsford,       Vermont. At 92 years old, in the year of her 70th college       reunion, Barbara Tennien Murphy '47 reflected on her time at       UVM with fondness and gratitude for being part of something       important.        Few women attended college in the 1940s and most nurses       lacked academic degrees. ``You didn't even need a high school       diploma to become a nurse. A bachelor's degree for nursing       was very new,'' Murphy said. ``Getting a degree wasn't a big       deal to me, but there weren't a lot of choices (for women). I       liked math and was pretty good at it.''        Murphy comes from a family full of UVM graduates and       working professionals: Her father, Jerome Tennien '15,       majored in agriculture and served on the UVM student council.       He managed a U.S. government farm in Panama before settling       on his family farm in Pittsford, Vermont, where he taught       agriculture at the local high school. Uncles Jim Tennian `10       and Bill Tennian `17 studied engineering. Murphy's brother,       Jim `43, a mechanical engineer at Wright Field in Ohio, died       in a test flight crash shortly after graduating. Her mother,       Mary, was a nurse, and sister, Mary, attended the College of       St. Rose and taught high school in Windsor, Vermont.        Murphy entered UVM in 1942, before UVM offered a nursing       degree. ``I started in home economics. I was not in love with       it. The next year the nursing program began. I immediately       knew that was what I wanted,'' she recalled. ``I wanted to       use my brain to make my hands work, and they very nicely       opened the doors to a degree in nursing. I felt very       comfortable with it, I felt complete.''                             COMPASSION AND FOCUS         Murphy admired her mother, who went on medical calls in       Pittsford with the town doctor and occasionally cared for       patients in the Tennien home. One patient, a little girl       about six years old, affected her deeply.        ``Her leg had been cut off by a mowing machine on a farm.       They hacked it off and gave her a metal prosthesis to wear on       her leg. I was 17, and I felt that I wanted to take care of       her,'' Murphy remembered. ``It was a compassion, for her and       for others who needed people to care for them. My mother       cared for people. She went to the neighbors and took care of       things for them. Nobody talked about it, it's just what we       did. It was what I wanted.''        While at UVM, Murphy participated in the All Sports Club       and lettered in Rifle, an activity taught by an army sergeant       at a firing range on campus. ``I liked shooting,'' she       explained. ``I also played badminton and bowled. The       university had bowling allies with duckpins.''        World War II was underway, and most young American men were       off to war, so UVM students were predominantly female. The       men's dormitories became sorority housing. Murphy lived in       Slade Hall. The workload was intense, she said, so she had       little time for sororities.        ``That first year, you didn't get credit for nursing       classes, and so you had to take a lot of classes. One year I       carried 22 credit hours, which was completely insane. But if       you wanted to do it, that's what you had to do. We were the       first class, they were experimenting on us,'' she quipped.       ``I liked the work at school, and I liked the work at the       hospital.''        Murphy did her nursing clinicals at Mary Fletcher Hospital,       a predecessor to the University of Vermont Medical Center.       With the war in progress, most of the male staff and hospital       supplies had gone to the front lines.        ``It was war time, and all the porters and help were in the       army, so we did everything. We did the cooking of the baby's       formulas, scraping the meat of gristle for baby food and       washing the linens. We made sure the babies, children and old       people taken care of. We washed diapers and bed pans.''        She believes that the hard work and long days helped her       become a better nurse.        ``I finished my 8 hours and then at 7:00 when we went off-      duty, we mopped the floors after because we didn't have       anyone else to do it. The head nurse was mopping beside you.       Everyone worked together to accomplish what needs to be       done,'' she recalled. ``Some of the time it was boring, but       we learned what you do when you don't have what you need, and       how to do it if a lot of stuff is not available. It makes for       an excellent adult life. I know my responsibility to my       patients.''                              SHOWING GRATITUDE         Murphy passed the Vermont Board of Nurse Registration exam       to become an R.N. in 1947. She received a gold seal and       second highest honors with 94 points, just one point less       than Ruby Sanderson. ``I didn't mind. Ruby was a nice person       and a hard worker,'' Murphy said.        After graduating, Murphy taught nursing at Barre City       Hospital, a forerunner to Central Vermont Medical Center, and       then worked at the Boston Children's Hospital. In this       period, she experienced an event that shaped her outlook on       life and informed her future relationships.        The polio epidemic was in full swing in the late 1940s, and       the young nurse Tennien was assigned to manage the hospital's       polio ward. Her unit included the infectious disease       laboratory where microbiologist John Franklin Enders       cultivated poliovirus for vaccine development (for which he       received the 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine). He grew the       virus in human cells--fecal matter--and it was Nurse       Tennien's job to collect stool specimens, prepare them       properly and send them to the lab.        ``One day, someone bumped into me in the hall--I thought it       was one of the underlings,'' she recalled. ``He said, `I know       who you are Miss T. I couldn't do my job if you didn't do       yours so well.' It was John Enders!'' His praise resonated       with the young nurse, and she never forgot that feeling.        ``He admitted that other people under him doing the scut       work are equally important because they keep him going. It       wasn't an inspiring thing to do, collecting smelly stools,       but he couldn't have grown the polio virus without me. I've       always tried to make sure the people under me knew they were       appreciated.''        She married William Murphy, an aircraft engineer she met on       a blind date arranged by her assistant head nurse. Eventually       they settled in Connecticut where Bill worked at Pratt &       Whitney, and together they raised five children, a girl       followed by four boys.        She attended graduate school at Boston University, studying       for a Masters degree in nursing. She completed all of the       coursework, but never wrote her thesis. ``I had all the       knowledge and I always worked, but I never tried to establish       a big career because I had six others I was taking care of.''        Murphy worked in a nursing home at night so she could care       for her children during the day. ``People would say to me,       `How do you take care of an eight-room house and five kids       and volunteer in the school library and work nights in a       nursing home?' Well, you put one foot in front of the other       and keep slogging along--it's all good,'' she said.                                 A FULL HEART         Working with elders in a nursing home amplified Murphy's       great appreciation for the power of love in healing. She       recalled, ``We had two old ladies in adjoining beds. One was       dying, and the woman in the bed next to her said, `Move that       bureau so that I can be next to her.' Margaret held her hand       all night and pulled her through it. She didn't die. We gave       her the oxygen, and she gave her the love.''        Murphy also taught math at Saint Francis School of Nursing       in Hartford, Connecticut, teaching students how to calculate       percentages for solutions and medications. ``In those  [[Page S1158]]       days, the nurses on the floor mixed up their own IV's, it       didn't come out of the pharmacy,'' she explained. ``We didn't       have IV teams or drip machines. Now that seems like ancient       history.''        She retired from Manchester Memorial Hospital in       Manchester, Connecticut, in 1987 at age 62, when her husband       became ill and required constant care. She and Bill moved to       Putney, Vermont, and when he passed she moved in with her       children. She only recently stopped volunteering for her       church, visiting the sick and washing alter linens. Murphy       stays fit and spry with daily walks on a treadmill, healthy       diet, reading books and playing board games with her eight       grandchildren. She enjoys keeping up with health science news       and reading scholarly articles online. She's honored to       represent the first generation of college-educated nurses,       and delighted to watch the profession's evolution and       progress.        ``I follow nursing and the sciences. There are so many       things in my life now that people speak of so routinely, that       didn't exist before. I've done it all, from prenatal to old       people's homes, and I've had a ball,'' she reflected.       ``Nursing is what I am. I'm proud to see the young women who       work in labs or go into other countries and use their       education.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize  the inspiring and dedicated work of Cecile Richards, who has recently  announced she is stepping down as president of Planned Parenthood after  12 years.   Throughout her tenure as president of Planned Parenthood, Cecile has  been a passionate advocate for healthcare for women and men across the  country. Despite the constant attacks leveled at Planned Parenthood in  recent years, the organization managed to grow stronger with Cecile at  the helm. Today Planned Parenthood has more volunteers, supporters, and  donors than it ever has had before. None of that would have been  possible without Cecile's exemplary leadership.   Millions of Americans depend on Planned Parenthood for their  healthcare, and for many, Planned Parenthood is their only source of  care. As president, Cecile maintained Planned Parenthood's mission, and  she never stopped fighting for the millions of American women and men-- including tens of thousands of Vermonters--that have trusted and  depended on Planned Parenthood for their basic healthcare needs,  including annual health exams, cervical and breast cancer tests, and  HIV screenings. Because of her dedication to helping low-income women,  she worked to ensure free birth control coverage was included in the  Affordable Care Act. Cecile is leaving as president when the teen  pregnancy rate is at a historical low and unintended pregnancies  overall are at a 30-year low. None of that would have been possible  without Cecile's relentless determination to her mission of helping  those that do not have the resources to help themselves.   The true measurement of Cecile's work at Planned Parenthood goes  beyond the statistics, however, for she understood that the  organization's strength comes from the voices of those who believe  access to healthcare for all women is a right. Those who up until  recently believed that there was nothing they could do or say that  would make a difference. Those who simply went on with their lives as  if they had no other options. It is those same people who have taken to  the streets--in Washington, in Vermont, and across the world--to let  their voices be heard. Cecile's unwavering passion and commitment to  advocating for these voices is one of her greatest strengths as a  leader.   While Planned Parenthood is stronger than ever, Cecile leaves a  legacy that will be hard to follow. Her ability to lead with grace and  courage has given hope to those who need it most. She has truly been  inspiration to us all.   Marcelle and I wish Cecile Richards all the best as she moves into  the next chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege to recognize  the achievements of a great Vermont broadcaster and friend, Ken Squier.   Ken recently became the first journalist ever to be enshrined in the  NASCAR Hall of Fame. While his roots are at WDEV Radio in Waterbury,  VT, Ken is known nationally as the country's most recognizable voice of  auto racing. Without question, Ken's voice and calls of the most  memorable auto races were key to the rise in prominence of the sport.   Still, with all of the national recognition, Ken has always made  Vermont his home. His radio station, WDEV, is strongly committed to  community service and serves the people of his hometown and the greater  Vermont community with distinction. Ken Squier is, without question, a  Vermont treasure.   In honor of Ken's induction into the NASCAR Hall of Fame and his  continued outstanding service to Vermont, I ask unanimous consent that  the article by Jasper Goodman, from the January 24, 2018 edition of the  Barre Montpelier Times Argus, ``Profile: Squier a living legend,'' be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Times Argus, Jan. 24, 2018]                      Profile: Squier a Living Legend                            (By Jasper Goodman)         ``Guys like Neil Bonnett and Tiny Lund and so many of those       guys who were so good--they all died doing what they wanted       to do, which is not the same as any other sport. If you are       dedicated to racing, it can cost you your life. I just felt       they needed to be represented far more than announcers or       promoters or sponsors''--Ken Squier.        Seldom is Ken Squier wrong in his prognostications about       the motorsports industry. But when he told me five years ago       that he would never be officially inducted into the NASCAR       Hall of Fame, I had my doubts.        Squier had just returned home from a trip to Charlotte,       North Carolina, where he and Barney Hall were presented with       the first annual Squier-Hall Award for NASCAR Media       Excellence, an honor for which they were co-namesakes. He       felt at the time that he had reached the pinnacle of his       career.        NASCAR had just unveiled an exhibit in its Hall of Fame       museum that featured audio from his famous broadcast of the       1979 Daytona 500. Each year since then, a media member has       been honored with an award named after him.        Last weekend, Ken Squier returned to the Hall of Fame in       Charlotte--this time to accept an even more prestigious       honor: being the first journalist ever inducted into the       NASCAR Hall of Fame itself.        ``Because the panel is made up of a majority of drivers and       media guys, there were two or three who said, 'You just have       to be there.' So there I went,'' Squier said.        Around Vermont, as the former owner of WDEV Radio and       Thunder Road, Squier has been a prominent public figure. But       at NASCAR events, fans worship the ground he walks on. Why?        It's simple: NASCAR wouldn't be the sport it is today       without him.        As auto racing rose in prominence during the 1960s and       early '70s, the sport began appearing on television. But it       was never given the treatment that baseball, basketball,       football or hockey got: live, start-to-finish coverage.        In 1979, Squier changed that.        At the direction of NASCAR co-founder Bill France Sr.,       Squier convinced skeptical CBS-TV executives to air flag-to-      flag coverage of the Daytona 500.        It was a smashing success--literally. The race ended in       thrilling fashion, with Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison       spinning out and getting in a fistfight on the infield. Ken       and color commentator David Hobbs vividly captured the       excitement and delivered a live broadcast to 15.1 million       viewers, many of whom were snowed into their homes after a       blizzard buried the Northeast.        That date--Feb. 18, 1979--was when racing went from being a       Southern fringe-sport to a nationwide phenomenon.        Squier served as the lap-by-lap commentator for the next 20       Daytona 500s. He famously nicknamed the event ``The Great       American Race.''        ``The beaches of Daytona, in Ormond--that's the history of       American motorsports,'' Squier said. ``They were racing there       over 100 years ago. . . . This wasn't just another race--this       was Daytona.''        Squier expresses hesitation about being in the same Hall of       Fame as the racing legends who he covered.        ``There was still that catch in my throat,'' he said.       ``Guys like Neil Bonnett and Tiny Lund and so many of those       guys who were so good--they all died doing what they wanted       to do, which is not the same as any other sport. If you are       dedicated to racing, it can cost you your life. I just felt       they needed to be represented far more than announcers or       promoters or sponsors.''        Squier's hesitation is unsurprising. Unlike many modern-day       broadcasters who enjoy directing the spotlight at themselves,       Squier has never been one to place himself at the center of       attention. Vermont Governor and three-time Thunder Road track       champion Phil Scott noted last Friday that in the first draft       of Squier's acceptance speech, there was ``not one single       mention of himself.''        ``He's been telling us the great American story his whole       life,'' Scott said in his introduction of Squier at the Hall       of Fame induction ceremony. ``But we never hear his story.''  [[Page S1159]]         The line about Squier not wanting to talk about himself was       repeated over and over again last weekend. And in a 90-minute       interview for this story, it proved to be largely true.       Squier managed to eloquently brush off questions about his       career accomplishments. Instead, he chronicled the history of       motorsports--as he so often does in conversation.        But make no mistake: The fact that Squier rarely speaks of       himself isn't a character flaw. It's what makes him the best       at what he does.        He is a storyteller--not of his own life, but of others'.       And without his innate ability to deliver those stories,       NASCAR would have never enjoyed the national prominence that       it does today.        Squier grew up in Waterbury and worked throughout his       adolescence at WDEV, which his father, Lloyd, founded in       1931.        ``I was lucky,'' Squier said. ``(WDEV) was always full of       kids--young, young guys. And Rusty (Parker) ran it fluidly.       It gave me an opportunity that a lot of people wouldn't have       had to go out and do something that I really desired, which       was the racing. It was big and it was growing and every year       it got bigger and bigger. But I could always come home.''        Even as he rose to national prominence, Squier always       called Vermont home.        ``I loved Verniont and everything it stood for,'' he said.        Squier once described NASCAR drivers as ``ordinary people       doing extraordinary things.''        The same can be said of Squier, an ordinary, down-to-earth       Vermonter who changed a sport in extraordinary ways.        Squier has given much of his life to NASCAR. Last weekend,       the sport gave back to him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Feinstein and  Cruz in cosponsoring a resolution recognizing the 59th anniversary of  the Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule--March 10, 2018 as ``Tibetan  Rights Day.''   Fifty-nine years ago, Tibetans took a stand, together, for the  freedom of their homeland. The people of the Tibetan capital, Lhasa,  fearing for the life of the Dalai Lama, surrounded his residence,  organized a guard, and called for the withdrawal of Chinese forces from  Tibet and the restoration of Tibet's freedom. Chinese statistics  estimate 87,000 Tibetans were killed, arrested, or deported to labor  camps during the suppression of the 1959 uprising, which also led to  the forced exile of the Dalai Lama and tens of thousands of other  Tibetans.   Today, 59 years later, the Government of the People's Republic of  China remains engaged in the severe repression of Tibet's unique  religious, cultural, and linguistic heritage, and is engaged in gross  violations of human rights in Tibet, including extrajudicial  detentions, disappearances, and torture. At least 152 Tibetans in Tibet  are known to have self-immolated in protest in the past decade. Yet the  Tibetan people have not given up their struggle for fundamental human  rights and freedoms. We stand by the Tibetan people, who have long been  our unwavering friends.   We also stand by the rights of Tibetan Buddhists, not just in Tibet  but around the world, who should be able to determine their own  religious leadership in accordance with their inalienable right to  religious freedom. According to the U.S. Commission on International  Religious Freedom, the Chinese government claims the power to  [[Page S1168]]  select the next Dalai Lama with the help of a law that grants the  government authority over reincarnations. That is absurd. The  identification and installation of Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders,  including a future 15th Dalai Lama, is a matter that should be  determined solely within the Tibetan Buddhist faith community.   We can foster closer, cooperative relations with China, but until  China works with Tibetan leaders to pursue a new way forward, their  reputation in the community of nations, and their ability to act as a  global power, will remain deeply tarnished. I urge other Senators to  join in support of this resolution, and to pass it before the important  anniversary commemoration on March 10, 2018.                            ____________________
