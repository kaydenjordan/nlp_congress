 Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, just two quick points. First, this is not  really about prisoners. This is about disrupting payments to families  all across the country who need the money to make rent and pay for  groceries.   Here is why. The IRS administers the tax system for millions and  millions of Americans. The Cruz amendment has the practical effect of  keeping these folks who are hurting from getting that check that they  are going to use to pay for essentials. That is because their check  would be on hold while the IRS sets up the system envisioned by this  amendment.   Now, I guess that is what my colleague from Texas wants. After all,  he opposed the bill. He opposed these payments from the get-go. So if  he passes this amendment, he gets what he wants, but for all those  folks who are hurting, their checks are on hold.   The last point I want to make is that it wasn't always this way for  Republicans and our colleague from Texas. Republicans were for these  payments before they were against them. They voted for two rounds of  relief checks going out to all the people who are being discussed here  when they controlled the White House and the Senate.   Senator Cruz voted for the CARES Act. It passed unanimously. There  were 44 Republicans for the December relief bill, with no exception  like the Senator from Texas wants.   Donald Trump was so happy with the checks going to prisoners that he  put his name on them. The only difference between the CARES Act relief  checks that Republicans unanimously supported and America Rescue Plan  relief checks is the party in the White House.   Mr. President, I object.    Reserving the right to object.    Thank you very much.   Mr. President, there isn't information about this crime or these  crimes at the Federal, State, and local levels. So, again, we are back  in exactly the same place.   The Senator from Texas wants to hold up the checks to millions and  millions of people in spite of the fact that he voted--he voted  earlier--for a system that got the checks to everybody in a timely way.  And when you don't have the information about the specific crimes at  the Federal, State, and local levels, it becomes impossible to carry  out what the Senator from Texas seeks to do. And the net effect is,  again, that millions and millions of Americans aren't getting the funds  that they need to pay for essentials, rent and groceries.   I object.    Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I want to read, specifically, what the IRS  has told us, because I gather my colleague would like to just continue  this for some time. But here is what the IRS says:         In the information the IRS receives from the Bureau of       Prisons and State prison systems, we do not get the crime for       which the person is incarcerated.    So we can have a host more of these amendments, if my colleague wants  to do it. But I get why he is so anxious to have his amendment passed-- because he was always for keeping people from getting checks, and his  amendment, if passed, would put those checks on hold. So that is why I  have objected, and we will put this into the record as well.   I object.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.    Mr. President, once again, our colleague from Texas is  offering an idea that would disrupt the system in a way that would keep  millions and millions of Americans who are hurting from getting help in  a timely way. He has come back with, essentially, one version after  another because he thinks that, somehow, this is the kind of  sensational idea that will cause people to rally to his side.   I believe what he has been proposing--now, I gather, four times--is  so disruptive, so unworkable that it is going to hurt the millions of  people whom this Congress wanted to help, and that is what the Senator  from Texas has sought to do from the very beginning. I object.    Here is what we are for. We are for making sure that needy  people get help to pay for groceries and make rent rather than have one  of our colleagues come out with something that is unworkable and  disruptive and is going to keep those people from getting help. That is  what this debate is all about, something that is unworkable.   I read the direct comment from the IRS with respect to not having the  information or getting help to people who are hurting.   I yield the floor.
