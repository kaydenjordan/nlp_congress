 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 260 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 260         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1) to lower energy costs by increasing       American energy production, exports, infrastructure, and       critical minerals processing, by promoting transparency,       accountability, permitting, and production of American       resources, and by improving water quality certification and       energy projects, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed seven hours, with       three hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce or their respective designees, three hours equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Natural Resources or their       respective designees, and one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure or their       respective designees. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. The       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution shall be considered as       adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole. The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived.       No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in       order except those printed in part B of the report of the       Committee on Rules. Each such further amendment may be       offered only in the order printed in the report, may be       offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified       in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall       not be subject to a demand for division of the question in       the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of       order against such further amendments are waived. At the       conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill, as amended, to the       House with such further amendments as may have been adopted.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my good friend and the ranking member on the Rules  Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.   During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee met  and reported out a rule, House Resolution 260, providing for  consideration of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1 under a structured  rule. It provides 7 hours of general debate, with 3 hours equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce or their designees. Additionally, the  rule provides for 3 hours equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources or  their designees, and 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure or their designees.   Further, this rule makes in order 37 amendments and provides 1 motion  to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying legislation. H.R. 1 unleashes American energy, and it  immediately will lower costs for families by resuming lease sales on  Federal lands and waters. It will repeal fee increases on energy  production, and it will end the moratorium on coal leasing.   Additionally, H.R. 1 strengthens America's critical mineral supply,  prohibits a moratorium on hydraulic fracking, and streamlines the  permitting process.   Let's remember, on day number one of his Presidency, President Biden  launched a war on American energy. He canceled the Keystone XL  pipeline, also, by the way, killing tens of thousands of union jobs,  and he paused new and oil gas leases on Federal lands. That was day  number one.   Under President Trump, we had independence with U.S. energy, but,  now, President Biden has drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the  lowest level since 1983. That is the lowest level since I have been  alive.   Meanwhile, the administration is increasing regulations on domestic  energy production by easing regulations and incentivizing energy  production in foreign, communist, and authoritarian states like  Venezuela.                                time  1215    In the words of President Biden, climate change is the existential  threat to humanity. Apparently, that only applies when the U.S. is the  one producing the oil and gas, not when nations like Venezuela produce  the natural gas.   President Trump, by contrast, opened 100 million acres of public land  and water to exploration. But Biden has leased fewer acres of Federal  land for oil and gas drilling than any President since the end of World  War II. The results have directly impacted all Americans.   On the day Joe Biden took office, the average price for a gallon of  gasoline was $2.39. Today, the national average is $3.47. That is a 44  percent increase. And let's not forget June's highest rate of $5 a  gallon.   Due to inflation, the average American family is now paying $10,000  more in household costs under President Biden.   By leaving our resources in the ground and turning to places like  Russia, Iran, and Venezuela for help, Democrats are choosing to  increase energy costs and risk the national security of American  families.   Why? All to appease far-left, radical activists, since they, the  Democrats, lack the moral clarity to do what is right for our citizens.   However, instead of focusing on lower energy costs, this  administration thinks the most pressing energy issue is--wait for it-- banning our gas stoves. That is their priority. Don't take my word for  it. While the administration is now gaslighting the American people,  [[Page H1475]]  saying they don't stand for this, in places like New York, they have  already taken the lead by announcing just yesterday they will ban gas  stoves in new buildings.   Americans shouldn't have to choose between driving to work, paying  their electric bills, or putting food on the table. We have to lower  energy costs for Americans. We have to do it now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just in rebuttal, my friend and Chairman Bruce Westerman put it best.  He said when the Democrats talk about polluters over people, what they  are actually referring to is not this bill. It is actually a reference  to where we are now, thanks to Democratic reckless and radical  policies.   Right now, China is actually the largest emitter of CO2.  Russian gas is much dirtier than gas from other places around the  world, especially the United States where we have cheap, reliable, and  clean natural gas. But instead of taking advantage of our God-given  resources, Democrats and their reckless, radical policies make us more  dependent on these forms of energy that are much dirtier.   My good friend from Massachusetts said this bill will drag us back  decades. Well, I do want this bill to take us back, not decades, but  just to a few years ago when we had a Republican in the White House.  Let us not forget that the United States, again, we currently lead the  world in CO2 emission reduction, but between 2018 and 2019,  the total reported greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities fell  nearly 5 percent. Yeah, let's go back. Let's go back to that time.   I find the talk about costs somewhat interesting because only in  Washington, D.C., only in a place that lacks logic and accountability  like Washington, D.C., can future revenue be considered a cost. Think  about that. It is considered a cost. The math does not make sense.   It is also quite fascinating that my friends across the aisle are now  talking about deficits, which in the last 4 years they voted for over  $4 trillion of increases to spending.   Before I yield to my good friend from Texas, Dr. Burgess, I will  point out a real-life example of what happens when we follow far-left,  Democratic environmental policies.   Often I wish that we had a real-life example that we could talk about  in terms of policy, and here we do. It is called Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka,  trying to search for a great ESG score to--I don't know, appease  globalists, appease the ruling elite, appease woke Wall Street  investors--they went for this ESG score and right now they are almost a  failed state. Sri Lanka's green new deal, to be clear, was a human  disaster. It is an ill-advised national experiment.   Let me explain it. They went to organic farming. Organic farming  yielded nothing but starvation, poverty, and chaos. President  Rajapaksa, with no warning, with no attempt to teach farmers how to  cope with change, announced a ban on all synthetic fertilizers and  pesticides. Again, he was after that ESG score.   Ninety percent of Sri Lankan farmers relied on synthetic fertilizers.  After the ban, 85 percent of farmers experienced crop loss. The damage  done by this organic order was so extensive that the former President  had to reverse himself less than 7 months later.   Now, let's just bring this to political reality, the goals of the  United States,  [[Page H1476]]  where only 20 percent of electricity is powered by renewable energy, 20  percent renewable, and less than 10 percent of American families own an  electric vehicle. By the way, those that own electric vehicles are  overwhelmingly people who make over six figures a year. It is not your  average Americans who are driving around in Teslas. Yet, the left seeks  to unilaterally ban all hydrocarbons and instill these pipe dreams that  the U.S. will generate all of its energy through wind and solar.   All you have to do is look at California to see what comes next. Last  August, Governor Newsom announced that they will ban the sale of  gasoline cars by 2035. Just 1 week later, after that announcement, the  electric grid was overwhelmed in California, and the State had to ask  EV owners to limit when they plugged in their vehicles to charge.   So if you ask yourself: Where does the policy of the left lead us?  Look no further than to the idiocy of the policy in California and look  no further than to the almost failed state of Sri Lanka. That is where  these reckless, radical policies will lead the U.S. economy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), the good doctor, my good friend, and fellow Rules Committee  member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we want to help senior citizens and if we want to  help the working class, we can make sure that the working class and  seniors on a fixed income can actually pay their heating bills.    According to Ipsos polling, one in three Americans have reported  trouble affording gas in Biden's energy crisis. Almost 35 percent of  Americans, over 40 million, use a gas stove. The Democrats want to ban  the gas stove.   Let's talk about the economic pain that is coming to all Americans.  Electricity prices are expected to rise over 11 percent this winter.  Natural gas prices are expected to rise as much as 25 percent since  last winter. About 47 percent of households use natural gas to heat  their homes, by the way.   Heating home oil prices are expected to rise as much as 45 percent  since last winter. Over 80 percent of homes in the northeast use  heating oil. Regions that heavily depend on home heating oil, such as,  may I dare say, Massachusetts, they will pay an average bill of $2,354  extra due to the draconian measures on energy, the reckless and radical  policies of the left on energy production.   If we want to actually help these individuals, like Republicans want  to do, we can pass H.R. 1. I also want to focus on the comment: Who do  we trust? We heard that refrain over and over from my good friend from  Massachusetts. I can tell you who we shouldn't trust. We shouldn't  trust the so-called experts that the Democrats are infatuated with.   Let's talk about some of the statements we have heard, some of the  predictions from these so-called experts. Al Gore in 2006 said: ``If  you look at the 10 hottest years ever measured . . . they have all  occurred in the last 14 years. The hottest of all was in 2005.''   ``Within the decade there will be no more snows of Kilimanjaro.''   He said that in 2006. Last time I checked, it was 2023 and we still  had snow on Mt. Kilimanjaro.   Al Gore also said:         The North Pole will be ice-free in the summer by 2013       because of manmade global warming.    That was 2013. It is 2023. Another prediction that has not come true.   John Kerry, the climate czar, in 2009 said:         You have sea ice, which is melting at a rate that the       Arctic Ocean is now increasingly exposed to. In 5 years,       scientists predict we will have the first ice-free Arctic       summer. . . .    That was 2009. It is 2023. Last time I checked, there was still ice  in the Arctic.   Let's talk about Barack Obama and his predictions. In 2015, he said:         No challenge poses a greater threat to the future       generations than climate change.    When he left office, let's not forget that this man bought beachfront  property in Martha's Vineyard, while having the audacity to tell us  that we are facing rising sea levels due to climate change. Again, he  bought a beachside mansion in Martha's Vineyard, so spare me.   In talking about the greatest threat, notice there was no mention of  the CCP, notice there was no mention of Russia, which in debate with  Republicans--when Republicans were pointing to the threat posed by  Russia, Barack Obama said the 1980s want their foreign policy back.   Let's talk about another so-called expert that the left loves to talk  about, Greta Thunberg. In 2018, she tweeted: ``A top climate scientist  is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we  stop using fossil fuels over the next 5 years.''   Conveniently, Greta Thunberg deleted that tweet this month. Why?  Because that was said in 2018. It is now 2023, 5 years later, and  humanity is still around.   It is easy to say that the experts have just been wrong in the last  few years, since the early 2000s. The so-called experts have been wrong  on this topic since the 1960s.   In 1969, The New York Times published a piece from Paul Ehrlich, and  he said--the so-called expert, by the way: ``We must realize that  unless we are extremely lucky, everybody will disappear in a cloud of  blue steam in 20 years.'' Again, that was 1969. That didn't happen.  Yet, in 2023, Paul Ehrlich--I think he is 90 years old--this man is  still being published and still being held up as an expert on climate  change, and appearing on 60 Minutes telling us that we are all going to  die. Spare me.   I have got more quotes. I could go on, but it is very clear who you  should trust. The Republicans are the party of science. The Democrats  are the party of political science. The Republicans are the party of  chemistry. The Democrats are the party of alchemy. We are the party of  astronomy. They are the party of astrology. The science is with us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy),  my good friend and fellow Rules Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, spare me the gaslighting on gas  stoves. We know that, just yesterday, New York banned all gas stoves in  new buildings. We are talking about New York.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Langworthy), who is my good friend on the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, spare me the pearl-clutching about  this amendment process. Let me remind my friends across the aisle that  last Congress, their H.R. 1 was a closed rule. Zero amendments from  either side were allowed.   We have Democrat and Republican amendments on this bill, so, again,  spare me. Also, spare me that we don't want to debate this. Spare me  that we don't want to have this debated and other viewpoints heard.   White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy recently called for Big  Tech censorship of Americans who dared to speak out against the Biden  administration's radical, far-left Green New Deal agenda. I think it is  very clear who wants censorship. I think it is very clear who is afraid  of ideas that don't fit their narrative. It is the Democratic Party.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Alford), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I admit I misspoke, it wasn't H.R. 1  in the 117th. It was--wait for it--H.R. 5, the Equality Act; H.R. 6,  the American Dream and Promise Act; and H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act. Three of the low-numbered bills that my  friends across the aisle ran last Congress, their so-called priority  bills, were run with closed rules. Just to be clear on that, it wasn't  H.R. 1, but it was the three other ones that they ran as a priority.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time  until closing.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time  until my closing.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   Mr. Speaker, my friend across the aisle wants to say follow the money  so we can see where people's priorities are.   Let's just follow the Strategic Petroleum Reserve release. President  Biden shipped 5 million barrels of this emergency fuel overseas to  countries, including China. If you want to see where the priorities  lie, don't follow the money, follow where the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve is going, and that is going to China.   Also, quotes on climate change, I will provide my friend across the  aisle with all my quotes regarding climate change. I have got pages and  pages of them. What you might find very interesting are all the ones  from the 1980s where the so-called experts were calling for the next  ice age, so I would direct you to that just for the fun of it.   It is interesting to see how wrong these so-called experts are and  somewhat ironic that we are still being told that the experts are right  after literally decades of getting almost everything wrong.   The U.S. produces more oil and natural gas than any other country in  the world. As a global energy power, we can provide lower energy  prices, we can create steady jobs, and we can secure America and our  allies with cheaper gas that is cleaner.   Just imagine if the U.S. were supplying LNG from the great  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to our allies in Europe. Think about that  instead of our allies in Europe being dependent on Russian gas, which  is 41 percent dirtier.   However, the left's goal is to eliminate fossil fuels. They want to  make the United States dependent, unstable, poorer, needier, and weaker  because they refuse to allow us to exploit our natural resources.   If you want to think about what lies ahead in the future if we allow  the Democrats to get their energy plan in place, just look at Sri  Lanka. I have already talked about it. Sri Lanka has a great ESG score.  They also have an almost-failed state.   Don't think that this is just some misguided plan or misguided  misinformation from the Democrats. This is their plan. They want to  make hydrocarbons more expensive because their base, the liberal elites  that sit at home on Zoom all day, they don't have to put gas in their  tank, they work from home. It is the guys who are working, who shower  after work that have to put gas in their trucks and cars. That is why  it is necessary to pass H.R. 1.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous question and  ``yes'' on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 260         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
