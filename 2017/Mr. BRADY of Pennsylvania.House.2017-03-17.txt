 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution before us.   The credit for this bipartisan legislation goes to my colleague and  friend, the gentleman from Mississippi. I want to thank Chairman Harper  for his bipartisan cooperation in developing this agreeable  legislation. All committees should follow our lead.   I also want to thank our staffs, the Democratic and the Republican  sides, for putting together the bill that we have on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation we are considering now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
