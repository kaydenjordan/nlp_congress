 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6146) to authorize, direct, expedite, and facilitate a land  exchange in Yavapai County, Arizona, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6146         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 5. WITHDRAWAL PROVISIONS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Like many of my colleagues from Western States, I represent rural  counties that are growing quickly but are hitting roadblocks due to the  large amount of Federal land in them. Yavapai County in my district is  no different.   My bill, the Cottonwood Land Exchange Act, is a commonsense land  exchange between the Forest Service and Yavapai County that would allow  the county to expand a park by adding new trails and bridges for the  residents of Cottonwood to enjoy.   In exchange for 80 acres in the Coconino National Forest, the county  has offered to the Forest Service nearly 370 acres of land adjacent to  the forest. This land is habitat for the endangered Arizona cliffrose,  and the exchange will allow for better protection and conservation of  the rose and other sensitive species.   H.R. 6146 is truly a win-win for both the residents of Yavapai County  and the Federal Government at no cost to the taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the  Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 2615) to authorize the exchange of  certain land located in Gulf Islands National Seashore, Jackson County,  Mississippi, between the National Park Service and the Veterans of  Foreign Wars, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:        Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gulf Islands National       Seashore Land Exchange Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

(b) Equal Value Exchange.--        (1) In general.--The values of the Federal land and non-      Federal land to be exchanged under this section shall be       equal, as determined by an appraisal conducted--        (A) by a qualified and independent appraiser; and        (B) in accordance with nationally recognized appraisal       standards.

(d) Description of Federal Land and Non-Federal Land.--The       exact acreage and legal description of the Federal land and       non-Federal land to be exchanged under this section shall be       determined by surveys that are determined to be satisfactory       by the Secretary and the Post.        (e) Conveyance Agreement.--The exchange of Federal land and       non-Federal land under this section shall be--        (1) carried out through a quitclaim deed or other legal       instrument; and        (2) subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually       satisfactory to the Secretary and the Post, including such       additional terms and conditions as the Secretary considers to       be appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2615, introduced by Congressman  Steven Palazzo of  Mississippi, authorizes the National Park Service to convey to the  Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5699 1.54 acres located within the Gulf  Islands National Seashore in Jackson County, Mississippi, in exchange  for a 2.16-acre parcel of land owned by the VFW Post.   This bill benefits both the VFW Post and the Park Service. It  provides the VFW Post with permanent access to their building via a  long driveway currently owned by the Park Service, while also adding  land to the Gulf Islands National Seashore.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5706) to establish the Pearl Harbor National Memorial in the  State of Hawai'i and the Honouliuli National Historic Site in the State  of Hawai'i, and for other purposes.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``World War II Pacific Sites       Establishment Act''.       SEC. 2. PEARL HARBOR NATIONAL MEMORIAL, HAWAI'I.

(b) Pearl Harbor National Memorial.--        (1) Establishment.--        (A) In general.--There is established the Pearl Harbor       National Memorial in the State of Hawai'i as a unit of the       National Park System.

(c) Administration.--The Secretary shall administer the       National Memorial in accordance with this section, section       121 of Public Law 111-88, and the laws generally applicable       to units of the National Park System including--        (1) section 100101(a), chapter 1003, and sections       100751(a), 100752, 100753, and 102101 of title 54, United       States Code; and        (2) chapter 3201 of title 54, United States Code.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5706 will bring increased recognition to two  important World War II sites in Hawaii. The attack on Pearl Harbor on  December 7, 1941, will never be forgotten. Over 2,300 sailors,  soldiers, and civilians lost their lives that fateful day the United  States entered World War II. Five sites in Hawaii have been designated  memorials, including the USS Arizona, the USS Oklahoma, and the USS  Utah. Receiving over 1 million visitors each year, these serve as  places of reflection and remembrance as well as tombs of honor for the  crew members who remain there.   The creation of the sweeping World War II Valor in the Pacific  National Monument in 2008 incorporated the five Hawaii sites, along  with three locations in Alaska and one in California. H.R. 5706 would  establish the areas in Hawaii as the Pearl Harbor National Memorial as  a distinct unit of the National Park System, giving it the full  recognition this hallowed site deserves. This new designation will not  affect the existing management of the area in any way.   H.R. 5706 would also redesignate Honouliuli National Monument as a  National Historic Site. This site was the largest and longest used  World War II confinement facility in the Hawaiian Islands. By war's  end, over 2,000 people of Japanese ancestry were interned there--the  majority of which were American citizens. The boundaries and management  of the site will not change with the enactment of H.R. 5706.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6666) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to grant to  States and local governments easements and rights-of-way over Federal  land within Gateway National Recreation Area for construction,  operation, and maintenance of projects for control and prevention of  flooding and shoreline erosion.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6666         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO GRANT EASEMENTS AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY                     OVER FEDERAL LANDS WITHIN GATEWAY NATIONAL                     RECREATION AREA.         Section 3 of Public Law 92-592 (16 U.S.C. 460cc-2) is       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(j) Authority To Grant Easements and Rights-of-Way.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of the Interior may grant,       to any State or local government, an easement or right-of-way       over Federal lands within Gateway National Recreation Area       for construction, operation, and maintenance of projects for       control and prevention of flooding and shoreline erosion.        ``(2) Charges and reimbursement of costs.--The Secretary       may grant such an easement or right-of-way without charge for       the value of the right so conveyed, except for reimbursement       of costs incurred by the United States for processing the       application therefore and managing such right. Amounts       received as such reimbursement shall be credited to the       relevant appropriation account.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6666, introduced by Congressman  Daniel Donovan, is  an essential piece of legislation that will protect human life and  property in coastal New York from devastating hurricanes and storm  surges.   Hurricane Sandy was one of the deadliest and most destructive  hurricanes in our country's history, tragically killing 162 people and  causing $70 billion in damage. Staten Island, New York, was especially  hard hit. H.R. 6666 seeks to ensure this type of devastation does not  happen again.   This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue an  easement across the Gateway National Recreation Area for the  construction of a seawall to protect coastal residents and  infrastructure. The plan for this seawall was developed by the Army  Corps of Engineers in conjunction with the State of New York as part of  a coastal storm risk management plan.   The National Park Service, which operates the recreation area,  supports this necessary project.   I thank Congressman Donovan for his good work on the bill, and I urge  its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Donovan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
