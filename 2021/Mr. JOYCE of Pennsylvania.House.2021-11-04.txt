 Mr. Speaker, right now, as our country  continues to suffer from the negative effects of the Democrats'  previous reckless spending spree, it is clear that we do not yet need  another reckless spending bill that would further balloon our debt and  raise all inflation without actually addressing the issues that we are  currently facing.   Congress has already appropriated trillions of dollars that has not  yet been spent. Again, trillions of dollars remain unspent. Instead of  passing yet another trillion-dollar spending bill, of which only 10  percent would actually go to true infrastructure, we can repurpose  those earlier funds to meet the needs of our communities.   I am proud to be joining my colleagues as a cosponsor of legislation  that would use the money that Congress has already approved to truly  help the communities that we serve; legislation that has already been  passed by our colleagues in the Senate.   Now is not the time to waste money on taxpayer-funded kickbacks to  green energy companies or spend $50 million to monitor coastal erosion.  We need to fund infrastructure improvements that our communities need.  We need to do so without mortgaging our children's future.   We were elected to be responsible stewards of the taxpayers' dollars,  and passing the Green New Deal dressed up as infrastructure is not the  way forward.                            ____________________
