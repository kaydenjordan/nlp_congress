 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend  the rule to make in order the Quigley amendment to restore funds to  prevent Russian interference in our elections.    Mr. Speaker, today we speak about the most  egregious acts from this administration, one after another after  another, but I will not forget about our children.   I rise today to tell my fellow Members of Congress that I am appalled  over reports of the mistreatment and abuse towards children at the  Shiloh Residential Treatment Center.   The facility is under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services and located just south of Houston, Texas. The Shiloh  facility is owned and operated by the same entity that formerly  operated Daystar Treatment Center in Manvel, Texas.  [[Page H6484]]    You may remember this place. Daystar was closed because of the way in  which they physically restrained children that led to the death of  three teenagers. In most cases, children were hog-tied.   Now, instead of being hog-tied, they are drugging children into  submission. One child was prescribed ten different shots and pills,  including the antipsychotic drug Latuda, Geodon, and olanzapine. We are  giving them Parkinson's medications, we are giving them pain  medications, antidepressants, and cognizant enhancers. This is a  disgrace.   Federal District Judge Laughrey recently explained: ``Psychotropic  drugs are powerful medications that directly affect the central nervous  system. They are particularly potent when administered to children. . .  . They are more vulnerable to psychosis, seizures, irreversible  movement disorders, suicidal thoughts, and aggression. . . . ''   This is a disgrace and this is un-American and it must stop now.
