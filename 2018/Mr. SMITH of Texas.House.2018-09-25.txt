 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5509) to direct the National Science Foundation to  provide grants for research about STEM education approaches and the  STEM-related workforce, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5509         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Innovations in Mentoring,       Training, and Apprenticeships Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) To remain competitive in the global economy, foster       greater innovation, and provide a foundation for shared       prosperity, the United States needs a workforce with the       right mix of skills to meet the diverse needs of the economy.        (2) Evidence indicates that the returns on investments in       technical skills in the labor market are strong when students       successfully complete their education and gain credentials       sought by employers.        (3) The responsibility for developing and sustaining a       skilled technical workforce is fragmented across many groups,       including educators, students, workers, employers, Federal,       State, and local governments, civic associations, and other       stakeholders. Such groups need to be able to coordinate and       cooperate successfully with each other.        (4) Coordination among students, community colleges,       secondary and post-secondary institutions, and employers       would improve educational outcomes.        (5) Promising experiments currently underway may guide       innovation and reform, but scalability of some of those       experiments has not yet been tested.        (6) Evidence suggests that integration of academic       education, technical skills development, and hands-on work       experience improves outcomes and return on investment for       students in secondary and post-secondary education and for       skilled technical workers in different career stages.        (7) Outcomes show that mentoring can increase STEM student       engagement and the rate of completion of STEM post-secondary       degrees.       SEC. 3.

(2) Community college.--The term ``community college'' has       the meaning given the term ``junior and community college''       in section 312 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       1058).        (3) Region.--The term ``region'' means a labor market area,       as such term is defined in section 3 of the Workforce       Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102).        (4) Skilled technical workforce.--The term ``skilled       technical workforce'' means workers with high school diplomas       and two-year technical training or certifications who employ       significant levels of STEM knowledge in their jobs.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5509, the bill now  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5509, the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and  Apprenticeships Act, was introduced by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy  and cosponsored by a number of Science, Space, and Technology Committee  members and approved by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.   H.R. 5509 continues the bipartisan progress the Science Committee has  made to expand and improve science, technology, engineering,  mathematics, and computer science education programs to create new  pathways to STEM careers.   We can't overstate the value of a strong STEM workforce in America.  STEM workers drive innovation, manufacturing, scientific discovery, and  productivity across the economy. According to the National Science  Board's most recent ``Science and Engineering Indicators'' report, the  number of U.S. jobs that require STEM skills has grown by a third over  the past decade.   STEM workforce demand is forecast to increase steadily for years to  come. Unfortunately, we know that nearly 40 percent of students who  embark on a STEM major do not complete it, and only half of STEM  graduates are employed in STEM jobs. We also know that apprenticeship  and mentoring initiatives can improve the rate of STEM degree  completion at both 4-year universities and community colleges.   America's competitiveness in STEM fields requires a diverse and  flexible workforce comprised of workers with educational backgrounds  ranging from certificate-level technical occupations to Ph.D.s. To this  end, H.R. 5509 directs the National Science Foundation to fund  initiatives that support innovative partnerships between academic  institutions and local industries.   The NSF will offer at least $5 million per year over the next 4 years  in grants to community colleges to develop new STEM courses and  degrees. These programs will combine formal education with on-the-job  work experiences, such as apprenticeships and internships, by  partnering with local employers.   Additionally, the pending legislation directs NSF to offer at least  another $2.5 million per year for the next 4 years to 4-year  universities to partner with local industry and offer apprenticeships  and other applied learning experiences for STEM undergraduate students.   The bill also requires the National Science Foundation to award $2.5  million per year over the next 4 years for research grants to measure  student outcomes and the effectiveness of computer-based and online  courses for technical skills training.   Leader McCarthy's legislation further directs the NSF to research the  difference between skilled technical workforce development in the  United States and in other developed countries.   Lastly, H.R. 5509 requires the National Science Foundation to conduct  research on labor market analysis innovations and America's skilled  technical workforce in order to improve our understanding of this  workforce's trends and needs.   The innovative initiatives in this legislation will leverage the hard  work and ingenuity of women and men of all ages, education levels, and  backgrounds to meet the demand for a STEM-capable workforce.   Much like the action the Trump administration has already taken to  expand apprenticeships to help meet today's rapidly changing economy,  the Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act takes  significant steps to invest in new STEM education and workforce  development programs. Such investments will ensure the United States  remains competitive in the global economy both today and tomorrow.  [[Page H8864]]    The majority leader's bill will enhance America's STEM  competitiveness and contribute to our future economic prosperity, so  there are many good reasons to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), who is an active member of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee and a member of both the Research and  Technology and Environment Subcommittees.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), who is a member of the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee and is the chairwoman of the Research and  Technology Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, just briefly, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Lipinski) for working with us so well on so many bills for almost 2  years. I think he has been as active on the legislation as any other  member of the committee, and as he pointed out or suggested, most of  the bills that we passed under the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee's jurisdiction are, in fact, bipartisan bills; and he has, as  often as not, been an important player in the passage of those pieces  of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, there are no other requests for time, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), the chairwoman of the Research and Technology  Subcommittee, for yielding me time to speak on her legislation.   The bill, H.R. 6229, the National Institute of Standards and  Technology Reauthorization Act of 2018, is an important bill that has  been worked on both by Chairwoman Comstock and the gentleman from  Illinois, Subcommittee Ranking Member Dan Lipinski, and I appreciate  their taking the initiative on this legislation.   This bipartisan bill was unanimously approved by the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee in June. It authorizes NIST's research and  technology programs for 2 years.   The NIST Reauthorization Act ensures that the research and  development conducted by NIST keeps the United States on the cutting  edge of global technological capabilities.   NIST is one of the Nation's oldest physical science laboratories. The  technology, standards, and measurements provided by NIST support U.S.  competitiveness in key industries, including manufacturing,  nanomaterials,  [[Page H8868]]  computing, communications, and cybersecurity.   These have real-world applications. Through basic research, NIST sets  standards and facilitates the implementation and use of technologies  that impact the lives of our constituents every day. Examples include  providing the precise official time for the United States that we see  on our computers and smartphones, to the thresholds for the smoke  detectors that protect our families and homes.   For instance, NIST research and standards have improved the self- contained breathing apparatuses worn by more than a million American  firefighters.   NIST also provides modeling techniques that allow scientists to  develop and test cancer therapies using active viruses that cannot be  studied using standard practices. And NIST's Smart Grid work is  improving the reliability and capability of our electric grid.   These are just a handful of examples that illustrate why NIST's  scientific and technical research and services are critical to American  innovation and industrial competitiveness.   Chairwoman Comstock's bill significantly increases NIST's research to  facilitate commercial use of emerging technologies. Specifically, this  legislation increases the core NIST laboratories account by $125  million to transform more basic and early stage research into usable  innovations and new technologies.   It accelerates basic quantum information science research and  standards development, and provides funds to address fundamental  research gaps, enabling the U.S. to take the lead in developing quantum  standards and measurements.   Chairwoman Comstock's bill allows NIST to expand its fundamental and  applied cybersecurity research to address key questions relating to  privacy, security, and vulnerability of software tools and  communications networks.    It expands the research infrastructure and scientific staff needed to  develop the Institute's capabilities in artificial intelligence and  data science, including rigorous scientific testing to support the  development of trustworthy AI systems.   It further directs NIST to expand its composites research and  standards development to facilitate the adoption of composite  technology in American infrastructure.   Finally, the legislation encourages NIST to continue to examine the  Internet of Things and address measurement and security challenges  created by the convergence of digital technologies with the physical  world.   By supporting this bill, Congress ensures continued U.S. innovation  leadership in quantum science, artificial intelligence, big data  science, cybersecurity, the Internet of Things, and resilient  infrastructure.   We can thank Chairwoman Comstock for her work on this legislation. I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6229 and the critical work done by  NIST.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the  gentleman from South Carolina, Congressman Ralph Norman, for yielding  me this time to speak in support of his bill, H.R. 6398, the Department  of Energy Veterans' Health Initiative Act.   I also want to say, I appreciate his serving as vice chairman of the  Environment Subcommittee on the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.   This important legislation was approved unanimously by the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee and is cosponsored by 15 members of the  committee.   H.R. 6398 authorizes the Department of Energy to conduct  collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs to  address complex challenges in veterans' healthcare by using advanced  computational tools.   Currently, DOE and the VA collaborate through the MVP-CHAMPION  initiative. The VA collects genomic and healthcare data from veterans  who have volunteered for the program and then securely transfers it to  DOE, where it is stored and analyzed in a secure site at the Oak Ridge  National Laboratory.   This partnership and exchange of data benefits both DOE and the VA  and provides valuable services to our veterans.   DOE is the Nation's largest Federal supporter of basic research in  the physical sciences. It funds programs in applied mathematics and  computer and computational science.   Under this program, authorized by Mr. Norman's bill, VA researchers  gain access to DOE's high performance computing research facilities and  significant resources, including DOE's extensive expertise in data  analysis and complex modeling.   This could help the VA make discoveries about the causes and warning  signs of various diseases. It will also speed up care for veterans'  critical medical needs and help the VA develop more effective  treatments in the future.    By giving DOE access to such a large database of information, the VA  will help DOE researchers improve their ability to develop next- generation computing systems, algorithms, and models. These are  capabilities that are critical to maintaining U.S. science and  technology leadership.   H.R. 6398 also authorizes a 2-year research pilot program to advance  basic research in artificial intelligence, data analytics, and  computational science.   This pilot program supports DOE's efforts to improve the application  of advanced data analysis techniques to big data challenges.   Congressman Norman's DOE Veterans' Health Initiative Act promotes  improved healthcare for American servicemen and -women. It facilitates  more high-yielding DOE collaborations, maximizes resources, and gives  other Federal agencies, academia, and industry the opportunity to  benefit from the Energy Department's R&D expertise.   We can thank Representatives Ralph Norman and Neal Dunn for  championing collaboration and basic research to support our veterans  and American innovation.                                time  2215    I also want to thank Chairman Roe of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee for his help and cooperation in bringing this bill before the  House this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support this bill.
