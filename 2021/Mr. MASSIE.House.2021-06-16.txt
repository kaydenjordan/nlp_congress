 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to end  the war in Iraq. That is right, it is still going on. The 2002 AUMF  that authorized military force in the Iraq war is still active, but  today we will be voting on it, and it is long past due for us to vote  on it. The original text of the 2002 AUMF was disturbingly broad and  authorizes the United States military to enforce United Nations  Security Council resolutions.   We have wasted $750 million on the world's largest embassy in Iraq.  When we get out of Iraq, it is time to put a for sale sign on that  embassy. We may get only pennies on the dollar for that embassy, but  that is better than sacrificing lives. We don't want another Libya; we  don't want another Benghazi to happen in Iraq. It is time to scale down  the embassy, put what is there for sale, and bring our troops and our  diplomats home.   Saddam Hussein's regime was defeated in 2003. That is 18 years ago.  Obama declared the Iraq war ended in 2011. But the AUMF was never  repealed, and it gives a blank check to any current or subsequent  administration to keep American soldiers in Iraq indefinitely and puts  us at risk of getting into another war if things escalate.   By 2013, a majority of Americans believed that the Iraq war was a  mistake. Approximately 4,586 U.S. soldiers have died in Iraq, lost  their lives since the beginning of the war, and 32,000 have been  seriously wounded or injured in Iraq since the start of the war.   Although it is hard to know the estimated number of civilian  casualties during this period of time in Iraq, it is somewhere between  800,000 and 1.3 million civilians. Think about that. A million  civilians have died in this conflict.   It is time for us to leave. We owe it to our soldiers. They signed up  to protect our country. They didn't sign up to be the world's  policemen.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF  today.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I fully support creating a day to  celebrate the abolition of slavery, a dark portion of our Nation's  history. However, naming this day National Independence Day will create  confusion and push Americans to pick one of those 2 days as their  Independence Day based on their racial identity.   Why can't we name this Emancipation Day and come together as  Americans and celebrate that day together as Americans?   Black and White--all colors, all races, and all ethnicities--can then  come together on Independence Day, which celebrates the creation of our  country, throwing off an oppressive government, and come together as  Black, White, and all races to celebrate that day, too?   Why ask Americans to pick one of the two Independence Days to  celebrate? I think it is wrong to do that.   I think this day is misnamed. I do support creating a holiday and  recognizing that wonderful day and that wonderful time when we got rid  of slavery in this country. But let's celebrate both of those days:  Independence Day  [[Page H2869]]  and the day that we celebrate emancipation and ridding our country of  slavery. Let's celebrate those 2 days together as one Nation under God  indivisible.
