 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor consumed by great  sadness. Yesterday's attack, as we have all heard, was an attack on the  entire United States Congress.   It is even more tragic that this attack occurred during a practice  for one of the most bipartisan traditions in the Congress.   I stand here with my colleagues hoping for a speedy recovery for my  dear colleague, Representative Steve Scalise. My thoughts and prayers  are with him, but also for all of the others that were injured, for all  of their families, and for all of their loved ones.   It is clear we all know that, without Capitol Police on duty with  Representative Scalise, there would have been many more victims.   I want to express my deepest gratitude to those officers who put  their lives on the line, but I also want to pray for them and all those  who were injured. I ask and I hope for their speedy recovery.                            ____________________
