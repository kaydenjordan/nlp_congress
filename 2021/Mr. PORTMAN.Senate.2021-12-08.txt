 Madam President, I rise today to honor an exceptional  member of the U.S. Air Force. I am proud to enter this tribute into the  Record as I have had the pleasure of traveling with Chris to London and  Ukraine and saw firsthand his professionalism, leadership, and  dedication to duty.   Lt. Col. Christopher ``Chris'' Ryan has distinguished himself through  his professional character and dedication by serving this Nation in  uniform. A leader and expert communicator, he has provided  distinguished service to our country while assigned to the Air Force  Senate Liaison Office. He is an outstanding leader and the perfect  airman to represent the Air Force on Capitol Hill. Chris has served in  the Air Force for over 20 years in both the enlisted and officer ranks.  As an aircraft maintenance officer, Chris has led thousands of  maintainers in support of the AC-130H, C-17A, KC-135R, and C-5M  aircraft.   Throughout his career, Chris has demonstrated his exceptional  abilities; he was the 1997 Airman of the Year at Joint Base Andrews and  recipient of the John Levitow Award in 2000. Chris was both  distinguished graduate for the ROTC Detachment 330 at the University of  Maryland-College Park and at the Advanced Maintenance and Munitions  Operations School. Further, Chris was recognized as the 2019 Secretary  of the Air Force, Legislative Liaison Reserve Officer of the Year.  Prior to his current assignment, Chris had the privilege of being  selected as an Air Force Legislative Fellow where he was detailed to  the Congressional Research Service and then worked for my dear  colleague, the senior Senator from Oklahoma and then-chairman of the  Armed Services Committee in 2018.   As a legislative liaison in the Air Force Senate Liaison Office from  December 2018 to December 2021, Lieutenant Colonel Ryan performed his  duties well and without reservation supporting the 115th, 116th, and  117th U.S. Congresses. His strategic thinking and foresight helped to  strengthen and improve our national security. Chris accomplished this  utilizing his in-depth  [[Page S9043]]  Air Force knowledge with numerous engagements between Congress and the  Department of the Air Force.   Chris expertly conveyed Department of the Air Force positions on the  Air Force Future Design that included the future bomber, tanker, and  fighter force. Chris' direct support provided the U.S. Senate critical  information necessary for three National Defense Authorization Acts.  His efforts helped establish the U.S. Space Force, ensure the  confirmation of the 25th and 26th Air Force Secretaries, the 22nd Air  Force Chief of Staff, and ensured the Department of the Air Force  support of the National Defense Strategy in our return to Great Power  Competition.   Lieutenant Colonel Ryan planned and led delegations for Members of  Congress on visits all over the world to include the bicameral  Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Reagan  National Defense Forum. In fact, Chris escorted me to the United  Kingdom and Ukraine in 2019. Chris' significant efforts led to  successful engagements between this governing body and senior  Department of Defense Officials, including the Secretary of the Air  Force. All of these engagements helped U.S. Senators understand defense  equities and their impact on national security. Due to his direct  involvement and stewardship, Members of Congress were able to make  informed decisions and ensure the Department of the Air Force was  properly resourced and funded.   After serving in this vital role for the past 3 years and becoming a  fixture on Capitol Hill, Lieutenant Colonel Ryan will move to his next  assignment, as deputy group commander, 514th Maintenance Group, located  at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. Chris, his wife Rachel--the chief  of staff for the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance  at the Department of State--and their children Joshua, Kathrine, and  Emma have sacrificed much as a family in service to our Nation. I am  thankful for Chris' service and his work with my office and the Senate  over the past 3 years on issues important to this great Nation. I  salute this American patriot whose selfless service has kept our  country safe and strong.                            ____________________
