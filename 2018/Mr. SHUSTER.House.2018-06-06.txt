 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 8.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to bring to the floor today the Water  Resources Development Act of 2018. This marks the third Congress in a  row that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee of the House  will consider a water resources bill, so we are back to regular order  when it comes to WRDA.   I hope we bring it to the floor today, and I hope we pass a WRDA  bill. That is good news for the American people and the American  economy, because WRDA works. WRDA works because it ensures that  Congress carries out its clear Federal role in addressing  infrastructure that is critical to our commerce and competitiveness,  and to protecting communities throughout the country.   WRDA authorizes targeted investments in America's harbors, ports,  locks, dams, inland waterways, flood protection, environmental  restoration, and other water resources infrastructure.   This infrastructure, maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  is vital to every part of the country and every American benefits from  it. You don't have to live near a port or a major waterway to  experience these benefits. The health of this infrastructure directly  impacts how efficiently the things we buy get onto our store shelves,  and how quickly the goods that we produce get to markets around the  world.   WRDA improvements originate at the local level. They grow our local,  regional, and national economies, and they create good-paying jobs.  Restoring WRDA legislation to a 2-year congressional cycle was one of  the first goals when I became chairman in 2013. By working together, we  passed WRDA into law in 2014 and 2016.   Both of these measures attracted broad bipartisan support, and this  bill is no different, passing out of our committee unanimously 2 weeks  ago. I want to thank Ranking Member DeFazio, Water Resources  Environment Subcommittee Chairman Garret Graves, and Subcommittee  Ranking Member Grace Napolitano for working with me to introduce this  bill.   Our bipartisan legislation follows the fiscally responsible,  transparent process for considering Corps activities that Congress  established in 2014. It maintains strong congressional oversight and  the constitutional authority of the Legislative Branch. It deauthorizes  old projects to fully offset new authorizations, and sunsets new  authorizations to prevent future backlogs.   WRDA also builds on past reforms of the Corps and explores new ways  to deliver projects more efficiently. In keeping with traditional  WRDAs, my cosponsors and I agreed to narrowly focus our bill on the  civil works program of the Corps. Preserving the civil works focus of  this bill increases the likelihood of final passage.   If we don't enact a bill into law this year, we will delay necessary  water infrastructure improvements and increase project costs. Let's  approve this vital bill today. Let's build our water infrastructure.  Let's grow our economy, and let's create jobs. Let's pass WRDA, because  WRDA does work, and let's ensure that WRDA continues to work for the  American people.   Mr. Chairman, I look forward to a good debate today and to moving  this bill to the Senate, so I urge all of my colleagues to support the  bill.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a cost estimate from the  Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 8.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                       Washington, DC, June 4, 2018.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 8, the Water       Resources Development Act of 2018.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.              H.R. 8--Water Resources Development Act of 2018  As reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure                              on June 1, 2018                                   SUMMARY         H.R. 8 would authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers       (Corps) to construct projects to improve navigation and flood       management, to mitigate storm and hurricane damage and to       provide assistance for water recycling and water treatment       projects. The bill also would authorize the Federal Emergency       Management Agency (FEMA) to assist states and local       governments in mitigating flood risks from aging dams and       levees. CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 8 would cost       about $1.1 billion over the next five years and $2.5 billion       over the 2019-2028 period, assuming appropriation of       authorized and necessary amounts.        Enacting H.R. 8 also would increase direct spending by $5       million over the 2019-2028 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go       procedures apply. The bill would authorize the Corps to       convey nine acres of federal land to the city of Nashville,       Tennessee, in exchange for the fair market value of the       property, which CBO estimates would total about $1 million.       The bill also would authorize the Corps to credit the       nonfederal sponsor of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project       for certain in-kind contributions totaling $6 million.       Enacting the bill would not affect revenues.        H.R. 8 would significantly increase direct spending by more       than $2.5 billion and on-budget deficits by more than $5       billion in at least one of the four consecutive 10-year       periods beginning in 2029, by authorizing the Corps to spend       amounts in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund without further       appropriation.        H.R. 8 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act       (UMRA).                   ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT         The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 8 is shown in the       following table. The costs of the legislation fall within       budget function 300 (natural resources and environment).

Estimates       of amounts necessary to implement the bill are based on       information from the Corps and FEMA; estimated outlays are       based on historical spending patterns for similar projects       and programs. Major components of the estimated costs are       described below.                      Spending Subject to Appropriation         CBO estimates that H.R. 8 would authorize appropriations       totaling about $2.7 billion over the 2019-2028 period for       water infrastructure projects and studies administered by the       Corps and FEMA. We estimate that implementing those       provisions would cost $2.5 billion over the 2018-2028 period.                        Water Resources Infrastructure         CBO estimates that implementing provisions of the bill that       would authorize the Corps to construct and modify water       infrastructure projects would cost about $1.5 billion over       the 2019-2028 period, assuming appropriation of the specified       amounts and accounting for anticipated inflation. Those       provisions would authorize the Corps to construct seven new       projects and would modify the existing authorization of three       projects aimed at mitigating hurricane and storm damage,       strengthening flood-risk management, improving the nation's       navigation system, restoring the environment, and providing       assistance for water recycling and water treatment projects.       Using information from the Corps, CBO estimates that the       total cost to complete those projects would be $4.2 billion.       H.R. 8 would authorize the appropriation of $2.7 billion to       cover the federal share of those costs--of that $1.7 billion       would need to be appropriated over the 2019-2028 period       (assuming historical rates of spending for similar       projects)--and nonfederal entities would be responsible for       the remaining costs, totaling an estimated $1.5 billion.        The estimated cost of the largest project authorized by       H.R. 8 totals $3.3 billion; the federal share would total       about $2.2 billion. That project aims to address erosion       along the coast in Galveston, Texas, and restore ecosystems       including wetlands and marshes to enhance protection from       storm surge in the area that was damaged by Hurricane Harvey.       The estimated cost for the other projects authorized by the       bill total $0.9 billion; the federal share of those projects       totals about $0.6 billion.        Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO       estimates that spending on the project to restore the Texas       coast in Galveston would total about $940 million over the       2019-2028 period. CBO estimates that construction spending       for the other six projects and three modifications would       total about $550 million over the next 10 years.        To estimate how funds appropriated for those projects would       be spent, CBO used information from the Corps about when       construction for each project could begin, how long it would       take to complete, and what funding would be necessary to       complete it over the anticipated construction period.       Construction schedules and the pattern of spending for       such projects is uncertain and plans are subject to change       because of delays in obtaining funding and other       unforeseen circumstances. For this estimate, CBO assumed       that those projects with greater costs to benefits ratios       would be prioritized for funding. Information on cost       benefit ratios was provided to CBO by the Corps. CBO also       analyzed the historical spending patterns of similar       projects. Because of their size and complexity some large       Corps projects can take several years to commence and more       than ten years to complete. CBO estimates that the federal       share of the projects and modifications authorized by this       title would require the appropriation of about $1.7       billion over the 2019-2028 period; the remainder of the       federal share to complete the projects would be needed       after 2028.        Finally, the bill would withdraw the authorization for five       projects originally authorized more than 70 years ago.       Information from the Corps indicates that these projects are       complete and no additional construction is planned; therefore       CBO expects that deauthorizing them would have no budgetary       effect.                             dam and levee safety         Using information provided by the Corps and FEMA, CBO       estimates that implementing provisions addressing dam and       levee safety would cost $590 million over the 2019-2028       period, assuming appropriation of authorized amounts.        H.R. 8 would reauthorize the national dam and levee safety       programs operated by FEMA Corps. Those programs provide       grants to local and state governments to assist with levee       safety and rehabilitation, maintaining databases for the       nation's dams and levees, and implementing a public awareness       and education program for managing dam and levee safety.       Under those programs the Corps also would provide technical       assistance to local and state governments to rehabilitate       high risk levees. H.R. 8 would authorize the appropriation of       $372 million for FEMA and the Corps to implement those       programs. Using information on historical spending patterns       for similar projects, CBO estimates that implementing those       provisions would cost $365 million over the 2019-2028 period.        The bill also would increase amounts authorized to be       appropriated each year for the Corps to rehabilitate dams       considered to be highly hazardous until the authorization for       program expires in 2026. Dams eligible for funding would       include those constructed by the Corps before 1940 that have       been classified as a high hazard by the state where the dam       is located and that are operated by a nonfederal entity.       Using information on historical spending patterns for this       program, CBO estimates that implementing that provision would       cost $225 million over the 2019-2028 period.               navigation and nonfederal construction programs         CBO estimates that implementing provisions of the bill       related to navigation and nonfederal construction programs       would cost $203 million over the 2019-2028 period, assuming       appropriation of the specified amounts.        H.R. 8 would increase the amounts authorized to be       appropriated each year by $12.5 million for the Corps to       construct small harbor projects to improve navigation. Using       information from the Corps, CBO estimates that implementing       that provision would cost $108 million over the 2019-2028       period.        The bill also would reauthorize a pilot program for the       Corps to contract with nonfederal partners to construct       projects to manage risk from floods, reduce damage from       storms and improve navigation of the nation's harbors. The       program aims to identify opportunities for reducing the costs       and the time required to complete construction projects. The       provision would authorize the appropriation of $25 million       for each year from 2020 through 2023. Using information from       the Corps, CBO estimates that implementing that provision       would cost $95 million over the 2019-2028 period.                         studies and other provisions         Using information provided by the Corps, CBO estimates that       implementing the provisions described below would cost $167       million over the 2019-2028 period, assuming appropriation of       the necessary amounts. Those provisions would:        Authorize the Corps to credit non-federal partners for work       carried out on projects to protect, preserve, and restore the       Louisiana coastal ecosystems;        Authorize the Corps to conduct about 20 feasibility studies       for projects to reduce risks stemming from floods, to restore       ecosystems, and to improve navigation; and        Direct the Corps to prepare a report on aquatic invasive       species and other management reports, fund a demonstration       project aimed at harmful algal bloom, and provide housing       support to Indian tribes displaced by the construction of       John Day Dam on the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon.        CBO's cost estimate for H.R. 8 excludes the costs of       implementing section 108, which would authorize the Corps to       restore infrastructure for shore protection damaged by       natural disasters to pre-storm levels because the number of       eligible projects is not available.  [[Page H4800]]                               changes in direct spending         Using information provided by the Corps, CBO estimates that       implementing the provisions described below would increase       direct spending by about $5 million. The construction phase       of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project in Florida is       nearly complete and the Corps anticipates that the final       accounting for the federal and nonfederal shares of the       project's cost will occur in about 5 years. The Corps has       previously determined that certain in-kind contributions       provided by the local sponsor of the project were ineligible       as a qualifying credit toward the portion of the local cost       share. H.R. 8 would reverse that decision by the Corps and       reduce any cash settlement that would be required by the       local sponsor to reconcile the nonfederal account. The Corps       would be required to credit the nonfederal sponsor for the       Kissimmee River Restoration Project for those in-kind       contributions, which total $6 million.        The bill also would authorize the Corps to convey 9 acres       of federal land to the city of Nashville, Tennessee, in       exchange for payment of the fair market value of the       property. Using information provided by the Corps, CBO       estimates the city would pay the federal government about       $600,000 in 2020 when the property is transferred.                         pay-as-you-go considerations         The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-      reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation       affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in       outlay that are subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are       an increase in direct spending of $5 million.        Enacting the bill would not affect revenues over the 2019-      2028 period.              increase in long-term direct spending and deficits         CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 8 would increase net       direct spending and on-budget deficits by more than $2.5       billion and on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in at       least one of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning       in 2029.        Under the bill, balances in the Harbor Maintenance Trust       Fund (HMTF) would become available to the Corps, without       further appropriation, beginning in fiscal year 2029. The       Corps would expend those funds on nonroutine maintenance       costs and deferred repairs at eligible projects. CBO       estimates that the balance in the HMTF would total about $15       billion in 2029. In recent years the annual appropriation       from the HMTF has been about $1 billion.

This bill,  H.R. 8, has many benefits to all 50 States and the territories,  including Puerto Rico. It was put together in a bipartisan manner. We  just here today adopted over 50 amendments in a bipartisan manner.   This bill asserts congressional authority and continues regular order  of the Corps of Engineers in authorizing these programs. It is fiscally  responsible. We fully offset new projects. Finally, it keeps American  jobs by strengthening our competitiveness ensuring that our  transportation system remains attractive to private-sector jobs, so I  oppose the motion to recommit.   This being my last WRDA bill that I will ever be able to shepherd  through the House, I am proud to be here. Hopefully we are going to  have a conference report in the near future to be able to pass that on  the House floor, but I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, I am very, very proud  of my term as chairman. One of the accomplishments I am most proud of  is getting WRDA back on regular order, every Congress authorizing these  important programs so that the Corps can move forward and the American  people can benefit by these programs.   Again, I want to, first off, thank my Democratic colleagues and the  Democratic staff on the other side of the aisle for their work, working  together closely on this bill. Of course, I couldn't get this done  without my dedicated staff who have worked so tirelessly, not only on  this bill but over the past 5 years, and I thank them from the bottom  of my heart.   Mr. Speaker, a personal point of order that I would like to take is  that in 2016 when we passed the WRDA bill, September 28, 2016, I woke  up that morning and found out that my mother had passed away. But I  could hear her voice in my head saying: Go to work. Do your job.   We came to work that day, and we were able to pass the WRDA bill in  2016. I was so proud that, as always, she was on my shoulder. This  morning I woke up and didn't think about the date until I realized  today, June 6, is my mother's birthday. It would have been her  birthday. So, again, my mother who was always my greatest supporter and  my greatest cheerleader was here again with me today. I can hear her  voice telling me: Make sure you do your work.   Our family chain is broken, and nothing seems to be the same. But as  God calls one by one, that chain will link again. And today, as strong  as ever, that link with my mother is with me. I want to thank my  mother. I know she is watching down. Patricia Shuster, as always, is  sitting on my shoulder, rooting me on to victory. So, again, today I am  very, very proud of the WRDA bill. I am proud we are doing it on June  6, my mother's birthday.   Again, I thank everybody on both sides of the aisle for their  efforts. Again, I oppose the motion to recommit and urge all my  colleagues to support H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of  2018.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of H.R. 8, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, amendatory instructions, and cross-references,  and to make such other technical and conforming changes as may be  necessary to accurately reflect the actions of the House.
