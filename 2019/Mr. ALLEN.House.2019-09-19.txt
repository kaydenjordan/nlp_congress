 Madam Speaker, every day, Americans volunteer within their  communities to help family, friends, and neighbors, including our  Nation's elderly. Personally, I have had the opportunity to deliver  Meals on Wheels on many occasions, and I have seen the impact it has  had on our seniors.   As a society, we must work together to take care of older Americans  who are sometimes exploited, abused, or neglected. That is why, in  1965, the Older Americans Act was enacted to support a wide range of  services and programs for individuals over the age of 60. This critical  legislation supports many programs important for Georgia's seniors,  like nutrition programs at churches and family caregiver support.   I am proud to serve on the House Education and Labor Committee where,  this week, with unanimous bipartisan support, we voted to move forward  legislation to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. As Congress has  done many times before, I urge my colleagues to reauthorize the Older  Americans Act to protect our Nation's elderly.                            ____________________
