 Mr. President, I rise today in the time-honored tradition  of giving my farewell remarks to the United States Senate. This is an  opportunity to thank my friends, my colleagues, and the voters of North  Carolina who have supported me for 28 years, through 8 elections, for  the opportunity to serve and the ability to make a difference for my  State and my country.   Thirty years ago, I was a businessman with a happy family in Winston- Salem, NC, who decided things in Washington, DC, weren't working  exactly right. So I decided to run for Congress in an effort to help  make that change for the better. My reason for  [[Page S7164]]  running was a concern of the future for my two young sons and others of  their generation.   I lost that first race for the House in 1992, and I took it in stride  thinking, I have done my best shot. It was meant to be. I am not a  politician. I had never run for office before or been involved in  politics except to vote. But by 1994, as Congress was still raising  taxes and increasing the deficit at the same time, I decided I had to  try again to bring some common sense to how things were being decided  in our Nation's Capital. So I threw my hat in the ring again, and I was  elected to the House of Representatives. I was surrounded by 73 other  new Members, with a new majority, and an opportunity to make new  friends.   I met three people who are now some of my closest friends: John  Boehner, Saxby Chambliss, and Tom Latham. Brooke and I are blessed with  their friendship. Every year since they have left, along with their  wives, Debbie Boehner, Julianne Chambliss, and the late Kathy Latham,  we have traveled and deepened those bonds of friendship. I am grateful  and proud we are so incredibly close, and I thank all of them today.   Do you suppose Boehner is crying by now?   While we have all made new friends in Congress, not a day goes by-- not a day--that I don't miss my good friend Tom Coburn. I have his name  plate in my office from the Intel Committee to remind me of the lessons  that Tom gave all of us and for the example he set as a Member of the  Senate. Now, from that class of 1994, there are only three of us left-- Roger, Lindsey, and me--and my time is short.   The Contract with America created a new majority. Newt Gingrich and  Frank Luntz crafted our unifying message to the American people. We  came with a commitment not to leave for a hundred days until we started  to change the course of American government. Then, this seemed like a  small sacrifice for a transformation I saw as imminent and important.  We worked day and night before we ever found the bathroom or permanent  housing.   Every Member had a different story and a different reason for  running, but we were elected for a common cause: to fix Congress and a  government that was broken and out of touch.   Being one of 435 Representatives in an institution driven by  seniority has a sobering impact. For many, our new committee  assignments taught us that we weren't quite as smart as we thought.  Winning elections was hard; thoughtful policymaking was even harder. I  decided early on that the Energy and Commerce Committee was where I  would spend the majority of my time and focus.   Much can be said for the value of institutional knowledge, but there  weren't any Republicans who knew what to do in the majority since none  of us had ever served in a majority.   John Dingell was the outgoing chair of the committee, and quite  honestly, John could have ignored the new Republicans and been upset  about the election taking his gavel away. Instead, he took me under his  wing. John taught me many lessons about hearings, about oversight, how  to focus on important topics, and more importantly, how the work in  Washington really gets done. He advised me to spend my time listening,  so I did. I came to the committee hearings, and I learned from the  experts.   I was doing so much at one time, I realized that family time was too  often ignored. I cannot express how much I appreciate the love and the  support of my family to let me have this incredible experience. Brooke  and I have lived apart for 28 years. Outside of congressional recesses  or a few trips, every Monday, I have had to wake up, just like you, and  know I had to fly back to Washington to cast a vote. I look forward to  being home with the love of my life when I am done with this.   During the decade I served in the House, our country went through  some major events, including 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,  which still ripple through our foreign policy, our defense policy, and  our domestic policy today; the anthrax attacks, which opened my eyes as  to how unprepared our country was for the threat of bioterrorism and  inspired my work to create the national preparedness and response  framework; and the impeachment of President Clinton--only the second  time a President had been impeached in the history of our country in  the House.    I had the opportunity to work on a lot of legislation, but issues I  am most proud of are bipartisan legislation to end the tobacco quota;  the start of my biodefense work with the National Disaster Medical  System and the Smallpox Vaccine Program when we created the Department  of Homeland Security; and especially the Food and Drug Modernization  Act, or FDAMA, as many of us know.   I came to Congress 6 years before the horrible attacks of 9/11, and  guarding our Nation's freedoms was as important then as it remains  today. Standing at Ground Zero just a few days after those awful  attacks in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania made it clear to me  that we could never let down our guard against those who hate our  country and hate our freedoms. Serving on the House and Senate  Intelligence Committees has made me more committed to remaining  vigilant in the goal of protecting the lives of all Americans.   When I decided to run for the Senate, little did I know how grueling  the campaign would be. Running a statewide race against Erskine Bowles  was never going to be easy. Erskine had experience, money, and a built- in network. I had a lot of energy and a determination to win.   Our campaign was downright civil compared to what we have seen in  recent years, and after the election, Erskine and I became lifetime,  longtime friends. We remain that way today. I appreciate Erskine Bowles  for his continued service to our State of North Carolina and to the  country.   In my 18 years in the Senate, we have lived through some major events  as well: the financial crisis of 2009, the Ebola outbreak of 2014, a  global pandemic, and I might say the third and fourth impeachments of a  President of the United States, the illegal and immoral invasion of  Ukraine.   In the Senate, any Senator can work on any legislation they want, but  in particular, I would like to mention just a few: the Pandemic and  All-Hazards bill, or PAHPA; the ABLE Act to help families with children  with disabilities save for the future; the child care and development  block grant reauthorization to help families afford quality childcare;  the Veterans Choice Act to help veterans get the healthcare they  deserve; making permanent the funding for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund; the Ryan White CARE Act to make this successful  program more equitable for Americans living with HIV/AIDS; the Emmett  Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes bill, which helps investigators work  to discover the truth and seek justice for families of the victims of  civil rights-era cold cases; and years' worth of annual intelligence  authorization bills.   Usually, the most bipartisan bills that move through this body are  often misunderstood and mischaracterized. Far from being a  congressional blank check to the intelligence community, they represent  an annual congressional exercise to guide and direct the intelligence  community. These bills are the most bipartisan products of ongoing,  rigorous oversight. Those who block or obstruct or otherwise delay  these bills are not empowering the people they think they are.   While I am proud of all these bills and more, I want to highlight the  work I have done to build the architecture of the Nation's pandemic and  biological preparedness systems--in particular, the creation of the  Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, BARDA.   Developing a collaboration between the Federal Government and private  sector companies to accelerate the development of medical  countermeasures helps us all meet the oath we swore to protect the  safety and security of the American people.   Without BARDA, we wouldn't have had the tools to deal with anthrax,  smallpox, and radiological or nuclear threats. We wouldn't have  developed the COVID vaccines as rapidly. We wouldn't be on the leading  edge of science, and we would instead be falling further and further  behind.   This infrastructure works because we made it flexible. We made it  adaptable. So whatever the current threat may be, my greatest  frustration is that administration after administration  [[Page S7165]]  seems to think they need to reinvent the wheel instead of picking up  the tools that Congress has already laid on the table and built to  handle emergencies.   I hope one lesson we have learned from COVID is exactly how valuable  BARDA is.   I have been especially fortunate to serve on three of the most  consequential committees in the United States Senate: Intelligence,  where I continued my service from the House in the Senate, eventually  becoming chair; Finance, which governs our Tax Code and much of our  healthcare programs; and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee, where I currently serve as the ranking Republican and have  focused on our public health threat preparedness and response  infrastructure and modernizing the FDA, CDC, and NIH, and I thank my  chairman, Senator Murray.   While serving on the Intelligence Committee, I have developed a deep  friendship with Mark Warner and so many of my colleagues. We were great  partners during our investigation of Russia's efforts to interfere in  the 2016 election, and our shared passion for oversight of the  intelligence community has made them better, more responsive, and our  country safer.   Mark, I am going to miss that work with you.   I would also like to offer my deepest thanks and proud affection for  the men and women of the intelligence community. From junior analysts  to the station chiefs, in DC and around the world, the thing that has  always stood out is their love of country, their commitment to mission,  to keep the American people safe and our country secure. It is easy to  focus on their so-called intelligence failures, which are more,  actually, policy failures, and we don't get to talk about their  successes, but that is what enables them to keep doing the work they do  successfully to keep us safe.   It is a rare opportunity to praise them for a job well-done. So to  all of them: Thank you. It has been an honor, and it has been a  privilege to serve in that capacity.   Committees are where you roll up your sleeves and you get to work. I  learned that from John Dingell in the House and from my friends Ted  Kennedy and Orrin Hatch in the Senate. It is where friendships are made  and where we work together to get results for the people who sent us  here.   If I have any regrets about the operation of the Senate in recent  years, it is how much leadership ignored the work of the committees  and, in many cases, ignored the expertise of our staff.   The Senate needs more committee consideration of bills and serious  issues, less consolidation of decision-making in the hands of a few.   Thomas Jefferson once said:         I like the dreams of the future better than the history of       the past.    So let me look forward in my remaining time rather than just  reminisce the past. I have never been more optimistic about America's  future.   During the next two decades, we will see technology and innovation at  a speed that none of us can envision today. Technology platforms will  emerge that change the global economy; and at a pace that will be hard  for this institution to keep up with.   Breakthroughs will transform healthcare, agriculture, and  manufacturing. Then it will hit a wall called the Federal Government,  with an architecture designed in the 1950s.   The work you have got is huge. It is time for Congress to be the  visionary body our Founders envisioned when they created us.   We are now 22 years into this new century. What are we waiting for?  We need to unleash Americans to solve today's problems with the  intellectual power of our great country. America is full of bright and  intelligent men and women of all ages who are creative at finding  solutions and forging new paths. We need these folks in the U.S.  Senate, and I am glad that I have had the chance to serve with some who  will now continue to carry on the great efforts for years to come.   We need more statesman and fewer politicians. As Harry Truman said  while serving in this great body:         Regardless of [your] politics . . . [our] fate is tied up       in what [happens] in this room.    What happens in this room.   The tradition of a farewell speech usually includes some words to  your colleagues about the importance of the U.S. Senate, John Dingell's  complaint about us being the enemy of the House notwithstanding.   So here are some lessons about what I have learned and what I  recommend to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, both to the  newcomers and to those in term 1 or 5.   One: Thank your family. They put up with more than you will ever  know.   To my wife Brooke, thank you, thank you, thank you.   While I am sure she is happy to see me retire, she also reminded me  she doesn't make lunch, so I had better get a job.   To my sons and their families, Tyler, Meg, Rooney, William, Tyler-- yeah, a boy Tyler and a daughter-in-law Tyler--Mary Lyde, Virginia, and  Henry: Thank you. I am proud of the lives you are building and the  grandchildren you have blessed Brooke and I with. I love you. I look  forward to spending more time with you instead of these guys.   Two: Thank your staff. They are actually the reason you are here; it  is not you.   In my time in the House and the Senate, during my leadership of the  Intelligence Committee, the HELP Committee, I have worked with roughly  200 of the smartest, hardest working staff who sacrifice time and  higher pay to work behind the scenes to make so many things happen.   I have been blessed with a staff in North Carolina. My constituents  couldn't be better served by their tireless efforts.   I have had the best constituent service folks in North Carolina as  North Carolina has ever seen.   It would be impossible to name all of you, and I will put the names  in the Record, but, particularly, I want to thank Dean Myers and Chris  Joyner for their years of friendship and service to North Carolina, our  country, and to me. I thank both of you.   There are so many names, but from my House terms, I would like to  especially thank Jenny Hansen Ware, John Versaggi, Brian Vanderbloemen,  and A.T.   From my Senate terms: Natasha Hickman, Chris Toppings, Polly Walker,  Michael Sorensen, Caitlin Carroll, Rebecca Glover, and Josh Bowlen.   From the Intel Committee, Christian Cook, Emily Harding, Vanessa Le,  Tommy Nguyen, the entire bipartisan Russian team, and all of those who  serve the committee under my chairmanship.   And my HELP Committee, Angela Wiles, Rachel Portman, Anna Abrams, Dr.  Bob Kadlec, Margaret Barton and David Cleary.   Finally, I would also like to say a few words about Alicia Peterson  Clark. She helped me in my first election. She became my House chief,  and she got me to the Senate.   She helped build the operation and establish the culture that runs  through my office today. Today, even if you never met her, if you have  worked for me, you have been influenced by her leadership. She passed  away a few years ago, heartbreakingly young, and she is deeply missed.   Three: Consistently remind yourself why you came to serve.   The American people expect us to get things done. Like it or not,  they may not send you home, but you will leave feeling that you played  in the game and have very little to show for it.   Four: Only do things that have meaningful purpose. My staff knows my  rule for the introduction of legislation. You have got to show me the  human face behind the issue if you want me to introduce it and be  passionate about it.   Five: Remember, our Founders expected Congress to be visionary.   When we complain about regulation we don't like, it is usually our  fault because we either delegated that authority away or remained  silent when an out-of-control President just takes authority we never  granted.   Our system is designed so that Congress would do things to fix  problems, including problems that didn't exist.   The creation of BARDA proved to me the importance of being visionary.  We would not have been prepared for H1N1, Ebola, Zika, coronavirus. My  advice is to look ahead to what you think future problems might be and  build an architecture to solve them.   Six: Nobody wins in impeachment. Let me say that again. Nobody wins  in  [[Page S7166]]  impeachments. I have lived through 3--75 percent of all impeachments in  the history of the United States of America.   Congress should resist the temptation to treat impeachment as just  the newest form of political opposition.   Seven: Principle is important, but flexibility is essential.   While we all have areas of interest that we are most comfortable  with, they may not be the greatest need of our time.   When the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened, we all had to shift our  focus. When the financial markets collapsed in 2008 and 2009, it was  all-hands-on-deck. And when COVID became a pandemic, we had to scramble  to become health, education, and financial experts to shore up our  economy and save lives.   I wish we had done more to keep schools open so that children  wouldn't have suffered quite so much.   But I know that in the future we will have learned from these  mistakes and we won't make them again.   That is seven lessons on how to be an effective U.S. Senator. I hope  some of my colleagues find these to be helpful.   America has always been a great country, where dreams can come true.  Let's keep it that way. Our citizens and elected officials alike should  dream big and then work hard to make them a reality.    The job of being a U.S. Senator means making tough decisions. Please  remember that good judgment in making those decisions often involves  finding some balance between two parties as much as it means standing  firm on your personal convictions and on the platform on which you were  elected.   I hope we are all committed to supporting the ingenuity of our  citizens so that they can match the likes of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison,  George Washington Carver, Beulah Louise Henry, and so many others.   Government should not be a roadblock to innovation and new ideas.  Rather, it should encourage new ideas, new innovation, and new  possibilities to realize the untapped potential of our citizens.   I have often expressed my belief that America's best days are still  ahead, and lately I have been chided for thinking that that is true.  But my optimism is rooted in reality.   Our country and our citizens have an unlocked potential and an  unbound determination to overcome any division, any problem.   Yes, there is much work to be done, but Americans have never been  afraid to roll up their sleeves and work hard to succeed.   Think of the challenges that we have overcome since our country was  founded--the Civil War, the Great Depression, two world wars, racial  division, the Cold War, terrorist attacks, Presidential impeachments,  disputed elections, an international pandemic, and more.   Yet none of these have destroyed the fabric of our Nation or its  people, and I refuse to believe that any challenge is too great to  tackle when we come together.   I stand here today in awe of the history made in the Capitol complex,  the people's House, the U.S. Senate, the old House Chamber, the old  Senate Chamber, and even the old Supreme Court Chamber.   Our Nation's history is crystalized here in this building. Our flaws,  our triumphs, our humbling errors, and our breathtaking successes.   If you listen closely at night, when all around is quiet, you can  hear the echoing voices of the ordinary men and women who became giants  in our Nation's history--Sam Rayburn, Margaret Chase Smith, Everett  Dirksen, Barbara Jordan, John Dingell, Tom Coburn, Barbara Mikulski,  John Lewis, and so many more.   They served here with dignity and honor, and they shaped the course  of a nation's destiny. They shared my optimism about our country and  our future. Even in the darkest days, I know that optimism is not  misplaced looking ahead.   It is hard for me to imagine that I have had the great honor and  extraordinary privilege to follow in their footsteps.   I hope that my time here has had purpose and meaning. I know I have  done my best to contribute and to help build a more perfect union.   I will miss you, my colleagues, and I will miss the tremendous staff  in Congress who are unknown by the public, but behind the scenes, they  keep everything running smoothly.   I will, especially, miss the hardworking, dedicated, and fearless men  and women of the U.S. Capitol Police for the job they do to keep us  safe. When trouble rears its head, they stand up. We must all remain  thankful for the job they do on our behalf.   As I conclude, I want to thank my wife and my family again, as well  as my colleagues and my staff.   I also want to thank the people of North Carolina for honoring me  with the trust and respect. I am humbled that they sent me here to  Congress eight different times, and I appreciate their support.   I yield the floor.   (Applause.)   (Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.)
