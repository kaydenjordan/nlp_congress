 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor to oppose the  nomination of Chad Readler to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and to  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose this nomination  as well.   We have learned that both Senators from Ohio--one a Democrat and one  a Republican--had previously proposed mutually agreeable candidates to  fill the Sixth Circuit Court position, but despite that prior support,  the Trump administration instead nominated somebody who did not have  the support from both Senators, which is a device we use to try to  encourage nominations that are not way out of the mainstream. We want  judicial nominees who are not on the far right nor on any other  extreme. Yet this administration decided to ignore that bipartisan  support and nominated Mr. Readler for the position on the Sixth Circuit  Court of Appeals.   Mr. Readler, unfortunately, has a record that falls well out of the  judicial mainstream. I am very concerned about the kind of judicial  reasoning and findings he will make as a member of the Sixth Circuit,  if he is confirmed.   He has been the Trump administration's point man at the Department of  Justice to try to destroy the Affordable Care Act and eliminate the  protections the Affordable Care Act has brought to tens of millions of  Americans, including protections for people with preexisting health  conditions--whether it  [[Page S1651]]  be a child with asthma, or somebody with diabetes, or anybody who has a  preexisting condition health condition. Before the Affordable Care Act  was passed, insurance companies would say either we are not going to  insure you because you are going to be too expensive to treat or we  will provide coverage but only at this price, and then they would quote  a price the person couldn't possibly afford.   The Affordable Care Act did away with that discrimination based on  preexisting conditions. Yet at the Department of Justice, this nominee,  Mr. Readler, was the point person in trying to reimpose discrimination  based on preexisting conditions.   Why do we say that? Because over the last couple of years there was a  lawsuit filed in the State of Texas. It was filed by the attorney  general of the State of Texas and a number of other attorneys general  from other States around the country--Republican attorneys general-- that went after the Affordable Care Act. They argued that once the  Congress passed legislation eliminating the penalties for the mandates,  all the rest of the law collapsed. It is a position most legal scholars  from all sides of the political spectrum think is an absurd legal  conclusion that will not stand the test of time or the test of the  courts in the long run.   Despite the fact that the conclusion was way out of the mainstream  and directed more out of a political charge to try to undo the  Affordable Care Act, nevertheless, Mr. Readler filed the case on behalf  of the Justice Department--not in support of the Affordable Care Act,  which would be the usual practice of the Department of Justice in  protecting the laws of the United States, but deciding, first of all,  not to protect it and, secondly, to actively go after the Affordable  Care Act and side mainly with the positions of Republican attorneys  general who were trying to destroy the law.   This was a very unusual position to take, and many of the career  attorneys at the Department of Justice decided not to sign their names  to the brief that was filed. They did not want to be associated with a  brief that they thought was more a political document than a legal  document. In fact, one very respected career attorney at the Department  of Justice resigned in protest.   Even our colleague, Senator Lamar Alexander, said this about the  brief that was filed by the Justice Department: It is ``as far-fetched  as any I've ever heard.''   Despite the fact that this was a legal position far out of the  mainstream--authored by Mr. Readler from his post at the Department of  Justice--nevertheless, he went ahead and filed that brief. It is  totally inconsistent with the position others claimed they were taking  with respect to protecting people with preexisting health conditions.  In fact, President Trump tweeted repeatedly that he wanted to protect  people with preexisting health conditions.   Many of our Republican colleagues in this Chamber in the Senate, and  in the House, said they don't like some parts of the Affordable Care  Act, but they want to protect people with preexisting conditions from  discrimination by insurance companies. Yet the Texas lawsuit dismantles  the Affordable Care Act top to bottom, including getting rid of  provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions.   I think it is important to remind people what that means because it  means children with expensive, chronic medical conditions will no  longer be able to get that kind of coverage.   We also know that before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies  had arbitrary annual caps early in each year. So if a child had a  chronic condition and the costs of helping that child, providing  medical attention to that child, began to build up, they would  sometimes hit that cap before their fifth birthday, and then the family  would be on its own. People were paying health plans for coverage and  services they needed, only to discover in the fine print that coverage  really wasn't there for them when they needed it, and women who became  pregnant found that their insurance plans would not cover any of their  prenatal care or deliveries. Many of our fellow Americans were  diagnosed with cancer only to discover that their plans did not cover  chemotherapy.   When the Texas attorney general, with a cohort of other Republican  attorneys general, filed that lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act,  they filed a lawsuit that put a dagger in the heart of the consumer  protections and patient protections we had in the Affordable Care Act.  It was Mr. Readler who didn't come to the defense of the law for the  Department of Justice but in fact went after the Affordable Care Act  and sided with the attorneys general in Texas.   Indeed, there was a U.S. district court judge in Texas who went along  with these legal arguments. What that means is, the case is now  traveling through the Federal court system. It will go to the circuit  courts and may end up at the Supreme Court. So I would hope our  colleagues on both sides of the aisle who say they want judges who are  going to do the right thing and call the balls and strikes as they see  them and who have also said they support protections for people with  preexisting health conditions would be nervous about putting someone on  the court who says the law requires them to take the opposite position  of what our colleagues say they support right now.    As we approach this vote, make no mistake, in many ways, this is a  vote on the future of protections for people with preexisting health  conditions.   Unfortunately, Mr. Readler has also taken a position on  discrimination issues that is very troublesome on other fronts,  specifically with respect to LGBT rights. Under his leadership, in his  office, the Department of Justice submitted a brief in the case of  Zarda v. Altitude Express. In that case, Zarda, who was an employee,  alleged that his company had fired him because of his sexual  orientation, and the Department of Justice did not take the side  against the right of employers to discriminate based on sexual  orientation. What they argued was that title VII of the Civil Rights  Act does not cover discrimination based on sexual orientation.   Fortunately, in a rare en banc decision, the Second Circuit Court of  Appeals held that the LGBT community is protected as a class under the  Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, because of a circuit split  surrounding this issue, it is likely to go up through the court system  and find its way to the Supreme Court. The position he took on behalf  of the Trump Justice Department is a telltale sign of where Mr. Readler  stands on questions of whether the law protects people who have been  discriminated against.   I should say this is not a new issue. For many of us, there have been  efforts in Congress to address this issue. In my State of Maryland, in  2001, we passed an anti-discrimination act that says it is illegal to  discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation in  housing, in employment, and in public accommodations. I recall that the  bill was filibustered late into the evening by Republican State  legislators, but fortunately for Marylanders it passed.   I am also concerned about Mr. Readler's record in taking the side of  tobacco companies during his time as a partner at Jones Day,  specifically R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Like many of us here, I  have worked for many years--first, in the Maryland State Legislature  and since then in the U.S. Congress--to curb tobacco use, especially  among young people. I hope we all agree we don't want young people to  get hooked on tobacco products or to get hooked on nicotine, which we  know is very bad for their health and could very likely kill them in  the long run. Yet Mr. Readler took the position of the tobacco  companies, defining this issue simply as one of the need to have  somebody who would stick up for special interests even when it was  against the public health interests of the American people.   He represented the tobacco giants in a number of cases--product  liability cases and commercial speech cases. In one example, the city  of Buffalo, up in New York, passed a ban on tobacco ads within 1,000  feet of facilities frequented by children, like schools, playgrounds,  and daycare centers. The purpose of that local ordinance was, of  course, to prevent kids from seeing these ads and saying: Hey, that  looks like something I want to do. Let's try this tobacco product.  Maybe it is a candy-flavored tobacco product, maybe it is another  tobacco product. The whole point of the ordinance was to protect the  health of kids. Yet Mr. Readler fought against that local ordinance.  [[Page S1652]]    The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which is an organization that  rarely, if ever, gets involved in judicial nominations, has found the  position Mr. Readler took on behalf of these tobacco companies so far  out and so extreme that they have taken the position of opposing the  nomination.   So whether it is fighting to dismantle protections for people with  preexisting conditions, as Mr. Readler did from his perch in the Trump  Department of Justice, or whether it is the positions he took as a  lawyer for the tobacco industry, trying to knock down local ordinances  and other laws to protect kids from tobacco and getting addicted to  nicotine, or the position he has taken not to prevent discrimination  but to say our laws do not protect people against basic forms of  discrimination, in my view, Mr. Readler is disqualified from taking a  position on a court where the goal of every justice, regardless of who  appoints them, should be justice itself and making sure everybody who  comes before that court gets a fair shake. They should not be positions  based on the power of a special interest like the tobacco lobby, and it  should not be a decision based on political slogans or political  promises. Rather, it should be based on the law itself. So I urge my  colleagues to oppose this nomination.   Even among nominees who are very far to the right and who take a very  restricted view of our rights and liberties, this is a nominee who  finds himself way outside the mainstream.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination of Mr. Readler.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today I wish to recognize Ann  Mitchell for her 20 years of outstanding dedication and visionary  leadership as president and CEO of Montgomery Hospice. I am grateful to  Ann for her tireless efforts to provide quality and compassionate end- of-life care and services to residents of Montgomery County, MD.   Ann understands that the experience of people who are dying is  extremely personal and that each of us has a cultural identity that is  part of our character. When people are in their final weeks of life,  Ann believes that it is paramount that each of us is cared for with a  deep respect for our cultural identity.   Ann considers herself a global citizen, as she grew up in seven  countries around the world. She celebrates diversity and recognizes the  value that a multicultural team brings to end-of-life care. Ann has  worked diligently to make Montgomery Hospice diverse at all levels,  including in senior management, and firmly supports inclusion and  equity initiatives.   Montgomery Hospice is well-known for its inpatient hospice, ``Casey  House''; its comprehensive ``Hospice at Home'' service; and its  compassionate ``Bereavement Care'' service. All Montgomery Hospice  services support its mission ``To Gentle the Journey'' for the dying  residents of Montgomery County, MD.   A trustee of Smith College, Ann graduated with a major in economics  from Smith. She earned a master's in public health at Yale University.  For the past 20 years, Ann has led Montgomery Hospice strategically in  service to its patients, employees, and volunteers.   I have known Ann for over 20 years, and I can personally attest to  the dedication and compassion she has brought to her job. It has been  an honor to support her efforts as she enlisted many in our community  in her important work. She has been totally committed to her mission of  ensuring that every individual in her care is treated with the utmost  respect and dignity, and our community is stronger and better because  of her work.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing all that Ann Mitchell  has done to make a difference in the lives of others.                            ____________________
