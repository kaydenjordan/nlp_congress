 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the people and  leaders of Taiwan on their National Day to take place on October 10.  The United States and Taiwan have a long history of friendship that has  promoted prosperity and security on both sides of the Pacific. The  U.S.-Taiwan bilateral relationship continues to grow based on our  shared democratic values and common strategic interests. I urge my  colleagues to join me in congratulating the people of Taiwan.                            ____________________
