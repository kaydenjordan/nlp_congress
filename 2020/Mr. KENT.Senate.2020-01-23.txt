 I do not think they are the same things. What       former Vice President Biden requested of the former President       of Ukraine, Poroshenko, was the removal of a corrupt       prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who had undermined a       program of assistance that we had spent, again, U.S. taxpayer       money to try to build an independent investigator unit to go       after corrupt prosecutors. And there was a case called       Diamond Prosecutor case in which Shokin destroyed the entire       ecosystem that we were trying to help create, the       investigators, the judges who issued the warrants, the law       enforcement that had warrants to do the wiretapping,       everybody to protect his former driver who he had made a       prosecutor. That's why Joe Biden was asking, remove the       corrupt prosecutor.         That is correct.         Referring to the requests in July?         I would not say so. No, sir.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. In short, the allegations against Vice  President Biden are groundless. So there is no comparison--none at  all--between what he did and President Trump's abuse of power.   Now let's turn to the third point.   Part of the allegation against former Vice President Biden is that he  pushed for the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor's removal in order to  protect his son from the investigation. In fact, the President's claim  about being concerned about corruption in Ukraine has recently  emphasized this component of the theory: that the President wanted  Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden's work on the board of Burisma, not  the former Vice President.   This, too, is false--simply false. You need look no further than the  July 25 call record and the President's own statements to see that the  President wanted the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden.   Let's look again at what the President's call said.         The other thing, there is a lot of talk about Biden's son,       that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want       to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the       Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging       that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it.       It sounds horrible to me.    The President was clearly asking President Zelensky to investigate  Joe Biden. And what did the President say on the White House lawn on  October 3, when he was asked about the Ukrainian scheme?   He said:         Well, I think if they were honest about it, you saw the       film yesterday, they would start a major investigation into       the Bidens. It is a very simple answer.    He said the Bidens, plural, not one Biden--the Bidens.   It is clear what the President wanted from Ukraine: an investigation  to smear his political rival. But even if the President wanted an  investigation  [[Page S496]]  of Hunter Biden, there is no basis for that either.   Now, how do you know? Well, Ukraine's former prosecutor general  admitted that the allegation against Vice President Biden's son was  plainly false. You can see it on the slide in his own words--``plainly  false.'' Then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko recanted his  earlier allegations and confirmed: ``Biden was definitely not involved  in any wrongdoing involving Burisma.''   So even the Ukrainians believed that Biden's son did nothing wrong.  The long and short of it is that there was no basis for the  investigation that the President was pursuing and pushing--none. He was  doing it only for his own political benefit.   Let's look at one more important reason why it is clear that  President Trump simply wanted a political benefit from Ukraine's  announcement of this investigation and didn't care about the underlying  conduct. The allegations against Vice President Biden were based on  events that occurred in late 2015 and early 2016. They were all well  publicized at the time, but as soon as President Trump took office, he  increased military support to Ukraine in 2017 and the next year, 2018.   It wasn't until 2019, over 3 years after Vice President Biden called  for Shokin's removal--3 years after--that President Trump started  pushing Ukraine to investigate that conduct.   So what changed? What changed? Why did President Trump not care at  all about Biden's request on the removal of Shokin the year after it  happened in 2017 or the next year in 2018?   Senators, you know what changed in 2019 when President Trump suddenly  cared. It is that Biden got in the race. On April 25, Vice President  Biden announced he would run for President in 2020. If President Trump  was so concerned about this alleged corruption, why didn't he push  Ukraine to investigate when he entered office in 2017 or in 2018 after  Biden gave public remarks about how he pressured Ukraine to remove  Shokin? Why did President Trump instead wait until former Vice  President Biden was campaigning for the Democratic nomination?   Senators, it is obvious: because President Trump wanted to hurt Vice  President Biden's candidacy and help himself politically. He pushed for  the investigation in 2019 because that is when it would be valuable to  him, President Trump. He pushed for it when it started to become clear  that Vice President Biden could beat him, and he had good reason to be  concerned.   Let's look at the slide about some polls. Throughout this scheme,  polling had consistently shown the former Vice President handily  beating President Trump by significant margins in head-to-head  matchups. The chart on the screen shows FOX News polls emphasizing this  point. The chart shows that from March to December, Vice President  Biden had consistently led President Trump in national polls by  significant margins. So beginning around March, Vice President Biden is  beating the President in the polls, even on FOX News.   In April, Biden officially announces his candidacy, and that is when  the President gets worried. In May, the President's personal lawyer  tells the press that he is planning to travel to Ukraine to urge newly  elected President Zelensky to conduct the two investigations--one into  Vice President Biden. Do you know what else happened in May? A FOX News  poll showed Biden beating Trump by 11 points. This clearly did not go  unnoticed.   On May 9, the President's personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani, said in an  interview: ``I guarantee you, Joe Biden will not get to election day  without this being investigated.'' And by July, right before President  Trump's call with President Zelensky, where he asked for the  investigation into Biden, the FOX News poll showed Biden beating Trump  by 10 points. Then, on July 25, after years of not caring what the Vice  President did, does President Trump ask for an investigation in his  formidable political rival in the 2020 election.   Senators, looking at this timeline of events, it is not difficult to  see why the investigation into the Bidens would be helpful to President  Trump. The mere announcement of such an investigation would immediately  tarnish the former Vice President's reputation by embroiling him and  his son in a foreign criminal investigation--even if the charges were  never pursued, just the mere announcement. And if a foreign country  announced a formal investigation into those allegations, it would give  allegations against the Bidens an air of credibility and could carry  through the election.   The evidence is clear. Everyone knew--even Ukraine--that there was no  merit to the allegation that Biden called for the removal of Shokin for  any illegitimate reason. Biden asked for it because it was consistent-- consistent with U.S. policy because Shokin was corrupt, and it was with  the backing of our allies. Even President Trump knew there was no basis  for this investigation. That is why, for years, after Shokin's removal,  he continued to support Ukraine. He never once raised the issue.    It wasn't until Biden began beating him in the polls that he called  for the investigation. The President asked Ukraine for this  investigation for one reason and one reason only: because he knew it  would be damaging to an opponent who was consistently beating him in  the polls and therefore it could help him get reelected in 2020.  President Trump had the motive, he had the opportunity, and the means  to commit this abuse of power.   Now, let's turn to the second investigation that President Trump  wanted. What he wanted was a widely debunked conspiracy theory that  Ukraine--rather than Russia--interfered in the 2016 U.S. election to  benefit President Trump's opponent. As we will explain, the allegation  that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 elections, just like the allegation  that Biden improperly removed the Ukraine prosecutor, has absolutely no  basis in fact. In fact, this theory ignored the unanimous conclusions  of the U.S. intelligence agency, the congressional Intelligence  Committees, and Special Counsel Mueller, which found that Russia-- Russia attacked our elections. It also went against the Senate  Intelligence Committee report which found no evidence supporting that  Ukraine attacked our elections, nor did any witness support the theory  that Ukraine attacked our elections. Indeed, even President Trump's own  advisers told him the claim was false.   In fact, the one person who told President Trump his theory is true-- who was it? You know it was our adversary, Russia, which had everything  to gain by deflecting the blame from their attack on Ukraine.   Let's look at what President Trump was actually suggesting Ukraine  investigate. The theory is this: Instead of listening to our entire  intelligence community that concluded that Russia interfered in our  2016 election to assist Donald Trump, the new theory says it was  Ukraine that interfered in the election to help Hillary Clinton and  hurt Donald Trump.   One aspect of this conspiracy theory was that the American cyber  security firm, CrowdStrike, which had helped the DNC respond to  Russia's cyber attack in 2016, moved a DNC server to Ukraine to prevent  the FBI from examining it. Here is what President Trump said about this  conspiracy theory during the July 25 call.         I would like you to find out what happened with this whole       situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike . . . I guess       you have one of your wealthy people . . . The server, they       say Ukraine has it.    Once again, if this sounds farfetched and crazy, it should because it  is. There is simply no factual basis to support this conspiracy theory.  Let's walk through the concrete reasons why.   First, as I mentioned, our entire U.S. intelligence community, the  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Special Counsel Mueller  all unanimously found that Russia--not Ukraine--interfered in the 2016  elections, and Russia did it to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary  Clinton. Here is an example of that.   This is the conclusion of the Director of National Intelligence's  report entitled ``Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent  U.S. Elections.'' I will quote part of it, and you can follow along in  the slide.         We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. Presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and       harm her electability and potential Presidency. We further       assess  [[Page S497]]       Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference       for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these       judgments.    ``Clear preference for President-elect Trump.'' And here is the  conclusion of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence:         The Committee found that the [Russian-based Internet       Research Agency] sought to influence the 2016 U.S.       presidential election by harming Hillary Clinton's chances of       success and supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the       Kremlin . . . The Committee found that the Russian government       tasked and supported the IRA's interference in the 2016 U.S.       election.    ``Supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the Kremlin''--that is  what it said. And here is the special counsel's conclusion Mueller  reported in 2019:         As set forth in detail in this report, the Special       Counsel's investigation established that Russia interfered in       the 2016 presidential election principally through two       operations. First, a Russia entity carried out a social media       campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump       and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.       Second, a Russian intelligence service conducted computer-      intrusion operations against entities, employees, and       volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released       stolen documents.    On December 9, 2019, even President Trump's own FBI Director  Christopher Wray stated unequivocally that there is no evidence to  support the theory that Ukraine interfered in our election in 2016.   Here is a video of that interview. Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         REPORTER. Did the Government of Ukraine directly interfere       in the 2016 election on the scale that the Russians did?        Director WRAY. We have no information that indicates that       Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election.        REPORTER. When you see politicians pushing this notion, are       you concerned about that in terms of its impact on the       American public?        Director WRAY. Well, look, there's all kinds of people       saying all kinds of things out there. I think it's important       for the American people to be thoughtful consumers of       information and to think about the sources of it and to think       about the support and predication for what they hear. And I       think part of us being well protected against malign foreign       influence is to build together an American public that's       resilient, that has appropriate media literacy, and that       takes its information with a grain of salt.        REPORTER. And Putin has been pushing this theory. And your       message to him in terms of the American public?        Director WRAY. Stop trying to interfere with our elections.        REPORTER. And we recently heard from the President himself       that he wanted the CrowdStrike portion of this whole       conspiracy in the Ukraine investigated, and I'm hearing you       say there's no evidence to support that as far as you know.        Director WRAY. As I said, we have no--We at the FBI have no       information that would indicate that Ukraine tried to       interfere in the 2016 presidential election.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. You heard him. He said ``no information  that would indicate that Ukraine tried to interfere in the 2016  Presidential election.''   So to be really, really clear, there is no real dispute that Russia,  not Ukraine, attacked our elections.   It is not just that there is no evidence to support his conspiracy  theory; it is more dangerous than that. Where did this theory come  from? You guessed it. The Russians--Russia. Russian President Vladimir  Putin and Russian intelligence services perpetuated this false,  debunked conspiracy theory.   Now remember, there is no dispute among the intelligence community  that Russia attacked our 2016 elections. The Senate's own Intelligence  Committee published a report telling us that as well. So it is no  surprise that Russia wants to blame somebody else.   In fact, President Trump even said that President Putin is the one  who told him it was Ukraine who interfered in our elections.   In short, this is a theory that the Russians are promoting to  interfere, yet again, in our democratic process and deflect blame from  their own attacks against us. But what is so dangerous is that  President Trump is helping them perpetuate this. Our own President is  helping our adversary attack our processes, all to help his own  reelection.   Dr. Hill, an expert on these matters, explains it in more detail as  to why this is very concerning. Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. This relates to the second thing I want to       communicate. Based on questions and statements I have heard,       some of you on the committee appear to believe that Russia       and its security services did not conduct a campaign against       our country and that perhaps somehow, for some reason,       Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that is being       perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services       themselves.        The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power       that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in       2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence       agencies, confirmed in bipartisan and congressional reports.       It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details       must remain classified.        The impact of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remains       evident today. Our nation is being torn apart. Truth is       questioned. Our highly professional, expert career Foreign       Service is being undermined. U.S. support for Ukraine which       continues to face armed Russian aggression is being       politicized. The Russian Government's goal is to weaken our       country, to diminish America's global role, and to neutralize       a perceived U.S. threat to Russian interests.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Their ``goal is to weaken our country,  to diminish America's global role, and to neutralize a perceived U.S.  threat to Russian interests.'' That is why it is so dangerous. Despite  the lack of any evidence to support this debunked conspiracy theory,  the unanimous conclusion of the intelligence community, Congress,  Special Counsel Mueller, and the FBI to the contrary, President Trump  continued to promote this fake conspiracy theory just because it would  be beneficial and helpful to his own reelection campaign.   Even President Trump's own senior advisers told him these allegations  were false. Tom Bossert, President Trump's former Homeland Security  Advisor, stated publicly that the CrowdStrike theory had been debunked.   Here is that interview. Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          New leaders, particularly countries that are       trying to have good footing in the international arena, see a       meeting with the US president in the Oval Office at the White       House as the ultimate sign of endorsement and support from       the United States.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. President Zelensky was a newly elected leader.  He was swept into office on the pledge to end pervasive corruption. He  also had a mandate to negotiate an end to the war with Russia. To  achieve both goals, he needed strong U.S. support, particularly from  President Trump, which Zelensky sought in the form of a White House  meeting.   David Holmes, political counselor to the Embassy in Kyiv, described  the particular importance of a White House visit to Ukraine in the  context of its war with Russia.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          In mid-August it became clear to me that       Giuliani's efforts to gin up politically-motivated       investigations were now infecting U.S. engagement with       Ukraine, leveraging President Zelensky's desire for a White       House meeting.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In short, U.S. diplomats responsible for  Ukraine policy understood that Giuliani had de facto control over  whether the Oval Office meeting would be scheduled and under what  circumstances. Mr. Giuliani had been given that level of authority by  President Trump, and it was infecting official U.S. policy toward  Ukraine.   To shake loose the White House meeting, top Ukrainian officials knew  that they had to meet with Mr. Giuliani, who John Bolton described as a  human hand grenade who was going to blow everybody up. So, on August 2,  Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Yermak, President Zelensky's top aide, in  Madrid--Giuliani, in Madrid, meeting with Zelensky's top aide on August  2. Mr. Giuliani made clear in that meeting that President Trump needed  more private assurances that Ukraine would pursue the investigations.  Mr. Giuliani made clear that President Trump needed a public statement.   According to Ambassador Sondland--and this is very important-- President Trump did not require that Ukraine actually conduct the  investigations in order to secure that White House meeting. The  Ukrainian Government only needed to announce the investigations because  they were phony and they were simply designed to cheat in the 2020  election, solicit foreign interference, and corrupt our democracy--to  the benefit of President Trump. So the goal was not the investigations  themselves but the corrupt political benefit President Trump would  receive as a result of these announcements. He also wanted to shake  ``this Russia thing'' and instead blame Ukraine with the fairytale that  Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. The facts didn't matter for  President Trump; he only cared about the personal political benefit of  these sought-after investigative announcements.   Over the next few weeks, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker worked with  Mr. Yermak to draft a public statement for President Zelensky to issue.  Ambassador Volker was also in frequent contact with Rudy Giuliani  regarding the content of that statement.   Now, Rudy Giuliani, of course, is not a Secretary of State. He is not  an Ambassador. He is not a member of the diplomatic corps. He was  working in the political personal interests of President Trump,  interacting with Ukrainian officials.   On August 9, Ambassador Volker texted Mr. Giuliani and requested a  call to update him on the progress of the negotiations for the  statement and discuss the content of what it should include. Volker  said that Yermak had ``mentioned Z''--President Zelensky--``making a  statement.'' He suggested that he and Mr. Giuliani ``get on the phone  to make sure I advise Zelensky correctly as to what he should be  saying.''   Later that afternoon, Ambassador Sondland suggested to Ambassador  Volker that they obtain a draft statement from the Ukrainian Government  ``to avoid misunderstandings'' or, in other words, make sure that  President Trump's political objectives were met. Ambassador Sondland  also reiterated that President Trump would not be satisfied by a vague  statement. The Ukrainian leader needed to commit to the phony  investigations in explicit terms in order to secure the sought-after  Oval Office meeting--this for that.   Call records subpoenaed by the House show multiple communications  between Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Giuliani on the one hand and  numbers associated with the Office of Management and Budget and the  White House on the other.   On August 8, around the time of direct communications between Mr.  Giuliani and Mr. Yermak, Mr. Giuliani communicated repeatedly with the  White House, sending or receiving six text messages and completing  several calls.   Most notably, late in the evening on August 8, Mr. Giuliani called  the White House in a highly distinctive pattern.   At 8:53 p.m., Giuliani texted a White House number.    At 10:09, a number identified only as ``-1'' in the White House call  records called Mr. Giuliani five times in rapid succession.   Two minutes later, Mr. Giuliani attempted to return the call, trying  an Office of Management and Budget number, then the White House  Situation Room, and then the White House switchboard.   At 10:28, 16 minutes after Mr. Giuliani tried to call the White House  back, frantically--Situation Room, Office of Management and Budget,  switchboard--16 minutes after Mr.  [[Page S516]]  Giuliani tried to call the White House back, Giuliani and the -1 number  connected for 4 minutes 6 seconds.   We should be clear. We do not know what Mr. Giuliani said or even  whom he talked to. We do not know who was on the other end of that  mysterious call with the -1. President Trump refused to produce  documents and ordered key witnesses not to testify, hiding part of the  truth from the American people. He obstructed our congressional  investigation. But we do know that Rudolph Giuliani frantically called  the White House late into the night. We do know that he talked to  someone at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and we know that Mr. Giuliani  likely talked about the drug deal that John Bolton characterized.   Over the next few days, President Zelensky's aide, Mr. Yermak,  exchanged drafts of the public statement with Ambassadors Volker and  Sondland, who consulted on these drafts with Mr. Giuliani. The  Ukrainian officials appeared to finally relent. They agreed to Mr.  Giuliani's specific language about the phony political investigations  in exchange for the Oval Office meeting.   On August 10, Yermak texted Volker that the Ukrainians were willing  to make the requested statements but only if they received a date for  the White House meeting first. Mr. Yermak texted: ``I think it's  possible to make this declaration and mention all these things.''  Yermak, again, is Zelensky's top guy. He later wrote that the statement  would come out ``after we `receive a confirmation of date ' for the  White House visit.   Ambassador Volker counterproposed: They would iron out the statement  in private, use that to get the date for the meeting in the Oval  Office, and then President Zelensky would make the public statement-- this for that.   Mr. Yermak countered: ``Once we have a date, will call for a press  briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot  of the US-UKRAINE relationship, including, among other things, Burisma  and election meddling in investigations.'' That was the specific  reference to President Trump's corrupt demands.   Two days later, Mr. Yermak sent the draft statement, but the  statement did not reference Burisma or the 2016 election. As soon as  Mr. Yermak sent the statement, what did Ambassadors Sondland and Volker  do? They sought a call with Rudolph Giuliani to see if the statement  would suffice. They needed to check in with Mr. Giuliani, who was  leading the charge to lock down the corrupt quid pro quo.   Let's listen to Ambassador Volker.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador VOLKER. This is the first draft of that from Mr.       Yermak after the conversations that we had.
