 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, as the Senate reconvenes this  afternoon, I am especially happy to welcome back our President pro  tempore. Senator Grassley quarantined and worked from home following  his positive COVID test 2 weeks ago. We all predicted that if any  Member of this body had the stamina and spirit to kick the virus to the  curb, it would certainly be him, and, sure enough, our colleague  reports that he experienced no symptoms. His doctors have cleared him  to come back to work, and we are sure glad to have him back.   Chairman Grassley had to put his epic streak of consecutive votes  temporarily on hold for the sake of other people. Of course, leadership  and example-setting are nothing new for the senior Senator from Iowa. I  am confident our colleague will pick up exactly where he left off,  resuming both his perfect attendance record and the tireless work for  Iowans that it represents. We all benefit so very much from his  leadership.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate is back in session to finish  up 2020. The American people are counting on us to finish strong. We  need to reach agreement on Federal Government funding to avoid a lapse  in basic programs and services.   We need to finish the annual Defense authorization to shore up the  U.S. military's competitive advantage over our adversaries, and we need  to continue processing well-qualified nominees for vacancies throughout  the government, especially--especially--on the Federal bench.   These are important assignments, but they aren't the only things that  Congress should get done before the end of the year. There is no  reason--none--why we should not deliver another major pandemic relief  package to help the American people through what seem poised to be the  last chapters of this battle   This morning, we got yet another major sign of hope. More data  appeared to confirm that the vaccine developed  [[Page S7098]]  by Moderna is more than 94 percent effective. They are going ahead and  asking the FDA for emergency use authorization. Experts are calling  this news ``absolutely remarkable.'' Alongside other promising vaccine  developments from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and others,  there is continued cause to suspect that victory over this pandemic is  not far off.   But a huge amount of work remains before us. If Operation Warp Speed  remains on this historic trajectory, we need to continue investing in  the system that will distribute these vaccines around our country. If  we want the small businesses that have already hung on for most of the  year to survive a few more months, we need a second round of the job- saving Paycheck Protection Program for the workers at the hardest hit  establishments. Some major parts of the historic CARES Act have already  run dry, and many others are set to expire at year's end.   We Republicans have spent months trying to renew important help and  provide even more. We have tried to send more than $100 billion to help  schools and welcome students and teachers safely to the classroom. We  have tried to implement commonsense legal protections that universities  and charities have been clamoring for. We have tried to pass all of  this over and over again, but Speaker Pelosi and the Senate Democratic  leader have blocked it.   They have been very transparent about all of this with their  political strategy--laid it right out there. The Speaker of the House  spent the entire summer and the entire autumn literally gambling with  the health and welfare of the American people. She gambled that if  American families didn't get any more relief before the election, her  party would expand its majority in the House, and Democrats could  continue demanding the right to remake all of society along far-left  lines in exchange for passing any more COVID relief whatsoever.   But their all-or-nothing obstruction backfired. Democrats did not  pick up seats in the House but instead appear to have lost seats. They  have not gained any leverage, but instead they have lost leverage. And  in the meantime, with the coronavirus surging from coast to coast, the  American people have gone entirely--entirely--without any additional  aid--even the least controversial, most bipartisan programs--because  the Democrats say no.   Here is a summary from one news outlet:         Pelosi seems to have overplayed her hand as she held out       for $2 trillion-plus right up until the election. The results       of the election, which saw Democrats lose seats in the House,       appear to have significantly undercut her position.    By now it is abundantly clear to everyone that the Speaker will not  be getting to fundamentally transform American society in a socialist  direction in exchange for more bipartisan relief. The hostage-taking  was never going to work.   Now there is only one remaining question for the Speaker and the  Democratic leader--just one question: Will they finally--finally--let  Congress pass hundreds of billions of dollars of relief on all the  subjects where we agree? Or will they continue to insist that either  they get their entire ideological wish list or the American people get  nothing at all?   Even their fellow Democrats are increasingly seeing this as not a  terribly difficult question to answer. For example, over the weekend,  Professor Austan Goolsbee, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers  under President Obama, called on Democrats to finally play ball. Here  is what he said:         There are a lot of people really hurting. . . . I hope       [Congress] can agree on something soon. . . . [I]f they have       to accept half a loaf, then they have to accept half a loaf.    Speaker Pelosi's No. 2, the House Democratic majority leader, feels  the same way:         I just hope that we can get agreement. It may not be       everything that everybody wants, but at least. . . . some       significant relief to people.    Our distinguished Senate colleague from Illinois, the Democratic  whip, said the same thing: ``[G]et something done that is significant,  do what we can achieve now.''   Here is the headline from Newsweek: ``Democrats Urge Pelosi to Accept  Smaller Stimulus Package to Ensure Relief by End of Year.''   Even the Speaker's own House Democratic Members are now openly  campaigning for our Republican approach. Here is one Democratic  Congressman, who nearly lost his reelection after Speaker Pelosi's  stonewalling:         We absolutely have to get something done. . . . Mitch       McConnell is talking about a bill we can pass. . . . We       should negotiate that to the finish.    That is a House Democrat saying that the Senate Republican proposal  is the template that can pass.   Rank-and-file Democrats in both Chambers are telling Speaker Pelosi  and the Democratic leader to stop stonewalling and move forward with  the approach Republicans have been urging for months. The American  people need more help, and they need it right now--right now.  Democratic leaders have already burned through 3 months--3 months--and  they didn't even get the political results that their cynical strategy  was supposed to deliver.   So let's hope our colleagues at the top of the Democratic Party can  finally hear their own Members and stop blocking the commonsense,  multihundred-billion-dollar measures that Republicans have been ready  to deliver for months.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 761.
