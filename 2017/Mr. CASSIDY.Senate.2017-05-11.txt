 Mr. President, before us as the Senate right now, aside  from issues Mr. Blumenthal referred to, is the repeal and replacement  of the Affordable Care Act.   I am a physician, and I have been practicing in hospitals for the  uninsured for the last 25 years. I would like to in one sense say that  gives me special standing to speak about this issue, but in reality, it  does not.   Senator Moran from Kansas spoke up the other day at our lunch. He  said that healthcare is like no other issue. He spoke of a friend of  his approaching him at church with tears rolling down her face. Her  mother had a preexisting condition, and she was so concerned that we  get this right.   I don't need to say I have special standing, being a physician. We  all have special standing from living, having families and friends  who--sooner or later, healthcare will affect the family.   The Affordable Care Act for many is not working. Premiums are going  sky high.   Two or 3 days ago, I had communication with someone from San  Francisco. Her young family has a $20,000-a-year premium, a $6,000  deductible for each member of the family--in San Francisco, already  paying so much for housing, food, and transportation, and $20,000 on  top of that for a family of relatively modest income.   Then I spoke to someone in Washington, DC. His family's premium is  $24,000; they have a $13,000 deductible. He said: I am out $37,000  before my insurance kicks in. I reassured him that his colonoscopy  would be for free. I don't think he thought that funny.   Then a friend of mine who last year in Louisiana--his quote for a  policy for himself and his wife, 60 and 61, was $39,000 for 1 year-- $39,000 for 1 year--with a deductible.   Now we are being told there will be premium increases this coming  year. In Connecticut, they just announced they are going to be 15 to 35  percent higher. In my own State, I have been told they may approach 30  to 40 percent higher, although that is not definite.   The reality is that premiums have become unaffordable. President  Trump campaigned on this. There were four things he told the American  people. He said he wanted to cover all, care for those with preexisting  conditions, eliminate the Affordable Care Act mandates that people hate  so much, and lower premiums.   I would like to say I think it is part of President Trump's intuitive  genius. Whatever you say about the fellow, he certainly has an  intuition sometimes about how things work. Of course, the way you would  lower premiums is that you would cover all, and by covering all, you  expand the risk pool, which then lowers premiums for those with  preexisting conditions but keeps them lower for the rest of us.   Folks ask how you can do that without mandates, and I say you can do  it through the mechanism of the Cassidy-Collins plan, the Patient  Freedom Act, which is to say you have an auto-enrollment feature.   By the way, here is President Trump. He said it many times, but here  he is in the Washington Post on January 15, 2017, just before he takes  the oath of office:         ``We're going to have insurance for everybody,'' Trump       said. ``There was a philosophy in some circles that if you       can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to       happen with us.''    You cannot have a stronger statement from a fellow who is about to  rise to be inaugurated and gives a speech in which he speaks  passionately about the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. President  Trump pledged to remember them.   The question is, How do you lower premiums? How do you fulfill  President Trump's goals?   There are several ways to lower premiums. I just described one, where  you fulfill the other parts of his contract with the voter, which is  you cover all, and by doing so, you increase the size of the risk pool,  and therefore you lower premiums. There is another mechanism. You can  put in price transparency and do other things to lower the cost of  medical care, which in turn lowers the cost of healthcare premiums. But  there is one way which is not so good. One way that you can lower cost  is to have a crummy policy that hardly covers anything. You think you  are getting a deal in the front end because premiums are low, and then  you or someone in your family gets sick, and it is not such a great  deal after all.   I was asked about this on a Sunday morning show and spontaneously  came up with something called the Kimmel test. Jimmy Kimmel, the late- night comedian, spoke of his son being born. We can all imagine--this  happened 2 weeks ago--his child was born. I suspect somebody is  videoing it. It is going to be a moment of celebration. As the child  emerges and everybody wants to lean forward and hand the child to the  mother and the father to hold and cuddle, instead, the doctor and the  nurse notice that the child is blue--``blue'' meaning he is not getting  enough oxygen. It is quickly realized that something is profoundly  wrong. Instead of mother and father hugging and bonding with the child,  they are pushed to the side. They hear a code blue call, which means  this child will die if something is not done immediately.   I was not there, but I have been in similar situations.   They are being asked to sign forms which would allow this child-- their child whom they have not yet held--to be transported by  helicopter across Los Angeles to have emergency surgery that day and  being told that if they do not sign this form, that child will die.   Now, Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that he is a millionaire, he could  afford it, but he also pointed out: Others, not so much.   I think that brings us back to what President Trump said. President  Trump said:         ``We're going to have insurance for everybody. There was a       philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you       don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.''    The Jimmy Kimmel test: We will protect those with preexisting  conditions, but we will do it by lowering premiums and not by giving  crummy coverage but, rather, by having adequate coverage. So if our  approach passes the Kimmel test, then we feel it is a way to go.  [[Page S2909]]    Now, how do we go from here?   We can recognize that premiums are too high for middle-class  families. They can no longer afford it, and that is before the premium  increases, which are about to occur.   I will also say that as to the way the Affordable Care Act was  passed--not blaming or praising anyone--that only one party was engaged  is not the path forward. History says that any time there is  significant social legislation that has an enduring effect in the  United States, both parties engage.   I want this to change. I would challenge my Democratic colleagues to  become engaged. Some have said: Oh, my gosh, Republicans are doing this  through reconciliation; isn't that terrible?   I would say it presents opportunity. We don't need 12 Democrats; we  don't need 8 Democrats. We could have three Democrats or four  Democrats. Anyone who cares enough about the people in their State and  their premiums, which are rising 20 to 40 percent a year, will put  aside all the pressure from a political base and say: The people of my  State are more important than the political pressure I may feel. They  will step forward to influence the final product.   We know that if folks come in from the other side of the aisle, we  will have a different product than if it is only among Republicans. If  Republicans had participated in the passage of the Affordable Care Act,  we would have had something perhaps a little different than the  Affordable Care Act.   I am not pointing fingers. I am just observing that it would only  take three or four Democrats to break ranks, to step across the aisle,  and to ask for what they would need. This is not: You come to us, and  you don't get it--no. We have a meeting of the minds so that we can  come to the policy that fulfills President Trump's pledge--his pledge  to cover all, caring for those with preexisting conditions, eliminating  mandates, and lowering premiums.   We have an incredible opportunity before us to bring relief to those  middle-class couples struggling with premiums that they can no longer  afford and deductibles that they will never meet. If they don't meet  and can't afford them and if they do not purchase the insurance, they  are being fined and are accumulating resentment toward Washington  because they are stuck with this. We can address that issue and at the  same time fulfill President Trump's pledge that all will have coverage.   Some said you can't get it if you can't pay, but that is not going to  be the case with us. It will provide them that coverage with something  that passes the Kimmel test. I look forward to working with our Senate  to come to this solution.   I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.
