 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1085,  awarding three Congressional Gold Medals to the law enforcement  agencies and officers who protected the Capitol during the armed  assault on January 6, 2021.   The bravery displayed by the U.S. Capitol Police, Metropolitan Police  Department, and other responding agencies helped save countless lives  that day. Two heroes who were there that day were my constituents, and  ultimately they lost their lives as a result of the attack.   United States Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick died from the  physical injuries he sustained while engaging with the attackers on  January 6. His face was drenched at close range by bear spray.   Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, who responded to the  attack at the Capitol from Georgetown, who was dragged into the mob and  beaten, died by suicide just a few days later. His death reminds us  that not all wounds sustained that day were visible. The invisible  damage to those who engaged with the insurrectionists is very real and  may last a lifetime.   I mourn both of their losses deeply. We must ensure that we honor the  sacrifices they and others made.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to award the  gold medals to the U.S. Capitol and Metropolitan Police Departments and  to honor the courage shown by those who protected us on January 6.
