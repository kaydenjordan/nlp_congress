 Mr. President, it is not often I come down to the floor  to say I have a lot in common with the Senate majority leader, Senator  Schumer from New York. In fact, in my 6 years in the Senate, I don't  think I have ever done that.   But after reading his remarks prior to the vote that we took  yesterday on the Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh, I thought I would  come down and make a few points on that nominee, that vote, and some  issues I have in common with the majority leader and now-Secretary  Walsh and maybe some issues I don't have so much in common with the  majority leader but I think I do have with Secretary Walsh, which is  why I voted for him.   First, as I mentioned, I, too, supported our now-Secretary of Labor,  Marty Walsh, for some of the reasons that Senator Schumer did. Let me  explain. Secretary Walsh started in the Laborers' Union, Local 223, in  Boston, age 21, following in his father's footsteps. Now, as many  people know, the Laborers are the biggest building construction union  in the country. They build things--pipelines, roads, oil wells,  bridges. They have made America strong. I am a big fan of Laborers and  leaders like Joey Merritt back home and Terry O'Sullivan, whom I am  going to talk a little bit about.   Secretary Walsh followed his father's example and joined the Laborers  in  [[Page S1718]]  Boston. He is also the son of Irish immigrants, which is something that  is near and dear to my heart. And Senator Schumer said he has something  very much in common--yesterday, when he spoke about Secretary Walsh-- with Secretary Walsh because his grandfather was an immigrant from  Eastern Europe who also, when he came over to America, got very  involved with the labor movement. That is really a very common,  powerful story of the American dream, common to millions--Senator  Schumer's family, Secretary Walsh's family, and it is certainly a story  that I have in common with those two.   You see, my great-grandfather was from a family of Irish immigrants,  and he was also very involved in the labor movement. In fact, he was  one of the original cofounders of the International Brotherhood of  Electrical Workers, the IBEW. He was its first grand marshal.   I have something I am quite proud of here. It is a page from the  history books of the IBEW, talking about my great-grandfather's great  work for the IBEW when it first got off the ground.   I look forward to working with Secretary Walsh on helping the men and  women in America, certainly in my State, who build things. They have  succeeded. They rise up and help others rise up--other working men and  women--the way Secretary Walsh's father did, the way Senator Schumer's  grandfather did, the way my great-grandfather did. It is a great  American story.   But I must say that my views and Senator Schumer's diverge on some of  the other things he may have been speaking about when he talked about  Secretary Walsh's nomination yesterday.   One, he was critical of some of the Trump administration's Department  of Labor policies as related to the men and women who build things-- these working men and women--despite the fact that prior to the  pandemic, with some of the policies that we implemented here, the  United States had the strongest economy in decades, the lowest  unemployment rate in 50 years, wages were finally going up after 2  decades of stagnation. And very importantly for the working men and  women of this country, there was a huge expansion and boom in the  American energy sector, ``all of the above'' energy: oil, gas,  renewables, as important to the Presiding Officer as it is to Alaska.   Let me describe one other narrative that I believe certainly is true  that I have seen in my professional life in Alaska--in America but  certainly back home in my State--and that is the narrative that I am  not so sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to  highlight. But I am going to highlight it because I think it is really  important, particularly now, and it is this: When national Democrats,  whether during the Obama administration or now, during the Biden  administration, are set up with the choice where they have to choose  between the interests of the working men and women in this country who  build things versus the interests of the extremists--radical  environmental groups who want to kill jobs and shut them down--they  almost always sid with these groups who kill jobs, not the working men  and women of America, not the working men and women of Alaska.    This is true. My colleagues sometimes don't want to admit it, but it  is true. Do you know who else has seen it, and do you know who else I  believe knows it is true? Secretary Walsh as a laborer. He has seen it.  That is another reason why I voted for him.   He and his fellow laborers, whether in Boston or Alaska, also know  that this issue is true. When there is a choice between the working men  and women of America who build things versus the extremists who want to  shut things down, way too often, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle go with the extremists, not the men and women who build things in  this country.   Now, this narrative is not only continuing under the Biden  administration; it is accelerating, and it has been bad for Alaska, bad  for America, bad for working families, and, to be honest, it is a bit  surprising. President Biden came into office talking about his blue  collar roots, but right now, the record is anything but supporting the  men and women who build things.   Here is a snapshot of what is going on in my State. In the first 4  weeks of the Biden administration, there were eight Executive orders  focused on Alaska--eight. No other State has had that many Executive  orders focused on Alaskan working families.   Day one, ANWR--trying to shut that down. We got that done in this  body. They also killed the Keystone Pipeline--10,000 jobs, laborers'  jobs. Marty Walsh knows a lot about that. It goes on and on and on.  There are Executive orders right now that, from my State's perspective,  are focused on hurting working men and women.   There is another one I will talk about. It is a project we have, a  big energy project in Alaska called the Willow project. This has been  permitted by Democratic and Republican administrations for 25 years to  finally get it going--the Clinton administration, the Obama  administration, the Trump administration, everybody. It is in the  National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska, a place set aside by Congress  over 70 years ago for oil and gas development and good jobs. It is not  controversial at all. The Biden administration has put a hold on that.  Here is the estimate. It is a $7 billion project that will produce  American energy and an estimated 2,000 direct jobs on the Willow  project. This isn't some pie-in-the-sky project that we were starting  this winter. There were 2,000 direct jobs, 75 percent of which are  union jobs, and they are saying ``We are going to put a hold on it''-- thousands of additional supporting jobs, and they are going to put a  hold on that. Why? Well, we know why, because in the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals, some of the most extreme radical environmental groups  in the country sued to stop it, and they were successful.   So guess what happened in Alaska this winter during a recession. The  2,000 men and women who were working on this project were given pink  slips and told to go home. That is what happened.   Mr. President, don't just take my word for it. I want to quote again  from Terry O'Sullivan. He is the head of the Laborers, the biggest  construction union in the country. This was his reaction after day one  of the Biden administration, where there was a choice of working men  and women who build things like pipelines or the radical extremist  environmental groups who want to shut down and kill American jobs. It  is a choice--day one, the radical environmentalists win.   Here is what the head of the Laborers--remember, Marty Walsh,  Secretary Walsh is a Laborer from Boston. Here is what the head of the  Laborers, the great American Terry O'Sullivan, said:         The Biden administration's decision to cancel the Keystone       XL pipeline permit on day one of his presidency is both       insulting and disappointing to the thousands of hard-working       LIUNA members--    Those are the Laborers.       --who will lose good-paying, middle class family-supporting       jobs.        By blocking this 100 percent union project, and pandering       to environmental extremists--    Remember, this is Terry O'Sullivan talking, not Senator Sullivan  talking.       --a thousand union jobs will immediately vanish and 10,000       additional jobs will be foregone.    That is Terry O'Sullivan. Remember the choice: Men and women who  build things and make our country great versus extremist groups like  the Center for Biological Diversity--they go with the extremists.   Here is Mark McManus, general president of the United Association of  Union Plumbers and Pipefitters. They were going to build the Keystone  Pipeline, too, just like LIUNA members:         In revoking this permit, the Biden Administration has       chosen to listen to the voices of fringe activists instead of       union members and the American consumer on Day 1 [of the       Biden administration]. Let me be . . . clear.    This is Mark McManus still talking.         When built with union labor by the men and women of the       United Association, pipelines like Keystone XL remain the       safest and most efficient modes of energy transportation in       the world. Sadly, the Biden Administration has now put       thousands of union members and workers out of work.    This is why the Secretary of Labor we just confirmed--and I was glad  to support him because he is a Laborer. He knows how to build things.  He knows these politics. This is why it is important to have his voice  because  [[Page S1719]]  the voice of the extremist is much stronger in this administration. It  is not just policies of killing union jobs--the men and women who build  things for America--but if you listen, it is how the new members of  this administration talk about these jobs. Listen. You have to listen,  and what you hear is a condescending tone as it relates to these jobs.  You may have heard John Kerry and Gina McCarthy, the climate change  czars in the White House, who were saying in one of their press  conferences that we need to help people make ``better choices'' on  their jobs. That is pretty condescending. They are talking about  laborers. They are talking about my oil and gas workers in the great  State of Alaska or in Colorado.   The Secretary of Energy, in her confirmation hearing, talked about  how some of the jobs might have to be ``sacrificed.''   Even in the Environment and Public Works Committee--and I am a very  bipartisan guy--some of my Senate colleagues on the other side of the  aisle were recently talking about: We need to encourage people to get  more ``relevant jobs.''   What is more relevant than powering America?   Until recently, the men and women who built America--pipelines, oil  and gas rigs, roads, bridges, the men and women with dirt under their  fingernails--were celebrated, which is as they should be. They built  this country. They powered this country. They won wars for this  country. By the way, they often fought in wars for this country. Then  they came home. They got good jobs in the building trades as laborers,  operating engineers, pipefitters, teamsters, IBEWs--the IBEW like my  great-grandfather helped start. Not so much anymore.   The new Secretary of Energy is now calling them ``fossil workers''  who are from ``fossil communities.'' I am not kidding. Listen to her. I  have been trying to give them a little bit of advice: Don't use that  term. It is condescending. You are talking to workers as if they are  some kind of dinosaur that should be put in a museum. Communities?  Fossil communities? Really?   Madam Secretary, if you are listening, ditch that language. It drips  with an attitude of being condescending toward these great Americans.   Well, I was just home in my State with a bunch of these so-called  ``fossil workers'' this past weekend. These are some of the best, most  patriotic Americans anywhere. They are tough; they are hard-working;  they love their country, but I will tell you they are concerned. They  are concerned. Why? Because they know that exactly what I have been  talking about here is happening--the radical, extremist environmental  groups want to kill and are killing jobs.   By the way, as for that lawsuit I talked about on the Willow Project,  200 Alaskans were sent home during a recession. Men and women who have  to pay mortgages and pay tuitions were sent home.   So my workers in the great State of Alaska are concerned. They know  that these groups they are sending have a beeline into the White House  and that they want to kill jobs--energy jobs--in my State and in  America. They are worried that the majority now, the Senate majority,  has similar views, so they are nervous.   Yet I am hopeful on one thing. Given his background and his  heritage--now I am talking about the Secretary of Labor, Secretary  Walsh.   I believe that, when the decisions are made--and I hope when the  decisions are being made in the Biden administration to kill more good- paying energy jobs that built this country--and when they are coming  before the Biden administration, the new Secretary of Labor is going to  stand up for the working men and women, stand up for the laborers in  Boston whom he knows so well or the laborers in Alaska whom he knows so  well and look at the other Cabinet members and say: Not on my watch. We  are not going to kill any more of these jobs.   That is what I am hopeful for. That is what he committed to me to do,  and that is why I voted for Secretary Walsh as the new Secretary of  Labor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have one more topic I would like to  talk about today. It is another important one, and it is one that many  have been talking about here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Many have  spoken very eloquently about this topic, and depending on when they  have spoken about it--this year, this week, last year, a decade ago, a  century ago--it is a topic that is really fundamental to this  institution, and it looks as if Members in this institution are trying  to change the institution forever. Now, I am talking about the  filibuster.   As you know, there has been much talk recently about the possibility  of getting rid of the filibuster. This is an action that will  fundamentally transform this institution, certainly, but I believe,  frankly, it will transform our country. I don't think this is a wise  move at all. The irony is--and I am going to talk about it--until very  recently, the vast majority of my colleagues, Republican and  Democratic, were in agreement on this topic in that getting rid of the  legislative filibuster was not a wise move for the Senate and not a  wise move for America.   Now, this might seem like an insular issue--something that people in  Washington, DC, get incensed about, wound up about, and the people back  home might not necessarily care because it might not impact them--but I  don't think that this is the case at all. This rule, the filibuster, is  at the very heart of what keeps extreme legislation, pushed by a small  minority of the public, from passing. It is a rule that, in the Senate,  certainly encourages, if not demands, compromise and bipartisan work  both when one's party is in or out of power.   Now, look, our instincts as Senators--all of our instincts--are to  get things done for our States, for our country, but what is good for  Alaska isn't always good for Colorado, and what is good for Colorado  isn't always good for New York. What is good for the majority isn't  alway good for the minority and vice versa and isn't always good for  the Nation. That is the heart of federalism. It is also why the  majority can't wield unfettered power in the U.S. Senate. With the  exception of a few laws, what is required here is typically 60 votes on  legislation. It is what separates this body, the Senate, from the  House.    For the good of the country, if you look at our history, we must work  together, find compromise, find consensus, find solutions, particularly  on major legislation, to get a broad-based buy-in from all Americans or  most Americans. This is what the filibuster has required.   Remember, the Framers understood that, here in the Senate, we would  be different from the House. We would be the bulwark against what James  Madison called an anchor, a necessary fence, against the fickleness and  passions that pervade the House. No offense to our Members of the House  of Representatives, but as George Washington is said to have told  Thomas Jefferson, the Framers created the Senate to cool House  legislation. It was the cooling saucer you had with regard to the tea  in the cup.   Indeed, the Senate--often referred to as the ``world's greatest  deliberative body'' in its earliest days--was founded on the right of  unlimited debate. That is what the filibuster is. Even in the first  session of the Senate in 1789, Senators used this right to debate and  debate and debate in order to delay consideration of legislation. It  wasn't until the mid-1800s that this tactic was coined the  ``filibuster.''   The point is that this procedural rule in the Senate has been here,  in one form or another, since the founding of the Republic, and when  you hear my colleagues talk about it as some new, recent procedure, it  is just not factually accurate. Before the 1900s, there was no formal  procedure to even end debate if a Senator chose to talk a bill to  death. It wasn't until 1917, during a debate about arming Merchant  Marine vessels during World War I, that the Senate established the  cloture tool, giving the body the ability to end debate by a certain  margin of Senators.   Now, as some of my colleagues have been debating recently and have  mentioned throughout its history, we have seen the filibuster, cloture  used for good. We have used it to stop legislation, and it has also  been used for ill--to delay much needed, historic reforms like civil  rights legislation during the  [[Page S1720]]  fifties and sixties, legislation which was filibustered by Democratic  Senators until the filibuster was finally broken in the sixties. It has  also been used for many other purposes, but Members on both sides have  used it for centuries. In fact, one scholar's account was that the very  first Senate filibuster was over a bridge across the Potomac River. I  am not sure why, but I guess it was an important issue back then.   So slowing things down, cooling passions, that is what this body was  designed to do, and that is what this procedure has done for decades.  That is why my friends on the other side, who are undertaking a push to  get rid of this, need to think. They need to stop. They need to think.  The American people need to understand the consequences, and our good  friends in the media who are covering the Senate need to write some  real history about this.   As my friends on the other side of the aisle know, this is one of  these issues that, when the shoe was on the other foot, we did not take  action. What am I talking about? Recently, the Republicans held the  majority in the Senate, and, recently, with President Trump, we had a  Republican in the White House. There was frustration, and they wanted  to move things quicker, and the President, President Trump, was  pressuring many Senators: Let's get rid of the filibuster. We didn't.  We didn't. We told the President: It is not a good idea for the Senate,  and it is not a good idea for the country.   That is what we did when the shoe was on the other foot. We said no.  It is not good for this body, and it is not good for the country. The  Republican President was pushing: We need to get things done. We need  to get rid of it. No.   Let me just read a few of the things that were said recently about  the necessity of keeping the filibuster.   My friend from Delaware, in 2018, said:         I am committed to never voting to change the legislative       filibuster.    Now, he said that when a Republican President was in the White House.   My friend from New Jersey, in 2009, said:         My colleagues and I--everybody I have talked to--believes       the legislative filibuster should stay here, and I will       personally resist any efforts to get rid of it.    My Democratic friend from Montana said just a little over a year ago:         I am a ``no'' on changing the filibuster. The move to make       the Senate like the House, I think, is a mistake.    I could go on.         I don't want the Senate to become like the House. The       consequences of getting rid of the filibuster are too great.    These are all words spoken very recently by my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle.   Even more impressive, just a few years ago, we had 61 Senators--33  Republicans, 25 of whom are still here, and 30 Democrats, 27 of whom  are still in the Senate today--who sent a letter. I have it right here.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter  sent to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democratic  leader, Senator Schumer, saying we have to maintain the 60-vote  threshold for filibusters involving legislation.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                           United States Senate,                                      Washington, DC, April 7, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader       Schumer: We are writing to urge you to support our efforts to       preserve existing rules, practices, and traditions as they       pertain to the right of Members to engage in extended debate       on legislation before the United States Senate. Senators have       expressed a variety of opinions about the appropriateness of       limiting debate when we are considering judicial and       executive branch nominations. Regardless of our past       disagreements on that issue, we are united in our       determination to preserve the ability of Members to engage in       extended debate when bills are on the Senate floor.        We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the       legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to       ensuring that this great American institution continues to       serve as the world's greatest deliberative body. Therefore,       we are asking you to join us in opposing any effort to       curtail the existing rights and prerogatives of Senators to       engage in full, robust, and extended debate as we consider       legislation before this body in the future.            Sincerely,        Susan M. Collins, Christopher A. Coons, Orrin Hatch, Joe       Manchin III, Claire McCaskill, John McCain, Lisa Murkowski,       Patrick J. Leahy, Roger F. Wicker, Lindsey Graham, Luther       Strange, Richard Burr, Angus S. King, Jr., Mark R. Warner,       Michael F. Bennet, Jerry Moran, Amy Klobuchar, Roy Blunt,       Robert P.

Now, what  was going on in April 2017? Republicans had the majority, and President  Trump was pressuring us to get rid of the filibuster. We said no.   This is what the letter said:         Regardless of our past disagreements on that issue, we are       united--    Remember, 61 Senators, 27 Democratic Senators, who are still here,  just 3 years ago said this--       we are united in our determination to preserve the ability of       Members to engage in extended debate when bills are on the       Senate floor.        We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the       legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to       ensuring this great American institution--    The U.S. Senate--       continues to serve as the world's greatest deliberative body.       Therefore, we are asking you to join us in opposing any       effort to curtail the existing rights and prerogatives of       Senators to engage in full, robust, and extended debate as we       consider legislation before this body in the future.    That is the letter. Twenty-seven of my Democratic friends said  ``Don't get rid of the filibuster'' 3 years ago. Where are they now?   Why is it that when this topic comes up, Senators Manchin and Sinema  are the only ones the media focuses on? How come they are not asking  the questions of the other 25--one-quarter of the entire body--who  wrote this letter? What happened? Where is their conviction?   When the shoe was on the other foot, we said we are not doing it, but  they now want to do it. Nobody is asking them. I think the media should  take a look at every Senator who signed this letter 3 years ago and  say: Hey. Why did you change your opinion so quickly? Three years ago,  you were adamantly against the filibuster, getting rid of it. What  happened? Could it be that you now have power and you--but we didn't do  that when we had the power, when we had the White House.   It is a really important question. Actually, it is so important, I  would welcome any of my colleagues who signed the letter, Democrat or  Republican, to come on down and explain to your constituents, explain  to the American people why you switched so quickly and what you think  it is going to do to the structure of the U.S. Senate and literally to  our country.   What strikes many of us is how, on so many issues, people change  their side--it happens on both sides--when people are holding power  from different perspectives.   Let me provide another example that even hits our media friends. In  2004, when George W. Bush was President and Republicans had the  majority, they were evidently considering getting rid of the  filibuster, and they didn't.   The New York Times wrote the following:         The Republicans see the filibuster as an annoying obstacle,       but it is actually one of the checks and balances that the       founders, who worried greatly about the concentration of       power, built into our system.    It is the New York Times saying the Founders built the filibuster  into our system.         People who call themselves conservatives should find a way       of achieving their goals without declaring war on one of the       oldest traditions in American democracy.    The filibuster. That is the New York Times. So Republicans heeded the  advice of the New York Times. It doesn't happen a lot, but it did.  [[Page S1721]]    So let's see where the New York Times was on this one just about a  month ago.         The filibuster is a centuries-old parliamentary tool that       has been transformed into a weapon for strangling functional       government. The filibuster must go.    Well, so much for the New York Times's convictions. I wonder why they  are changing their tune. I wonder why they are changing their tune.  Probably the same reason that some of my Democratic colleagues are  changing their tune after signing this letter.   So I will end with one final quote. This is from a politician we all  know well, all very familiar with him. It is from a speech on the  Senate floor by U.S. Senator--in 2005, U.S. Senator Barack Obama. He  spoke about how the American people expect their politicians to work to  create a more perfect union.         What they do not expect is for one party, be it Republican       or Democrat--    This is former Senator, former President Obama speaking right here on  the floor--       to change the rules in the middle of the game so that they       can make all the decisions while the other party is told to       sit down and keep quiet.    Sounds a little bit like what is going on with this filibuster  debate.         I understand that Republicans are getting a lot of pressure       to do this--    ``This'' meaning get rid of the filibuster--       from factions outside the [Senate] Chamber, but we need to       rise above the ``ends justify the means'' mentality because       we are here to answer the people--all of the people, not just       the ones who are wearing our particular party label.    That was Senator Obama--former Senator Obama, former President Obama  saying in 2005: Don't do it, Republicans. You have the power. You have  the Presidency. You have the Senate. Don't get rid of the filibuster.   Well, I couldn't agree more with our former President. Again, when we  had the ability to do this just 3 years ago, we said no.   I hope our friends in the media will write about this. Don't hold  your breath. But here is one instance when the shoe was on the other  foot. Because it was so important to America, so important to this  institution, we declined to make the power move.   It would be really good--whether it is President Obama, who has  spoken out about this now; or the New York Times, who has changed their  tune; or all 25 of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who  signed this letter 3 years ago saying ``Don't do it''--come on down,  speak to the American people. Tell them why you have had such a drastic  change of heart.   But I will tell you this: If we do do it, you are going to regret it;  we are going to regret it; the American people are going to regret it.  And do you know what? In my discussions with some of my Democratic  colleagues, and I am not going to name names, they know that. They know  that. They are getting a lot of pressure. Majority Leader Schumer is  getting a lot of pressure from the far left.   Don't let the far left ruin this institution. Don't let the far left  bludgeon you guys into changing America, because I think deep down in  your heart of hearts, especially all of you who signed this letter 3  years ago know what the right thing to do for the U.S. Senate is and  the right thing to do for the United States of America is, and it is to  continue to keep what the Founding Fathers devised for this body.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
