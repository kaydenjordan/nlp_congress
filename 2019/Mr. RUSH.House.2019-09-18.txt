 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the scourge of mass  shootings currently plaguing my community and other communities around  the Nation.   The Gun Violence Archive, Mr. Speaker, which is a not-for-profit  corporation that tracks and disseminates information on mass shootings,  defines mass shootings as incidents where four or more people are  injured or killed as a result of gunfire. Using this metric, Mr.  Speaker, there have been 33 mass shootings in my district in the past 5  years, and eight so far this year--33 mass shootings in my district in  the past 5 years and eight so far this very year.   Mr. Speaker, our national consciousness has been shocked by the  tragedies in Ohio and Texas, as it should very well be, but we seem  increasingly numb to the everyday violence taking place in cities like  Chicago and Baltimore and other places throughout the Nation,  especially when that violence impacts people of color.   Mr. Speaker, clearly, the events that took place in Dayton, El Paso,  and Odessa deserve our most serious and intense attention. These are  despicable acts carried out by despicable actors. I only wish, Mr.  Speaker, that every single mass shooting in our Nation received the  same intense and undivided attention.   There are men, women, and children being murdered and maimed on an  almost daily basis across our Nation. Their names, Mr. Speaker, are  easily forgotten and not remembered. Their stories will not be read  aloud on the national news. Their families' pain will continue to be  ignored.   There are many slow-moving massacres taking place in districts like  mine that, unfortunately, do not receive the same widespread attention  because the violence is occurring in poorer, minority communities where  it is sadly seen as commonplace or par for the course: They deserve to  be victims. They deserve to be mass murdered. They deserve to be killed  by gunfire. They have earned that. That is how they live. They are  subhuman.   Mr. Speaker, as you and I know, this is unacceptable at its core.  Throughout my tenure in this Congress, I have introduced and  reintroduced legislation that will help reduce the mass shootings  taking place today, yesterday, and days gone by in my district and  beyond.                                time  1015    In 2007, I first introduced the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing and  Record of Sale Act. I have reintroduced this bill in every Congress  since; and in 2019, it is more necessary than ever, as it would forbid  unlicensed firearm ownership, prohibit the transfer of firearms without  a valid license, and require universal background checks.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, this body has passed two important  background check bills that have been passed out of this House, and I  was the proud cosponsor of each of these bills. They now, sad to say,  are sitting collecting dust over on the Senate side.                            ____________________
