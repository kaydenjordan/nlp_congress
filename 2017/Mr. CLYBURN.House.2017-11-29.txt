 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 630,  which would require each Member, officer and employee of the House to  complete anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training. Enacting  this legislation ought to be a first step toward affirming with one  voice that there is absolutely no place for discrimination nor  harassment of any kind in the Halls of Congress. But we must also do  more than agree to mandatory training.   As elected officials, we ought to be held to a higher standard.  Congress must review and improve the current administrative procedure  for victims to come forward. All harassment and discrimination  allegations must be taken seriously. After enacting this measure,  Congress must streamline the process, protect victims that wish to be  protected, and ensure all allegations of wrongdoing are investigated  with professionalism, urgency and due process.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and encourage  the House to take whatever administrative steps are necessary to make  it easier for victims to come forward. More importantly, I respectfully  ask all of my colleagues to take a close look inward at themselves and  their offices and to put an immediate end to the cultural climate that  has allowed harassment and discrimination to tarnish the institution of  Congress. We can do better and we must.
