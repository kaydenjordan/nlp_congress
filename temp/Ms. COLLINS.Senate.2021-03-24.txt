 Madam President, small businesses and their employees  are the backbone of our economy, particularly in States like those of  the Presiding Officer and the State that I am privileged to represent,  the great State of Maine.   Later today, the Senate is slated to vote on cloture on the motion to  proceed to H.R. 1799, the PPP Extension Act of 2021.   As a sponsor of the Senate companion bill, along with my colleagues  Senator Cardin and Senator Shaheen, I urge my colleagues to support the  cloture motion.   We are also delighted that several of our colleagues have joined us  as cosponsors of the Senate companion bill.   The Paycheck Protection Program continues to be a lifeline for small  businesses. It has made the difference between their shutting their  doors and laying off their employees and their being able to remain  open, survive the pandemic, and most important of all, send paychecks  to their employees.   Since the program was created last year, more than $718 billion in  forgivable Small Business Administration loans have been approved,  securing tens of millions of jobs in this country.   The program has also been responsible for bringing approximately $3  billion to the State of Maine in forgivable loans that have allowed our  small businesses, particularly those in the hospitality industry, to  survive the pandemic and continue to send paychecks to their employees.   The current application deadline for the PPP is March 31. That is  just days away. I continue to hear about the urgent need for more PPP  assistance from Maine's small businesses and to hear from others who  are eligible for assistance but whose financial institutions are  getting error messages from the Small Business Administration's  computer system.   Originally, the SBA had used the E-Tran system. For some reason, it  switched computers for this round of PPP, and we understand that there  are more than 190,000 applications that are pending for approval that  are likely eligible for assistance but are held up because of computer  glitches or other errors.   The bill before us today mirrors the legislation that I introduced  with Senators Cardin and Shaheen in that it provides for a clean  extension of the PPP application deadline. It would simply extend the  application deadline for PPP loans from March 31 to May 31, just 2 more  months, and then it would provide an additional 30 days for the SBA to  process pending applications.   So if a small restaurant, for example, applied for a second PPP loan  for which it is eligible because its revenues are down by 25 percent,  comparing similar quarters in 2019 and 2020, it would not lose out  because it applied in May and the SBA did not get time to process the  application.   Our bill has been endorsed by more than 90 organizations, including  the Nation's largest small business advocacy group, the National  Federation of  [[Page S1745]]  Independent Business, which is key voting this vote. It has also been  endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Hotel & Lodging  Association, the International Franchise Association, the National  Restaurant Association, the U.S. Travel Association, and the  Independent Community Bankers of America.   The House passed this clean PPP extension last week by an  overwhelming margin of 415 to 3.   With the House now in recess and the Senate leaving this week,  advancing a clean extension through the Senate ensures the continuation  of this vital relief for our small businesses and their employees. We  simply have to get this done.    I agree with my colleagues that there are further improvements that  could be made to PPP, such as addressing an issue facing certain sole  proprietors. Unfortunately, the new administration changed the rules,  so sole proprietors who applied early when the program reopened in  January were treated differently than sole proprietors who are applying  now. That obviously doesn't make sense. We should have the same rule.   I have talked with the new SBA Administrator about this problem. She  agrees that it is unfair and needs to be fixed and has committed to  working with all the sponsors and with the House and Senate Small  Business Committee to find a solution to ensure that the program is  implemented as Congress intended.   But in order to ensure that there is adequate time to develop and  implement these improvements, we must first, without delay, pass H.R.  1799 to keep the PPP open for another 2 months.   I urge all of my colleagues to support cloture and passage of this  important bipartisan legislation. It truly is bipartisan.    Mr. President, earlier this week, I joined Senator Leahy  in introducing the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act. Our bill  would strengthen Federal law by making it easier for prosecutors to go  after gun traffickers and straw purchasers, those individuals without  criminal records who buy firearms for other people so they can bypass  the Federal background checks law. Our bill would also fully protect  the rights of the vast majority of gun owners who are law-abiding  citizens.   Straw purchasing is intended to achieve one result: to put a gun in  the hands of a criminal who cannot legally obtain one. Today,  traffickers, in particular, exploit weaknesses in Federal law by  targeting people who can lawfully purchase guns. Then, those  traffickers use those guns to commit crimes or sell them to other  criminals. They often ship them across State lines, straight up I-95's  ``Iron Pipeline'' and other interstate highways. They frequently  connect with criminal gangs that are ready to sell or trade those guns  for prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl, and commit other  crimes.   Yet right now, a straw purchaser can be prosecuted only for lying on  a Federal form, a paperwork violation. Our bill would create new  criminal offenses for straw purchasing, which would help law  enforcement officials take down these criminal enterprises.  [[Page S1764]]    The heroin and fentanyl epidemic is taking a devastating toll on all  of our communities. Police officers in Maine tell me about the familiar  patterns they see: Drug dealers and gang members, often from out-of- State and with criminal records, cross into Maine and approach drug  addicts to be their straw buyers, people with clean records who may  legally purchase firearms. They target addicts, who exchange guns for  heroin to support their drug dependencies, and the cycle repeats time  and again.   I received a briefing from Federal law enforcement officials about a  case in Maine fitting this exact pattern. Gang members trafficked crack  cocaine and heroin between New Haven, CT, and Bangor, ME, and committed  acts of violence including assaults, armed robberies, attempted murder,  and murder. They traded narcotics for firearms and then distributed  those firearms to other gang members. This is exactly the criminal  activity our bill aims to prevent. And our bill would complement  existing laws that target criminals who are profiting off of firearm  and drug trafficking.   It is very difficult to prevent and prosecute straw purchasing  offenses under current Federal law. As I stated, right now, a straw  purchaser can be prosecuted only for lying on a Federal form, which  amounts to a paperwork violation.   The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act would create new,  specific criminal offenses for straw purchasing and trafficking in  firearms. Instead of a slap on the wrist, these crimes would be  punishable by up to 15 years in prison. For those straw purchasers who  know or have reasonable cause to believe that the firearm they are  acquiring will be used to commit a crime of violence, that crime would  be punishable by up to 25 years in prison.   Our bill would also strengthen existing laws that prohibit gun  smuggling. Right now, it is illegal for someone to smuggle a firearm  into the United States with the intent to engage in drug trafficking or  violent crime. To combat the drug cartels operating across our southern  border, however, we must also prohibit firearms and ammunition from  being trafficked out of the United States for these illegal purposes.  In doing so, our bill would provide an important tool to combat  trafficking organizations that are exporting firearms and ammunition  from the United States and into Mexico where they are used by drug  cartels that are in turn fueling the heroin crisis here at home.   I also want to emphasize that our bill protects the Second Amendment  right of law-abiding citizens. It protects legitimate private gun sales  and is drafted to avoid sweeping in innocent transactions and placing  unnecessary burdens on lawful, private sales. It expressly exempts  certain transactions that are allowed under current law, such as gifts,  raffles, and auctions. Furthermore, the bill expressly prohibits any  authority provided by this act from being used to establish a Federal  firearms registry.   The Stop Illegal Trafficking and Firearms Act will help keep guns out  of the hands of criminals without infringing upon the constitutional  rights of law-abiding citizens. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.                            ____________________
