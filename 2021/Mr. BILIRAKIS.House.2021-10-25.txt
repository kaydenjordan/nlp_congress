 Mr. Speaker, President Biden's radical policies have  stymied America's energy independence and created a crisis,  unfortunately.   The national average price for a gallon of gas has climbed to its  highest level since 2014 and is 66 percent higher than it was last  year.   On day one, President Biden destroyed 11,000 American jobs by  canceling the Keystone Pipeline.   President Biden paused new domestic oil and gas leases, which will  cost one million American jobs and decrease the GDP by $700 billion.   Instead of allowing American companies to increase domestic  production and hire more U.S. workers, President Biden and his  administration has pleaded with OPEC and Russia to increase global  output to ease rising fuel prices.   Democrats in Congress are pushing a multitrillion-dollar spending  package, which includes a tax hike on fuel.   These actions jeopardize our Nation's energy security and will  increase costs for all American families, unfortunately.                            ____________________
