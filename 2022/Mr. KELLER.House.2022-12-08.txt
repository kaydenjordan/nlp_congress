 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, reflecting on my time in Congress and in the  [[Page H8860]]  Pennsylvania General Assembly makes me think about how blessed I am,  and we are as Americans. I thank God for giving me the opportunity to  serve the outstanding people of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District and Pennsylvania's 85th legislative district.   I am also thankful for all the lessons and people who God placed in  my life. At a time when I needed guidance, God placed people before me  to give me that guidance and that example, and then He gave me the  wisdom to accept that guidance and put it to work.   My dad, at a very young age when I was very young, taught me a work  ethic second to none. My grandmother taught me the importance of an  education and how to be proper.   Max Bingaman, owner of Bingaman & Son Lumber in Kreamer,  Pennsylvania, taught me business, leadership, and how to be an adult. I  can't say enough about my wife and her family. My wife and brother-in- law are here today. I am so blessed to have them in my life. My wife  and her family taught me kindness. My mother-in-law is the kindest  person I have known. It is not always heard people talking about their  mother-in-law so affectionately, but she was very kind. It is often  said that behind every successful man there is a surprised mother-in- law. That is a little joke of mine that I say. But my wife's family is  truly exceptional, and I am very blessed that I married into that  family almost 38 years ago.   The list could go on, but the point is no one accomplishes anything  alone. America is the greatest country on Earth. Nowhere else in the  world can a poor kid like me go from picking up aluminum cans along the  side of the road to owning his own home, running a business, starting a  small business of his own, and get elected to the Pennsylvania House of  Representatives or the United States Congress.   Growing up, we never were envious. If we wanted something for  ourselves, we were taught that we had to work for it. Hard work and  education is the way to succeed in America. We knew the American Dream  was attainable no matter who you are or what you have.   We never used being poor as an excuse. In fact, my grandmother taught  me many things at a very young age. I was about 12, she was about 75,  and she sat us down at the table one day. I don't know what my brother  and I had done. My brother was 1 year older than I. She said: Boys,  people who make excuses are weak.   We never used an excuse. We never let anyone, or our government  define us. In today's world, if we had grown up now, people probably  would have tried to define us as at-risk or disadvantaged. No, we were  just poor. Because if you believe in God, and you live in the United  States of America, you are not disadvantaged or at-risk.   I have used the experience growing up and the examples that the many  people taught me over my lifetime to shape me into the person and  public servant I am today. It has been the honor of my lifetime to  represent the good people of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District  over the past few years, and I thank them for having the confidence in  me to do that job.   Our team worked to hold government accountable, create opportunities  for workers and job creators, provide veterans with improved care,  expand quality healthcare for rural communities, support our farmers,  and bolster the Commonwealth's natural gas industry.   One of the best parts of representing Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District has been traveling the district and meeting the  outstanding, intelligent, and hardworking people who live in our  communities. That is where the real work happens and from where the  solutions to our problems come. These are the people who make a  difference.   As politicians, we all go out, we campaign for office, and we all  talk about jobs and jobs and what we are going to do. My friend, Bob  Garrett, the president of the Greater Susquehanna Valley Chamber of  Commerce, reminded me of this one time. He said: You know, Fred, you  can't be pro-jobs and anti-business.   I think that is a lesson that people in the Beltway could learn  because the job creators and the workers who work in those jobs are the  people who are put on the line every day to work and create the wealth  in America.   I can say with confidence that every day our team brought their voice  and the values of the people of PA-12 to Washington, D.C.   I am incredibly grateful and honored for the work that we have  accomplished. It was made possible by the integrity, passion, and  commitment of our entire team.   Mr. Speaker, what an outstanding group of individuals they are. In  fact, our district director and chief of staff is here today, and I  just want to give a shout-out to Ann Kaufman who is one of the hardest  working and intelligent people I know. I thank her for her work. Jon  Anzur and Nick Barley are here with me today. They are just great  people. I appreciate the passion and the commitment of the entire team.  Without their efforts, their contribution, and their service, we would  not have been able to serve Pennsylvania's congressional district so  well. It would not have been possible.   Though I will not be in Congress next year, I am reminded of a quote  from Ronald Reagan. President Reagan said: ``There is no limit to what  a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the  credit.''   I see some of my friends. I thank Mr. Kelly so much, and I appreciate  him being here, as well as Representative Miller-Meeks. I think I saw  somebody else over here. Dr. Foxx is here. These are great individuals  and public servants, but I would say these are people who have  servants' hearts. They are people who have helped me throughout my time  in Congress.   To the rest of the people here in the Beltway: America's greatness  does not come from buildings and politicians. It comes from her  citizens who are guided by our Lord God Almighty.   A personal example I can give to that, I mentioned a gentleman who  has meant so much to me in my adult life and has been there to support  my family whenever we needed it. His name is Max Bingaman. Max took  this young kid, employed him, taught him business, and taught him how  to behave and the taught him the right things to do. My life is better  because of Max.                                time  1500    Max, our community, our Commonwealth, and our Nation are better  because of you. You have touched so many lives and have been a great  example to so many people.   Take that example of Max Bingaman, and there are many other people  that do that. As I mentioned, it doesn't come from inside these walls.  It comes from across our great Nation, and we need to make sure that we  honor and respect those people for whom we work.   While our Nation still faces many challenges, I am more confident  than ever that we will be successful if we continue to believe in the  greatness of the American people.   Get government out of the way, protect our God-given freedoms, and  allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. In fact, they  have earned it.   I am often asked what I plan to do next. The answer is, I do not  know. Whatever the good Lord has in store for me next, I will build  upon the work our team has accomplished to ensure America remains that  shining city on a hill that forebearers saw from afar.   It looks like we have some other people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly),  my colleague.    Thank you, Mike, for your comments. Love you, pal.    Mr. Speaker, I have to say, about Dr. Foxx, I remember  when I first got here, and they were working out committees because I  came in in a special election. I had to promise not to create any  trouble for Dr. Foxx, I think is what it was. But I think what it  really meant was you better work hard. I think that is what it meant.  You better contribute. You better work hard.   There isn't anybody who runs a better ship when it comes to making  sure that we accomplish the goals on behalf of the people we represent  than a great mentor, a great person who has become a friend over the  past few years, Dr. Virginia Foxx.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Foxx. I certainly wasn't  anticipating my friends being here today, but I do want to say to Dr.  Foxx that she is a great example, and, of course, we have  Representative Miller-Meeks here.   But I would like to say to Dr. Foxx, if I can, as I told my friend,  Max Bingaman, when I decided not to run again, I said, Max, I don't  have to be elected to serve. Think of all the people we represent that  make a difference every day.   When they take a kid like me and invest time and resources in them,  that is what the people across America do. That is what you do, that is  what   Mike Kelly does, that is what Representative Miller-Meeks does.  I will stay in touch with all my friends that are here to make a  difference. I thank them all for that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller- Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Miller-Meeks for that, she is  truly an outstanding individual, a veteran, one of the people that  stood on the line to defend our freedom and our way of life. That is  why we are here, so many fought, and so many cared about the idea that  is America. There are so many people that will continue to do that, and  for that I tell them thank you for your service.  [[Page H8863]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert),  my friend and my granddaughter's friend's dad. When you have grandkids,  you sort of lose your title.    Can I just say you inspired me to think of something.  This is the only place that does less with more; the only place that  does it. I am sorry. You are talking about this efficiency and stuff,  and I just look at this place.    And during COVID they talked about essential jobs.   Well, I tell you what: This is probably the only place on Earth where  there are some jobs that are not essential.   But anyhow, sorry for taking your time, sir, but it just reminded me  that this is the only place on the face of the Earth that does less  with more.    Actually, I have an F-150 that I can run seven devices  from anywhere in PA-12.    2022.    I got the F-150 so I didn't have to buy a generator  because it has one in it. So that was my justification for that.    You are already here.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his  insight. I have nobody else to speak in this hour, so I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
