 Mr. President, as we all know, we are continuing to  debate what amounts to repealing the Affordable Care Act without any  indication of what is going to replace it--what is actually in the  Republican leader's bill. I think this is worth repeating because we  are talking about changing one-sixth of the U.S. economy, impacting  every American family, and yet we still have no idea what the bill  actually is.   We do know this. A partisan bill to take away health insurance from  tens of millions of Americans, written behind closed doors, opposed by  every healthcare stakeholder group and by an overwhelming majority of  the American people should not pass the Senate.   As I have repeatedly said, the only constructive way forward is for  Democrats and Republicans to come together in a good-faith, bipartisan  effort to repair and strengthen the current law. Bipartisanship should  not be our last resort, as Senator McConnell has suggested. It should  be a starting point. It should be the foundation of what we do in this  body. This is how the great majority of the American people want us to  conduct the Senate's business. This is what I hear from my constituents  in New Hampshire, and this is especially true with healthcare  legislation which affects families all across this country.   Make no mistake, every bill proposed by the Republican leadership has  been designed as a bullet to the heart of the Affordable Care Act.  Republican proposals will collapse the individual marketplaces, make it  impossible to provide affordable coverage for people with preexisting  conditions, and take healthcare coverage away from up to 32 million  Americans, including the most vulnerable.   I hope nobody is fooled by this latest partisan measure to roll back  the Affordable Care Act and take healthcare coverage away from tens of  millions of Americans. I hope every Senator will, at long last, heed  Senator McCain's call for bipartisanship--as we have been hearing at  townhalls and in countless messages from our constituents. The American  people want us to make commonsense, bipartisan changes to the current  law. We need to work together to build on the strengths of the  Affordable Care Act, which has dramatically reduced the number of  uninsured Americans and has given us valuable tools for fighting the  opioid epidemic which is ravaging so many communities in America. This  is the best way forward for both the Senate and our country.   Republican leaders have spent the last 7 months pushing deeply  unpopular bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including their  effort to dramatically cut Medicaid--not just the expansion of Medicaid  under the Affordable Care Act but the Medicaid Program that has done so  much to protect and provide healthcare for children across this  country, for pregnant women, for those with disabilities and older  Americans, so many of whom are in nursing homes who would lose that  care if we dramatically cut the Medicaid Program as the Republican  proposals have tried to do.   At the recent National Governors Association meeting, Democratic and  Republican Governors alike urged Congress to reject the Republican  leaders' healthcare bill--in particular, its harsh and unsustainable  cuts to Medicaid. The Republican Governor, John Kasich, was especially  forceful in urging Members of Congress to work together to find  bipartisan solutions. He urged Congress to give first priority to  stabilizing the healthcare marketplaces.   We should listen to the Governors, but most importantly we should  listen to our constituents--to the great majority of our constituents  who want to preserve what is working in the Affordable Care Act and see  us change what is not working. Instead of legislation to take  healthcare away from people, it is time now for an inclusive,  bipartisan approach to provide quality, affordable healthcare for every  American.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.    Madam President, I intend to offer the following five  motions to commit to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that they  be printed in the Record.   The first motion would send the reconciliation bill to the Health,  Education, Labor and Pensions Committee with instructions to strike  repeal of cost sharing reductions, CSRs, and advanced premium tax  credits and replace this section with my legislation, the Marketplace  Certainty Act, which would make CSRs permanent and extend them to those  making up to 400 percent of the Federal poverty line. I want to  reiterate what I previously said for the Record, that the Affordable  Care Act, ACA, already prescribes that such payments are to be made  from such a permanent appropriation pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1324.   The first motion is supported by Senators Carper, Reed, Murphy,  Baldwin, Hirono, Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Heinrich, Coons, Heitkamp,  Stabenow, Cardin, Markey, Warner, and Van Hollen.   The second motion would send the reconciliation bill to the Finance  Committee with instructions to strike repeal of cost sharing  reductions, CSRs, and advanced premium tax credits and replace this  section with my legislation, the Marketplace Certainty Act, which would  make CSRs permanent and extend them to those making up to 400 percent  of the Federal poverty line. Similar to the first motion, I want to  reiterate what I previously said for the Record, that the ACA already  prescribes that such payments are to be made from such a permanent  appropriation pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1324.   The second motion is supported by Senators Carper, Reed, Murphy,  Baldwin, Hirono, Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Heinrich, Coons, Heitkamp,  Stabenow, Cardin, Markey, Warner, and Van Hollen.   The third motion would send the reconciliation bill to the Finance  Committee with instructions to strike provisions that would weaken or  eliminate the small employer health insurance credit, prohibit the  ability of entrepreneurs to purchase affordable health coverage through  the individual marketplace, or allow discriminatory rating rules that  prohibit small businesses from providing affordable, comprehensive  benefits to their employees.   The third motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal, Carper, Udall,  Baldwin, Brown, Peters, and Stabenow.   The fourth motion would send the reconciliation bill to the Health,  Education, Labor and Pensions Committee with instructions to strike  provisions that would allow insurers to establish diabetes as a  preexisting condition or reduce funding for diabetes research,  treatment, prevention and education.   The fourth motion is supported by Senators Hirono, Klobuchar,  Blumenthal, Menendez, and Van Hollen.   The fifth motion would send the reconciliation bill to the Finance  Committee with instructions to strike language that would remove mental  healthcare services from the list of essential health benefits or  prohibit States from providing Medicaid coverage for more than 30  consecutive days of inpatient psychiatric services.   The fifth motion is supported by Senators Hirono and Blumenthal.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S4287]]                          Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mrs. Shaheen moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that nothing in the bill would--        (A) establish diabetes as a pre-existing condition such       that insurers could charge higher premiums for diabetes       patients; or        (B) reduce funding allocated to diabetes research,       treatment, prevention, and education.
