 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a local police officer,  husband, father, and respected community member: Ken Foley.   In 1990, Officer Foley joined the Lakeland Police Department  following 8 years with the United States Marine Corps. Last week, on  December 4, after 29 years of distinguished service, his career and his  life here on this Earth came to an end as he died unexpectedly while on  duty.   Police Chief Ruben Garcia shared that Foley was an ``everyday first  responder and definitely one of our local heroes.''   Officer Foley was active in the community, and he knew it well.  Lakeland residents flooded social media with anecdotes about Officer  Foley's infectious smile, his compassion, and his unique ability to  connect with people.   Officers like Ken Foley make me proud of my community and grateful  for the daily sacrifices of our first responders.   So, to Officer Foley's family, his friends, and the entire Lakeland  Police Department: Our prayers are with you all. May God bless,  comfort, and keep you during this difficult time.                            ____________________
