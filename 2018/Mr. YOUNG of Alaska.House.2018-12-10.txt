 Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank the  chairman very much for bringing this legislation to the floor. It is a  Senate bill very much like the bill I introduced that came out of the  committee.   The bill promotes energy projects critical for economic development  areas around Indian Country. Native communities face a significant  number of obstacles to developing and delivering energy on their land.  Ultimately, the lack of affordable energy undermines efforts to promote  social and economic well-being in these communities.   I have always said Alaska Natives and American Indians are the best  caretakers of their lands. This is what Tribal self-determination is  all about: empowering Native communities with the tools and authority  to manage their resources.   S. 245 makes important progress in this effort. The bill incorporates  a variety of policy changes to enhance Indian energy development. This  includes expanding the ability of the Department of Energy to provide  technical assistance to tribes and Tribal organizations for energy  projects, improving the Department of the Interior's process for  approving energy resource agreements, and requiring FERC to give tribes  equal footing with municipalities for hydroelectric licenses.   I am also pleased that the bill includes a Tribal biomass  demonstration program that mirrors a provision in my Native American  Energy Act.   I appreciate Chairman Hoeven's willingness to continue to work on  Indian energy and his commitment to hold a hearing on my Native  American Energy Act in 2019. My bill can serve as the foundation for  the next step in promoting Indian energy. I urge my colleagues to  support passage of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.  [[Page H9789]]         Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 825) to provide for the conveyance of certain  property to the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium located in  Sitka, Alaska, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 825         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Southeast Alaska Regional       Health Consortium Land Transfer Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE OF PROPERTY.

(b) Effect on Any Quitclaim Deed.--The conveyance by the       Secretary of title by warranty deeds under this section       shall, on the effective date of the conveyance, supersede and       render of no future effect any quitclaim deed to the property       described in section 3 executed by the Secretary and the       Consortium.        (c) Conditions.--The conveyance of the property under this       Act--        (1) shall be made by warranty deed; and        (2) shall not--        (A) require any consideration from the Consortium for the       property;        (B) impose any obligation, term, or condition on the       Consortium; or        (C) allow for any reversionary interest of the United       States in the property.       SEC. 3. PROPERTY DESCRIBED.         The property, including all land and appurtenances,       described in this section is the property included in U.S.       Survey 1496, Lots 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11A, 11A Parcel A, and 11B,       partially surveyed Township 55 South, Range 63 East of the       Copper River Meridian, containing 19.07 acres, in Sitka,       Alaska.       SEC. 4. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY.         (a) Liability.--        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, the Consortium shall not be liable for any soil, surface       water, groundwater, or other contamination resulting from the       disposal, release, or presence of any environmental       contamination on any portion of the property described in       section 3 on or before the date on which the property is       conveyed to the Consortium, except that the Secretary shall       not be liable for any contamination that occurred after the       date on which the Consortium controlled, occupied, and used       such property.        (2) Environmental contamination.--An environmental       contamination described in paragraph (1) includes any oil or       petroleum products, hazardous substances, hazardous       materials, hazardous waste, pollutants, toxic substances,       solid waste, or any other environmental contamination or       hazard as defined in any Federal or State of Alaska law.        (b) Easement.--The Secretary shall be accorded any easement       or access to the property conveyed under this Act as may be       reasonably necessary to satisfy any retained obligation or       liability of the Secretary.        (c) Notice of Hazardous Substance Activity and Warranty.--      In carrying out this Act, the Secretary shall comply with       subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 120(h)(3) of the       Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and       Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)(3)).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 825, the Southeast Alaska  Regional Health Consortium Land Transfer Act of 2017.   The consortium provides comprehensive healthcare to Native  communities throughout Alaska's panhandle. It also delivers healthcare  on behalf of the Federal Government through self-determination  compacting.   The consortium operates Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital in Sitka, a 25-bed,  [[Page H9790]]  critical-access facility. The hospital was constructed towards the end  of World War II. It is in dire need of updating due to its age and  condition.   For the consortium to secure financing for the project to update the  conditions of the facilities, they need land on the hospital campus,  which is currently held by IHS, conveyed by warranty deed.   S. 825 is a companion bill to my bill, H.R. 1901. Simply, it would  transfer 19 acres of Federal land to the consortium, allowing them to  update and improve healthcare services for Alaska Natives.   From the 112th to the 114th Congress, three of my bills that  authorized similar land transfers for different entities were signed  into law. These bills were nearly identical to S. 825.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Bishop and his staff for  moving this bill through committee. I would also like to thank Ranking  Member Grijalva and his staff for their bipartisan work on this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 2511) to require the Under Secretary of Commerce for  Oceans and Atmosphere to carry out a program on coordinating the  assessment and acquisition by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration of unmanned maritime systems, to make available to the  public data collected by the Administration using such systems, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2511         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Finally, I       would be pleased to include this letter and your response in       the Congressional Record during debate on the bill.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction.            Sincerely,                                                     Rob Bishop,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Natural Resources.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Armed Services,                                  Washington, DC, December 10, 2018.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning S. 2511,       the ``Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of       2018.'' There are certain provisions in the bill which fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed       Services.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important       legislation, I am willing to waive this committee's further       consideration of S. 2511. I do so with the understanding that       by waiving consideration of the bill, the Committee on Armed       Services does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over       the subject matters contained in the legislation which fall       within its Rule X jurisdiction. The committee also reserves       the right to seek appointment to any House-Senate conference       on this legislation and requests your support if such a       request is made.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our respective       committees.            Sincerely,                                     William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
