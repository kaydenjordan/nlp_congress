 Mr. Speaker, the Insurrection Act was passed in 1807 and  signed into law by Thomas Jefferson as a delegation by the Congress to  the President of the power granted under Article I, Section 8, Clause  15 of the Constitution to call forth U.S. Armed Forces, number one, to  execute the laws; number two, suppress insurrections; and, number  three, repeal invasions.   In 1827, the President's power to do so was upheld by the Supreme  Court in Martin v. Mott.   In 1861, it was amended to add a section empowering the President to  use the Armed Forces against the will of the Governor of a State in the  case of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the  United States.   In 1871, it was amended again to allow the President to use U.S.  Armed Forces to enforce the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th  Amendment and protect Black people from the Ku Klux Klan. President  Grant used it three times.   To get Democrat support for President Rutherford Hayes in this House  during the aftermath of the disputed 1876 Presidential election, Hayes  agreed to remove Federal troops from the South, which ended  Reconstruction.   The Posse Comitatus Act was passed in 1878 to limit the use of U.S.  Armed Forces in domestic matters, thus codifying the compromise.                                time  0930    The Insurrection Act provisions are construed as specified exceptions  to the Posse Comitatus Act. As such, it has been used by Democrat  Presidents, Grover Cleveland, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, John  Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson.   Roosevelt used it to put an end to a Detroit race riot during which  25 Black people were killed, and over 400 were injured.   President Eisenhower used it to desegregate Little Rock schools.   Kennedy used it to end the race riot at the University of Mississippi  in 1962, after James Meredith, a Black man, was enrolled there. He used  it again in my home State when Democratic Governor, George Wallace,  disgracefully tried to block the enrollment of Vivian Malone and James  Hood, both Black people, at the University of Alabama. He also used it  to enforce the desegregation of public schools in Alabama in reaction  to the hate-filled environment around the State Wallace encouraged.   In 1989, it was used by George H.W. Bush in St. Croix in the  aftermath of Hurricane Hugo; and again in 1992, when the Governor of  California asked for assistance in the riots which followed the beating  of Rodney King.   It has not been used since. Nor did President Trump use it earlier  this summer here in Washington. All military personnel used here this  year were National Guard, the authorization of which was not needed  under the Insurrection Act in this Federal city.   Nonetheless, last week this House approved an amendment to the  National Defense Authorization Act to substantially weaken the  operations of the military under the Insurrection Act.   Let me be clear: Over the last 200 years, this law has only been used  sparingly and only under extreme circumstances, which is only  appropriate in a country which highly values the civilian control of  our military. Our Armed Services have a primary mission to protect us  from enemies without our country. They should rarely be used to do so  with people within our country.   This unwise House amendment forbids our military when they are called  out under the Insurrection Act from participating in search, seizure,  arrest, or ``other similar activity,'' unless ``otherwise expressly  authorized by law.''   Mr. Speaker, the Insurrection Act is the primary provision that is  expressly authorized by law. This amendment would effectively make the  Insurrection Act toothless.   Imagine General Grant cleaning out the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina  with the limiting language of the amendment.   Imagine Franklin Roosevelt quelling the Detroit race riot and  protecting innocent Black people with that limitation.   How about President Kennedy protecting Black students just trying to  attend their State universities in Mississippi and Alabama in the face  of violent racists and the Ku Klux Klan.   What is this House thinking? I submit, in this instance, the House  didn't think. It just reacted, as it has these last 2 years, with blind  indignation against President Trump. I say ``blind''  [[Page H3887]]  because I don't believe many would have voted for such language if  Hillary Clinton was President. Thank God the Senate didn't include this  language in their version of the NDAA.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the conferees from both Houses and both parties to  reject this rash amendment and for all of us to return to our senses.  Insurrections are rare but ugly things. Let's not tie a future  President's hands at a time when our people may need his, and our  military's, protection here at home.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Child Care Is  Essential Act.   Everyone in this Chamber can agree that access to childcare will be  vital to the continued reopening of our economy, especially as more and  more parents return to work. However, this legislation is not the  answer. It would cost an astronomical $50 billion, an amount higher  than the total revenue of the childcare industry in the United States,  and twice as high as the Bipartisan Policy Center reports that  childcare providers actually need.   Further, this legislation places so many reporting requirements on  agencies that $5 billion of that money, a whopping 10 percent, will go  to administrative expenses, rather than helping children get the care  that they need. This is not where the red tape is, by the way. The bill  places additional and unneeded regulatory burdens on childcare centers  that would increase their costs and require them to follow State and  CDC guidelines on operations, even when those guidelines may directly  contradict each other. The Child Care Is Essential Act also unfairly  limits access to these funds. Licensed-exempt facilities like at many  churches will be prohibited from accessing these funds.   Childcare is essential as parents begin returning to the workplace,  however, this bill spends too much taxpayer money and places an undue  and unworkable regulatory burden on facilities, Federal agencies, and  yes, on families.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation, and I ask my  Democratic colleagues to actually come to the table on a bipartisan  solution to this issue.
