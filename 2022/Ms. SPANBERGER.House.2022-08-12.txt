 Mr. Speaker, today, I am so proud to rise in support  of the Inflation Reduction Act.   As chair of the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry, I am  excited that this bill includes dedicated funding to further the role  of Virginia's crop and livestock producers in our work to protect our  planet.   Farmers are the original conservationists, and their expertise cannot  be ignored if we are going to meet our shared climate goals while also  bringing greater investments to rural America, strengthening our  farmers' bottom lines, and lowering the cost of inputs.   We can make investments in our Nation's producers by investing in  existing voluntary conservation programs at USDA, and that is what this  legislation does.   I am proud that the conservation provisions in this bill reflect  multiple pieces of legislation that I have championed to make possible,  including my bipartisan REAP Improvement Act.   These provisions include stronger investments in the Rural Energy for  America Program, or REAP, and support our conservation workforce and  our Natural Resources Conservation Service. These are smart investments  for the bottom lines of our farmers.
