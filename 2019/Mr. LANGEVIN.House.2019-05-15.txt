 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  hope that I won't take the whole 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 312, the Mashpee  Wampanoag Tribe Reservation Reaffirmation Act.   This bill will have enormous impacts on my home State of Rhode  Island. The  [[Page H3821]]  intent of this bill is to allow for the construction of a new casino  resort near the State line between Rhode Island and Massachusetts,  which would rival the existing casinos in our State.   The Twin River Casino Hotel and the Tiverton Casino Hotel of Rhode  Island generate $300 million each year, representing the State's third  largest source of funding. These dollars support vital education and  infrastructure programs in Rhode Island. Rhode Island would suffer  tremendously if H.R. 312 became law.   Beyond the economic damage that would occur to Rhode Island, the  precedent that would be set by this bill is fundamentally unfair. The  bill would overturn a 2018 decision by the U.S. Department of the  Interior, and it would reverse a 2016 ruling by the U.S. District Court  for the District of Massachusetts.   If Congress grants the Mashpee Tribe this exception, then other  Native American Tribes would seek individual relief. Congress would be  creating an unbalanced patchwork process for Tribes to put land into  trust. Such a system would be based on lobbying, not on firm principles  or deliberative rulemaking.                                time  1500    The process to take Tribal lands into trust is complex and requires  careful consideration of the interests of our indigenous peoples in  conjunction with local communities. We know this complexity firsthand  in Rhode Island, as the Supreme Court decision Carcieri v. Salazar  directly concerned our State.   But the solution is to create a uniform standard for the whole  country, not a haphazard process wherein Congress chooses winners and  losers, again, based on lobbying. This is why I urge my colleagues to  oppose this bill. The bill creates evident harms to our State revenues  in Rhode Island, but it also represents a slipshod way of addressing  the very real issues of how Tribes have land taken into trust.   My friends in the Massachusetts delegation insist that this issue be  handled with alacrity. I respectfully disagree. The urgency they  express is grounded in the dollars and cents of gaming development,  money loaned on the promise of casino riches. Those loans may have been  imprudently granted, but we cannot allow imprudent financial dealings  to force our hand.   Rather than rush a Tribe-specific loophole, I ask my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on H.R. 312 and to, instead, update the Indian  Reorganization Act to make this process more transparent and fair. Mr.  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
