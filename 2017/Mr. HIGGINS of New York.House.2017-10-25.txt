 Mr. Speaker, Medicare is the best public  option that already exists to improve the Affordable Care Act and to  provide immediate relief to Americans on the individual market.   Next week, the Nation's State insurance commissioners will make  public insurers' price gouging increases for next year, including a 60  percent increase in Georgia, a 50 percent increase in Florida, and the  remaining States up to a 50 percent 1-year increase.   A Medicare buy-in option for younger Americans is the only hedge  against these price spikes that every American will look to Congress  for relief from. Congress has been negligent in their 7-year near  obsession with repeal and replace. You can no longer blame ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member of Congress to support the Medicare  Buy-in and Healthcare Stabilization Act and Medicare X legislation. It  is time to unleash the market power of Medicare to lower costs, improve  quality,  [[Page H8155]]  and push back on private insurers' aggressive pricing.                            ____________________
