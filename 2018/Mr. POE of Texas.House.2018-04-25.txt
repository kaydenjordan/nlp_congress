 Mr. Speaker, just a stone's throw away from the  Champs-Elysees and the Louvre in Paris stands the Hotel de Vendome, the  former home of the official embassy of the Republic of Texas.   In fact, France was the first nation to recognize Texas as an  independent nation in 1836, when a treaty was signed between the two  countries. Today, a marker denotes the building where the Texas embassy  was in France.   In turn, France had an embassy in Austin, Texas, not far from our  current Texas Capitol Building.   Notably, Texas also once belonged to France before Spain reclaimed  Texas.   Explorer La Salle planted the French flag in Texas in 1685 and  established a settlement in Matagorda.   Texas later became a sovereign republic and 9 years later joined the  United States.   So on this day when French President Macron addressed Congress, Texas  remembers and appreciates that Texas was not only an independent  country France first recognized, but was once a part of France.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
