 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for giving me this  moment.   Mr. Speaker, years from now, history books will tell of this day. It  will tell of a purely partisan effort to remove the President of the  United States, an effort not built on a high crime or misdemeanor, not  on a process in keeping with the high American standard of due process  and equal treatment. This effort is rooted only in the governing  party's hatred of a man elected President of the United States.   Members on the other side of the aisle have been in pursuit of this  moment since 2016. They are consumed by it. Earlier in this debate, one  of our colleagues referred to our President as a ``domestic enemy.''   Our Founders warned us about this day. That is why our Nation has  entrusted the future of the country with the outcome of elections, not  the will of a party filled with contempt for a duly elected President.   My hope is that, when historians write about this day, it is not  written in the context of a nation that lost its way because its  elected Members chose hateful partisanship over the sacred oath that  has protected this great Republic since its founding.
