 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Smith for his always  knowledgeable and articulate leadership. I have appreciated it very  much as I have served on this committee.    Mr. Speaker, it has been my privilege to serve as the ranking member  of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, alongside my  colleague and friend, Chairman Mike Turner of Ohio. I, once again,  thank Mr. Turner for the spirit of bipartisanship and collegiality he  has shown over the years on this subcommittee and on the many other  issues on which we have worked closely, including addressing the  scourge of sexual assault in the military.   Among many important provisions, this year's bill includes measures  aimed at providing increased oversight over key naval aircraft and  makes crucial investments in research and development aimed at better  protecting the men and women we send into harm's way.   This is the last NDAA that I will have the privilege of helping  craft. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve on the House  Armed Services Committee for the last 11 years, a committee that has  such a proud tradition of bipartisan cooperation and, as such, is a  model for the country during these challenging times.   I commend the committee, under the leadership of Chairman Thornberry  and Ranking Member Smith, and the many members of the professional  staff for their work in managing such an important and complex piece of  legislation in such a timely manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the conference report, so aptly named  for the heroic Senator John McCain.
