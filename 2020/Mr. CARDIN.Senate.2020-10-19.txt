 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, once again, the Republican leadership is  circumventing and abusing the rules of the U.S. Senate. In this  Congress, this has happened over and over and over again--denying  debate on the Senate floor, where we have the opportunity to offer  amendments and have a debate, which the Senate is very famous  historically for engaging in. I can give you numerous examples.   There is Justice in Policing. After all of the problems that we have  seen around our country, there has been no opportunity on the floor of  the Senate to consider legislation, to offer amendments, and have  debate.   As for the environmental challenges that our Nation and world face,  there has been no debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   As for gun safety, we have heard from students and communities of all  of the tragedies that have occurred during this Congress, but there has  been no debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate, where we would have an  opportunity to offer amendments and have a full debate.   As for immigration reform, it is something that has been talked about  a great deal, but there has been no real action taken on the floor of  the U.S. Senate during this Congress.   With election reform, once again, there has been no debate on the  floor of the U.S. Senate and no opportunity to offer amendments.   We are not doing what the American people expect us to do, and I can  name many, many, many more examples. At last count, somewhere around  400 bills have come over to us from the House of Representatives--many  bipartisan--that have not been considered by the U.S. Senate.   Then, of course, the Republican leadership changes the rules when it  suits itself in order to do what it wants to do, particularly with  judicial confirmations. We are seeing that right now in the attempt to  fill Justice Ginsburg's vacancy. They are changing the rules. The rules  that apply to the Democrats don't apply to the Republicans. They do  whatever they want to do. That is not what we should be doing. Now we  see the Republican leadership circumventing and abusing the rules of  the U.S. Senate as it relates to our responsibility with COVID-19.   Everyone knows, including the Republican leader, that we are not  going to enact the bill that is currently before the Senate without the  amendments being offered by the majority leader. Why are we taking up  these issues? There is one simple answer: political cover votes. That  is the only reason for it, but there is a consequence to this. It makes  it more difficult for us to get relief to those who need it. Whether it  be small businesses or whether it be our schools or whether it be our  State and local governments or whether it be those who are unemployed  or whether it be American families, it makes it more difficult because,  as we are taking up these issues, Secretary Mnuchin, on behalf of the  Trump administration, and Speaker Pelosi are negotiating, from which we  hope there will be a comprehensive package to deal with COVID-19.   I must tell you that Secretary Mnuchin has a very difficult  challenge. First, he has to represent the President of the United  States, who changes his mind every few minutes on whether he wants a  package or doesn't want a package, which makes it very difficult for  Secretary Mnuchin to negotiate with Speaker Pelosi. Then he has to deal  with the Republicans in the U.S. Senate. We will be voting tomorrow, I  understand, on a proposal from the Republicans that will be less than  one-third of the amount of money that President Trump has authorized in  negotiations, pulling us further apart and making it more difficult for  us to reach an agreement to help the people of this country.   Since mid-May and again several months ago, the House did its work.  It sent over to us a comprehensive bill to deal with the next phase of  COVID-19. There have been no efforts--none whatsoever--by the  Republican leader to bring that legislation to the floor of the U.S.  Senate so that we can have an open and full debate with amendments as  to what to do. That bill has been here since mid-May, and we can't find  the time to have that type of debate. So what is Leader McConnell  suggesting? You will have to follow this  [[Page S6312]]  because I know, if it were not so serious, the public would find it  somewhat amusing.   First, he wants to withdraw the amendment that was championed by the  Republicans that deals with preexisting conditions. I must tell you  that we all on our side of the aisle said that this was just another  political cover vote. Now Leader McConnell is making that prediction  very clear by withdrawing it and offering it again later as an effort  to block the Democrats from being able to offer a clean vote on an  amendment. We are going to make it a clean vote anyway, but that is his  motivation. He is withdrawing the amendment that deals with preexisting  conditions so that it will no longer be a part of the bill.   Then he is going to offer an amendment to the underlying message, S.  178, which is legislation that deals with sanctions against China. You  heard me right. This is a message on legislation that deals with  sanctions against China. It already includes the underlying amendment  that Leader McConnell is offering--the amendment that we are voting on  in a few minutes. Then he is going to file a motion to table, which  means he will want to kill the amendment. Then he is going to vote  against his own motion. I hope you all can follow that.   Here is the irony or hypocrisy of all of this: If the motion to table  carries, the provisions that are in the amendment are still in the  underlying bill. In other words, it has no effect whatsoever because it  is already in the bill. So this is a vote for one purpose only--to give  political cover. The American people understand that, and they  understand that this is strictly about dealing with a partisan,  political type of trickery, and we should have no part of that.   Let's talk about the process that we have used. There will be no  chance in this legislation of helping businesses with the passage of a  comprehensive bill under the approach taken by the Republican leader.  Now, there is a model we could follow. It has worked before, and it can  work again. Look at the CARES Act. We had partisan differences, and we  bridged those partisan differences. We worked together and put the  American people's interests first. As a result, we passed the CARES Act  with a proud 97-to-0 vote in the U.S. Senate and provided desperately  needed help in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic itself, in dealing  with the health professionals and the public health people, and for  testing and for vaccine development. We provided money for State and  local governments, and we provided money for businesses and taxpayers.  We also dealt with unemployment insurance. We did all of that.   When we passed that bill in March, we thought this pandemic would be  behind us by now and that we wouldn't still be in the first wave and be  increasing the numbers of people infected with COVID-19. We need more  help, not less help, so we need a second round.   I am frustrated in regard to the provisions affecting small business.  I say that because Senator Rubio, the Republican chair of the Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and I, as ranking Democrat of  that committee, were proud to work together and put the interest of our  country first and develop the tools that were included in the CARES  Act, which included, yes, the Paycheck Protection Program, the PPP. It  also included EIDL loans and grants.   It also included loan forgiveness in an effort to help small  businesses. It was truly a bipartisan working effort. We were, I think,  the first of the different provisions that were included in the CARES  Act that were basically worked out in a bipartisan manner. But that is  not the process the majority leader is following today. The proposal he  is making is not a bipartisan proposal that has been worked on by  Senator Rubio and me. We haven't come together. We could easily resolve  our differences; I have no doubt about it. If we get the parameters on  how much money we have, and give us a few minutes to negotiate, we will  come to an agreement, as we have done in the past. I have every  confidence in the world that we will do it. But this process doesn't  further that aim--a process that cannot lead to help for our small  businesses.   Let's talk about what our small businesses need.   First, they need comprehensive help. Similar to what we did in the  CARES Act, they need a second major influx of help. They need help for  State and local government. Why? Because the stability of the services  provided by State and local government is critically important for the  climate in which small businesses need to operate to get back to some  degree of normalcy.   They need help for our schools because our schools need to reopen as  fully as they can safely, whether it is virtual or in classroom or  hybrid, and they don't have the resources to do it. Our economy will  not get back on track unless parents are confident about the  educational opportunities of their children and can fully participate  in our economy knowing their children are safe. Small businesses need  that type of support.   They need help for the people who are unemployed. That $600 a week  went directly to helping small businesses by providing customers that  use small businesses.   We have 12 million Americans who are uninsured today. We didn't  anticipate that in March when we passed the CARES Act, that we would  still have those numbers.   We need a comprehensive approach, and, yes, we need to get COVID-19  under control. We need confidence among Americans that it is OK to go  out and shop and use services and participate fully in our economy. But  until they are confident they can do that safely, the economy will not  rebound the way it needs to. So small businesses need a comprehensive  approach.   Food services are still doing very poorly, and now we are entering  into the cold months, when it is more difficult to eat outdoors. It  means restaurants are going to need more help, not less.   The hospitality industry is still very much impacted by COVID-19. We  know that there are no large gatherings or events. The travel and  tourism industry has taken a hit. I saw that during COVID-19, during  the summer months, down on the beaches when the normal crowds were not  there. We will see it again this winter in the western part of our  State, as we see fewer people are traveling to Deep Creek Lake.   We all recognize that we need to give attention to these types of  conditions to get consumers back, that this economy is OK, to help  small business.   Now, the House has acted not once but twice, and Senator McConnell  instead brings up a bill one-third the offer the President--less than  one-third of the offer the President has already put on the table and  probably about a quarter--less than a quarter of what the Democrats  have passed in their most recent bill.   So Senator McConnell is going to first file an amendment that would  provide a second round of the Paycheck Protection Program. I agree we  should have a second round of the Paycheck Protection Program. We need  a second round--that is nothing new. We have had hearings in our  committee where Secretary Mnuchin acknowledged that, the Democrats  acknowledged it, and the Republicans acknowledged it.   I filed legislation in June with Senator Shaheen on a second round of  PPP--in June. It is now October, and we haven't brought that bill to  the floor so we could reconcile differences if we were going to bring  it up on its own, if it is not going to be part of a comprehensive  package. But what Leader McConnell is saying is we are going to bring  it up on our own, but it doesn't take into consideration the lessons we  learned from the Paycheck Protection Program, the first round.   What did we learn? We learned that underbanked, underserved  communities were not treated fairly; that they didn't have the  relationship with the banks that allow them to get the money in a  timely way, get as large of a loan as the more established small  businesses were able to get; that the lenders were more likely to do  business with those who had existing relations, with the larger loans;  and that we needed to empower the mission lenders who go into  underserved communities and we needed to concentrate on the smaller and  the smallest of the small businesses. If you look at what is being  brought forward today, the legislation does not adequately provide for  the underserved community.  [[Page S6313]]    We also learned from the first round of help in the CARES Act about  the importance of the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, the EIDL  Program. Now, you see, the EIDL Program provides loans, and those loans  are critically important because that is working capital. That is not  just payroll; it is working capital. Small businesses need long-term,  low-interest EIDL loans that are able to be paid over a long period of  time and to get a break in the first year or two where they don't even  have to make payments.   They needed the EIDL loans, but we also created an EIDL grant  program. Now, I must tell you something. Many small businesses-- particularly the smaller of the small businesses--are reluctant to take  out any more loans. They don't know how they are going to pay them off.  They need grants. They need grants. We provided originally $10 billion  and then another $10 billion. We provided $20 billion, but that is  gone. We need to replenish that money for the grant program. The  amendment the leader is bringing up doesn't provide any help for that  grant program.   In addition, we need to think more strategically about grants under  the EIDL Program, and there is a way of doing that. I will come back to  that in a minute. It is not in the leader's amendment.   We need to do something about the arbitrary cap that the  administration placed on the EIDL loans. They placed a $150,000 cap.  The law says $2 million. They compromised the effectiveness of this.   Now, here is the good news. We have bipartisan support for these  changes. Senator Rosen and Senator Cornyn have filed legislation that  would allow us to move forward with the EIDL Program, but it is not in  the amendment being offered by the majority leader.   There are so many other programs in the small business field that are  important. There is the loan forgiveness program--Senator Coons worked  on that--that forgives loans for 6 months under the 504 and the 7(a)  programs. We can reduce the cost of small business loans. We can  approve microloans. I could mention so many other areas where we could  provide help.    We know we have specific industries that need special attention, such  as the restaurant industry, such as local newspapers, such as  nonprofits that weren't covered under the first PPP program. Those are  not covered under Leader McConnell's amendment.   Here is the tragedy: There is no opportunity under this process for  us to correct errors in Senator McConnell's amendment. No chance to  amend. Never had a chance to amend. Never went through the committee.  And, by the way, is on a bill unrelated to this relief and has no  chance of passage.   That is not what we should be doing. We have other options. We could  bring the revised House Heroes bill to the floor of the U.S. Senate. It  is a comprehensive approach. It has been compromised. We could open it  to amendment. We could debate it and pass it and provide comprehensive  relief. It includes all of the small business provisions that I  mentioned earlier. They are included in the House-passed bill. They  passed a couple weeks ago.   If Leader McConnell is just determined to bring a small business bill  to the floor, then I have filed such legislation today with many of my  colleagues--a bill that works with issues of concern to small  businesses, which is very much bipartisan. It includes not only the  second round of PPP but also includes important help for the  underbanked communities and mission lenders. It provides real help for  the smaller of the small businesses. It increases the EIDL Program-- similar to the Rosen-Cornyn bill but also adds a new opportunity for  grants under the EIDL Program. It strengthens programs in areas for the  hospitality industry, for our local newspapers, for our nonprofits. It  provides help in many of the small business existing programs, such as  the loan forgiveness program. The cost of small business loans are  reduced. Microloans are improved.   We could bring up that legislation, and then we have a bill that  really deals with small business that can be debated, amended. We can  have amendments and vote on it. But at least we have a comprehensive  bill that has a chance of being enacted. Why do I say it has a chance  of being enacted? Because the House has already acted on this. It is  included in their package. We don't have to try to conference this.   Look, we should have passed this months ago, but we all know  elections are coming up in 2 weeks. We have to act if we are going to  act. Here is a bill we can act on now and get done because we know the  House has already voted on a similar package.   We know small businesses need help. They are in desperate need of  help. Our economy needs help. Americans need the Senate to stop playing  procedural political games and to be serious about taking up  legislation that can deal with their needs.   I am ready at any time to sit down with my Republican colleagues and  work out such legislation, but the way the majority leader is going  about this is just wrong, and it should not be supported by any of us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I mourn the loss of a tremendous  champion for human rights and the State of Israel and one of my  personal heroes and mentors, Ambassador Richard Schifter. Ambassador  Schifter lived a truly remarkable life. After escaping Nazi-occupied  Austria in 1938, he bravely returned to Europe just a few short years  later as one of the U.S. Army's ``Ritchie Boys'', German-speaking  officers trained in counterintelligence at Camp Ritchie in Maryland.  While serving in Europe, he learned that all of his family had been  killed in the Holocaust. At just over 20 years old, Ambassador Schifter  had experienced more adversity than most of us see in a lifetime.  Nevertheless, he spent the next seven decades demonstrating incredible  faith and courage as he strived to make the world a better place.   Ambassador Schifter was successful in this mission. After he  graduated from Yale Law School, he went on to become an attorney,  advocating for the rights of Native American Tribes facing  discrimination at the hands of the U.S. Government. Under Presidents  Reagan and George H.W. Bush, he served as Assistant Secretary of State  for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, U.S. Representative to the  Geneva-based UN Human Rights Commission, and as Deputy U.S.  Representative to the UN Security Council. Under President Clinton, he  served as Special Assistant to the President on the staff of the  National Security Council and as Special Advisor to the Secretary of  State. As a diplomat and public servant, he fought against oppressive  regimes around the world. He pressured the Soviet Union to release  political prisoners, end the criminalization of dissent, and allow the  emigration of Soviet Jews. After leaving the U.S. Government,  Ambassador Schifter went on the lead the American Jewish International  Relations Institute, where he fiercely defended the State of Israel and  worked to ensure that other people would never suffer his family's fate  under the Nazis. Until his last day, Ambassador Schifter fought to  promote fairness and democracy and to protect the security and freedom  of others.   I would be remiss if I failed to commemorate Ambassador Schifter's  enormous impact on our home State of Maryland. Ambassador Schifter  served for 20 years on the Maryland State Board of Education, leading  both the Governor's Commission on Funding the Education of Handicapped  Children and the Governor's Commission on Values Education. He was also  the chairman of the Montgomery County Democratic Committee. In all  these roles, he worked to expand equality and opportunity for everyone  in our State. Even as his professional responsibilities spanned the  globe, Ambassador Schifter remained committed to building a brighter  future for his neighbors.   Ambassador Schifter's passing is a staggering loss, but his legacy  lives on and will serve as the true North Star for all of us who share  his devotion to human rights, democracy, and decency. His parent's  decision in 1938 to send their 15-year-old son to a new country, alone,  saved not just his life, but also countless others on whose behalf  Ambassador Schifter worked so indefatigably throughout his illustrious  career. I extend my deepest condolences Ambassador Schifter's children  and grandchildren and all those who were fortunate enough to call  Ambassador Schifter a friend.
