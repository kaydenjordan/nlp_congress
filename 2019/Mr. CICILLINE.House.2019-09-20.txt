 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 1423, Forced Arbitration Injustice  Repeal Act, or the FAIR Act.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1423, the Forced  Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, or the FAIR Act.   Buried deep within the fine print of everyday contracts, forced  arbitration deprives American consumers and workers of their day in  court when they attempt to hold corporations accountable for breaking  the law. This private system lacks the procedural safeguards of our  justice system. It is not subject to oversight, has no judge or jury,  and is not bound by laws passed by Congress or the States, but it has  become a requirement of everyday life. Consumers and workers must  surrender their rights to corporations through forced arbitration  clauses, which are unilaterally imposed by companies before disputes  even arise.   When forced arbitration is combined with nondisclosure agreements, it  effectively silences the victims of rampant corporate misconduct. This  shameful, humiliating, and corrupt system has isolated and silenced  people who are ultimately deprived of their right to hold wrongdoers  accountable through their day in court.   Few instances of this silencing effect are as stark and disturbing as  the experiences of victims of sexual harassment and assault, who are  routinely exploited by forced arbitration.   Forced arbitration has also eroded the fundamental rights of our  Nation's men and women in uniform, veterans, and their families. These  brave Americans have sacrificed much in service to our country. They  have fought to protect the fundamental idea that we are a Nation of  laws and institutions that guarantee the rights to every American and  that every American should have the freedom to enforce these rights  meaningfully.   But for too long, arbitration has eroded these fundamental  protections by forcing servicemembers' claims into a private system set  up by corporations. The Military Coalition, which represents 5.5  million current and former servicemembers, The American Legion, and 29  other military service organizations, notes that forced arbitration has  funneled the claims of servicemembers, veterans, and their families  into ``a rigged, secretive system in which all the rules, including the  choice of the arbitrator, are picked by the corporation.''                                time  0915    Let me give an example. Lieutenant Commander Kevin Ziober, who  testified in support of the FAIR Act earlier this year, has served in  the U.S. Navy Reserves since 2008, but in the fall of 2012, he was  called into Active Duty for deployment to Afghanistan.   Kevin notified his employer and conveyed his desire to resume work  upon his return, but after over 2 years with the company, on the last  day of work, right before his deployment to Afghanistan, following a  farewell party with a big cake with a symbol of the United States flag  on it, he was fired by his employer for serving his country.   When he tried to hold his employer accountable for violating his  rights under USERRA, his company forced his claim into arbitration,  citing an arbitration clause in Kevin's employment contract that he was  required to sign 6 months into his employment waiving his  constitutional right to a jury trial.   This outrageous practice is nothing short of a corporate takeover of  our Nation's system of laws, and the American people have had enough.  The overwhelming majority of voters, including 83 percent of Democrats  and 87 percent of Republicans, support ending forced arbitration. It is  time to act.   H.R. 1423, the FAIR Act, does just that. This important legislation  ends the use of forced arbitration in everyday consumer, employment,  antitrust, and civil rights abuses. It is supported by a broad  coalition of groups dedicated to advancing the rights of women,  servicemembers, veterans, consumers, and hardworking Americans.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would just remind the gentleman that  this is a bipartisan piece of legislation, and the most recent polling  shows 87 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats support it.  So it is broadly bipartisan all across the country. It is bipartisan in  terms of its introduction and sponsorship. It is just not bipartisan in  the Republican caucus, apparently.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson). He is not only a distinguished Member; he is the lead sponsor  and author of the FAIR Act.    Madam Chair, I yield an addition 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath), who has been a fierce advocate for workers and  consumers.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued  that forced arbitration is cheaper or easier than litigation and that  consumers and workers should have a choice.   The FAIR Act doesn't take away anybody's choice. It restores choice.  It restores choice that has been taken away from the American people by  big corporations that don't want to face liability or public scrutiny  for their actions. This is a complete misrepresentation of what the  bill does.   The FAIR Act does not ban arbitration. It eliminates forced  arbitration that is imposed on everyday consumers and hardworking  Americans before a dispute even arises.   And the notion that you have a choice, most consumers don't even know  it is happening. When you check that box on the contract for your phone  or your cable, you have given away your right to have your claims  heard. It is very widespread in consumer employment contracts.   These clauses are hidden, very often, from consumers and workers.  They appear inside of envelopes and delivery boxes in the fine print of  privacy policies, which often span dozens of pages. In most cases,  people aren't even aware that they have signed away their right to a  day in court, simply by using everyday goods and services.   Companies still have the option to use arbitration, but only on a  voluntary basis after a dispute arises and not by unilaterally imposing  it on people by big corporate entities.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), the distinguished senior member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Madam Chair, I would point out the family law cases  that my friend just referenced, of course, are voluntary arbitration  proceedings post dispute. This bill has nothing to do with that. This  is pre-dispute forced arbitration.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), a champion for women, and a Member of  Congress who has fought to be sure that women have their rights  vindicated against powerful corporations for a very long time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier), perhaps Congress' strongest champion for  women, particularly women as it relates to their employers, and someone  who has been an advocate for this for a very long time.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), who has been a very important  champion of this legislation.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished chair of the Education and  Labor Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I want to respond briefly to the notion that somehow  forced arbitration is good for consumers and workers and that they are  really going to miss being forced into these proceedings.   According to a 2017 study by the Economic Policy Institute, consumers  won only 9 percent of the claims brought in arbitration while companies  won 93 percent of the claims. So in terms of who wins, who has the  benefit of this rigged system, it is clear that it is the corporations.   The Economic Policy Institute's economist, Heidi Shierholz, notes  that ``not only do companies win in the overwhelming majority of claims  when consumers are forced into arbitration, they win big.''   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau concluded in 2015 that there  is ``no evidence of arbitration clauses leading to lower prices for  consumers.''   So this notion that even though 83 percent of the American people are  against forced arbitration and even though the evidence shows  overwhelmingly that they lose in them, that somehow they really like  them, it is just not true.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time remains.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would like to build a little bit again on what the real impact of  forced arbitration is on consumers and workers.   According to data from the two biggest arbitration providers, the  American Arbitration Association and JAMS, only 1,909 consumers won a  monetary award in arbitration over a 5-year period. In all nursing home  arbitrations, only four won a monetary reward over that 5-year period.  Of the 11,114 employment claims that were filed, only 282 won a  monetary award. That is 2.5 percent.   Of the 6,012 arbitration cases involving credit cards and banks, only  131 won monetary damages. That is barely 2 percent.   These numbers make it clear that you are more likely to be struck by  lightning than win a monetary award in forced arbitration.   Furthermore, forced arbitration discourages consumers and workers  from adjudicating disputes altogether, while the lower probability of  victory and the meager legal fees associated with forced arbitration  discourage attorneys from representing individuals in arbitration  proceedings.   Even when workers go to arbitration, the system can wreak havoc on  their lives, and we heard many examples, particularly in the context of  sexual assault and harassment victims.   We heard during our hearing on forced arbitration from advocate and  former FOX News commentator Gretchen Carlson who spoke forcefully about  the horrifying effect that forced arbitration has on victims of sexual  assault and harassment.   Again, forced arbitration is corporate immunity. It is rigged because  corporations get to pick the arbitrators and the whole proceeding is  entirely secret.   That is why, overwhelmingly, the American people want forced  arbitration to end once and for all, and that is what the FAIR Act  does.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the distinguished chair of the  full committee.
