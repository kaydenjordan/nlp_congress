 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate Mr. Chris Delesandri on his retirement after a dedicated  41 years of service with United Way of Galveston County Mainland, where  he served as the executive director for the past 10 years.   Not only did Chris serve Galveston County during his time with United  Way, but Chris has also served as the president of the Rotary Club of  Texas City. He was elected to the Roll of Fame for Rotary District 5910  and earned the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards volunteer.   Chris always prioritized giving back to his community, and as such,  he has earned several awards through the Chamber of Commerce, such as  Citizen of the Year in 2008 and the Leslie Hayley Community Service  Award in 2014.   I commend Chris for his numerous accomplishments and his dedicated  service to our district and congratulate him on his retirement. I am so  glad to represent him and call him a friend. He deserves a great  retirement.   Have a good one, buddy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up  H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.
