 Mr. President, I enjoyed that little bit of history  there. I am sure that the Irish everywhere--and those who are, perhaps,  not quite as Irish--will find good reason to celebrate on March 17  whether one is in Florida or in the Northeast or in Alaska, as the  Presiding Officer certainly knows.                                 The Iditarod    Mr. President, I am here to share a little bit of Alaska. I know that  the Presiding Officer will also appreciate the update on an event that  we in Alaska celebrate every year and have for the past 46 years--the  annual Iditarod race.   This is a sled dog race of international fame, a race that begins  just outside of Anchorage, AK, and ends in Nome. It is about 1,000  miles. I think this year's southern route was 998 miles to be exact. It  is one of the longest sled dog races on Earth, and it travels over some  pretty interesting terrain. ``Interesting'' is a choice word to use as  you cross mountains and frozen tundra and forests and the frozen ice.  The Iditarod is, truly, a race for only the most hardy, only the best.   The Iditarod, itself, commemorates the deadly 1925 diphtheria  outbreak that happened in Nome. There was no way to get the diphtheria  antitoxin from the coastal area, down in Seward at the time, all the  way up to Nome. This was before we had air transport as a viable  option. So the real question was, How do you move this? How do you move  this quickly? It was the middle of the winter. This was not a race.  This was a lifesaving mission to move serum, again, 1,000-plus miles to  the north to save a community. They resorted to a relay of dog sleds,  of dog teams, to move that serum.   Today, the Iditarod is no longer a relay. It is a race of individual  sled dog teams. Again, it is about a 1,000-mile race. It is a test of  determination, certainly, of the K-9 mushers, and it is tough. It is  always in the first weekend of March. At this time of year in Alaska,  sometimes conditions can be pretty good--above zero. Sometimes they can  be 30 degrees or 40 degrees below zero. Sometimes you can have a ground  blizzard and wind conditions that move close to 80, 90, 100 miles an  hour, and when you want to talk about windchill, out there, it is real;  it is extreme.   This 46th annual running of the Iditarod hasn't been that challenging  in terms of the cold, in terms of what they have seen in the past, but  there is always some bump. There is always something that causes the  race to be a little bit different. This year, the mushers had a  scheduled checkpoint on Eagle Island. This is a place where they take a  mandatory 8-hour break. The game changer in the race this year was in  the snow conditions. Because of the ceiling, planes could not drop food  for the mushers, so they had to take this very critical checkpoint off  of the board. The mushers plan all of this out in advance of the trip.  They kind of know where they are going to be along the way. They plan  their moves. So this was a pretty unanticipated event at the end and  could have impacted it. Yet you had mushers who were pretty versatile,  pretty adaptable. They took the news in stride and continued up the  Yukon River toward other rest stops there.   Nicolas Petit, who had arrived in Anvik, was the frontrunner at the  time. He was, like, ``Ah, no big deal. My strategy is an evolving  thing.'' Yet that evolving thing allows for, again, curve balls that  get in the way. In the instance of Nicolas Petit, the frontrunner--a  Girdwood musher from a place that the Presiding Officer and I frequent  often and I call home--everyone was quite excited. Long story  [[Page S1750]]  short, he lost the trail and lost the lead.   You think to yourself: Wait a minute. How can you lose the trail?  This is not a NASCAR race, where you just go around the same track  here. This is 1,000 miles. If it is windy, if it is blowing, if there  is ground cover that you can't see through, things happen--things truly  happen. On top of the harsh climate conditions that the mushers face,  there are occasionally chance encounters with some wildlife. You have  moose, caribou, bears, and porcupines out there, and they are all  potential rendezvous for mushers around the trail.   One of the interesting headlines to come out of the Iditarod this  year was a headline that read: ``Iditarod Musher Chases off Bison with  Ax''--an ax, yes. Marcelle Fressineau and her 14-sled dogs were between  Rohn and Nikolai, and they came face-to-face with a mother bison and  her calf. What do you do? You don't want your dogs to be in danger, so  the tough Alaskan woman takes her ax and charges the bison and says,  ``Go away. Go away.'' Long story short, they ran away, and she  continued her journey to Nome. You have to admit that people like this  are ready for adventure and are full of grit and determination to  succeed.   Of course, it is not just the mushers. It is the K-9 athletes. It is  these dogs that, truly, are the inspiration to watch along the journey.  This year's Iditarod kicked off with 67 talented, resilient competitors  from all over Alaska and the world--67 dog teams.   This year, Joar Ulsom was the first musher to arrive in Nome. He came  in just after 3 a.m. on Wednesday morning. He is originally from  Norway, and he has been dreaming of being an Iditarod racer since he  was a kid. In 2011, he relocated to Willow, AK, which is kind of our  dog mushing capital of the world, and he really has made this dream a  reality. He is a seasoned racer. He first completed the Yukon Quest in  2012 and has completed other races since then. He completed--he won the  race in 9 days 12 hours. Again, this is not a recordbreaking time. Snow  slowed things down, but think about standing on the back of a sled for  9 days 12 hours, minimal sleep, constant attention to the dogs in front  of you. It is just an extraordinary story.    The newspapers are telling the story of Joar crossing the finish line  in Nome. Thousands of people had gathered under the burled arch to  congratulate him. It was about 4 degrees, 3 a.m., with thousands of  people out in the street. My brother and sister-in-law came all the way  from Brazil to be there on the other end. It was my sister-in-law's  dream of a lifetime--bucket list--to be there at the end of the  Iditarod.   Joar and his team are happy, and we are very pleased for him. I offer  hearty congratulations to our 2018 Iditarod champion and his team of  amazing dogs.   I wish all the competitors, many of whom are still out on the trail,  success and safety as they compete in this truly ``Last Great Race on  Earth.''                         Tribute to Chuck Kleeschulte    Mr. President, I want to recognize a longtime member of my staff,  Chuck Kleeschulte, who recently retired from the Senate. If you are  from Alaska and you have ever had any dealings with the Alaska  delegation, you have met or have dealt with Chuck Kleeschulte. He is  held in great respect in our State as a result of the work he did for  so many people back home.   It is an understatement to say we miss him already. He hasn't been  gone that long, but we miss him already.   Let me share a little bit of his biography for those who were not  fortunate enough to know and work with Chuck. He is an Alaskan not by  birth but by choice. He moved from Ohio to Alaska in 1976 to work as a  reporter at the Juneau Empire in our capital. A few years later, he  became press secretary for then-Governor Jay Hammond. He followed that  with a stint at the Department of Environmental Conservation and then  he returned to reporting for a few more years.   Chuck first came to the Senate in 1991. He was convinced by my father  Frank Murkowski, who was a Senator at the time, to move to Washington,  DC, to be his press secretary. So he did. He made the move, and now 27  years later, Chuck is still part of the family here. He served as my  father's communications director, a legislative assistant in my  personal office, and most recently as a senior adviser for the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee.   Chuck, I think it is fair to say, is an institution within our  institution. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of all things Alaska. If  someone wanted to know what the vote was on a measure back in 1993 that  related to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline or whatever, Chuck would be able  to recall that without any notes, without any prodding, without any  background. Chuck is extraordinary. He has a work ethic that is second  to none.   We have a phrase that has been around for about 30 years now, and it  is ``Check with Chuck.'' Just check with Chuck because you don't need  to do any fact-checking. He is it.   His legislative achievements are almost too many to name. Let me talk  about some of the big-ticket Alaska items that Chuck was involved with.  He was involved with responsible energy development in the 1002 area.  He led this fight for us for decades as we sought to open up ANWR. He  has been the lead on a lifesaving road for the good people of King Cove  that we just, again, have been successful with. He has been working to  build out a safer route on the Sterling Highway, a much needed timber  supply in the Tongass National Forest. He wrote legislation to ensure  the transfer of lands owed to Alaska, to promote the construction of an  Alaska gasline, and to expand the use of renewable resources, such as  hydropower, marine hydrokinetic, and geothermal. Chuck was involved  with all of it.   He has been involved in so many significant accomplishments for our  State, but what is equally impressive is the work Chuck did very  quietly and just every day for Alaskans all over the State. Whether it  was a bridge that needed repair, a light pole that had toppled over in  bad weather, land use fees that had been miscalculated by a Federal  agency, a land exchange for a remote community, Chuck was always there.  No matter how small the problem, no matter how complicated it may be,  Chuck was there to work on it.   Chuck has only been retired now for a few weeks, and the people I  talk to are all asking: How is Chuck doing? Where is Chuck? They all  say they are going to miss him, and I say how much I already do.   It is a comfort to know that Chuck is not going too far. He is  retiring from Washington, DC, and he is moving to a beautiful little  farm in Floyd, VA. Apparently there is only one stoplight in Chuck's  new town, but I think Chuck is going to keep busy. His better half Tori  says she wants a cow. They want to grow a little bit of hay, and there  is grass to mow. There is a half-acre pond that apparently is stocked  with fish. There is a barn we all volunteered to help him paint this  summer. We will figure out time to do the barn painting.   To the people of Floyd, congratulations on bringing Chuck into the  fold. We know the barn, the cow, the hay, the pond, the single  stoplight, and the community are all very lucky to have him. I  certainly was.   He spent 27 years in Congress and near double that working on behalf  of Alaska in some fashion or another. Chuck's guidance and work have  not only benefited me but the State and people of Alaska and the rest  of our country.   My favorite part, what I loved best about Chuck is, after all he has  done and all he has accomplished, he is still one of the most humble  guys you will ever meet. I told him that recently, and he said: ``Oh,  yeah, it's easy to be humble when you have a lot to be humble about.''   Chuck was just that way. He is always modest, but the example he set  as a true public servant is one to emulate. He worked hard every day-- every day. He made our office a better place. He helped people, and in  doing so, he left some truly enormous shoes to fill.   Should anybody doubt that Chuck left a lasting impression, all we  have to do is look at the single space, 50-page exit memo he wrote to  give the rest of my staff, giving them updates on everything he had  been working on, the status, whom to contact, what to do next. Chuck  left the guidebook. He is incredibly thorough, amazingly impressive,  and always appreciated.   So I want to thank Chuck Kleeschulte. Thank you. Thank you for  [[Page S1751]]  everything you did for me, for Alaska, and for our Nation. You will  always be a part of our Senate family and a beloved member of Team  Murkowski. After 27 years, and on behalf of those who knew him, I wish  Chuck the absolute best as he begins his very well-deserved retirement.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kennis  Brady, a member of my staff, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the day.
