 Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce  legislation that will finally put an end to the separation of families  at our southern border. I have believed from the outset that the  administration was wrong to pursue a zero tolerance policy of family  separation, which is cruel and detrimental to children and parents  alike.   The President claimed to end this policy in June by executive order,  but we have learned that the practice of separating families continues  today. In fact, the separations may have been broader in scope than we  previously knew.   Last year, the American people were rightly horrified when thousands  of children, including babies and toddlers, were taken from their  parents, to be separated for weeks and months. Dozens of these children  spent days and weeks in cages with nothing but thin mats and aluminum  blankets.   In response, people from all walks of life--Republicans, Democrats,  clergy, the medical community, business leaders, labor organizers-- stood up and  [[Page S803]]  said, ``enough is enough.'' Average Americans spoke out, marched, and  called their members of Congress pleading for us to stand up to the  President and demand he reverse his policy.   But we still may not know the full scope of the harm that was caused.  We still do not know just how many families were torn apart as a result  of the zero tolerance policy.   Litigation has identified over 2,700 children who were separated from  their parents by DHS, including nearly 100 children under the age of 5.  However, in January the Inspector General for Health and Human Services  found that ``this number does not represent the full scope of family  separations.'' Indeed thousands--thousands--more children may have been  separated from their parents in 2017, before the start of the  accounting period required by the court.   We have also learned in recent weeks that this crisis is not over.  Families are still being separated from one another.   In June, the Trump administration issued an executive order that  ended the ``zero tolerance'' family separation policy. Despite that  order, the practice of family separation did not end.   Instead, the Inspector General for Health and Human Services reported  that separations are ongoing with little oversight or accountability.  In fact, at least 118 children were separated from their parents  between June 2018, when the executive order was issued, and early  November.   These family separations could not have happened if Republicans had  joined me and all Senate Democrats to pass the Keep Families Together  Act last Congress. The Keep Families Together Act prohibits Border  Patrol from separating children from their parents or legal guardians,  without good cause.   Good cause is defined with a focus on the best interest of the child,  and cannot be based on the parent's migration or crossing of the  border. No separation can be made without consulting a child welfare  specialist, and all presumptions are made in favor of family unity,  including unity of siblings.   The Keep Families Together Act includes vital oversight mechanisms  that will ensure that every child separated under the zero tolerance  policy is accounted for. These include a requirement for DHS to publish  transparent guidance on separations, as well as annual reporting  requirements and a requirement for a GAO report on criminal prosecution  of asylum seekers.   These are basic protections for children that should not be  controversial. Parents who try to protect their children from violence  and poverty abroad, should not be punished by having those children  ripped from their arms. Children should not be subjected to severe  trauma in the interest of deterring migration.   Instead, families should be kept together and given a fair chance to  present their cases for asylum. The Keep Families Together Act will  provide these fundamental necessities and protect children from further  harm. We have a fresh start in a new Congress. It is time to make these  vital protections a reality.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Cardin):   S. 296. A bill to amend XVIII of the Social Security Act to ensure  more timely access to home health services for Medicare beneficiaries  under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the  ``Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act.'' This legislation would  help implement a consensus-driven regional land management plan by  directing the Bureau of Land Management to exchange land with the San  Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District in San Bernardino,  California.   Before I continue, I would like to thank Senators Lisa Murkowski and  Maria Cantwell, as well as their staffs, for their hard work to move  this bill forward last Congress. With their assistance, this  legislation passed out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee in August 2018 and was included in a bipartisan public lands  package.   I thank Senator Murkowski for introducing a bipartisan lands package  bill this Congress and including this legislation in it. I look forward  to working once again with Senator Murkowski, as well as the newly  designated Ranking Member, Senator Manchin, to maintain our momentum  and pass this bill as quickly as possible.   I also would like to express my gratitude to Representative Paul Cook  and his staff for their continuing work and collaboration on this  legislation. Lastly, I welcome working with Representative Cook and  Representative Aguilar who are cosponsoring companion legislation in  the House of Representatives. Lastly, I thank Senator Harris for  cosponsoring this legislation.   This bill is an excellent example of how smart, sustainable, land  planning can be accomplished through interagency cooperation. Federal  and State agencies, private industry, and municipalities representing  mining, flood control, water supply, wildlife conservation, and other  interests all came to the table to develop a land management plan that  accounts for the array of land uses in this area.   The land exchange facilitated by this bill is broadly supported,  including by: County of San Bernardino, City of Redlands, City of  Highland, San Bernardino Water Conservation District, San Bernardino  Valley Municipal Water District, East Valley Water District, Endangered  Habitats League, CEMEX Construction Materials Pacific, Robertson's  Ready Mix, Inland Action.   This diverse group of entities formed the ``Wash Committee'' in 1993  to address mining and land management in the upper Santa Ana River wash  area.   I applaud the Committee, along with federal, state and local  stakeholders, for working together to develop a strategy for  comprehensive land management planning for the area. This group has  shown that through cooperation, it is possible to both protect the  environment and support local business and community interests.   The land exchange between the San Bernardino Water Conservation  District and the Bureau of Land Management will consolidate open space  for conservation purposes and optimize the efficiency of mining  operations and water conservation efforts.   The exchange will also set aside new land for conservation purposes  near land already managed by BLM.   This bill will lead to increased habitat protection, groundwater  recharge, and public access while allowing for the continued use of  land and mineral resources.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the ``Santa Ana  River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act'' as soon as possible.   Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SANDERS:   S. 309. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  reinstate estate and generation-skipping taxes, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Finance.

Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______    Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution in  observance of ``National Trafficking and Modern Slavery Prevention  Month.'' This resolution is meant to bring awareness to the worldwide  scourge of human trafficking.   All of us, as Americans, must raise our awareness of this pernicious  crime that often goes unnoticed and undetected in our communities.  Human trafficking claims over 40 million victims globally. It has also  created an estimated $150 billion global industry, an industry that  affects every State in America.   Traffickers prey on vulnerable populations, like those in the  juvenile justice system, and use physical and psychological techniques  to control their victims behind closed doors: isolating them from the  public, exploiting language and cultural barriers, and threatening  victims with violence. These techniques often prevent victims from  coming forward. All of us can do better in recognizing warning signs.   I have been heartened that recently, various private entities, such  as hotels, the travel industry, and those in the convenience-store  industry, have all come together to commit to training their employees  to better detect human trafficking. In addition to raising awareness,  January is also a month to renew our commitment to enforce, and enact,  laws to help eradicate trafficking.   For example, in 2000, Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act, which marked a strong commitment to prosecute human  traffickers and better aid victims.   Last Congress, then-Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley and I authored  the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which was complemented by  Senators Cornyn's and Klobuchar's Abolish Human Trafficking Act. Both  of those bills update our trafficking laws to better aid victims.   Bipartisan members of Congress worked together to address this  critical issue, and I am proud that both bills were signed into law  last month.   Finally, in introducing today's resolution, I would like to thank  Senators Grassley, Leahy, Cornyn, Klobuchar, Isakson, Markey, Shaheen,  Blumenthal, Brown, Toomey, and Rubio for cosponsoring the resolution.   Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the Floor.                            ____________________
