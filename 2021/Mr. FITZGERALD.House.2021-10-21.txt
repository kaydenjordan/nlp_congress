 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, amnesty is not infrastructure, and I know this seems  obvious to many Americans, but I know for some of my colleagues they  are trying to redefine. And what is tucked away right now in the $5.5  trillion spending package are provisions that would give amnesty to  over a million illegal immigrants.   I have been to the border. Some of my colleagues that I have been  able to visit the border with are here this evening.   Eye-opening experiences in McAllen, Texas. And in the travel back to  Houston to fly back to Wisconsin, I saw a plane that was full of  refugees with brown envelopes and destinations written in black magic  marker. And I just wondered who could possibly be sponsoring all of  these individuals and where would they end up.   We know that there is 11 million illegal immigrants living in the  U.S. today. Not only does this provision pose a risk to national  security, but studies have found that it is going to cost us trillions  of dollars in payouts in increased entitlement benefits.   Mr. Speaker, what I witnessed, and I think what I have experienced  back in Wisconsin, has put us in a position where unless we act now,  unless we act swiftly to get a handle on the southern border, we will  no longer have the borders that bind us Americans. And I don't think  the urgency could be any more clear and any more in front of us right  now.
