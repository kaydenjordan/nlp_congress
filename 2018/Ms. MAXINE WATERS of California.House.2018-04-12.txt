 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of the importance that Vietnam war memorials have in our  Nation's remembrance and commemoration of Vietnam veterans and their  distinguished devotion to duty and country.   The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a symbol of honor, recognition, and  remembrance of the more than 58,000 military servicemembers who  sacrificed their lives or remain missing to this day and the over 8.7  million brave men and women who served over the course of the Vietnam  war. More than 5.6 million people visit the memorial each year.   Not long after the memorial opened, it became clear that families  across the country, not just those visiting  [[Page H3156]]  Washington, D.C., greatly desired the opportunity to remember those we  have lost and pay their respects to the approximately 7.3 million  Vietnam war veterans living today.   To accommodate, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund built an iconic  replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. This replica travels across  the country as part of The Wall That Heals exhibit, stopping in  approximately 39 communities each year. The replica is 375 feet in  length, 7.5 feet high at its tallest point, and includes 140 panels,  each engraved with the names of fallen United States Armed Forces  servicemembers who served during the Vietnam war. It has been displayed  at almost 600 communities nationwide.   There are roughly 7,500 Vietnam veterans living in my district, the  43rd Congressional District, alone, and over 570,000 in the State of  California. California is home to more veterans than any other State-- almost 2 million. The residents of my district and the State of  California deserve the opportunity to say thank you to some of the  bravest Americans who have ever lived and remember those they may have  lost.   I worked with the city of Gardena and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial  Fund for 2 years to bring the replica to my district, and I am so happy  to say that we recently succeeded. This past weekend, The Wall That  Heals arrived in one of my cities, the city of Gardena, California, to  a welcoming crowd of hundreds who came to pay their respects and honor  Vietnam veterans.   In my opinion, full and appropriate recognition of our Vietnam  veterans is long overdue. The war often separated friends and families,  both physically and politically, and created divisions which have taken  years to heal. Many veterans have spoken about how difficult this was  and how much harder this made the healing process.   No matter what you may have felt about the war, we should all honor  the sacrifice made by our veterans who answered their country's call,  who served, and who sacrificed.   This country should be and is honored to acknowledge and express  appreciation for the sacrifices Vietnam veterans and their families  made, both during their service and over the many years since. The  Vietnam Veterans Memorial, The Wall That Heals, and the dozens of local  museums and memorials allow us to pay proper respect to and commemorate  our Vietnam veterans.   I have just introduced a resolution in recognition of the Vietnam  Veterans Memorial, its traveling replica, which is one part of The Wall  That Heals exhibit, and the Vietnam veterans for their devotion to  neighbor, community, and country.   I say once again: Welcome home, Vietnam veterans.                            ____________________
