 Mr. Speaker, I urge support of my amendment,  which would permit the Secretary of HHS to receive unused and  oftentimes just about to expire COVID vaccines from States and be able  to redistribute them to foreign partners or allies.   Now, my primary legislation before the body in Congress is called  NOVID. It is a play on words, no more COVID. And this legislation would  actually establish a program to help vaccinate 60 percent of the  population of the world's 92 poorest countries. I hope that this  legislation is taken up by this body and supported by the  administration.   In the meantime, the very least that we can do is to donate unused  vaccines from the States. Now, these vaccines are about to expire. They  are going to be no good in just a matter of months, and so instead of  allowing them to go to waste, we should donate them abroad.   This is not only the right thing to do to help to end suffering  abroad, but it is the smart thing to do because then it helps to  prevent variants that are generated abroad from coming back home to the  United States and further wreaking havoc on our economy.   On top of that, we see the Chinese Communist Party going around the  world peddling their ineffective Sinovac vaccine, and we should be  instead vaccinating those populations with effective vaccines.   Again, I hope that the administration utilizes this amendment to  great impact, and I hope that they also do more and endorse my NOVID  legislation.
