 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.  [[Page H3219]]    I rise today in support of H.R. 3593, the Department of Energy  Science for the Future Act. As a newly minted member of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee, I was so proud to see my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle work so hard on this bill to pass it through  committee with amendments from both Democrats and Republicans. I, too,  had an opportunity as a newly minted member to make an impact on this  important legislation.   And I think that it wasn't by accident, and I thank the chairwoman of  the committee, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson and Representative  Lucas, the ranking member, for creating the environment in which we  could do our work and craft this important legislation.   As you all have heard, the Department of Energy's Office of Science  is a hub of technological advancement and research designed to tackle  our greatest scientific challenges facing the United States.   Through several hearings in the committee, we learned about the DOE  Office of Science's ongoing efforts to support research and to find  solutions.   This bill allows the Office of Science to continue carrying out  nondefense research on a vast array of critical areas. It supports  research to modernize our energy infrastructure, allowing us the tools  to overhaul our outdated energy grid to more climate-friendly  solutions. And we, of course, have seen some of the catastrophic events  caused by the lack of current technologies that recognize the climate  action.   It funds continuing studies in artificial intelligence and quantum  computing, keeping pace with our competitors in the tech sector and  readying our cybersecurity defenses from our adversaries, as we have  seen up close and personal the cost to our country to not keep abreast  of these technologies.   During markup, I was able to offer a provision that was included in  the bill that is before the House today that would prioritize clean  water and watershed research at the Office of Science. My amendment  directs the Office of Science to support clean water and watershed  research that increases the quality and quantity of water across  America, including the treasured Great Lakes.   My home district of Milwaukee shares a coast with Lake Michigan,  which I consider one of my most important constituents.   It is imperative that we study the harmful effects of water  pollution, make investments in technologies to combat the contamination  of our waterways, and to protect drinking water sources that are  critical to every man, woman, and child. We also need to make sure that  water continues to be a resource for commerce.   My amendment also ensures that relevant communities, research  institutions, and nonprofits will be at the table when DOE carries out  these tasks. Innovation doesn't occur in a vacuum, and it is critical  that these research efforts have real world input from key  stakeholders.   Before I close, I want to mention something about the National  Science Foundation, H.R. 2225, which we considered on this floor today.  I thank the chair and the ranking member for leaning in again to put  this together in giving Members an opportunity to weigh in.   As you all know, the NSF is the funder of more than 1,800  institutions in the United States, and they provide tremendous  resources, funding, and opportunities for STEM students. I have been  able to weigh in to make sure that there is diversity and opportunity  in STEM.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3593, the Department of Energy  Science for the Future Act.                                time  1745
