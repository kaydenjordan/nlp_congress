 We were surveying the data to understand who       was contributing what and sort of in what categories.         Yes.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. How else do we know that the President was  awaiting information on burden-sharing and anti-corruption efforts in  Ukraine before releasing the security assistance? Because that is what  Vice President Pence told President Zelensky.   On September 1, 2019, Vice President Pence met with President  Zelensky. President Trump was scheduled to attend the World War II  commemoration in Poland but instead remained in the United States to  manage the emergency response to Hurricane Dorian. Remember, this was 3  days--3 days--after President Zelensky learned through the POLITICO  article about the review of the security assistance. Just as Vice  President Pence and his aides anticipated, Jennifer Williams testified  that once the cameras left the room, the very first question that  President Zelensky had was about the status of the security assistance.  The Vice President responded by asking about two things: burden-sharing  and corruption.   Here is how Jennifer Williams described it:         And the VP responded by really expressing our ongoing       support for Ukraine, but wanting to hear from President       Zelensky, you know, what the status of his reform efforts       were that he could then convey back to the President, and       also wanting to hear if there  [[Page S586]]       was more that European countries could do to support Ukraine.    Vice President Pence knows President Trump, and he knew what  President Trump wanted to hear from President Zelensky. The Vice  President was echoing the President's two recurring themes: corruption  and burden-sharing. It is the same, consistent themes every time.   Ambassador Taylor received a similar readout of the meeting between  the Vice President and President Zelensky, including the Vice  President's focus on corruption and burden-sharing. Here is Ambassador  Taylor.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. On the evening of September 1st, I       received a readout of the Pence-Zelensky meeting over the       phone from Mr. Morrison during which he told me that       President Zelensky had opened the meeting by immediately       asking the Vice President about the security cooperation. The       Vice President did not respond substantively but said that he       would talk to President Trump that night. The Vice President       did say that President Trump wanted the Europeans to do more       to support Ukraine and that he wanted the Ukrainians to do       more to fight corruption.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. On September 11, based on the information  collected and presented to President Trump, the President lifted the  pause on the security assistance. As Mr. Morrison explained, ``our  process gave the President the confidence he needed to approve the  release of the security-sector assistance.''   The House managers say that the talk about corruption and burden- sharing is a ruse. No one knew why the security assistance was paused,  and no one was addressing the President's concerns with Ukrainian  corruption and burden-sharing. The House managers' own evidence--their  own record--tells a different story, however. They didn't tell you  about this, not in 21 hours. Why not?   The President's concerns were addressed in the ordinary course. The  President wasn't caught, as the House managers allege. The managers are  wrong. All of this, together with what we discussed on Saturday,  demonstrates that there was no connection between security assistance  and investigations.   When the House managers realized their ``quid pro quo'' theory on  security assistance was falling apart, they created a second  alternative theory. According to the House managers, President Zelensky  desperately wanted a meeting at the White House with President Trump,  and President Trump conditioned that meeting on investigations.   What about the managers' backup accusations? Do they fare any better  than their quid pro quo for security assistance? No. No, they don't.   A Presidential-level meeting happened without any preconditions at  the first available opportunity in a widely televised meeting at the  United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 25, 2019. The  White House was working to schedule the meeting earlier at the White  House or in Warsaw, but those options fell through due to normal  scheduling and a hurricane. The two Presidents met at the earliest  convenience without President Zelensky ever announcing or beginning any  investigations.   The first thing to know about the alleged quid pro quo for a meeting  is that by the end of the July 25 call, the President had invited  President Zelensky to the White House on three separate occasions, each  time without any preconditions.   President Trump invited President Zelensky to an in-person meeting on  their initial April 21 call. He said: ``When you're settled in and  ready, I'd like to invite you to the White House.''   On May 29, the week after President Zelensky's inauguration,  President Trump sent a congratulatory letter, again, inviting President  Zelensky to the White House. He said:         As you prepare to address the many challenges facing       Ukraine, please know that the American people are with you       and are committed to helping Ukraine realize its vast       potential. To help show that commitment, I would like to       invite you to meet with me at the White House in Washington,       D.C., as soon as we can find a mutually convenient time.    Then, on July 25, President Trump personally invited President  Zelensky to participate in a meeting for a third time. He said:  Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.  Give us a date, and we'll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.   Those are three separate invitations for a meeting, all made without  any preconditions.   During this time, and behind the scenes, the White House was working  diligently to schedule a meeting between the Presidents at the earliest  possible date. Tim Morrison, whose responsibilities included helping to  arrange head-of-state visits to the White House or other head-of-state  meetings, testified that he understood that arranging the White House  visit with President Zelensky was a do-out that came from the  President.   The House managers didn't mention the work that the White House was  doing to schedule the meeting between President Trump and President  Zelensky; did they? Why not?   Scheduling a Presidential meeting takes time. Mr. Morrison testified  that his directorate, which was just one of several, had a dozen  schedule requests in with the President for meetings with foreign  leaders that we were looking to land and Ukraine was but one of those  requests.   According to Mr. Morrison, due to both Presidents' busy schedule,  ``it became clear that the `earliest opportunity for the two Presidents  to meet would be in Warsaw' at the beginning of September.''   The entire notion that a bilateral meeting between President Trump  and President Zelensky was somehow conditioned on a statement about  investigations is completely defeated by one straightforward fact: A  bilateral meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky was  planned for September 1 in Warsaw--the same Warsaw meeting we were just  discussing--without the Ukrainians saying a word about investigations.   As it turned out, President Trump was not able to attend the meeting  in Warsaw because of Hurricane Dorian. President Trump asked Vice  President Pence to attend in his place, but even that scheduling glitch  did not put off their meeting for long. President Trump and President  Zelensky met at the next available date, September 25, on the sidelines  of the United Nations General Assembly.   As President Zelensky, himself, has said, there were ``no  preconditions'' for his meeting with President Trump. Those are his  words: ``No conditions.''   You are probably wondering how the House managers could claim there  was a quid pro quo for a meeting with President Trump when the two  Presidents actually did meet without President Zelensky announcing any  investigations? Well, the House managers moved the goalpost again. They  claim that the meeting couldn't be just an in-person meeting with  President Trump. What it had to be was a meeting at the Oval Office and  in the White House. That is nonsense.   Putting to one side the absurdity of the House managers trying to  remove a duly-elected President of the United States from office  because he met with a world leader in one location versus another, this  theory has no basis in fact.   As Dr. Hill testified, what mattered was that there was a bilateral  Presidential meeting, not the location of the meeting. She said:         [I]t wasn't always a White House meeting per se, but       definitely a Presidential-level, you know, meeting with       Zelensky and the President. I mean, it could've taken place       in Poland, in Warsaw. It could've been, you know, a proper       bilateral in some other context. But, in other words, a White       House-level Presidential meeting.    The House managers didn't tell you about Dr. Hill's testimony. Why  not? In fact, just last week they said that President Zelensky still  hasn't gotten his White House meeting. Why didn't they tell you about  Dr. Hill's testimony so you would have the full context and  information? They spoke for over 21 hours. They couldn't take a couple  of minutes to give you that context? How else do we know that Dr. Hill  was right? Because President Zelensky said so on the July 25 call.   Remember, when President Trump invited President Zelensky to  Washington on the July 25 call, President Zelensky said he would be  ``happy to meet with you personally'' and offered to host President  Trump in Ukraine or, on the other hand, meet with President Trump on  September 1 in Poland. That is exactly what the administration planned  to do.  [[Page S587]]    If it weren't for Hurricane Dorian, President Trump would have met  with President Zelensky in Poland on September 1, just as President  Zelensky had requested and without any preconditions.   As it happened, President Zelensky met with the Vice President  instead and just a few weeks later met with President Trump in New  York--all without anyone making any statement about any investigations.  And, once again, not a single witness in the House record that they  compiled and developed under their procedures that we have discussed  and will continue to discuss, provided any firsthand evidence that the  President ever linked the Presidential meeting to any investigations.   The House managers have seized upon Ambassador Sondland's claim that  Mr. Giuliani's requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House  visit for President Zelensky. But, again, Ambassador Sondland was only  guessing based on incomplete information. He testified that the  President never told him there was any sort of a condition for a  meeting with President Zelensky. Why, then, did he think there was one?   In his own words, Ambassador Sondland said that he could only repeat  what he heard ``through Ambassador Volker from Giuliani.'' So he didn't  even hear from Mr. Giuliani himself. But Ambassador Volker, who is the  supposed link between Mr. Giuliani and Ambassador Sondland, thought no  such thing. Ambassador Volker testified unequivocally that there was no  linkage between the meeting with President Zelensky and Ukrainian  investigations.   I am going to read the full questions and answers because this  passage is key. This is from Ambassador Volker's deposition testimony.         Question. Did President Trump ever withhold a meeting with       President Zelensky or delay a meeting with President Zelensky       until the Ukrainians committed to investigate the allegations       that you just described concerning the 2016 Presidential       election?        Answer. The answer to the question is no, if you want a       yes-or-no answer. But the reason the answer is no is we did       have difficulty scheduling a meeting, but there was no       linkage like that.        Question. You said that you were not aware of any linkage       between delaying the Oval Office meeting between President       Trump and President Zelensky and the Ukrainian commitment to       investigate the two allegations as you described them,       correct?        Answer. Correct.    Over the past week, on no fewer than 15 separate occasions, the House  managers played a video of Ambassador Sondland saying that the  announcement of the investigations was a prerequisite for a meeting or  call with the President--15 times. They never once read to you the  testimony that I just did. They never once read to you the testimony in  which Ambassador Volker refuted what Ambassador Sondland claimed he  heard from Ambassador Volker.   Here is what we know. President Trump invited President Zelensky to  meet three times without preconditions. The White House was working  behind the scenes to schedule the meeting. The two Presidents planned  to meet in Warsaw, just as President Zelensky had asked, and ultimately  met 3 weeks later without Ukraine announcing any investigations.   No one testified in the House record that the President ever said  there was a connection between a meeting and investigations. Those are  the facts, plain and simple. So much for a quid pro quo for a meeting  with the President.   Before I move on, let me take a brief moment to address a side  allegation that was raised in the original whistleblower complaint and  that the House managers are still trying to push.   The managers claim that President Trump ordered Vice President Pence  not to attend President Zelensky's inauguration in favor of a lower  ranking delegation in order--according to them--to single a downgrading  of the relationship between the United States and Ukraine.   That is not true. As I am sure everyone in this room can greatly  appreciate, numerous factors had to align for the VP to attend.   First, dates of travel were limited. For national security reasons,  the President and Vice President generally avoid being out of the  country at the same time for more than a few hours.   The President had scheduled trips to Europe and Japan during the  period when our Embassy in Ukraine anticipated the Ukrainian  inauguration would occur, at the end of May or in early June. Jennifer  Williams testified that the Office of the Vice President advised the  Ukrainians that, if the Vice President were to participate in the  inauguration, the ideal dates would be around May 29, May 30, May 31,  or June 1, when the President would be in the United States. She said  ``if it wasn't one of those dates, it would be very difficult or  impossible'' for the Vice President to attend.   Second, the House managers act as if no other priorities in the world  could compete for the administration's time. The Vice President's  Office was simultaneously planning a competing trip for May 30 in  Ottawa, Canada, to participate in an event supporting passage of the  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Ultimately, the Vice President  traveled to Ottawa on May 30 to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  and to promote the passage of the USMCA. This decision, as you know,  advanced the top administration priority and an issue President Trump  vigorously supported.   What you did not hear from the House managers was that the Ukrainian  inauguration dates did not go as planned. On May 16--May 16--the  Ukrainians surprised everyone and scheduled the inauguration for just 4  days later, on May 20--Monday, May 20. So think about that: May 16, May  20. Get everybody--security, advance, everyone--to Ukraine. Jennifer  Williams testified that it was very short notice, so it would have been  difficult for the Vice President to attend, particularly since they  hadn't sent out the advance team.   George Kent testified that the short notice left almost no time for  either proper preparations or foreign delegations to visit and that the  State Department scrambled on Friday the 17th to try and figure out who  was available. Mr. Kent suggested that Secretary of Energy Perry be the  anchor for the delegation, as ``someone who was a person of stature and  whose job had relevance to our agenda.'' Secretary Perry led the  delegation, which also included Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker,  and Senator Johnson. Ambassador Volker testified that it was the  largest delegation from any country there, and it was a high-level one.  The House managers didn't tell you this. Why not?   The claim that the President instructed the Vice President not to  attend President Zelensky's inauguration is based on House manager  assumptions with no evidence that the President did something wrong.   Finally, as I am coming to the end, if the evidence doesn't show a  quid pro quo, what does it show? Unfortunately for the House managers,  one of the few things that all of the witnesses agreed on was that  President Trump has strengthened the relationship between the United  States and Ukraine and that he has been a more stalwart friend to  Ukraine and a more fierce opponent of Russian aggression than President  Obama. The House managers repeatedly claimed that President Trump  doesn't care about Ukraine. They are attributing views to President  Trump that are contrary to his actions. More importantly, they are  contrary to the House managers' own evidence.   But don't take my word for it. Ambassadors Yovanovitch, Taylor, and  Volker all testified to the Trump administration's positive new policy  toward Ukraine based especially on President Trump's decision to  provide lethal aid to Ukraine. Ambassador Taylor testified that  President Trump's policy toward Ukraine was a substantial improvement  over President Obama's policy. Ambassador Volker agreed that America's  policy toward Ukraine has been strengthened under President Trump, whom  he credited with approving each of the decisions made along the way.   Ambassador Yovanovitch testified that President Trump's decision to  provide lethal weapons to Ukraine meant that our policy actually got  stronger over the last 3 years. She called the policy shift that  President Trump directed very significant. Let's hear from Ambassador  Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and Ambassador Yovanovitch.
