 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Jerry Ronning, of Ronning Auto, Truck and Tractor in Carbon  County for winning business of the year at the Red Lodge Chamber of  Commerce Awards.   Jerry was nominated for the award because of his commitment to the  community and the excellent services he provides for locals and  tourists in the Red Lodge area.   Red Lodge Assistant Police Chief Scott Cope nominated Jerry saying,  ``Whatever the time of day or the time of year they go all out to help  the community. They routinely drop everything to help trapped motorists  on the Beartooth Pass. They embody the definition of small town,  hometown pride.''   Assistant Police Chief Cope's words describe exactly why the folks of  Red Lodge are proud of Jerry and Ronning Auto, Truck and Tractor.   It is my honor to recognize Jerry for earning the Business of the  Year  [[Page S1595]]  Award, and I, along with all of the folks of Red Lodge, are grateful  for the services Ronning Auto, Truck and Tractor provide for the  community.                            ____________________
