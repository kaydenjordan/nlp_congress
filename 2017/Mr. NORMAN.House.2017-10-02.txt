 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague from  Arizona's bill, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, as well  as the rights of the unborn. As a father of 4 children and a  grandfather to 15 grandchildren, I strongly believe that life begins at  conception. I wholeheartedly feel that nothing is more precious or  beautiful than a life. I will do everything in my power to continue to  advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves.   Since the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973, nearly 60 million abortions  have been performed. Mr. Speaker, this is a moral atrocity. I am a  proud cosponsor of H.R. 36, which would make it illegal to attempt or  to perform an abortion if an unborn child is 20 weeks or older with  exceptions. Science has proven that babies are capable of feeling pain  at the start of the third trimester. It is imperative that we protect  the lives of the unborn.   Our Nation was built upon the idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness. We guarantee that every American citizen has a right to  pursue absolute happiness. Our Constitution guarantees that every  American has the right to liberty and justice.   Should we, as Americans, not guarantee that every American has a  right to life as well?   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of  this bill and the protection of the sanctity of life for all Americans.
