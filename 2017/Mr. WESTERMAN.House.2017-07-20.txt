 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 218, the King  Cove Road Land Exchange Act. I thank Congressman Don Young for his  tireless work on this pressing issue.   Nineteen people: the cost of decades of inaction by the Federal  Government, Mr. Chairman, is 19 American lives.   Expedient access to a hospital is something most Americans can,  fortunately, take for granted. For many, emergency services are an  ambulance ride away. Not for the citizens of King Cove, Alaska.   Adjacent to the Aleutian Islands, the 1,000 residents of King Cove,  Alaska, are connected to hospitals in the region via a small runway and  a ferry. Harsh winter storms ground planes and prevent safe sea travel,  cutting off residents from hospitals and necessary supplies.   In truly dire emergencies, King Cove residents have but two choices.  Number one is to pray a boat captain will brave enormous seas. Or wait  until the Coast Guard can dispatch a medivac helicopter.   Mr. Chairman, allow me to read some of the stories of those who have  braved the sea, or held out until help arrived.   Take, for example, Lonnie Brandell, who had to hoist his ailing  father out of a fishing boat during a blizzard. After a perilous 3-hour  journey to Cold Bay, the sea was so rough his boat could not dock.  Brandell had to tie a rope around his father and allow him to be pulled  to safety. To quote Brandell: ``It was not a good scenario at all. But  if we had stayed here one more day, even 10 or 12 more hours, he would  not have lived.''   Or take Etta Kuzakin, who went into labor early. Unable to safely  leave King Cove during a storm, it took the Coast Guard 8 hours to  arrive to rescue her. ``I was lucky,'' she says. ``The Coast Guard was  in the area. That is really what it was. They were in the area.''   Mr. Chairman, this is shameful. Our citizens should not have to wait  hours for a medivac, or brave treacherous seas while we sit here and  debate this issue. No American should have to perish while we argue  whether or not a refuge would be better off with 81 or 70 miles of  gravel road.   I urge my colleagues to listen to the stories of Etta Kuzakin, Lonnie  Brandell, and others. I urge my colleagues to think about the 19  Americans who perished for want of a gravel road.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 218.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to show my support for the  ``Made in America'' Week initiative. It is an initiative to highlight  the contributions of American workers and job creators.   Made in America brings to mind a combination of the American spirit  of innovation and perseverance that is required to turn raw materials  into manufactured goods.   I am proud of the contributions that my home State of Arkansas makes  to the American economy. In Arkansas, 13 percent of the State's  workforce is employed in the manufacturing industry, which is the  second highest percentage in the South and the third highest percentage  in the Nation. Twenty-eight percent of those jobs in Arkansas are in  the Fourth District.   In 2016, manufacturers contributed $2.2 trillion to the American  economy. For every dollar spent in manufacturing, an additional $1.80  is added to another part of the economy.   With abundant resources, a strong infrastructure, and a second-to- none work ethic, Arkansas is working to train the next generation of  technicians and visionaries so that manufacturing can expand, promoting  better careers, stronger families, and thriving communities.                            ____________________
