 Madam Speaker, almost from the day that I have been  elected to Congress, I have looked forward to the opportunity to honor  my wife's great-grandmother.   She was able to vote in the 1920 election. Prior to that election, in  Boston, they distributed sample ballots. This document that I have with  me today has been in my wife's family for almost 100 years. On the back  of the document, Miss Abby Mayhew Cushing wrote this note: ``November  2, 1920. Cast my first vote for President of these United States.''   You can feel the pride and the patriotism in those words that she  experienced for the first time. Abby Mayhew Cushing was 67 years old.   With all due respect to my Democrat colleagues, she wrote: ``Voted  straight Republican ticket. Smashing victory for Harding and  Coolidge.'' Then she added this: ``President Harding died very suddenly  August 2, 1923, in California. Burial in Marion, Ohio, Friday, August  10.''   This is, for the Cushing family, a historic document that celebrates  the patriotism of American women earning the right to vote.                            ____________________
