 Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of Xavier  Becerra, as Senator Menendez just did.   Like Senator Menendez, when Xavier and I came, we all were in the  first class in 1992 together. I consider him a friend also and have  admired the work that he did as a Member of Congress, as attorney  general, and the work that he will do at HHS.   In the middle of the worst health crisis of our lifetime, we need  someone leading this Department who understands the importance of  public health and who will work to build a stronger, more affordable  healthcare system for the future. That is what Xavier Becerra will do.   He has the experience for this job. As Senator Menendez pointed out,  he ran the Nation's second largest law firm. He helped pass the  Affordable Care Act, as a Member of the House, that expanded coverage  to millions of Ohioans and tens of millions of Americans.   I think the Republican opposition, all partisan opposition, to  Attorney General Becerra for Secretary of HHS, as Senator Casey pointed  out, is all about their opposition to the Affordable Care Act, their  opposition to expansion of Medicaid. I heard one Senator after another  say their State isn't treated right by Medicaid, but they didn't even  expand Medicaid in many of those States.   As State attorney general, he took on tobacco companies, drug  companies, opioid manufacturers, and polluters. That is another reason  Republicans oppose him, because he took on their biggest contributors  and their sponsors and the people they come to the Senate and fight  for. That willingness to stand up to big drug companies is going to be  more important than ever in the years ahead.   The cost of prescription drugs eats away at the budget of seniors and  families in Cleveland and Akron and Mansfield and Youngstown and  Dayton. I look forward to working with future Secretary Becerra to  bring down those drug prices. I also hope we can work together to  expand the Affordable Care Act and to make it work even better for the  families.   We started this month, and the Presiding Officer from Wisconsin was a  part of this, with the American Rescue Plan. People buying healthcare  in the ACA exchanges are going to have lower premiums because of the  rescue plan.   Mr. Becerra will work to undo the vast disparities in healthcare in  our country. This pandemic has been the great revealer. It has shown  how unequal access to care and pollution and biases in the system and  so much else have hurt the health of Black and Brown Americans for  generations.   We need to start with getting accurate data on how different  communities have been hurt by this pandemic, something I have pushed  for over the past year and something I know will be a priority to the  new Secretary of Health and Human Services.   I urge my colleagues to join me in confirming him so he can work to  help get every American vaccinated, to expand PPE and COVID testing  supplies, and to build a stronger healthcare system for the future  [[Page S1598]]         Madam President, for decades, Ohio workers have watched  the spread of a corporate business model where companies shut down  production in Toledo or Dayton or Gallipolis or Youngstown. They  collected a tax break to move jobs to Mexico or China where they can  exploit workers only to sell their products back into the United  States. Ohioans live with those consequences every day.   Last week, 81 workers in Bucyrus, OH, had their jobs outsourced to  China, where GE-Savant moved production of its high-efficiency light  bulbs overseas. Now, 81 union workers are facing tough conversations at  the kitchen tables: How will their families survive; will they fall  behind on their rent or their mortgage; do they move away with their  kids; will their kids have to change schools--all those decisions that  families have to make when workers or when plants shut down and move  overseas.   The Presiding Officer from Wisconsin has been involved in this fight  ever since her career began in the House 20-plus years ago, and I have  worked alongside with her to make sure that we have a different trade  policy. But when one production line closes, the ripple effect extends,  as we know, to the whole community, to other workers and communities in  the supply chain.   Yesterday, people in Northeast Ohio, in the Cleveland area, woke up  to headlines about yet another American corporation deciding to build  things in Mexico instead of Ohio with Ford breaking its promise to  invest $900 million in Avon Lake.   I got a call 2 days ago from a smalltown mayor, John Hunter, mayor of  Sheffield Lake, OH, a longtime Ford--he was a Ford worker, retired, now  mayor of Sheffield Village. He talked about how Ford had promised, at  the bargaining table in 2019, that they would invest $900 million in  this Avon Lake plant. Ohioans are tired of watching corporation after  corporation abandon the workers and communities that have made their  businesses successful.   We are being told that production of cheap, simple products will be  shipped overseas, while innovative, high-value products will be made in  the United States by American workers. We see in Bucyrus, we see in  Avon Lake that that is just not true, and we are sick of it. Our trade  policy has to change.   That is why today was a good day for this country. Katherine Tai was  confirmed by this body 98 to nothing. She understands trade policy. She  is the right leader to take us in a new direction on trade with  American workers at the center. She is a serious expert. She is  respected on both sides of the aisle. We saw that in that vote today.  She has a proven track record of making progress for workers.   Last year, I voted for a trade agreement for the first time ever in  my career because of our work with Senator Wyden to fix the Trump  administration's corporate trade agreement. He said it was a new NAFTA.  It was really a tired, old, mostly the same NAFTA, rebranded as USMCA.  We went to work. We secured groundbreaking new worker protections.  Katherine Tai was one of the key policymakers who worked with us to  make that happen. She was in the negotiations. She was in the  discussions. She helped Senator Wyden and I make this a much better  bill that people, like a whole lot of us, as progressives, pro-worker  Senators, could vote for.   Her work helped us make the first improvement to enforcing labor  standards in our trade agreements enforceable, serious labor standards,  since we have been negotiating them.   We know why companies close factories in Ohio and open them in  Mexico. They can pay lower wages. They can take advantage of workers  who don't have rights. American workers can't compete. We get a race to  the bottom on wages and benefits.   The only way of stopping it is raising labor standards in every  country we trade with and making sure those labor standards are  enforced.   That is what Katherine Tai will do. She will enforce the laws we  already have. She will stand up for American workers. She will fight  for American businesses when countries cheat the rules. She will work  with us to level the playing field so steelworkers and autoworkers and  communication workers in Ohio and Wisconsin and all over the country  can compete.   She won't allow corporate lobbyists to write trade agreements. We  have seen it. Since I came to the Congress, we have seen it with NAFTA.  We have seen it with CAFTA. We have seen it with PNTR. We have seen it  with agreement after agreement after agreement: Corporate lobbyists  write trade agreements. Workers are locked out of the room.   Now, with U.S. Trade Rep Tai's confirmation--the nominee, of course-- I asked her what she will do to start to regain the trust of Americans  in trade. She said:         You start by listening.    She then talked about the Mahoning Valley, Youngstown area in my  State, listening to and understanding the concerns of communities that  have gotten hurt over and over.   The administration's outline for its 2021 agenda, trade agenda, which  Miss Tai will be charged with carrying out, says that ``trade policy  should respect the dignity of work.''         Trade policy should respect the dignity of work and value       Americans as workers and wage earners.    Imagine that; that our trade policy, never before have we seen this  respecting the dignity of work and valuing Americans as workers and  wage earners. That is the kind of thinking we need leading our trade  policy.   As the first woman of color to ever serve as the President's chief  trade adviser, Katherine Tai knows how important it is for the people  in the room making trade decisions to actually reflect, to actually  reflect the diverse workforce that our trade policy affects.   We know one good appointment and one good provision won't stop  outsourcing, but I am always going to be straight with American  workers. We have come a long, long way, but we have a long, long way to  go to undo the damage our trade policies have done over the past three  decades.   As the Presiding Officer, I have stood up to Presidents of both  parties on trade throughout my career. That is not going to change. One  of my proudest votes was one of my first votes, and that was against  the North American Free Trade Agreement.   I will continue to watch closely what this administration does. If  they show any hint of reverting back to the old way of doing things, of  letting corporations dictate trade policy at the expense of workers,  they will hear about it from me. This is going to be a constant effort  over many years.   As thrilled as I am with Katherine Tai, we know we still have a job  to do to reorient trade agreements and trade laws that are a priority;  that our emphasis no longer is corporations, but it is American  workers. It has to be coupled with real investment in the communities  that have been hollowed out because of Washington's and Wall Street's  past mistakes. It has to be paired with an overhaul of our Tax Code to  end, once and for all, the tax breaks paid for by Ohioans and others to  send production overseas.   Trade doesn't happen in a vacuum. Our policies must work together to  create a global market where workers are treated with dignity; they are  safe on the job; they are paid fair wages; they are able to bargain  collectively; they are able to bargain collectively for better pay and  benefits.   When you love this country, you fight for the people who make it  work. That is what Katherine Tai will do.   I thank my colleagues for the strong vote in support of her  confirmation.   I yield the floor.
