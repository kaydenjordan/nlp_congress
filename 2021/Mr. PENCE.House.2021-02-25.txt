 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of my friend and  fellow Hoosier, Ronnie Mohr.   Ronnie was a 1966 graduate from Hancock Central High School before  receiving a degree at Purdue and then serving in the United States Army  101st Airborne Division during the Vietnam war.   Ronnie was a pillar in the Greenfield community and a well-respected  farmer across the State. He was also a member of my Agricultural  Advisory Board on top of being a member of the Indiana Corn Growers  Association, Hancock County Sheriff's Merit Board, NineStar Connect  Board, and Hancock County Drainage Board.   My thoughts are with his wife, Sarah; his three children; and his 10  grandchildren. Ronnie's legacy will live on forever.                       Columbus, Indiana's Bicentennial     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of my hometown,  Columbus, Indiana's bicentennial.   For 200 years, Columbus has been a vibrant community sitting between  Indianapolis and Louisville. Today, it is world renowned for its modern  and contemporary architecture. It has been my home for my entire life,  and I am proud to be serving my hometown community.   Happy 200th birthday to Columbus, Indiana.           Congratulating Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend,  Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson, on her retirement.   Secretary Lawson is a true public servant who dedicated her life to  helping Hoosiers. Having served 32 years in public office, Connie was a  champion for secure elections and the first woman to serve as majority  floor leader in the Indiana Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Secretary Lawson for all the work she has done  for the State of Indiana, and I wish her good luck on her future  endeavors.                               Mount Suribachi     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the Battle of  Iwo Jima and the taking of Mount Suribachi.   On February 23, 1945, U.S. Marines were battling the Japanese to gain  control of Iwo Jima. It was that day that Mount Suribachi was captured  and the flag was raised for all to see. The Battle of Iwo Jima would  become the deadliest battle in the United States Marine Corps history.  Having visited Iwo Jima during my service, I will always remember those  sacrifices of my fellow marines.    Semper Fi. God bless the Marine Corps and the United States. Oorah.                         Democrats' Latest COVID Bill     Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Democrats' newest  proposal is, yet again, a political statement rather than a sincere  effort at COVID relief.   Last year's CARES Act distributed money mainly by State population,  but much of the $220 billion for States in the new bill will be  allocated based on average unemployment over the 3-month period ending  in December.   In other words, States who fought COVID-19, took care of their small  businesses, and helped their citizens stay afloat during the pandemic  by being open are receiving less funds. Meanwhile, leftwing States-- like New York, Illinois, and California--are getting rewarded for  crushing small businesses.   Relief for hardworking Americans must be bipartisan, and it must be  fair, end of story.                                March Madness     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Indiana on  hosting March Madness this year.   We are going to have divisions I, II, and III all over the State. We  owe this opportunity and achievement to Governor Holcomb and his great  work leading our State through our fight with COVID. With our Nation's  eyes upon the Hoosier State, our deep-rooted history with basketball  will be well-represented.   Congratulations to the NCAA and Indiana. It is sure to be an  extraordinary tournament.                            ____________________
