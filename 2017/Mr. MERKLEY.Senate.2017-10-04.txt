 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, The most powerful words in our  Constitution are the first three words: ``We the People.'' It sets out  the mission statement for our Nation, or, as President Lincoln put it,  a nation ``of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' Our  Founders did not start out our Constitution with ``we the powerful'' or  ``we the powerful and privileged.'' They didn't proceed to say that our  form of government is all about the powerful and privileged ruling for  themselves to make themselves richer at the expense of everyone else.   Thus, going back to the foundation, the vision of our Nation is  appropriate because our Republican colleagues have put forward a  document--a budget--with a tax plan that is all about government for  the powerful. It is all about self-serving government for the  privileged. There is nothing about fighting for a foundation for  ordinary people to be able to thrive here in the United States of  America.   Indeed, the plan put forward by my Republican colleagues is a plan  fit for a king living in a gilded castle--maybe  [[Page S6314]]  fit for King Trump living in Trump Tower, but certainly not for working  Americans living and striving to build the wealth of America. No, this  is not a plan for them. This is a plan for the King Trumps of our  Nation, who believe they can deceive the country again and again by  putting forward an argument that they are going to do something to help  the people while writing it for themselves.   We can take a look at this and realize that the President himself  leads that effort to do the sales pitch when he unveiled his tax plan  at the National Association of Manufacturers last week. President Trump  said: ``My plan is for the working people.'' He said: ``There's very  little benefit for people of wealth.'' And he went on to say: ``I don't  benefit. I don't benefit.'' He repeated it twice.   Well, as soon as you look at the tax plan, you see that this is  wrong. He sent out his other Secretaries to reinforce his message.  Secretary Mnuchin showed up on the shows and said: ``The objective of  the President is that rich people don't get tax cuts.'' Well, that is a  little bit of lawyerly work there. He didn't want to confront the  reality that this plan is all about tax cuts for the wealthy. So he  said the objective wasn't to do that.   Well, let's talk about the reality. The bottom third economically  here in America get zero help from the tax provisions in this plan-- none whatsoever. Plus, the broader budget slashes Medicaid by about  $473 billion--you know, the one thing that has improved for working  people. It has been tougher in a blue-collar communities to get a full- time job. It has been tougher to get a living wage. It has been tougher  to save for retirement, with pensions disappearing and employer- supported retirement and savings plans disappearing.   One thing got better, and that is access to healthcare, thanks to  ObamaCare. In my State, over half a million Oregonians gained access to  healthcare. It didn't just help them; it helped everyone. The  uncompensated care rate went way down in hospitals and way down in  clinics, which meant stronger clinics and stronger hospital services  for everybody in the State. Everyone benefited.   So the one thing that has improved for working America the  Republicans in this Chamber wanted to rip it away--stomp on it, destroy  it, shred it. They couldn't bear the thought that working Americans  might finally have affordable, quality healthcare. They couldn't stand  the vision of healthcare as a right. They wanted to return it to  healthcare being only for the wealthy and the healthy, but not for  ordinary working people.   Well, the bottom third is totally unhelped--in fact, hurt by this  plan. How about the middle third? For the middle third--25 percent of  the middle third--taxes go up, not down. The tax bracket goes from 10  percent to 12 percent. For the seniors in middle America, this plan  takes a trillion dollars away from Medicare. Not only do my Republican  friends hate having healthcare for working people, but they want to  destroy healthcare for older Americans at the same time.   So if the bottom third doesn't benefit and the middle third has taxes  going up, who benefits here? Simple answer: It is the billionaires. The  millionaires and billionaires of America are those whom this plan is  written for.   Well, let's just look at the provisions that cost so much money to  the Treasury. The alternative minimum tax is wiped out. Remember how  the rich and powerful rigged the system so they were paying no taxes at  all? We here in America established an alternative minimum tax, saying  that, if you are wealthy, with a ton of money coming in the door, you  should pay at least a little. The one tax return we have for President  Trump shows he paid taxes because of the alternative minimum tax. That  is the only reason he paid taxes.   So when President Trump says he doesn't benefit, clearly that is  wrong. If he knows it is wrong, it is a lie. Let's just say he is  either incredibly ignorant or trying to be incredibly misleading about  the fact that this would benefit him enormously to get rid of the  alternative minimum tax.    What is the second thing it does? Where it raised the tax rate at the  lowest bracket for working Americans, it lowers the tax rate for the  wealthiest Americans, from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. That is a huge  reduction that benefits people at the very top, wealthy enough to be  paying in the top bracket. Certainly, President Trump, by his own  description of his own affluence, would be in that category. So  clearly, he benefits enormously from that.   The third huge provision is getting a special rate for passthrough  entities. Let's say you own a big development, like a shopping complex  or a Trump Tower, and it generates a lot of money and you pass it  through to pay your personal taxes from your limited liability  corporation. Well, instead of being charged 39.6 percent, the current  rate, or 35 percent, at the lower rate or at the corporate rate, no,  you get this special deal on this passthrough of 25 percent. So you  paid an enormous amount less.   Who benefits from this? Well, the people who own LLCs and pass  through huge amounts of money are the ones who benefit from this. Who  has a lot of LLCs? Who has, by various estimates, hundreds and  hundreds? I heard an estimate that the President has over 500 LLCs. So  if the President has hundreds and hundreds of LLCs, passing through  income that is lowered from a 39.6-percent rate to a 25-percent rate-- basically, a 15-percent reduction--he benefits enormously from this, as  do all of his millionaire and billionaire friends.   Finally, there is the estate tax. This one, I have to admit,  President Trump doesn't benefit from today because he hasn't died. But  when he dies, his estate would benefit massively. If he is taking out  insurance to be able to pay his tax bill when he dies, then he has to  take out less insurance. In that case, it does benefit him today. Most  wealthy individuals do have that kind of insurance investment to pay  the estate tax. A very small number of Americans fall into this  category, and that very small number have a whole team of financial  planners. That means that, yes, even though, technically, he wouldn't  pay the tax benefit until he dies, he pays less for the preparation of  paying that. As for the AMT, the lower tax bracket, the passthroughs,  and the estate tax, the President benefits enormously from every single  one.   There you have it. There is nothing for the bottom third. The middle  third get hit with Medicare being slashed, and also with an increase in  taxes for a good share of them, but the billionaires at the top benefit  enormously. Let's be fair. The President understands this. His advisers  understand it. His Cabinet is full of the types of individuals at the  very top--the 1 percent, the 0.1 percent--full of the richest  Americans. They wrote this plan for themselves and to hurt the rest of  America. That is shameful.   There is another provision that the President has put in that  probably helps himself, and that is cutting the corporate tax rate to  20 percent. It is keeping with the President's demonstrably false  statement that the United States is the most taxed nation in the world.  That is simply not true, as a percentage of GDP. We have seen the share  of tax revenue that companies pay decline.   Here we have the argument that somehow there will be prosperity  because we reduce the tax rate. Let's look at those companies that  already pay less than 20 percent in corporate taxes because of the big  difference between the nominal rate--the stated rate of corporations-- and the reality of what they actually paid. A report from the Institute  for Policy Studies analyzed 92 U.S. corporations that paid less than 20  percent in corporate taxes. Did they find that these firms have medium  job growth of 20 percent? No. Ten percent? No. Five percent? No. Zero?  No. It is negative 1 percent. There is negative job growth even though  these companies paid less than 20 percent in corporate taxes, while the  private sector job growth over those years as a whole was 6 percent  positive. So those paying less than 20 percent had negative 1 percent  growth, while the entire private sector grew with job growth at 6  percent. In fact, during that period, these 92 firms that were  studied--in fact, just a fraction of them, or 48 of them together-- eliminated basically about half a million jobs. They had very low  taxes.   The argument is that they will do more because they don't have to pay  as much taxes. They will expand the number of people they hire. But  instead,  [[Page S6315]]  they slashed half a million jobs--just 48 of these firms that pay less  than 20 percent.   What happened to the CEOs of those firms? Their salaries went through  the roof. Part of the plan here is that you cut as many people as you  can, and you have a net profit increase. Sometimes, even when you  don't, you get a big increase.   So if we take this as a model of what the President wants to achieve,  he wants to empower other companies to follow this track of having this  model of slashing hundreds of thousands of jobs and jacking up the  salaries of the already richest CEOs in the country. Who were these  companies?   AT&T had an effective tax rate of 8 percent. Wouldn't that be nice  for middle-class Americans, to have an effective tax rate of 8 percent?  While they had that beneficial 8 percent tax rate, they slashed 80,000  jobs and doubled their CEO's pay to $28.4 million. Think of how many  ordinary working people would have a better life if they raised their  pay by one dollar an hour. But no, the CEO slashes 80,000 jobs and  raises to pay himself $28.4 million.    How about GE, which boosted its CEO's pay nearly $18 million in 2016,  while cutting 14,700 jobs over 9 years and achieving a negative tax  rate? A negative tax rate--get that. They didn't pay a dollar to the  National Treasury--not a dollar. They had a negative tax rate. The  company got more money back from the government than it paid in taxes.   How about ExxonMobil? Between 2008 and 2015, they had an effective  tax rate of 13.6 percent. That is way below 20 percent. In that time  period, did we see a significant growth in the number of people they  employed because they got this hugely beneficial 13.6 percent tax rate?  No, we did not. In fact, they cut their global workforce by a third. At  the same time, the CEO of that company, who just happens to be our  Secretary of State at the moment, saw his compensation grow to $27.4  million.   The record shows that these companies that are getting these low tax  rates are slashing their employees and boosting their CEO salaries. Is  that the model that makes for a prosperous middle-class America, slash  jobs and a dramatic increase of inequality in this country?   That is why this entire tax plan and the budget are so diabolical. It  is everything contrary to ``we the people.'' It is a vision of  basically hijacking the National Treasury to inflate the wealth of the  wealthiest in America, while doing as much harm as possible to working  Americans, laying down a model on the corporate side of rewarding  companies for slashing hundreds of thousands of jobs and inflating the  salaries of their CEOs.   Here is the question every Member of this Chamber should ask: Is your  priority adding more zeros to the bank balances of millionaires and  billionaires? Is that your mission? Are you at work here not  representing the people of your State but just millionaires and  billionaires? If you are, then you should be full-throated supporting  the Republican tax plan and the Republican budget on the floor of this  Senate. But if you believe in the mission of the United States of  America, the ``we the people'' mission of providing a foundation for  families to thrive across this land, then there is no choice but to  take this budget and this tax plan and shred it, destroy it, burn it,  put a stake through its heart in every way possible.   I, for one, believe in this mission of ``we the people.''   Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern  Nissa Koerner be granted floor privileges for the remainder of the day.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
