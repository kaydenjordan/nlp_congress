 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1519 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1519         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 8393) to       enable the people of Puerto Rico to choose a permanent,       nonterritorial, fully self-governing political status for       Puerto Rico and to provide for a transition to and the       implementation of that permanent, nonterritorial, fully self-      governing political status, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Natural Resources now printed       in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 117-74 shall       be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Natural Resources or their       respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 1519, providing for consideration of H.R. 8393,  the Puerto Rico Status Act, under a closed rule. The rule provides 1  hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources and provides one  motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since the Jones- Shafroth Act of 1917. That is over 100 years the Puerto Rican people  have been Americans. Yet, for those 100 years and more--in fact, going  all the way back to the United States' annexation of the island in  1898--the U.S. Government has not guaranteed our fellow citizens on  Puerto Rico the full and equal rights of citizens on the mainland.   Puerto Rico has faced multilayered crises rooted in this century-long  policy, crises that have been compounded in recent years by natural  disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, and migration.   Puerto Rico's current status prevents the island from enjoying full  democracy at the national level. Puerto Rico's Delegate to Congress has  limited voting rights, and the Puerto Rican people cannot vote in U.S.  Presidential elections, even though the U.S. Government enacts and  enforces their national laws and residents pay Federal taxes.   Puerto Rico also cannot set its own monetary trade or immigration  policy. They are unable to join international organizations or enter  into international agreements, highlighting the complicated  implications of the island's current status as a territory.   Puerto Rico's status also limits the island economically. For  example, in  [[Page H9860]]  granting Puerto Rico the ability to restructure its debt in 2016,  Congress established an oversight and management board that had the  power to override decisions of the Governor and legislature of Puerto  Rico.   Look, it is time Congress recognizes that Puerto Rico has no interest  in being a colony, just as we in the United States should have no  interest in being a colonizing power in the year 2022.   We are here today to consider a rule that would bring H.R. 8393, the  Puerto Rico Status Act, to the floor.   This bill details the transition to and the implementation of a  nonterritory status for Puerto Rico, finally giving the people of  Puerto Rico a choice to determine their own status. It tasks the Puerto  Rico State Elections Commission to carry out a nonpartisan campaign to  educate and inform voters before holding a referendum for Puerto Ricans  to decide between statehood, independence, or independence followed by  free association with the United States.   I am proud to represent a vibrant Puerto Rican community in central  Massachusetts, and many of my Puerto Rican constituents have family  members still living on the island. Their family members, just like  Americans on the mainland, deserve the right to self-determination.  They ought to have an opportunity to carve their own path and build the  future that they want.   The Puerto Rico Status Act is the result of serious negotiation and  careful compromise to clarify available status options and ensure a  productive process.   I am grateful to Chairman Grijalva, Chairwoman Velazquez, and  Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto  Rico, for all the work that they have done to get us to this point.   Ultimately, the people of Puerto Rico must decide on the island  status, and it is up to us in Congress to help facilitate that process.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This shouldn't be controversial. We are not deciding the fate of  Puerto Rico. We are setting a process in place so that the people who  live on the island can make that decision.   Listening to my colleague's speech, as he mentions Democrat,  Democrat, Democrat, Democrat, you would never know that this compromise  was actually written in conjunction with the Republican--let me repeat  that--with the Republican Delegate from Puerto Rico.                                time  0930    So I don't understand what the big fuss is about.   But if my friend believes that the people of Puerto Rico should  decide their future, then he should support this bill which will set in  place a process so they can determine their future. If the gentleman  doesn't, if he continues to believe that we should act like a  colonizer, then vote ``no'' on the bill. But this is the commonsense  thing to do.   One other thing we heard him say, they are taxpayer-funded elections.  All of our elections proceed with the support of taxpayer funds. I  don't understand what that is all about. But the bottom line is that  people of Puerto Rico do pay taxes.   In any event, this really is about self-determination, and it is that  simple. I hope that my colleagues will not only support the rule but  also the underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I will close.    Madam Speaker, I don't even know where to start in  response to all of that.   Let me, first of all, inform Members about what the legislative  history of the bill that we want to bring to the floor is because if  you listen to the gentleman, Madam Speaker, you would think that it  just came out of nowhere.   On July 15, 2022, Chairman Grijalva introduced H.R. 8393, the Puerto  Rico Status Act, with original cosponsors Chairwoman Velazquez,  Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon--I will remind my  friend, again, that she is a Republican Resident Commissioner from  Puerto Rico--and Representative Darren Soto of Florida.   The Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on April 14, 2021,  titled: ``Insular Affairs Legislative Hearing on Puerto Rico Political  Status,'' and a hearing on June 16, 2021, titled: ``Office of Insular  Affairs Legislative Hearing.''   On July 20, 2022, the full committee met and held a markup of the  bill and favorably reported it with an amendment in the nature of a  substitute by a vote of 25-20 with Resident Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon  joining the majority. So the idea that somehow nobody has been talking  about this doesn't reflect what the legislative history is.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an AP article from June 4,  2022, titled: ``Puerto Ricans speak out on U.S. territory's political  status.''         Puerto Ricans Speak Out on US Territory's Political Status                              (By Danica Coto)         San Juan, PR (AP).--Hundreds of Puerto Ricans crowded into       a convention center Saturday where federal legislators held a       public hearing to decide the future of the island's political       status as the U.S. territory struggles to recover from       hurricanes, earthquakes and a deep economic crisis.        One by one, dozens of people ranging from politicians to       retirees to young people leaned into a microphone and spoke       against the island's current territorial status, which       recognizes its people as U.S. citizens but does not allow       them to vote in presidential elections, denies them certain       federal benefits and allows them one representative in       Congress with limited voting powers.        The hearing comes two weeks after a group of Democratic       congress members including the House majority leader and one       Republican proposed what would be the first-ever binding       plebiscite that would offer voters in Puerto Rico three       options: statehood, independence or independence with free       association, whose terms would be defined following       negotiations.        Congress would have to accept Puerto Rico as the 51st state       if voters so choose it, but the proposal is not expected to       survive in the Senate, where Republicans have long opposed       statehood.        ``Everyone, even congress people themselves, know that the       possibilities of this becoming law are minimal and maybe non-      existent, but it doesn't stop being important,'' former       Puerto Rico governor Anibal Acevedo Vila told The Associated       Press.        About an hour into the hearing, a small group of people       including a former gubernatorial candidate who supports       independence burst into the ballroom, pointed fingers at the       panel of U.S. legislators and yelled, ``120 years of       colonialism!''        The majority of the audience booed the group and yelled at       them to leave as U.S. lawmakers called for calm. ``Democracy       is not always pretty, but it's necessary,'' said Rep. Raul       Grijalva of Arizona, chairman of the U.S. House of Natural       Resources Committee, which oversees affairs in U.S.       territories.        The proposal of a binding plebiscite--a measure that has       not yet been introduced in committee--has frustrated some on       an island that already has held seven unilateral, nonbinding       referendums on its political status, with no overwhelming       majority emerging. The last referendum was held in November       2020, with 53 percent of votes for statehood and 47 percent       against, with only a little more than half of registered       voters participating.        Luis Herrero, a political consultant, said during the       hearing that even if enough people support statehood, there       are not enough votes in the Senate to make Puerto Rico a       state: ``Not today, not yesterday, not tomorrow. Since 1898,       Puerto Rican statehood has been a mirage, lip service to       score cheap political points or to raise a few dollars for a       campaign.''        Saturday's hearing comes amid ongoing discontent with       Puerto Rico's current political status, with the U.S. Supreme       Court further angering many in April after upholding the       differential treatment of residents of Puerto Rico. In an 8-1       vote, the court ruled that making Puerto Ricans ineligible       for the Supplemental Security Income program, which offers       benefits to blind, disabled and older Americans, did not       unconstitutionally discriminate against them.        As a result, many of those who spoke at Saturday's public       hearing welcomed the proposed binding plebiscite.        ``We finally see the light at the end of the tunnel,'' said       Victor Perez, a U.S. military veteran who lamented the       current political status. ``Even after all our service and       sacrifice, we come back home and we are denied full voting       rights and equality. . . . We cannot vote for our president,       our commander in chief,        (but) they send us to war.''        Grijalva said the testimonies given Saturday will help him       and other legislators revise the proposed measure, which he       said is a way to make amends. He said he hopes it will go to       the House floor by August. If eventually approved, it would       be held on Nov. 5, 2023.        Acevedo, the former governor, said he hasn't lost hope       despite numerous attempts throughout the decades to change       the political status of Puerto Rico, which became a U.S.       territory in 1898 following the SpanishAmerican War.        ``A solution to this problem of more than 120 years has to       happen at some point,'' he said. ``When will conditions allow       for it? That's unpredictable.''     Madam Speaker, it is clear something needs to change.  Puerto Ricans don't want to continue under the island's territorial  status for many reasons--namely because while the status recognizes its  people as U.S. citizens, it doesn't allow them to vote in Presidential  elections, denies them certain crucial Federal benefits, and limits  their congressional Representative's voting power.   The Puerto Rico Status Act is a good solution that will allow Puerto  Ricans to decide themselves what the next steps should be. We should  give them that opportunity.   The gentleman talked about process in terms of how this House is  being operated. Let me remind the gentleman--and let me remind all my  colleagues--that the last time the Republicans were in charge of the  House, the Senate, and the White House--they controlled everything, and  I mean everything--the last time they did that, do you know what they  did?   They shut the government down and walked away. That is not  responsible governing. That was unconscionable.  [[Page H9862]]    And leading up to that government shutdown in the Rules Committee we  had an emergency meeting, on what?   Cheese.   Don't even ask me to explain that, but that is what they did. They  had an emergency meeting in the Rules Committee, and it was a meeting  on cheese.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a HuffPost article titled:  ``House Republicans Called Emergency Meeting On Cheese As Shutdown  Approached.''                       [From HuffPost, Dec. 22, 2018]     House Republicans Called Emergency Meeting on Cheese as Shutdown                                 Approached                               (By Amy Russo)         As the federal government was heading for a shutdown Friday       night, House Republicans called an emergency meeting.        Plot twist: it was about cheese.        During her broadcast that evening, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow       appeared astonished while reporting on the gathering, which       was arranged so that lawmakers could discuss the Curd Act, a       proposal to allow some cheeses to be advertised as       ``natural'' despite having artificial ingredients.        Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) was clearly irked, feeling the       timing was pretty inconvenient.        ``This is an emergency meeting that we're having here and       I've seen some surreal things around this place, but this is       really something,'' McGovern said. ``Vital parts of our       government are about to shut down in just a few hours, and       the Republicans have called an emergency meeting on cheese.''        Venting his frustration with Republicans in the room,       McGovern wondered whether his colleagues had thought about       how the meeting would look to the public, which would soon be       faced with the third shutdown of the year.        ``I mean, has anybody considered how ridiculous this is or       how bad the optics are as the American people are watching       what's going on here?'' he asked. ``By all means, if you       think the most important thing we have to discuss right now       is cheese, I'll let you have at it.''        Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) eventually jumped in to defend       the meeting, calling the cheese bill ``important to small       business,'' then eventually segueing into the issue of       funding for the southern border wall, the key matter that       prompted the shutdown.        ``We are being overrun on our southern border,'' Sessions       declared.        That's when McGovern piped up, appearing confused, asking,       ``There's no wall in this bill, right?''        ``It is important,'' Sessions argued back, clarifying that       he was ``not talking about the wall of cheese.''     Madam Speaker, my Republican colleagues seem to be  confused about why we are moving quickly here.   Let me explain that simply in the last few hours that they were in  charge, as I said, they called an emergency meeting on cheese. Don't  get me wrong. I love cheese just as much as everybody else in this  Chamber does. But I think the systematic disenfranchisement of millions  of American citizens is a little bit more important than cheese. Maybe  my Republican colleagues disagree.   I also point out that this is not the last day of this Congress. We  will be here to complete our business on an omnibus appropriations  bill. But I want the American people to understand how my Republican  friends have acted in these last few days. We are still trying to work  out the details of this government spending bill. We are working with  Republicans and trying to come up with some sort of an accommodation.  We need a little bit more time.   What we voted on yesterday was a continuing resolution to keep the  government running a few more days so we don't have a shutdown and to  work out the details. It is not the final package. Lots of stuff still  remains to be figured out.   But what we said is that we need to pass a short-term continuing  resolution for a few days so that we can work out those details and so  we don't shut the government down and cause all kinds of chaos because  we know what government shutdowns do.   I think it is really interesting for people to understand that 201  Republicans voted to shut the government down. If they succeeded, then  the government would shut down tomorrow. They voted to shut the  government down--   Who does that?   What are they thinking?        All because there is a small group of people here in the       House whose allegiance to Trump and the hard-line rightwing       fringe of the Republican Party say they don't want to have       any kind of deal. They don't want to govern. They would       rather shut the government down costing the economy billions       and billions of dollars, causing all kinds of uncertainty,       and hurting the American people.   They did that before. If they had their way, then the government  would be shut down tomorrow. Talk about irresponsible.   So I also should point out that every Democrat--215 Democrats--who  voted yesterday voted to keep the government running. So apparently,  Members of the Republican Party do not think they are responsible for  governing. They vote ``no'' on everything--on everything--and they  criticize us for the way we do the job that they won't do.   We heard the gentleman criticize President Biden for dealing with the  drug crisis at the border, for actually seizing fentanyl. He is getting  criticized because we are seizing it at the border.   Really?   Madam Speaker, this is simple. The legislation that this rule will  bring to the floor gives the people of Puerto Rico a choice--one that  they deserve--to determine their status. It is past time we provide  them this opportunity to decide for themselves what kind of  relationship they want with the United States moving forward.   So that is what this rule will do. It will bring that bill to the  floor.   Before I close, Madam Speaker, I would just, again, urge my  Republican friends: stand up to the Freedom Caucus, stand up to the  hard-line rightwing in your conference who says ``no'' to everything.  Put the American people first. Put people over politics.   That is something that I think is not an unreasonable request.   The idea that over 200 of my friends voted to shut the government  down yesterday?   Give me a break.   So we are going to do our work, and we are going to pass this bill  today. We are going to get to an agreement on an omnibus bill that will  help the American people. That will be next week. And we are going to  do our job because we believe our job is to govern. That is the  responsible thing to do, not shut the government down. Madam Speaker, I  urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.
