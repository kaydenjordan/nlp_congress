 Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the 46th  anniversary of Black April.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        April 21, 2021 on Page H2003, second column, the following  appeared: (Mrs. KIM of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)  Madam Speaker, today I  rise to commemorate the 46th anniversary of Black April.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     April 30, 1975, marked the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam  war. Many Vietnamese Americans who were alive during the war remember  this as the day that signified the loss of a country they once called  home.   The people left everything they knew to flee communism. Hundreds of  thousands of Vietnamese people have resettled in the United States and  built vibrant communities here. California's 48th District is the proud  home of Little Saigon, which is home to more Vietnamese Americans than  anywhere else in the United States.   On Black April, I will join the Vietnamese Americans in our community  and around the country in honoring those who served in Vietnam, and  those who lost their lives attempting to flee Communist rule.                            ____________________
