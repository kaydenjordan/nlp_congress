 Madam Speaker, as we here in the House and our country  come near the close of 2022, the United States has gone through the  worst year on our record for illegal border crossings.   Meanwhile, we have a Homeland Security Secretary who tells us  regularly that the border is secure. Just this last month, over 230,000  illegals have crossed that we know of.   Along with this, gasoline prices are over $4 a gallon again, and the  cost of Thanksgiving for most families will be over 20 percent what it  was last year.   This has been a troubling year. America needs a new course. This  House needs a new course, a new direction, and new priorities that  strengthen America and Americans.                            ____________________
