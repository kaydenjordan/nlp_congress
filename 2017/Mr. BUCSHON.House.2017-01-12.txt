 Mr. Speaker, as a medical provider, I understand how  critical and necessary patient choice and input is to the overall  quality of our healthcare system. Put simply, patients are better off  when they are equipped to make their own decisions.   Unfortunately, ObamaCare limits patient choice, as outlined in this  chart. In fact, in the ObamaCare marketplace, patients in two-thirds of  our country are limited to a choice of one or two insurers. Across five  entire States, patients have only one option. To me, the marketplace  looks more like a government-created monopoly under a system where  every American is required by law to purchase the product.   To make matters worse, the onerous mandates in the law have led to  restricted physician networks. So not only do patients have little  choice regarding their insurers, they are also limited to what  physicians they can see.   It turns out we can't keep our doctors even if we like them. That is  why we are offering a Better Way plan that expands choice and empowers  patients.                            ____________________
