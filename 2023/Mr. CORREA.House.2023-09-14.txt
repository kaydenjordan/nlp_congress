 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the 45th  anniversary of El Pachuco Zoot Suits stores in Fullerton, California.  El Pachuco is a very important cornerstone of our community in Orange  County.   Phyllis Estrella first heard the word ``Pachuco'' in the 1940s and  1950s when this word was linked to racial tension and riots in Los  Angeles, California.   Later, in the summer of 1978, she was inspired by the Luis Valdez  production centered on the Pachuco and the iconic zoot suit. She opened  up an El Pachuco Zoot Suits store that year.   Now, high schoolers across Orange County wear zoot suits to proms and  graduations, bringing dignity and pride to the name ``El Pachuco.''   Congratulations to Phyllis and the entire El Pachuco Zoot Suits team  for 45 years and 45 years to go.                     Honoring the Life of Minh Tam Nguyen     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  a beloved member of the Orange County community, Mr. Minh Tam Nguyen.   Minh was a Lieutenant Colonel in the South Vietnamese Navy. After the  war, Minh and his family sought refuge in America and made southern  California their home.   Minh was a pillar for Little Saigon and the Vietnamese-American  community across the United States. He started Advance Beauty College  to provide for his family and encourage other Vietnamese families to  become nail technicians.   He was known as the Godfather of Manicures, and his work as an  entrepreneur opened and provided for the community and those like him  who left everything behind in Vietnam for a better life in America.   Today, more than 40,000 students have graduated from Minh's beauty  salon and school. His children, Linh and Tam, continue to carry his  legacy in Orange County and all over the United States.   Minh is the American Dream. His story is the story of Little Saigon,  entrepreneurship, and of the American melting pot.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Minh for his hard work. May he rest in peace.  His memory lives forever.                            ____________________
