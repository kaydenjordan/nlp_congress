 Madam Speaker, later today we will debate the  PRO Act, and we will pass the PRO Act to free up American workers to  form unions and bargain collectively just because they darn well please  without interference from their employer. And when we debate the PRO  Act, Madam Speaker, we will get into all the details of the provisions  of the PRO Act, which are really incredible, and I am very excited  about that.   But right now, I want to talk about what a difference the PRO Act  would make, why it would be a game changer for the working people of  this country.   First of all, let's talk about productivity. American workers are  incredibly productive. In the whole period during and after World War  II when Americans were forming unions, thanks to the National Labor  Relations Act, and up to a third of private-sector workers were in  unions, wages and productivity rose in lockstep. You can't even  separate them.   But then in the late seventies when we started deregulating airlines  and deregulating trucking, and when Ronald Reagan became President and  busted the air traffic controllers union, PATCO, and the union-busting  business came up, and union membership started declining, productivity  kept zooming up, but workers' compensation was totally flat. Since  1979, productivity has increased 70 percent, but compensation only 12  percent.    What about income inequality? We can go to the next one. For the last  100 years, income inequality has tracked union membership almost  exactly. So if you take the share of income taken by the top 10 percent  of the workforce, you can see that as union membership grew, income  inequality fell.   Look at the difference the National Labor Relations Act itself made.  In 1935, union membership shot up. The wages of the top 10 percent shot  down as a share of everybody. We got more equal. We achieved the  American Dream. And now with 1,000 cuts to union membership, when we  are down to 6 percent of private-sector workers being in unions, there  has been this incredible divergence, and the wealthy have taken all of  the gains, and workers aren't in unions anymore.   And let's look at some specific stuff as we get the next slide up  here. Let's start with benefits. Union members have more benefits and  better benefits almost across the board. Here are just a couple of  examples: 86 percent of union members have access to paid sick leave,  as opposed to 72 percent of nonunion workers; and 94 percent of union  members have access to healthcare benefits, compared to just two-thirds  of nonunion workers.   And it is not on this slide, but more than half of union members have  access to defined benefit pensions, real pensions, and only a small  fraction of nonunion workers do.   Finally, let's look at wages in the next one. For all workers across  the private sector, union members make about $1,150 a week more.   We are here debating, and finally we are passing, $1,400 for poor  families one time. Union members earn $1,150 more every week through  their own labor because they negotiated for it. That is $7,800 a year  more.   And finally, if we look at the next slide--and Rick is doing an  awesome job here; I appreciate you--it is especially important for  women and workers of color. Look at this: This shows that across all  categories of American workers, White, Black, and Latinx men and women  workers make more. Women make $11,752 a year more if they are union  members than if they are not. African-American workers make $10,088 a  year more if they are union members. And Latinx workers make almost  $14,000 a year more, $13,936.   Madam Speaker, any way you slice it, when we give workers the power  to form unions at their workplace, they lift themselves up, they lift  up their families, they lift up all the nonunion workers around them  because the nonunion employers have to raise wages to keep up with the  unionized workers, and they lift up our country.   Let's pass the PRO Act and rebuild the middle class of this country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  of support for the bill from the AFL-CIO.      Legislative Alert                                                         AFL-CIO,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.        Dear Representative: On January 26, we wrote in support of       the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act (H.R. 842),       which would restore the original intent of the National Labor       Relations Act (NLRA) to give working people a voice on the       job so they can negotiate for higher wages, better benefits,       a more secure retirement and a safer workplace. We write       today to redouble our request and to express our views on       amendments to H.R. 842 that the Rules Committee has made in       order.        Now is the time to pass the PRO Act. For too long,       employers have been allowed to violate workers' rights with       impunity because the law includes no penalties for doing so.       As a result, workers' ability to negotiate for better pay and       benefits has eroded and income inequality has reached levels       we have not seen since the Great Depression. In the midst of       a global pandemic, which has killed tens of thousands of       front line workers, it is more important than ever that       working people have the right to rely on the protection of a       union contract.        The PRO Act will level the playing field to give workers a       fair shot when fighting for improvements on the job. The bill       modernizes the NLRA by bringing its remedies in line with       other workplace laws. In addition to imposing financial       penalties on companies and individual corporate officers who       violate the law, the bill would give workers the option of       bringing their case to federal court. The bill would also       make union elections fairer by prohibiting employers from       requiring their employees to attend ``captive audience''       meetings, a common tactic whereby employers present anti-      union propaganda to pressure workers to vote against the       union.        Under the bill, once workers vote to form a union, the       National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) would be authorized to       order that the employer commence bargaining a first contract.       These orders would be enforced in district courts to ensure       swift justice, avoiding the complex and drawn out process in       the courts of appeals. In addition, the bill would ensure       that employees are not deprived of our right to a union       because an employer deliberately misclassifies them as       supervisors or independent contractors.        Too often, when workers choose to form a union, employers       stall the bargaining process to avoid reaching an agreement.       The PRO Act would establish a process for mediation and       arbitration to help the parties achieve a first contract.       This important change would make the freedom to negotiate a       reality for countless workers who form unions but never get       to enjoy the benefits of a collective bargaining agreement       due to employers' intentional delays.        The PRO Act recognizes that employees need the freedom to       picket or withhold our labor in order to push for the       workplace changes we need. The bill protects employees' right       to strike by preventing employers from hiring permanent       replacement workers.        It also allows unrepresented employees to engage in       collective action or class action lawsuits to enforce basic       workplace rights, rather than being forced to arbitrate such       claims alone.        Finally, the bill would eliminate ``right to work'' laws.       These laws, steeped in a history of racism, are promoted by       billionaires and special interest groups to give more power       to corporations at the expense of workers, and have the       effect of lowering wages and eroding pensions and health care       coverage in states where they have been adopted.        The PRO Act is the first step towards restoring our middle       class by strengthening the collective power of workers to       negotiate for better pay and working conditions. After the       PRO Act's passage, we urge Congress to further empower       workers through passage of the Public Service Freedom to       Negotiate Act, so our nation's public sector workers may       enjoy the protections of a union contract.        We urge you to support and vote for the PRO Act.                          Amendment Recommendations         Tlaib (#8) This amendment establishes a 120-day timeline       for the tripartite arbitration process between the employees/      labor organization and employer to ensure that the       arbitration process is not indefinitely drawn out. Vote yes.        Hern (#6) Prohibits the PRO Act from taking effect until       the Secretary of Labor certifies that the PRO Act will not       negatively affect employment rates. There is nothing to       support the notion that strong labor protections have adverse       impacts on job numbers. This serves no purpose other than to       further delay worker access to the protections of the PRO       Act. Vote no.        Keller (#16) This amendment deletes the provisions of the       bill prohibiting employers from permanently replacing workers       on strike and protecting the rights of workers to engage in       brief or intermittent strikes. Vote no.        Good (#18) Amends section 302 of the Labor Management       Relations Act to prohibit employers from remaining neutral       during an organizing effort or election. Vote no.        Comer (#21) This amendment strikes the provision of the       bill which requires employers to disclose how much they are       spending on union-busting or ``union avoidance'' consultants.       Vote no.        Torres (#22) This amendment revises the Labor-Management       and Disclosure Act of 1959 to require the Department of Labor       to make disclosures under the persuader rule publicly       available in an accessible and searchable electronic form,       and through a secure software application for use on an       electronic device. Vote yes.        Walberg (#24) This amendment seeks to extend the time       between a petition for a union election and a pre-election       hearing. Vote no.        Levin (#34) This amendment directs the NLRB to develop a       system and procedures to conduct union representation       elections electronically, as allowed by the PRO Act itself.       Vote yes.        Fulcher (#37) Codifies a vote-and-impound process through       which the NLRB will conduct union elections even where       employer coercion or other unfair labor practices have       occurred, tainting the election. This policy is harmful to       workers who are subject to employer unfair labor practices       during or prior to a union election. Vote no.        Fitzgerald (#39) Requires an unnecessary administrative       process for unions to collect consent before using dues for       activities other than collective bargaining or contract       administration. Serves only to create administrative hurdles       as employees are already entitled to limit payments to union       to those for representational purposes. Vote no.        Allen (#47) This amendment strikes the provision requiring       states to allow ``fair share agreements.'' So-called ``Right       to Work'' laws, which prohibit fair share agreements, depress       wages and benefits. Vote no.        McBath (#54) This amendment simply clarifies that the       definition of employer and employee in the PRO Act does not       affect state laws governing wages, hours, workers'       compensation or unemployment insurance. Vote yes.        Wilson (#59) This amendment strikes the provision requiring       states to allow ``fair share agreements.'' So-called ``Right       to Work'' laws, which prohibit fair share agreements, depress       wages and benefits. Vote no.        Newman (#67) This amendment ensures that the NLRB's notices       that inform workers of their rights be in the languages       spoken by the employees. Vote yes.        The AFL-CIO offers no recommendation on the following       amendments: Jackson Lee (#12), Bordeaux (#25), Stevens (#65),       Murphy (#68), Davids (#71).        Restoring our middle class depends on strengthening the       collective power of workers to negotiate for better pay and       working conditions. This is why public support for unions is       the highest it has been in decades. We urge you to support       the PRO Act, oppose all weakening amendments for the reasons       explained above, and help us build an economy that works for       all working families. We also urge you to oppose any Motion       to Recommit, which would have the effect of killing the bill.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                                      Director, Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, I wish I had time to rebut many  arguments, like the one we just heard. The requirement that the  employer share lists of the employees during a union election is  decades and decades old. It hasn't changed.   In any event, I am here to support the PRO Act with all of my heart.  For decades, we have witnessed the loss of workers' rights, the decline  of private-sector union membership, and the erosion of the American  middle class. For 86 years, Congress has failed to pass any meaningful  private-sector labor law reform to reverse these devastating trends.   The decline of union membership has resulted in an unequal economy  where workers no longer receive a fair share of the profits they  produce. But we can change that starting today.   The PRO Act protects workers' rights to unite and negotiate for  higher pay, better benefits, and safer working conditions. By passing  the PRO Act, we empower workers to fight for the fruits of their labor  and build an economy that works for all Americans.   I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for the working people of  this Nation and vote for the PRO Act.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this en  bloc amendment, including my amendment to develop a system and  procedures to conduct union elections electronically.   Last week, I was in Bessemer, Alabama, supporting workers fighting to  form a union at an Amazon warehouse. Amazon, the company that got us  all to stay home instead of going to a store in person, demanded an in- person election for 5,800 workers in the middle of a COVID hotspot, but  the NLRB ordered a safer mail ballot election instead. Amazon  circumvented that ruling and had a mailbox placed in the parking lot  under a tent covered in antiunion propaganda, and urged employees to  vote there.   This is why the PRO Act gives workers the right to choose the method  of their own election, so they can vote away from such coercive  environments.   Electronic union elections aren't new. The National Mediation Board  has conducted secure electronic elections in the rail and airline  industries for almost two decades without a single problem.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the  PRO Act.    Madam Speaker, this amendment would strike the  bill's provision that allows unions to collect a fair-share fee for  services they are legally required to provide, and create, in its  place, a national right-to-freeload scheme.   This is a blatant attempt to undermine unions by making it harder to  collect reasonable fees for the services they are required by law to  perform equally for union members and nonmembers alike.   Let us understand where so-called right-to-work laws come from. They  have nothing to do with a right to a job. Their history is rooted in  Jim Crow-era laws designed specifically to prevent White and Black  workers from organizing together in the same union.   Last week, I was in Alabama, supporting an overwhelmingly Black group  of workers in their effort to form a union. I saw how difficult this  was in a so-called right-to-work State. These laws are vestiges of a  racist past, and it is time we reject them.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the chairman giving me some time.    Madam Speaker, this amendment seeks to hinder  workers' First Amendment right to assemble peacefully to better their  workplace situation.   No worker wants to go on strike. No worker wants to forgo a paycheck  so they can walk a picket line, often in the frigid cold of winter or  in the burning sun in the summer. Workers strike because they are left  with no other option.   The right to withhold labor is a core right, supposedly protected in  our labor law, and the PRO Act would restore that fundamental right  because, in practice, it has been gutted.   I actually agree with the gentleman that what we need is to restore  the balance that the National Labor Relations Act sought to create when  it was passed in 1935.    The things we are changing aren't the National Labor Relations Act  that was passed. It is not that balance. It is the ways that employees'  freedom to withhold their labor has been gutted in the interim by State  and Federal courts and by this body.   We need to restore workers' freedom to withhold their labor in order  to improve their situation. That is all this bill does. Let's get back  to that balance.    Madam Speaker, this amendment is truly amazing  to me as a longtime union organizer. It seeks to undermine the freedom  of contract, the ability of employers and unions to agree on how to  handle a situation freely together.   The shock of giving the employees' addresses and other contact  information: That is required in every NLRB election, and it has been  since the Excelsior Underwear case many decades ago.   The shock of letting the workers have access to hearing from the  union on company time: The current law is that employers can force  employees, on company time, to listen to antiunion propaganda the  entire time. If you refuse to go, you could be fired. But if an  organizer tries to step on the premises of the employer, they could be  arrested.   I have been arrested for trying to talk to workers. It was on a  public sidewalk, but the police said we were too close. Anyway, that  was thrown out, as it should have been. We were exercising our First  Amendment rights.   In any event, this amendment is truly astounding in a capitalist  society. We need to let parties be free, and I urge rejection of the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman so much  for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, at base, what we are talking about here is whether  workers in this country are free to come together and form a union. All  of these amendments are designed to undermine that right.   Let's get back to the basic concept of a free market for workers,  where they, prounion or antiunion, can decide amongst themselves  whether they want to form a union or not, and not have the person in  the world who has the most power over them, their boss, who decides  their wages and their hours, to pressure them, to force them to listen  to things, to subject them to propaganda.   The PRO Act simply creates freedom for workers to form unions, at  long last, so that the workers who want to form a union can do so  freely.
