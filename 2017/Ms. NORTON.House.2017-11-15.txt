 Mr. Speaker, a picture is worth a thousand words, so is a  graph. Following the blue line, the tax scam works this way:   For average taxpayers, the blue line--the blue line is for blue and  red States--shows taxes for individual taxpayers go down for one full  year. Then look what begins to happen at 2019. They begin to go up. By  2020, they continue. Follow the blue line for average  [[Page H9275]]  taxpayers. Their taxes are continuing to go up, they reach a real high,  and steeply go up for the entire 10-year period. For business tax  credits, they go down, too. That means business taxes go down. And then  they, too, go up.   So the scam shows both look like they are doing the same thing, but  2024 is a dividing line. Then business income taxes plummet, but income  taxes for average Americans go up.   Who is paying for these business tax cuts? Individual taxpayers.   Defeat this Republican tax scam.
