 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today as a Senator, as a former  president of a synagogue, as the only Jewish mother in the U.S. Senate,  as a steadfast supporter of Israel, and as a person who stands firmly  against hate and terrorism around the world.   Since October 7, when Hamas launched a horrific and unprovoked  terrorist attack on the Israeli people, our hearts--well, our hearts  have been shattered. And over the past week and a half, we have learned  that 1,300 innocent Israeli civilians and soldiers have been murdered.  Thousands more have been injured. And countless families are grieving  for loved ones who have been kidnapped, who at this very moment are  being held hostage by Hamas--young children, women, seniors, some of  whom even were Holocaust survivors.   This past weekend, I met with these families in Israel as part of a  bipartisan Senate delegation, meeting with parents whose children-- their children, their babies--that is how they called them: My babies.  They have my babies, a mother said.   They were ripped away from them by terrorists. Hearing those stories,  seeing the fear and the pain in their eyes, feeling their heartbreak is  something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.   And there is one story in particular that I am never going to forget.  A woman, whose family member was taken from her by Hamas, spoke to us,  and in speaking about her pain, she said:         We no longer live in the same world as you.    We no longer live in the same world as you. For her and her family,  she said, every moment is an eternity. Just think about that, think  about what they feel every single day that they are separated from  their loved ones, not knowing how they are doing, not knowing if they  are being tortured, if they are in pain, if they are even still alive.   And with each passing day--each passing day--these families, they  anxiously await for their loved ones, hopefully, to be returned to  them. And these stories, these stories demonstrate why I am going to do  everything in my power to make sure that these families are made whole  again.   We know that Hamas is currently holding nearly 200 innocent people,  including Americans, many of them in dire need of medical attention. So  we cannot stay silent. We must speak out until every hostage is  released--every single one of them.   And that is why last night, I introduced a bipartisan resolution  condemning Hamas for its brutal, brutal, premeditated attacks on Israel  and demanding that Hamas immediately release the hostages so they can  be reunited with their loved ones.   After what I saw, after what I experienced on the ground, I know we  need to take decisive, bipartisan, and immediate action to help Israel.  Let us take action to free the hostages, pass supplemental funding, aid  to our ally in its greatest time of need, and provide Israel with all  the support it needs to defend itself from acts of terrorism.   And at the same time, we need to make sure that Palestinian civilians  receive humanitarian aid and that it does not ever, ever, end up in the  hands of Hamas terrorists. Israelis and Palestinians alike have been  victims of Hamas's terror. We have seen how Hamas uses Palestinian  civilians as human shields to--which has led to the death of  countless--countless--innocent residents in Gaza.   And so we will continue to support Israel's efforts to eliminate  Hamas once and for all and limit civilian casualties. And as we do  this, let's use the full force of the Senate, both sides of the aisle,  to send a clear and decisive message to Hamas.   Let us all tell those cowards who kidnapped children, who kidnapped  seniors, that the United States will not stand by and let these crimes  occur. We will not rest until the hostages are free, until justice is  delivered.   So I urge all of my colleagues to support my resolution and send a  clear--and united message to the world.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
