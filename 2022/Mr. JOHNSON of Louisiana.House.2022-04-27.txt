 Mr. Speaker, I recognize tonight my good  friend, Mr. Robert J. Wright. He is a local legend and cohost of the  ``Robert and Erin Show'' on KEEL Radio in Shreveport, Louisiana.   After 50 years on the air and an illustrious career, Robert has  decided to retire. He will be sorely missed in our area. It is truly  difficult to imagine our region without his voice on the airways. He is  a consummate professional broadcaster, always informative,  entertaining, and genuinely tuned in to the people and issues of  Louisiana.   Fifty years in any career field is an extraordinary accomplishment,  but 50 years of consistently compelling radio is an achievement that  few others can ever boast.   I congratulate Robert on his retirement and on a half century of  devotion to his craft. We all hope he will finally be able to get some  sleep in the mornings. He has earned it. God bless.

Mr. Speaker, according to The Washington  Post, Washington Democrats have diagnosed their messaging as the source  of their current political problems. My colleagues and I are here  tonight to offer a second opinion.   Mr. Speaker, the Washington Democrats certainly do have a problem,  but it is not caused by their messaging; it is being caused by their  policies. That is clear for everybody to see.   You see, the phrase ``messaging problem'' is a phrase that is  familiar to us on Capitol Hill. It presumes that the American people  would support your agenda; they just haven't heard it yet, or they  don't quite understand it. But that is certainly not the problem for  these Washington Democrats.    It is not their policies, and it is not that their policies are too  sophisticated for the rest of us to understand, nor is it that the  American people  [[Page H4564]]  don't know what is good for them. It is exactly the opposite.   The American people know what is best for them and their families,  and they can see very plainly the results of Washington Democrats' one- party rule. They do not like it.   The plain result of the Washington Democrat agenda can be summed up  in what I have been calling back home the three i's. You might narrow  it down to, currently: inflation, immigration, and incompetence.   We can talk about the crippling inflation, the sky-high illegal  immigration, and the unprecedented incompetence of the Democrats in  charge in the White House, too.   Let's talk about inflation. When President Biden and Washington  Democrats assumed control of the Federal Government, inflation was at  1.4 percent. Now, here we are 1 year and trillions of dollars in  government spending later, and inflation has reached 8.5 percent. It is  at a 41-year high, and it is still climbing.   For Americans doing the math at their kitchen table, let's put that  in real terms. That means these price increases will cost you two  paychecks this year and probably two more next year.   Rather than accepting responsibility, what are they doing? President  Biden and Washington Democrats have told us all that it is Russia's  fault, and they advise that we should buy an electric car.   Let's talk about illegal immigration. With regard to that, the  policies of President Biden and these Democrats have resulted in record  levels of illegal immigration, record levels of illicit drugs flowing  into our country, and a humanitarian catastrophe at the southern  border.   Today, the Biden administration is actually planning to lift the  public health restrictions of title 42 that were really the last  remaining tool in the toolbox to control illegal immigration. Believe  it or not--get this--this is happening at the very time that they are  suing in Federal court to keep Americans masked up.   According to the Biden administration, if you are an illegal  immigrant, COVID restrictions are over. But if you are an American  citizen, hey, you better buckle up because these COVID restrictions are  going to be around for a while.   Incompetence, I don't think we need to elaborate too much. Everyone  can see this with their own eyes. It wasn't so long ago that Washington  Democrats tried to cast themselves as the party of competence. Remember  that, in the election cycle?   But many congressional Democrats still can't be bothered to show up  here at work. Many haven't voted in person in a long, long time. Some  phone into committee hearings from bed, literally.   The story at President Biden's agencies isn't much better. Another  tax season has come and gone, yet Biden's Treasury Department is still  working on getting last year's tax refunds out to the American people.   Remember the fatal troop withdrawal, the debacle from Afghanistan. No  one at Biden's Defense Department has been fired or held accountable  for the chaos that left 13 American soldiers dead.   The President himself continues to confuse basic policies from the  White House podium on a near-daily basis.   The American people deserve competence in government. But they have  received, by far, with this administration, the most incompetent  government of our lifetimes.   Mr. Speaker, again, there is a reason that politicians like to blame  their problems on messaging. It implies that if only the American  people heard our message, they would support it. In this case, it is  the American people who are hearing very clearly the Democrat message,  and they reject it.   I thank my colleagues for joining me on the floor this evening, where  we will be talking about the broad array, the panoply, of crises  created by this administration.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. Some wise  counsel there. I wish they would heed it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Burchett).    Mr. Speaker, I told my friend that I would  be faithful to him because he has been faithful to participate in all  the Special Order hours if I kept the trains running on time.   I yield now to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller), who I  slighted earlier. I would invite him to talk more about all these  crises we are facing.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for bringing  that up. Coming from an energy State like Louisiana, just like  Pennsylvania, we know how important this is to us. Under the Trump  administration, we had achieved energy dominance. We could get back to  that if they would just simply do the opposite of what they are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Rose) has articulated so well what is on the hearts and minds of  so many of our constituents. Inflation is a very real problem for the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend so much for  that and for his service to our country.   Having defended our Nation you know that if we don't have a border,  we not only don't have safety and security, but we also don't even have  sovereignty. We don't even have a country. We have to have a border,  and this administration has given us none.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas, (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. And I will  tell him that he is not going to resign.   The gentleman from Arkansas may not know this, but just a few hours  ago in the Homeland Security Committee, one of our Republican  colleagues from Mississippi, Congressman Guest, asked the Secretary  under oath, he said: Are you testifying, as you sit here today, that  the southwest border is secure?   ``Yes, I am.''   The Secretary of Homeland Security actually said under oath that that  border is secure. So we must just be imagining all of this. It is  really unbelievable, as we said.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is exactly  right. It is time to shift back to American energy dominance, which we  had under the previous administration.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield next to another doctor, the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, we have been calling on this  President to do his job since he entered that office, and he hasn't  done it. I appreciate the gentleman's leadership on all these issues.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield next to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Clyde), another good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his  clear voice and clarion call for competence and common sense.   Mr. Speaker, what my colleagues have articulated tonight is our view,  the American people's view on the debacle that is the unified  government by the Democrats of the Congress and the White House.   We have crippling inflation. We have sky high, illegal immigration.  We have unprecedented incompetence at every level. It has yielded us,  as you heard tonight, an energy crisis, a crime crisis, a foreign  policy crisis, and an agenda that seems almost intentional in its  design to put the American people last instead of first.   This is the opposite of what was pursued under the previous  administration, the opposite of the strides, the incredible  achievements that we had accomplished in the first 2 years of the Trump  administration with Republicans in charge of this House and the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I think the American people have had enough of this  wildly progressive America last agenda. I think that they are going to  let their voices be heard in this upcoming election. And it is our  prayer that we can survive between now and November, and in January  when we take control again.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleagues for participating and  joining me on the floor this evening, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
