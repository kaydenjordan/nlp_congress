 Mr. Speaker, the GOP continues to hold the American  economy hostage unless their extreme ransom note is met. However, the  June 1 deadline is fast approaching, and progress must be made in  negotiations.   The debt ceiling will be reached 10 days from now. If Republicans  keep up their brinkmanship and drive us into default, the United States  will be unable to pay its bills.   This will have unimaginable consequences for our seniors and people  nearing retirement. It will be particularly damaging for retirees who  rely on monthly Social Security payments to survive.   Our seniors worked hard, paid into the system all their lives, and  they should be able to count on the monthly checks that they have  earned.   However, a Republican-forced debt default would jeopardize Social  Security payments for 98,000 families in my district.   Default would also wreak havoc on the stock market, threatening  retirement savings of over 100,000 of my constituents and eliminating  approximately $20,000 from typical retirement portfolios.    We have a responsibility to protect the well-being and financial  security of our seniors. We must raise the debt ceiling now. The clock  is ticking.                            ____________________
