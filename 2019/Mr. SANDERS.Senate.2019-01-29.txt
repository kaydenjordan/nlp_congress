 Madam President, since 2010 I have sponsored a  State of the Union essay contest for Vermont high school students. This  contest gives students in my State the opportunity to articulate what  issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United  States.   This is the contest's 9th year and I would like to congratulate the  almost 600 students who participated. It is truly heartening to see so  many young people engaged in finding solutions for the problems that  face our country. To my mind, this is what democracy is all about.   A volunteer panel of Vermont teachers reviewed the essays and chose  Firdaus Muhammad as this year's winner. Firdaus, a freshman at Essex  High School, focused on the rise of Islamophobia across the Nation.  Jackson Maiocco, a senior at Bellows Falls Union High School, was the  second place winner. Jackson wrote about military spending and the  impact our defense budget has on our Nation. Joseph Brody, a senior at  St. Johnsbury Academy, was the third place winner, having written about  voter suppression.   I am very proud to enter into the Congressional Record the essays  submitted by Firdaus, Jackson, and Joseph.   The material follows:           Firdaus Muhammad, Essex High School, Freshman, Winner         September 11, 2001--a day that all Americans remember. A       day that changed so many lives. A day when I wasn't even       alive yet. Yet 9/11 was a day that changed my life. Fast       forward eleven years to 2012. I was in third grade and had       just made the decision to start wearing the hijab in public.       I had awoken that winter morning with the intention to wear       my hijab to school, but I was naive. I didn't know that by       wearing the hijab, I became a symbol of Islam. I didn't       realize that by wearing a piece of cloth on my head, I was       suddenly a nine year old representing all 1.7 billion Muslims       across the globe.        It's 2019. Eighteen years have passed since 9/11. It's been       seven years since I started wearing the hijab publicly. The       racism against Muslims has only gotten worse. The hatred and       Islamophobia has spread like wildfire, affecting every Muslim       in its path. Women's hijabs are being ripped off, racist       slurs are being spit at Muslims, and the angry stares have       only increased. The rise of Islamophobia during these past       years has been exacerbated by President Trump's Travel Ban.       On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed the Protecting       the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United       States Order. This became known as the Travel Ban or       essentially, the Muslim Ban. Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria,       Yemen, North Korea, and Venezuela were all affected by this       ban. It's not a coincidence that five of these countries have       a majority Muslim population.        I clearly remember watching the news with my dad and       hearing all the racist names being thrown at Muslims. Being       an eleven year old Muslim girl, I couldn't comprehend how       people could be so rude and racist to one another. I didn't       understand why Muslim families were suddenly being torn apart       because they were deemed ``unsafe''. Why were people suddenly       so scared of Muslims? Didn't they know that Islam was a       religion founded on peace and justice? A religion of equality       and kindness? How can we live in ``The Land of the Free''       when Muslims are afraid of being targeted based solely on       their religion? I am lucky enough to live in Vermont where       most people are quite respectful and accepting of each other.       But I also know that there are other Muslims who are not so       lucky. Those Muslims who feel isolated in their offices,       schools, and other public places.        I believe that in order to solve this huge racial problem,       we must learn to accept each other's differences. We should       not discriminate against others based on their religion. We       need to make sure that we represent people as they are, not       based on stereotypes. We cannot let the actions of a few       people reflect the beliefs of a whole religion. The United       States is a country of diversity, a country built by       immigrants. Any person who comes from any religion, deserves       to feel respected and welcomed in this country.   Jackson Maiocco, Bellows Falls Union High School, Senior, Second Place         For decades, an excess of military spending has plagued our       nation while there are many vital areas that would prosper       with the reallocation of some military spending. The majority       of our nation's federal budget is dedicated to the military;       in 2018, the US spent a grand total of $623 billion on       national defense. This huge sum of money dwarfs the amount       that President Trump allocated to the Department of       Education: a mere $68 billion. I know that sounds like a       considerable amount of money, so I'll put it in perspective.       For every dollar spent on education, nearly $11 went to the       military. This simply can't stand.        In fiscal year 2018, the US Federal Budget was roughly a       trillion dollars. President Trump made good on his promise to       slash federal budgets, but increased the defense budget by       almost 10%. Considering the size of the defense budget, a 10%       increase is huge: $52 billion, to be exact. Areas that were       negatively affected by Trump's budget cuts were the       Department of Education, which had a 14% budget slash, and       the Department of Health and Human Services, which lost 18%       of its federal funding. Every country's main goal should be       the scientific and social advancement of their citizens and       society as a whole, so the damage done by Trump's budget cuts       is incredibly detrimental to our nation. Meanwhile, we're       pouring unprecedented amounts of money into building tanks       that will never see action; according to Eric Husher, former       Senior Balkan Intelligence Analyst (1992-1996), there are       over 4,000 M1 Abrams tanks sitting in the Nevada desert       collecting dust. Keep in mind that it costs upwards of $4.3       million to assemble an M1 Abrams. So collectively, there's       roughly $17 billion worth of American taxpayers money sitting       in a parking lot in Nevada. But wait, it gets worse. These       tanks aren't being built for use; they're simply being built       to keep a factory running. This needless military spending is       incredibly detrimental to our country. Excessive military       expenditures results in slower economic growth, and, as       outlined above, is simply a waste of money.        The only feasible solution is to gradually decrease       military spending, and invest those funds into more       worthwhile areas such as education, science, and healthcare.       Far right hawks and conservatives might argue that a drastic       decrease in military expenditures would leave us exposed and       weak, but the evidence states otherwise. In fact, even if we       cut our military budget by 80%, we would still have military       superiority in the world.        In the words of legendary journalist Hunter S. Thompson,       ``Every Republican administration since 1952 has let the       military-industrial complex loot the treasury and plunge the       nation into debt on the excuse of a wartime economic       emergency.'' With no such emergency anywhere in sight, our       tax dollars should be spent on more worthwhile investments.          Joseph Brody, St. Johnsbury Academy, Senior, Third Place         Democracy was founded on the fundamental principle that the       power of government is derived from the consent of the       governed. Throughout the course of our nation's history, this       foundation has been fractured by the disenfranchisement of       low-income and minority groups. The Jim Crow laws, for       example, prevented African Americans from voting through poll       taxes and literacy tests. While the means of voter       suppression have become less glaring, the United States       continues to systematically suppress underrepresented       populations from exercising their Fifteenth Amendment right.       In order to ensure that our democracy is accessible and       fruitful for all, the United States must abolish Voter ID       laws and reform Election Day.        First of all, minorities are silenced by the Voter ID laws.       As Attorney General Eric Holder simply stated, ``We call       those poll taxes.'' Voter ID laws inhibit minority voters       because they present additional barriers to an already       problematic voting process. Even though obtaining       identification is often touted as ``free,'' Harvard Law       School asserts that the cost of supporting documents can       exceed $175. Given that minorities are often in the lowest       income brackets, this price can be insurmountable and       disproportionately prevents African Americans from receiving       identification. The Brennan Center for Justice revealed that       nearly 25% of African Americans lack necessary identification       in comparison to just 8% of their white counterparts.       According to The University of San Diego, the beneficiaries       of Voter ID laws are largely ``whites and those on the       political right.'' Clearly, this not only alienates       minorities, but produces politicians who are not concerned       with their interests. The solution is simple: eradicate Voter       ID laws. Though many express concern about voter fraud, this       fear is baseless. Professor Justin Levitt confirms that there       have only been 31 cases of credible voter impersonation since       2000. In short, Voter ID laws are a refurbished Poll Tax;       under the mask of ``fraud  [[Page S740]]       prevention,'' only the disenfranchised stand to be silenced.        Election Day is a hindrance because it occurs on a Tuesday.       The working class cannot afford lost wages or lost energy       from standing in hours-long lines. The result of this awkward       timing: low-income Americans cannot afford to vote. According       to the Pew Research Center, 63% of the most financially       secure Americans voted in the 2014 election, while only 20%       of the least financially secure were able to make it to the       poll. In effect, the population that bears the greatest       burdens possesses the least political power. In actuality,       Election Day was established on a Tuesday so that farmers       wouldn't miss church or market day. The government needs to       act with a similar intent and align Election Day with the       schedule of the working class. It should be a federally       mandated holiday and stretch across Saturday and Sunday. For       those unable to vote, absentee ballots should be guaranteed       and expedited.        Ultimately, eliminating Voter ID laws and reforming       Election Day will make voting accessible to all Americans.       Voting is at the heart of democracy, and once this is       realized, the quality of life for all Americans will be       heightened.                            ____________________
