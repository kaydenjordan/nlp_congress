 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak today in support of Black  and Brown migrants around the world. Putin's invasion of Ukraine is  horrific, and my heart is with the millions of families who have been  displaced and those who have lost their lives.   I must highlight the refugee crisis caused by the war that has  exposed a double standard. Black and Brown migrants fleeing Ukraine are  being forced to the back of the line and turned away at European  borders. This reminds me of what happened this past September at our  own border when the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol used excessive force  and life-threatening tactics in a racially-charged manner against  unarmed Haitians. Simply put, we must demand better.   President Biden and the administration must raise this issue with  European leaders at every opportunity, and act to ensure that everyone,  regardless of their color, their skin, their faith, and their ethnicity  can find safety from this violent conflict.                            ____________________
