 Madam President, during my time as a Senator, one of the       responsibilities I have cherished most is my role in supporting and       strengthening our Vermont National Guard. I have worked closely with       the Guard throughout my time in the Senate and since 1999 as cochair of       the Senate National Guard Caucus. During my tenure, the Vermont       National Guard has never let the people of Vermont down, and I have       always tried my best not to let them down.        Tracing all the way back to the New England militias that served in       the French and Indian War, groups formed from early settlers in a       remote and forested region spanning what is now called Vermont took on       the name the Green Mountain Boys. Banded together by the legendary       Ethan Allen from a need for local defense, they eventually became an       integral component in our Nation's broader national defense strategy.       And Vermonters kept answering the call, from 1812, through the Civil       War, to our 20th century wars and the overseas deployments since       September 11.        Today, our Guard is a diverse and modernized organization, with the       same capabilities as its active component peers. At the beginning of my       tenure in the Senate, the National Guard was called ``weekend       warriors'' and regularly relegated equipment that was old and discarded       from the Active Duty. I worked hard to support efforts that integrated       the National Guard and reserves into our Active military forces--often       referred to as the Total Force Policy. In partnership with several       Presidents and Secretaries of Defense, we have all seen a       transformation of how our Nation deploys and calls on our National       Guard. That culminated in the passage of the National Guard Empowerment       Act that was coauthored by my Guard cochair Lindsey Graham which       elevated the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of       Staff.        Over my years in the Senate, I made it a point to fight for equipment       worthy of the contributions to the Nation made by the Vermont Guard,       such as ensuring the Army Guard fielded the M1 Abrams tank, and that       when it converted to a mountain brigade, that it had gear like modern       snowshoes and equipment like the icy terrain navigating SUSV. They have       proven time and again the value of the National Guard, earning praise       at every level of the Department of Defense.        For the Air Guard, too, modern equipment in the hands of such       talented people has made the difference. It was Vermont Air National       Guard pilots who first secured the skies over New York City following       the devastating attacks of 9/11, and they flew F-16Cs that at the time       were some of the most advanced in the Air Force. When the Air Force       decided to do something it had never done before and place the second       squadron of the most advanced fighter aircraft in the National Guard       before all but one Active-Duty squadron, I made sure they stuck to       their word, and Vermont was selected for the F-35A Lightning II. This       year, they proved the wisdom of that decision, playing a key role in       reassuring our NATO allies who feel threatened by Russia's murderous       campaign in Ukraine and its belligerence throughout Eastern Europe.        In 2011, while reviewing the carnage Hurricane Irene inflicted on       Vermont, I saw firsthand the devotion to service woven throughout the       ranks of the Vermont Guard. While flying over the State alongside then       Adjutant General Michael Dubie, I witnessed rural communities that were       completely cut off because of historic flooding. I saw those same       villages and hamlets reconnected with transportation and communication       networks as a result of the tireless work of Vermont Guard engineers.       Hurricane-impacted Vermonters were fed by supplies dropped from Vermont       Guard helicopters, assisted and reassured by Guard patrols moving all       around the State, and rendered medical aid by Vermont Guard medical       personnel.        While Hurricane Irene stands out in our State's history as our       costliest national disaster, it was not our first and it was certainly       not the only disaster the Guard helped pull Vermont through. For more       than 2 years, the Vermont Guard was activated domestically in response       to the COVID-19 pandemic. Soldiers and airmen established medical surge       facilities, helped with logistical operations at the Strategic National       Stockpile, set up testing sites, and distributed food to out-of-work       families. They accomplished their mission related to the pandemic even       while also supplying critical units to the National Capital Region to       support security operations following the Capitol attack of January 6,       2021.        Not to be forgotten, Vermont's cyber and information operation units       work daily to protect our grid or train others in responding to       malicious cyber attacks. These experts skillfully and lawfully bridge       the divide between civilian government and our military. They provide       wisdom and Federal resources to municipal and State government       organizations faced with the ever-evolving task of securing information       networks and civil infrastructure. And in keeping with Vermont Guard       tradition, many of these soldiers and airmen have helped to set the       national standard for how the Department can most appropriately assist       local governments in achieving their goals related to cybersecurity and       event response, as they did when our local hospital system was hacked.        The soldiers and airmen of the Vermont National Guard distinguish       themselves not only in military contexts, but also in their civilian       lives,            [[Page S9761]]            where they work in virtually every profession, while often raising       children and finding time to serve their communities in volunteer       positions, which they do at a higher rate than the general population.       The legislative success I have achieved on behalf of the Guard is the       result of a partnership with the Vermont National Guard, and I am       inspired by their guidance, their feedback, and their absolute devotion       to service. I cannot emphasize strongly enough how much their service       and sacrifices means to me and all Vermonters. They have inspired me       throughout my career, and as I transition into retirement back home in       Vermont, I feel reassured knowing our Guard will be there, ready to       respond immediately to any danger or challenge, as they always have.                                      ____________________                Madam President, we should all be alarmed by the       increasing attacks against freedom of the press by governments around       the world. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, in this       year alone, at least 38 journalists have been killed, 294 have been       imprisoned, and 64 are missing for simply doing their job, not to       mention the countless others who faced intimidation, harassment, legal       persecution, and threats. Today, I want to mention one.        Rana Ayyub is an award-winning Indian journalist who has courageously       reported on religious violence, extrajudicial killings, and other       matters of public interest in India. Her important work is driven by a       sense of purpose and a love for her country and the ideals for which it       stands. Yet she faces online harassment and trolling, death threats,       and baseless government retaliation for her reporting. Despite the       immense pressure to silence her by government officials who should be       protecting her, she continues to expose the abuses of those in power.        Freedom of expression is the cornerstone of democracy. Without it,       the fundamental differences between a democratic state and an       authoritarian regime disappear. Throughout my 48 years in the Senate, I       have often been reminded that we each have a responsibility to defend       press freedom and amplify the work of journalists who shine a light on       corruption, injustice, discrimination, and impunity. We must stand up       for freedom of expression and the rights of journalists, so Rana Ayyub       and her brave colleagues around the world can do their essential work       without fear of retribution.                                      ____________________                Madam President, Vermonters have a long history of       distinguished service to the Nation of which I am proud. I am also       proud that Vermonters have a reputation for distinguished service to       those veterans when they come home. I have been grateful in my 48 years       to know so many Vermonters willing to help others and to be able to       support their efforts from the U.S. Senate.        First and foremost, I am proud to represent the men and women of the       White River Junction VA Medical Center and its associated community       based outpatient clinics. Across Vermont, it is known that the best       care veterans can get in the State comes from our dedicated VA       employees. Earlier in my career, when a 25-percent funding cut was       proposed which would have shuttered the White River Junction VA surgery       units, I was proud to join Vermont veterans to fight to reinstate the       funding. Today, my faith in our VA has proven right time and again, as       it has become a model for the Nation. While national stories may swirl,       Vermonters regularly tell me their preferred healthcare provider is the       VA.        Right across the parking lot from the medical center is the National       Center for PTSD, a world-class hub for research on the condition of and       the treatment of PTSD. In 1984, I was happy to help establish by law       such a center in the VA system and, in 1989, proud that White River       Junction was selected to be the headquarters. It may seem hard to       believe, but we had to fight for many years to preserve its funding so       that researchers and clinicians alike could make use of its expertise       to help veterans. We took a huge leap forward in 2013 in our ability to       help when Dr. Matt Friedman came to me with the idea to establish a       brain bank, so new, cutting-edge techniques could reveal more about how       brain physiology affects and is affected by PTSD. I found the funds,       and the research findings have already changed the perspective on PTSD.        It is not just Vermonters working for the Federal Government that       care for our veterans, but a host of veterans themselves. The veterans       service organizations in Vermont have been tireless advocates for       veterans and worked in partnership with my dedicated staff when       veterans had trouble accessing their benefits. Organizations like the       Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, the American       Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans       Association have shown the importance of veterans helping other       veterans, and I have always encouraged it. In fact, in my first term, I       helped establish the first vet center in Vermont in 1979, to provide       readjustment counseling to veterans returning from Vietnam, often from       other veterans, and I have been proud to support funding for the       Vermont National Guard's successful Veterans and Family Outreach       Program and Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Programs, which have become       national models for reintegration of National Guard members returning       home from deployment.        Along with healthcare, veterans in Vermont and across the Nation       receive compensation for injuries and illnesses associated with their       military service. It has always been important to me that claims made       by veterans are adjudicated fairly and timely. That is why I partnered       with the Veterans Benefits Administration to ensure that the VA       maintained and staffed veterans service center on the White River       Junction Medical Center campus, and I was proud to cut the ribbon on       that office in 2015.        Compensation and healthcare for veterans affected by toxic exposure       has been a priority of mine for decades. This last year, Vermont       veterans and their families led local and national movements to support       the PACT Act and change the way that the VA deals with presumption of       toxic exposure, which I am proud that the omnibus appropriations funds       appropriately. From Atomic veterans to Agent Orange to Camp Lejeune, I       have been proud to stand alongside generations of veterans demanding       the Nation keep its promises, and I am grateful that this year we have       made structural changes that should make a future fight for benefits       easier.        As I leave office, it is because of veterans themselves that I am       reassured. Whether working at the VA or National Center for PTSD, for       an organization dedicated to veterans, or in the community as       volunteers, veterans--especially Vermont veterans--are the key to       caring for each other, and I have been proud to have done what I can       from the floor of the Senate for the last 48 years.                                      ____________________                Madam President, I want to speak briefly now about the       tens of thousands of Vermonters served by my casework staff over my       time in office. It has always been a priority of mine to make sure that       my constituents could call my office if they were having difficulties       with Federal Agencies and reach a knowledgeable and sympathetic       caseworker to help them cut through redtape. When I first opened my       Vermont office, people told me that if I gave out my office phone       number, I would get inundated by phone calls. And I told them that I       was elected to serve Vermonters. Since 1995, we have closed 25,000       cases, and countless more were closed in the day before digital       records.        I deeply believe in the ability of government to help people who are       struggling. However, I am not blind to the fact that the dual       imperatives of efficiency and customer service mean that even the most       well-intentioned government bureaucracies can be difficult to navigate       at times.        The particular challenge of the Federal Government is its almost       unimaginable scale relative to the individual people that it serves.       Imagine that in 2022 an average of 66 million Americans per month will       receive a Social Security benefit, totaling over $1 trillion in            [[Page S9762]]            benefits paid during the year. Imagine further that the Social Security       Administration spends about a half a percentage point of those trillion       dollars to administer all of those benefits. Our dedicated Federal       civil servants are the best in the world, but individual Americans       still at times fall through the cracks due to their unique       circumstances and are unable to get what they need. Frustration and       disillusionment can follow, and this is corrosive to faith in       government and ultimately to democracy itself.        Combating these feelings of disempowerment was the challenge and       mission of the casework staff in my Vermont offices. They were not able       to solve every problem put in front of them, but they always did their       best. For 48 years, they talked with any constituent who called my       office with an issue regarding a Federal agency, regardless of wealth,       power, or political affiliation. They helped Vermonters resolve       immigration issues, get their passports, process their Social Security       Disability Insurance applications, get needed care from the Veteran's       Administration. When they spotted systemic failures, they worked with       my staff in Washington to write legislation in order to make things       work better in the future.        My staff and I helped constituents with issues writ large and small       because what seems trivial to one person can be incredibly important to       another. Hearing from Vermonters every day helped me do a better job in       Washington. Just as importantly, my staff always let Vermonters know       that they mattered.                                      ____________________                Madam President, throughout my time in the Senate, I have       been proud to champion policies and programs that encourage community       and economic development. The two go hand-in-hand. Vibrant communities       attract investment and economic success supports community life.        Our sense of community and our pride in our communities defines       Vermont. As a Vermonter, I have supported programs that invest in the       physical infrastructure our communities need to thrive--from water and       wastewater systems, roads, bridges and sidewalks, to the clean-up of       brownfields.        Burlington's Church Street Marketplace is a model nationwide for how       to build a lively, attractive downtown that will attract visitors while       also serving local residents. I was proud to secure funding for its       creation.        But the ties and connections which create community do not come just       from buildings and sidewalks. They come from a shared history and the       knowledge that we have a shared future. That is one of the things I       learned from my dear friend, the late Paul Bruhn, for whom the Paul       Bruhn Historic Revitalization Program is named. The program is used       across the country to not simply preserve historic buildings, but to       give them new life as housing, business incubators, or community       centers which preserve our history as we build our future.        Community development block grants and the HOME program are also used       throughout the country to build needed housing, which we know touches       on nearly every challenge we face from workforce development to       substance use. That is why when the previous administration wanted to       cut funding for these programs, I fought to retain that funding.        Roughly half of all Americans work for a small business, which is why       I had also strongly advocated for the Small Business Administration and       defended it whenever an administration decided, wrongly, that it should       be cut. It is also why I pushed for funding for the Small Business       Development Centers to provide free technical assistance to small       businesses and help them attract capital.        In Vermont, I secured funding for the Vermont Sustainable Jobs Fund       and the Vermont Center for Emerging Technologies to provide needed       capital for new businesses. I also supported innovative job training       centers such as the Advanced Manufacturing Center at Vermont Technical       College and the Burlington's Aviation Technical Center to be sure these       new businesses have the skilled workers they need to succeed.        I have always been a proud champion and advocate for Vermont's State-      run and privately run airport. For decades, the Burlington       International Airport has served as Vermont's window to the world and       an essential economic engine that the broader economic development       community across the State depends on.        I also brought Federal funds to build and strengthen the       infrastructure that connects Vermont's businesses and communities to       the rest of the world such as airports, rail lines, and the ports of       entry along the border we share with Quebec.        One of the reasons people come to Vermont to visit or to live is the       State's physical beauty. Whether you prefer to walk through a historic       village green or to ski down a mountain, Vermont offers the chance to       get outside and enjoy beautiful weather.        I used Vermont's town forests as a model for the Community Forest and       Open Space Program, which protects open spaces while creating places       across the country for people to walk, hunt, and cycle right in their       community. I sought to protect and expand Vermont's fisheries, trails,       and forests because public spaces are integral to our individual and       collective well-being while also supporting economic development.        When it comes to building strong communities and strong economies,       there isn't a silver bullet. Instead, there are a great many pieces,       each of which varies slightly from place to place. I am proud to have       helped towns and cities in Vermont and across the country and the       businesses located there get what they needed from their government to       improve the lives of their residents.                                      ____________________                Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to say a       few words about why protecting and restoring Lake Champlain has been so       important to me throughout my years in the U.S. Senate.        Lake Champlain, shared by Vermont, New York, and Quebec is a gem. It       is one of the largest and cleanest lakes in the United States, ringed       by the Adirondack Mountains on the west and the Green Mountains on the       east. Marcelle and I visited Lake Champlain together before we were       married and have returned there often to walk her shores, swim, and       scuba dive. The lake is at the center of the culture and economy for       much of Vermont.        I took office just 2 years after the 1972 passage of the Clean Water       Act, and Lake Champlain was in decline. Sea lamprey were devastating       the fishery of the lake, municipal waste water was barely treated       before discharge, and we were just beginning to understand the problems       caused by stormwater runoff. I immediately began working on funding for       Lake Champlain cleanup and am proud that at least $360 million has been       directed through annual appropriations to protect the lake as the       result of my efforts. My leadership of the Senate Appropriations       Committee has helped in this work, with about $50 million in FY2022       funding going for Lake Champlain.        I leave office secure in the knowledge that although I will no longer       be directing Federal funds, I have been able authorize several programs       that are now well established and will continue the work to protect the       waters and wildlife of Lake Champlain and support the communities which       line its shores for years to come. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration Lake Champlain Sea Grant Program became possible when I       arranged for Champlain to be declared a Great Lake. While the       declaration was brief, the Sea Grant Program is now well established,       funded at more than $1 million each year and has made a tremendous       difference for a multitude of Lake Champlain programs.        I led legislation in 1991 and reauthorizing bills in 2002 and 2022 to       establish and grow the EPA Lake Champlain Basin Program. The LCBP       brings together Vermont, New York, Quebec, and all relevant Federal       Agencies, with a budget in FY23 of $33 million to lead the protection       and restoration of Lake Champlain. And I am so proud that the FY23       omnibus includes the $35 million reauthorization of the LCBP for the       next 5 years.            [[Page S9763]]              I was able to help address the sea lamprey problem in Lake Champlain       by bringing NOAA and Great Lakes Fishery Commission funding to the U.S.       Fish and Wildlife Service to implement sea lamprey control. The program       is an unmitigated success, with sea lamprey control goals being met and       more importantly, with a spectacular rebound in the number, size, and       health of salmon, lake trout, and other large fish species. Over the       past decade, I have brought the funds needed to build the GLFC Lake       Champlain program to $10 million each year, supporting research,       education, and implementation work in New York and Vermont.        The U.S. Army Corps Lake Champlain Ecosystem Restoration Program,       more commonly known as the 542 program, was put in place at my request       in legislation in 2000. That program has been reauthorized with       expanded funding authorization this year and should continue to benefit       the lake for many years to come.        My exploration of Lake Champlain shipwrecks as a diver sparked an       interest in the history and heritage of the Champlain basin that led to       my cosponsoring the bill that created the Champlain Valley National       Heritage Partnership in 2006. That program continues to provide funding       and technical support through the National Park Service around cultural       heritage in Vermont and New York.        I also supported the construction of the new UVM research vessel       which I was proud to see named for Marcelle. The boat will begin       service in 2023 and is sure to carry generations of students and lake       researchers across the water for years to come. The Patrick and       Marcelle Leahy Center for Lake Champlain is also in an excellent       position to educate students of all ages, from 2 to 92 years old, about       science and Lake Champlain.        In conclusion, I am pleased to have been able to bring Federal       support to the restoration and protection of Lake Champlain throughout       my career and even more proud that measures I have helped put in place       should keep multiple Lake Champlain programs operating for many years       after I return to Vermont to live near the shore of this Great Lake.                                      ____________________
