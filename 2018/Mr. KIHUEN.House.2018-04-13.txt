 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Jordan  McIldoon. Jordan, who came from Maple Ridge, British Columbia, Canada,  was an only child with a big heart who worked hard and loved his  family. He was just days away from his 24th birthday and was about to  start trade school to further his knowledge as a mechanic's apprentice.   Jordan was always making jokes and loved trucks, motorcycles, and  country music. He died saving his girlfriend, Amber Bereza, from  gunfire at the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1.   Jordan was a selfless person who only wanted to make people happy. He  always wanted to have a good time and was a happy-go-lucky kind of guy.  Jordan is remembered for his sense of humor and laugh that could light  up a room.   I would like to extend my condolences to Jordan McIldoon's family and  friends. Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
