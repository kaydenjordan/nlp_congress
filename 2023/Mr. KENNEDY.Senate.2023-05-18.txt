 Mr. President, I am going to talk for a few minutes  today about HB12. That is not HB12 from the U.S. House of  Representatives; that is HB12 from the Louisiana House of  Representatives. Why do I want to talk about it? Because it is  important. It is important for my State, and I think it is important  for other States.   HB12 passed the Louisiana House of Representatives yesterday--maybe  it was the day before--by a vote of 88 to 15, and it is headed to my  senate.   As the Presiding Officer knows, it is frustrating in that the  American people can do things that take your breath away--we can  unravel the human genome; we can take a diseased human heart--we can do  that in America--and replace it with a new one and make it beat; we can  send a person to the Moon--but we can't seem to teach our children how  to read and write when we have 18 years to do it.   I don't come here this morning to assess blame. Our problem is shared  in other countries. That is no excuse. Our problem is caused by a  multitude of factors, but I believe and I will bet the Presiding  Officer believes that every child can learn--that every child can  learn. It is harder for some than others. I recognize that some of our  children do not have a supportive home life, not just in America but in  other parts of the world. It seems commonsensical to me that if parents  do not love their child, the child is not going to stop loving the  child's parents; the child is going to stop loving himself or herself.  But I don't know how to fix that. All we can do is continue to believe  that every child can learn--every child.   My State, like other States, has a problem with elementary and  secondary education. Over half of my children--my young people--in  Louisiana are not reading at their grade levels, and at some point, as  a child is socially promoted in school and progresses, it almost  becomes impossible for a child to learn if the child can't read.   It is not just money. Go look at a list of what States spend on  elementary and secondary education--and not just States but local  governments and the Federal Government as well. One of our States in  America is spending $54,000 a year on their public schools. I mean, God  bless them, but that is a lot of money. It is not just money. We have  to try and we have to be courageous enough to try new things that we  think will work.   Now, what does that have to do with HB12 in the Louisiana State  Legislature? Here is what HB12 would do. It would say: Look, we are not  blaming anyone, but if you are a child in the third grade in Louisiana  and if you can't read, according to objective standards, at an  acceptable level, then you are going to stay in the third grade. We  don't care if you are 16 years old. We can hold you until you are 18.  But we think you can learn, and you can't learn if you can't read.   Now, that doesn't mean that the child just repeats the third grade  with no help. We will assign that child special tutors. We will assign  that child special attention. We will give that child a number of  efforts to demonstrate that child's proficiency after getting this  special tutoring and attention. But we think every child can learn.   This approach has been tried in two other States--Mississippi and  Florida--and it has worked in both States--in both States. We have  copied it from Mississippi and Florida. We take no pride of authorship.  I am always willing to copy other people's ideas that work and give  them full credit. Let me just mention the success in Mississippi, and I  hope my colleagues in the Louisiana Legislature--I love every one of  them--are listening to me.   After Mississippi implemented its requirement that kids can't advance  until they can read, this is what one analysis says of the results of  that effort:         The results are stunning: In sixth grade, three years after       the intervention, retained students outperform similar       students by 1.2 standard deviations (a 0.8 effect size is       generally considered ``large''), with no measurable impact--    None--       on student absenteeism or special education classification,       negative indicators sometimes associated with retention.    Those aren't my words; that came from an in-depth study at Boston  University.   This analysis goes on to say:         The magnitude of Mississippi's accomplishments with early       reading is truly impressive and rightly deserves attention       and replication by other states. For low-income, Black, and       Hispanic students, by 2019, Mississippi had risen to the top       five of all the states on the fourth grade NAEP, with each       group showing more than a year's additional progress since       2013.    I could go on. I could cite you similar analyses and statistics for  the State of Florida.   Every child can learn. It just requires a little extra attention and  love for some of our children.   Now, HB12 in the Louisiana Legislature would copy the program in  Mississippi and Florida. It has passed, as it did last year,  overwhelmingly, as I mentioned, in the Louisiana House of  Representatives. Last year, in the Louisiana House of Representatives,  it passed overwhelmingly. This year, just recently, it passed by a vote  of 88 to 15. Last year, when the bill went to my State's senate, the  bill died. We are on our second try, and the bill is now before the  Louisiana State Senate.   I know every member of my Louisiana State Senate. I respect all of  them, and I am pleading with them. Please, please, please, pretty  please with sugar on top, pass this bill. It has worked in other  States. If it doesn't work in Louisiana, I will come right to this  lectern and say it didn't work, that we tried it. We gave it our best  shot, but it didn't work.   But I think it will, and I think our kids deserve the chance. Every  child can learn. Every child can learn, but some of our children need  special attention. This bill, HB12, before the Louisiana State Senate  will provide that attention.   Please, members of my Senate, pass this bill.   I yield to my colleague from Hawaii.
