 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the CHAMPIONING  HEALTHY KIDS Act.   This important legislation continues much-needed funding for programs  like the Children's Health Insurance Program, community health centers,  and our rural hospitals.   Community health centers are a critical access point to care, and I  have seen firsthand how they bless each person they serve.   In addition to community health centers, my district includes many  rural hospitals, which are truly a lifeline for my constituents.   That is why I join my colleagues in letters urging to delay the cuts  for the proposed disproportionate share of hospital and community  health centers for at least 2 years. And I am happy to see this  legislation doing just that.   I won't let Washington forget about the rural communities at the  heart of my district. They deserve better.   And guess what? This bill is fully paid for.   While delaying these cuts is a step in the right direction, I will  continue to fight for a permanent solution.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Energy and Commerce Committee for their  work,  [[Page H8449]]  and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.                            ____________________
