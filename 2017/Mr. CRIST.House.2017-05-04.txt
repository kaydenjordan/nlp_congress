 Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible bill. This bill will cut  24 million Americans out of health insurance. This bill will gut  Planned Parenthood in the first year, affecting women across the  country. And it will cut $850 billion out of Medicaid hurting the poor  and the disabled in our country. It is unconscionable.
