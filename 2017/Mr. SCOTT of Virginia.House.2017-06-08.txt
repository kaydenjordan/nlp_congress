 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise in opposition to the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act. In addition to what  else is wrong with the bill, there are two significant problems with it  impacting the jurisdiction of the Education and the Workforce  Committee, where I serve as the ranking Democratic member.   First, the bill essentially eliminates the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau. The Bureau has played a crucial role in making sure  student loan borrowers are treated fairly and receive the protections  that they deserve. It has shut down fraudulent student loan debt relief  scams, resolved countless consumer complaints, and secured hundreds of  millions of dollars in loan forgiveness for borrowers tricked into  taking out costly private loans.   The bill also repeals the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule, which  simply ensures that financial advisers put their retirement clients'  interests first.   Workers getting ready to retire often seek assistance in making what  would be the biggest financial decision in their life. Let's be clear:  many of these just set aside a few hundred dollars a month throughout  their career, and now have hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest.  They are counting on their financial adviser to do right by them and  their families. This rule simply says that they have to do right for  the families and the workers, not what may generate the highest fees.   Mr. Chairman, this bill undermines key policy priorities impacting  student loans and retirement savings. We should stand up for students  and retirees and reject this bill.
