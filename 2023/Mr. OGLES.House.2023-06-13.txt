 Mr. Speaker, Joe Biden has failed the American people. He  has failed to uphold his oath of office to preserve and defend the  Constitution from illicit family business dealings and millions of  dollars in bribes and payments to himself and to his extended family.   Joe and his border czar, Kamala Harris, have allowed an invasion at  our southern border, jeopardizing the lives of hundreds of thousands  and killing hundreds of thousands with fentanyl.   They have directed their Border Patrol to release illegals into our  country unfettered. In fact, a judge had to even intervene and stop  Biden's release program.   Joe Biden has violated Article II of the Constitution to take care  and respect the laws of this country.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I am introducing Articles of Impeachment  against Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
