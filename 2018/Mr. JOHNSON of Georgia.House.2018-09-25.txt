 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  might consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of H.R.  6758, the SUCCESS Act.   This bill takes the important step of extending for 8 more years the  Patent and Trademark Office's authority to set its own fees. It is a  timely bill, and it is a timely time that we are passing this bill,  because the fee-setting authority for the USPTO expired on September 16  of 2018.   This bill will allow the USPTO to have the ability to set the amount  it charges for each of the services it provides to patent and trademark  applicants.                                time  1815    The ability to set its fees will also help the USPTO with its long- term planning. The fees are set to recover aggregate estimate costs of  the patent and trademark operations, including all administrative  costs.   This bill would renew the USPTO's fee-setting authority consistent  with the framework of the America Invents Act, which was enacted in  2011. Section 29 of the America Invents Act called for the Director of  the United States Patent and Trademark Office to ``establish methods  for studying the diversity of patent applicants, including those  applicants who are minorities, women, or veterans.''   This bill directs the Director of the USPTO, in consultation with the  Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to conduct a study  on the number of patents annually applied for and obtained by U.S.  women, minorities, and veterans. The study would provide  recommendations to promote the participation of women and minorities in  entrepreneurship and in the patent system.   This data is necessary so Congress and the public can fully  understand the demographic nature of the patent applicant pool. This  study will be critical in developing policies to help underrepresented  groups engage in entrepreneurial activities that are the backbone of  our American economy.   Women, racial minorities, and low-income individuals are  significantly underrepresented in the innovation ecosystem. For  example, the Institute for Women's Policy Research reported in 2016  less than 20 percent of U.S. patents listed one or more women as  inventors, and under 8 percent listed a woman as the primary inventor.   The exclusion of women, minorities, and other underserved communities  is beneficial not just for inventors, but for the business sector as  well.   For these reasons, I am proud to cosponsor this bill. I urge all of  my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).    Mr. Speaker, I am again asking that my  colleagues support this very commonsense bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
