 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today we are debating the final version of the  Republican tax bill, which I cannot support.   This bill was flawed from the start. First of all, it was never  deficit neutral and there was never a bipartisan negotiation. This is a  Republican-only bill, and it was developed without any input at all  from Democrats because they never sought our input at all.   My Republican colleagues say they would like to jump-start the  economy. Well, we can do just that by providing more tax cuts to  working class families whose paychecks are already stretched far too  thin and who would reinvest that money in the local economy.   Instead, this bill provides them with crumbs, and temporary crumbs at  that.   Under this plan, corporate cuts, though, will be permanent. With this  bill, we will see an entirely different, more expensive, individual Tax  Code in 2025, when the middle class tax cuts expire.   This bill also balloons the national debt, make no mistake about it.  It repeals a critical healthcare provision that will result in 13  million Americans becoming uninsured.   Now, these days, I hear a lot about accountability and encouraging  competitiveness for the American worker, which I support. But this  bill, with its novel loopholes and flawed trickle-down philosophy, does  neither. It is a wasted opportunity.   I believe that it is not too late, but the way this bill is written,  I cannot support it. This was written for corporations and the wealthy  1 percent in this country. It was not written for a strong middle  class. We can do better.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
