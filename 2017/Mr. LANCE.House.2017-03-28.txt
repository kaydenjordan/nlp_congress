 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support S.J. Res. 34, which seeks  to halt agency overreach of the Federal Communications Commission  concerning the way broadband internet service providers handle their  customers' personal information.   The FCC's broadband privacy rule, a midnight regulation adopted by  executive order in the waning days of the Obama administration,  unnecessarily targets internet service providers and does very little  to protect consumer privacy.   The rule adds costly and unnecessary innovation-stifling regulations  to the internet and is another example of the Federal Government's  picking winners and losers.   When passed, the FCC claimed that the rule would provide broadband  customers meaningful choice, greater transparency, and strong security  protections for their personal information collected by internet  service providers.   In reality, the FCC's rules arbitrarily treat ISPs differently from  the rest of the internet, creating a false sense of privacy.   Consumer data privacy is of significant concern to every American.  The proper parties should address the issue. In this area, the Federal  Trade Commission has historically held authority on the establishment  and enforcement of general online privacy rules.   Repealing the FCC's privacy action is a critical step toward  restoring a single, uniform set of privacy rules for the internet. This  legislation puts all segments of the internet on equal footing and  provides American consumers with a consistent set of privacy rules to  permit the FCC and the FTC to continue to work to ensure consumer  privacy through enforcement.   The FTC, the premier agency in this regard, has the experience to  protect the privacy of the American people regarding the internet--at  least 20 years of experience. Bifurcation between the FTC and the FCC  is not productive. A good question to ask the FTC: Why did it wait  until the last minute of the  [[Page H2496]]  Obama administration to promulgate its regulation?   Mr. Speaker, I believe it is important that we pass S.J. Res. 34, and  I rise to ask all of my colleagues to support it.
