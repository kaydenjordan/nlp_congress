 Madam Speaker, I am sure every Congressman who has been  back in their district for the last 2 weeks heard the same thing as the  number one issue that is facing the American public right now, and that  is inflation, be it gas, even more food, even more housing, again and  again and again.   People say: How are you going to get around that? It is simple to get  around it; it is just sometimes a little more difficult. That is  finally saying no to the excessive government spending around here that  has forced the Federal Reserve to print dollars and decrease the value  of the dollar.   Within the next couple of weeks, we are going to vote on  appropriation bills for the budget year beginning October 1. Let's  look: Are we holding the line?   Transportation and HUD, 12 percent increase; water, 7 percent  increase; financial services and general government, 16 percent  increase; interior, 18 percent increase; military construction and VA,  11 percent increase.   Congress has not yet adapted to the new crisis.                            ____________________
