 Mr. Speaker, one of the most important  elements of this Republic is the ability of the people to understand  and to remember the public actions and record of those they elect. This  is vital to government accountability, to historical accuracy, and to  the future direction of the future generations of this country.   So, Mr. Speaker, what follows is the record and legacy of President  Barack Obama.   Last night, Mr. Speaker, President Barack Obama gave his farewell  address to the Nation. In his speech, President Obama praised American  exceptionalism for the very first time since his Presidency began.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, much of the remainder of the President's  speech was far removed from reality.   Mr. Obama implied that his Presidency had increased trust and respect  for America. Yet, the truth is that under Mr. Obama's Presidency, the  trust and respect that both friend and foe alike previously had for  America has been demonstrably diminished across the world. Mr. Obama,  in fact, weakened our economy and led the most anemic military campaign  in our history. So, Mr. Speaker, let us now recall the grand promise of  candidate Barack Obama, bedecked with Greek columns and the rhetoric of  bipartisan unity as it was, and let's compare it to the actual legacy  of President Barack Obama, the partisan heckler at home and the lead  from behind, apologize for America, academic abroad who was evermore  eager to force Catholic nuns to buy birth control than he was to fight  the ruthless butchers of the Islamic State.  [[Page H381]]    Mr. Speaker, President Barack Obama has taken credit for a growing  economy, but, after his failed stimulus, his was the worst economic  recovery in the history of America. And his Presidency will be the  first in modern times whose 8 years in office will fail to include even  1 year of 3 percent economic growth.   Under Barack Obama's Presidency, the number of long-term unemployed  eclipsed 15 million for the very first time in history.   Today, 95 million Americans, the highest number in history, are now  not in the workforce in America. And according to the latest numbers  from the Census Bureau, household income fell by more than $2,100 in  inflation-adjusted terms; and 45.3 million Americans, the highest  number in history, now live in poverty. More than 43 million Americans  were receiving food stamps under Barack Obama, the highest number in  history.   Barack Obama single-handedly added almost as much deficit to the  national debt as all of the other Presidents in the 240-year history of  the United States of America combined. And Standard & Poor's downgraded  the U.S. Government from its AAA credit rating for the very first time  in history.   Mr. Obama's signature policy achieved what was called the Affordable  Care Act. As we have learned year after year, essentially nothing Mr.  Obama said about the Affordable Care Act was true. ObamaCare contained  over $1 trillion in new taxes, which was the largest tax increase in  history. Yet, millions remain uninsured. Healthcare costs have never  been higher, and the entire debacle called ObamaCare is now  catastrophically collapsing before our very eyes.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Obama engineered the sequester on the military which  had devastating consequences on our men and women in uniform and our  ability to fight and win wars when necessary. Mr. Obama's was the  opposite of a commitment to peace through strength.   When it came to justice at home, Barack Obama told us that adult male  transvestites had the moral right and the legal right to go into the  bathroom with little schoolgirls whether their parents liked it or not.  He fundamentally sought to abrogate religious freedom in America. He  weaponized the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection  Agency, the Attorney General's Office, and the Justice Department  against America's own citizens. It was and is the epitome of tyranny.   Mr. Obama unconstitutionally ignored and selectively applied  America's immigration laws and illegally suspended immigration  enforcement. He released 19,723 criminal illegal immigrants from prison  into every State of the Union. These nearly 20,000 criminal illegal  aliens were collectively convicted of over 60,000 crimes, including  over 12,000 drunk driving convictions, and over 8,000 violent crimes  such as assault, rape, and murder.   Mr. Obama's actions endangered Americans and denied justice to the  victims of their crimes. Mr. Obama bears a share of the responsibility  for every crime that these criminals have committed or will commit  against Americans since he released them from prison into American  society.   But, Mr. Speaker, perhaps Mr. Obama's most egregious broken promise  to all Americans is when he said: ``I, Barack Hussein Obama, do  solemnly swear that I will execute the Office of President of the  United States faithfully, and will to the best of my ability, preserve,  protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' Since  then, he has shown complete and open contempt for the Constitution.    Barack Obama blatantly stoked racial tensions in America, and, in the  process, he painted a deadly target on the backs of the noble men and  women in blue who risk their lives every day to protect the innocent  citizens of this Nation.   Barack Obama consistently subjected Americans to condescending  lectures. If we opposed ObamaCare, we didn't want people to have health  insurance.   If we opposed wasteful stimulus spending, we hated schoolteachers and  firemen.   If we opposed the nuclear deal with Iran, we were compared to  terrorist-sponsoring Iranian mullahs.   If we believe in God and exercised our Second Amendment right, we  were bitter.   If we didn't believe in open, unsecured borders and vetting those who  came into this country, we were un-American.   If we believed in protecting unborn baby girls from being killed  simply because they are little girls, we were waging war on women.   And Mr. Obama was also fond of using politically correct euphemisms  and constantly using them to distort nearly every issue.   Evacuation of our Embassy in Yemen was ``a reduction in staff.''   Terror attacks are ``man-caused disasters.''   The global war on terror is an ``overseas contingency operation.''   An Islamic terrorist murdering 13 American soldiers is ``workplace  violence.''   Terrorists beheading children, crucifying women, and burning men  alive in the name of Islam are ``individuals from various religions''  who practice ``hateful ideologies.''   Veterans, pro-life groups, and States' rights advocates were listed  as ``at-risk'' to become domestic terrorists.   Mr. Speaker, from day one, Barack Obama considered the cold war a  giant misunderstanding. He did his famous reset with Russia and then  turned and caved into everything that they wanted. Mr. Obama's policies  of weakness and appeasement yielded Crimea, the South China Sea, the  rise of the Islamic State, the return of Iran, and the unspeakable  desecration of thousands upon thousands of innocent people in Aleppo  where the result to date is now where 4 million refugees and 400,000  people are dead. And during the so-called Arab Spring, the Obama  administration sided with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.   At the end of the Obama administration, the only countries in the  world that we have better relations with are Iran and Cuba--and even  that has been entirely on their terms.   Mr. Speaker, the average number of innocents killed by terrorists  before the Obama Presidency was approximately 3,000 per year in the  world. Now, under Barack Obama, it is probably 30,000 every year. Mr.  Obama labeled the Islamic State a junior varsity team, and then stood  by with a golf club in his hand while ISIS raped, butchered, and  beheaded its way across Iraq, selling little, 6-year-old girls into  slavery, burning people alive, and perpetrating a genocide against  Christians and Yazidis. The Islamic State now keeps an estimated 3,000  girls and women in sexual slavery while Mr. Obama runs out the clock on  his term of office and hands the fight against ISIS off to the next  President.   Because of his delusional negotiation and acquiescence, the Islamic  Republic of Iran, the number one sponsor of terrorism in this world,  may place the finger of jihad on the launch button of an entire nuclear  arsenal; and America's children and future generations may thereafter  be forced to live their lives in the shadow of nuclear terrorism.   Mr. Obama stood before a group of thousands of supporters of Israel  and proclaimed: ``When the chips are down, I have Israel's back.'' But  then as President, he blatantly refused even to acknowledge Jerusalem  as Israel's capital and consistently expressed more open rebuke toward  Israel than he did toward Iran for building an entire nuclear effort to  some day threaten the world.   I am going to say that again, Mr. Speaker.   As President, Mr. Obama blatantly refused to even acknowledge  Jerusalem as Israel's capital. And he consistently expressed more open  rebuke toward Israel for building houses in its capital city than he  expressed for Iran's efforts to build nuclear weapons with which to  existentially threaten Israel along with the peace and security of the  entire human family.   In the political safety of his lameduck, he orchestrated and failed  to veto a resolution that undermines Israel's very right to exist. Mr.  Speaker, it was a cowardly act of political treachery that disgraced  the United States, and it will send Barack Obama's name down the  corridor of history as on overt traitor to the State of Israel.   When the Security Council Quartet meets on January 15 and the full  United Nations Security Council meets  [[Page H382]]  on January 17, I am gravely concerned that Barack Obama will overturn  U.S. precedent going back to Lyndon Johnson and use the opportunity to  stab Israel in the back one final time by allowing the anti-Semites at  the U.N. to attempt to redraw the map of Israel to indefensible pre- 1967 borders, which would leave the only Jewish state less than 9 miles  wide.   Mr. Speaker, no government leader has any greater responsibility than  that of protecting the innocent. Yet, Mr. Obama stood by and allowed  not only ISIS, Boko Haram, Russia, and Syria, but also Planned  Parenthood to brutally desecrate the innocent on a horrific scale.                                time  2015    President Barack Obama went to great efforts, against taxpayers'  wishes, to give billions of taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood to  expand abortion on demand in America and throughout the world and to  proactively promote policies to allow the indiscriminate killing of  these, the most defenseless of all human beings.   As President, he appointed an empire of radically pro-abortion judges  and government bureaucrats. When he was in the State legislature,  Barack Obama actually voted ``no'' four times on a bill that would have  protected babies after they were born alive.   In the U.S. Senate, Mr. Obama voted ``no'' on a bill that would have  prohibited someone from taking a minor child out of State for an  abortion without even notifying the child's parents.   He vowed to veto the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, which would  prohibit discriminating against an unborn baby girl by subjecting her  to abortion simply because she is a little girl instead of a little  boy.   He promised to veto the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a  bill that would have protected both mothers and their little pain- capable babies between the beginning of their sixth month of pregnancy  from the unspeakable cruelty of Planned Parenthood and evil monsters  like Kermit Gosnell.   Mr. Speaker, perhaps most astonishingly, Barack Obama, the President  of the United States and the leader of the free world, wrote a letter  to Congress and said he would veto the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act to protect breathing, crying, kicking, born-alive human  babies if it ever reached his desk.   Mr. Speaker, could not the President have agreed that little human  babies who survive abortion and are born alive should be protected?   President Barack Obama's record is crystal clear. For his entire  political life, he has strongly supported the full legalization of  abortion on demand throughout all 9 months of pregnancy, for any reason  or no reason, including sex selection, throughout all 9 months of  pregnancy, and forcing American taxpayers to pay for it whether the  taxpayers liked it or not.   Under Barack Obama, nearly 9 million innocent, defenseless little  American babies were aborted before they ever saw the first smile of  their mother.   Ironically, President Obama was in the unique position, perhaps among  all other Presidents in history, of bringing this country together to  protect these helpless little children. Yet, as the most powerful human  being in the world, Mr. Obama chose to become the most powerful enemy  of the most helpless human beings in the world. And nothing will stain  his legacy or his claims of looking out for the little guy with more  shame than going down in history as the ``Abortion President.''   Mr. Speaker, it gives me no pleasure to lay out this record. I truly  and sincerely hoped for God's best for Barack Obama when he took  office. I wrote him a letter, hoping that he would be remembered as  someone who stood up for the Constitution and stood up for the  innocent.   But in a Republic like ours, where the people are the final arbiters  of our public policy and where those who would subvert this Republic  consistently resort to deception and historical revisionism, an  accurate record is vital to our Nation's survival and its future  generations.   So, alas, Mr. Speaker, I am afraid Barack Obama tragically wasted his  precious and historic opportunity. However, this is the true record of  President Barack Obama and, to paraphrase William Wilberforce: We may  choose to look the other way, but we can never again say that we did  not know.   Mr. Speaker, Under President Obama, as of 2015, Democrats lost 900+  state legislature seats, 12 governors, 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats.  Mr. Obama lost more U.S. Senate and U.S. House seats than any president  since FDR. I would suggest this was not caused by a lack of political  skills. It was Mr. Obama's policies and his attitude toward democracy  and the Constitution that were so devastating to his Democrat party.   From the beginning of his presidency it was President Obama's  theological conviction that America needed to be transformed into  something far afield of the founding fathers dream.   Last night the President gave his farewell address to the country. In  his speech, President Obama praised American exceptionalism for the  first time in his presidency. Unfortunately Mr. Speaker, much of the  remainder of the president's speech was far removed from reality.   Mr. Obama implied that his presidency increased America's wealth and  power and respect. The truth is that under Mr. Obama's presidency, the  trust and respect from both friend and foe for America has been  demonstrably diminished across the world. Mr. Obama in fact weakened  our economy and led the most anemic military campaign in our history.   One of the most important elements of this Republic is the ability of  the people to understand and remember the public actions and record of  those they elect. This is vital to the future direction of future  generations of this country.   So I come before the House today in order to lay out, and call for  the American people to reflect upon, the true record of Barack Obama's  Presidency.   During this crucial moment of self-reflection happening in our great  Republic, it is incumbent upon us to look back over the past eight  years to fully comprehend what are the wages of two full terms of  Progressive governance under President Barack Obama. Because Mr.  Speaker, if Hillary Clinton had been elected president, the left-wing,  mindset to ignore the foundations of this nation, the Constitution, and  so many millions of those it was designed to protect, would have  continued unabated and this Republic may have been lost.   Mr. Speaker, I solemnly wonder if America as a nation and Americans  as individuals truly comprehend how close we came to actually losing  this Republic and the founding fathers dream during the last election.   As Americans soberly reflect on that reality, let us now recall the  grand promise of candidate Barack Obama, bedecked with Greek columns  and the rhetoric of bipartisan unity as he was, and compare it to the  actual legacy of President Barack Obama--the partisan heckler at home  and the lead-from-behind, apologize for America, academic abroad who  was ever more eager to force Catholic nuns to buy birth control than he  was to fight the ruthless butchers of the Islamic State.   So Mr. Speaker, what follows is the record and the legacy of Barack  Hussein Obama:                               Economic Growth    Obama's presidency will be the first in modern times whose eight  years in office will fail to include at least one year of 3 percent  economic growth.   Mr. Obama has taken credit for a growing economy, but after his  failed stimulus, his was the worst economic recovery in history.   Using the broadest measure of economic progress, growth in output,  the growth rate over the first 25 quarters under Reagan was 34 percent  versus 14.3 percent under Obama.   Yet, Under Barack Obama, the growth of a ravenous Leviathan called  the federal government, grew larger and larger in scope and in power  every single year he was president.                                 UNEMPLOYMENT    Under Barack Obama's presidency the number of Long-Term unemployed  eclipsed 15 million for the first time in history.   As the Los Angeles Times notes, ``The longer people remain jobless,  the more likely they are to suffer the scarring effects of unemployment  that can hurt their earnings permanently and create a cycle of  instability.                           Work Force Participation    The percentage of people participating in the labor market in January  fell to 62.7 percent its lowest rate in 31 years.   On his watch, the number of people forced to work part time for  economy reasons eclipsed 8 million for the first time in history.   On his watch, the average time it takes Americans to find a job  reached the highest total in the history of the statistic being  measured.   The unemployment rate among African Americans was nearly double what  it was for white Americans   And today 95 million Americans, the highest number in history, are  now not in the workforce in America.                                  Inflation    Under Barack Obama, American Families faced Higher Costs on Nearly  Everything:  [[Page H383]]  Spending on gas, groceries, utility bills and health insurance premiums  skyrocketed.   However Wages were Down: according to the latest numbers from the  Census Bureau household incomes fell by more than $2,100 in inflation- adjusted terms,''                                    TAXES    When it came to taxes, Barack Obama said, ``No family making less  than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.'' He said that  he ``Will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than  $50,000 per year. This will eliminate taxes for 7 million seniors-- saving them an average of $1,400 a year--and will also mean that 27  million seniors will not need to file an income tax return, at all.''   However, Mr. Speaker, Obamacare alone contained at least 20 new or  higher taxes on American families and small businesses, representing  over $1 trillion in tax increases, the largest tax increase in history.  It has produced a crippling effect on the working and middle class. Mr.  Obama's tax increases include the Individual Mandate Excise Tax,  Employer Mandate Tax, Surtax on Investment Income, taxes on health  savings accounts, a hike in the Medicare Payroll Tax, and the  elimination of the tax deduction for employer-provided retirement  prescription drug coverage.                                   Poverty    Under Barack Obama the number of Americans living at or below the  poverty line went up 5.5 million between 2008 and 2013. A record number  of 45.3 million Americans now live in poverty.   Under Mr. Obama's presidency, the income gap between rich and poor  reached its highest level in over 40 years, and the American poverty  rate hit the highest level in the 52 year history of the statistic  being measured.                       Number of People on Food Stamps    According to a report in the Washington Examiner, the number of Able- Bodied adults on food stamps doubled, from 1.9 million in 2008 to 3.9  million in 2010, when Mr. Obama suspended the work requirement.   On his watch, more than 43 million Americans were receiving food  stamps, that's an increase of 23% since January 2009 and more than at  any time in American history.                                National Debt    Barack Obama said, ``I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our  deficits, either now or in the future.'' And ``Today, I'm pledging to  cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in  office.''   Yet the reality was that under Mr. Obama's presidency, America had  the first $1 trillion deficit in history. He raised the debt ceiling  time and time again. He used scare tactics against seniors (``he said  quote ``cannot guarantee'' Social Security checks will go out) as a  means of getting way with another debt ceiling raise and Standard &  Poor downgraded the U.S. government from its 70 year AAA credit rating  for the first time in history.   He instituted Federal bailouts, including bailouts that went to  hundreds of millions in executive bonuses. The Obama government alone  was equal to the entire United States' population in 1776. And he  robbed the children coming up around her knees of their economic future  and placed them on the path to national bankruptcy in order to ensure  his radical, big-government agenda was implemented. Barack Obama  single-handedly added almost as much deficit to the national debt as  all of the other presidents in the 240 year history of the United  States of America combined.                              Military Readiness    Mr. Obama engineered the sequester on the military which had  devastating consequences to our ability to fight and win wars when  necessary. The army is now the smallest it has been since Pearl Harbor;  the Navy has shrunk to WWI levels; missile defense was cut every year  he was in office, and the Pentagon was turned into a politically  correct playground for social experimentation. During that same time,  North Korea, one of the most dangerous police states in the world,  tested nuclear weapons 5 times. Mr. Obama's was the opposite of a  commitment to peace through strength.   The reason President Obama's legacy will be endless war is because  America's enemies knew he never had the commitment or the will to win  any war. So all they had to do was wait him out. And that's exactly  what they did; and so many people suffered and died as a result.   When Mr. Obama was negotiating the New Start Treaty, he was caught on  camera secretly asking Russian President Medvedev to ``Give me more  time until the elections''. At least he meant for it to be a secret.  Then after the elections he gave up far more that America got in return  in that treaty, demonstrably diminished the strength of our nuclear  deterrent and gave Russia a lopsided advantage over America in tactical  nuclear weapons. I pray our children and grandchildren do not pay  unthinkable price someday for the feckless and cowardly policy Mr.  Obama negotiated.                               Justice at Home    When it came to justice at home, Barack Obama fundamentally sought to  abrogate religious freedom in America and he weaponized the Internal  Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Attorney  Gen.'s office and the Justice Department against America's own  citizens. It was and is the epitome of tyranny.   President Obama turned the criminal justice system upside down. He  commuted the sentences of 774 federal inmates which is more than the  previous 11 presidents combined. He issued 590 commutations in the year  2016 alone, which is the highest in U.S. history according to his own  White House. Mr. Obama pardoned a total of 148 people during his  presidency and has shortened the sentences of 1,176 people, including  395 serving life sentences.   Yet during his presidency, in Mr. Obama's hometown of Chicago alone,  a city where his policies on gun control are the strictest in the  nation, there were nearly 800 murders this year alone which is the  highest in history.   It was also Mr. Obama's administration that told us that mud puddles  are navigable waters, that a tax is not a tax, that an exchange created  by the federal government is an exchange created by a state, and that  bureaucrats had more right's then parents to decide their child's  education and that adult male transvestites had the moral and legal  right to go into the bathroom with little schoolgirls whether their  parents liked it or not.                             Illegal Immigration    Mr. Obama unconstitutionally ignored and selectively applied  America's immigration laws perhaps because he saw those coming across  the border into this country illegally, not as illegal immigrants, but  as unregistered democrats.   President Obama never gained control of the border and in fact, Mr.  Obama unconstitutionally ignored and selectively applied America's  immigration laws and illegally suspended immigration enforcement. He  released 19,723 criminal illegal immigrants from prison into nearly  every state of the Union. These nearly 20,000 criminal illegal aliens  were collectively convicted of over 60,000 crimes, including over  12,000 drunk driving convictions and over 8,000 violent crimes such as  assault, rape, and murder. Mr. Obama's actions endangered Americans and  denied justice to the victims of their crimes. Mr. Obama bears a share  of the responsibility for every crime that these criminals have  committed or will commit against Americans since he released them from  prison into American society.                                  Terrorism    When President Obama took office in January 2009, Iraq was a  relatively stable nation. Iran was contained and ISIS did not exist.  Now there is chaos throughout the Middle East. Vladimir Putin's Russia  is in Syria, the Iranians have been unleashed, and ISIS has raped and  butchered its way across Iraq declaring that there would be nothing for  Christians but the sword and history will record that it was Barack  Obama who willingly stood on the sidelines and knowingly let a genocide  against Christians and Yezidis happen.   Barack Obama drew red lines he had no intention of enforcing, stood  back and watched as Syria burned and Islamist radicals grew in strength  until they exploded out of Syria to bring Hell on earth to the innocent  men and women across the region. To date, the result is over 4 million  refugees and over 400,000 people dead.   There are nine times more people killed in terrorist attacks today  than there were in 2000. My colleagues and I earnestly warned President  Obama and his administration of the dangers that Boko Haram and ISIS  represented to innocent people in America and the world and pleaded  with him to take actions to prevent them from desecrating the innocent.  Mr. Obama casually dismissed our concerns related to both of those  groups. His administration refused to call Boko Haram a terrorist  organization and he dismissed ISIS as ``Junior Varsity''. My colleagues  and I then repeatedly pleaded with Mr. Obama for over a year to  resolutely respond to this insidious, murderous, hellish evil. I  personally asked the president in an open video message if he did not  realize ``that by ignoring this monstrous, ideological evil, that you  allow it to grow, and you ultimately invite it to exercise its  desecration of the innocent within the shores of our own nation.''   Yet, President Obama stood by casually, golf club in hand, and  steadfastly refused ignored those entreaties. And terrorism did return  to America and for the first time since 9/11, innocent Americans  citizens were murdered by terrorists on American soil. Today Boko Haram  and ISIS are responsible for 51 percent, of all terrorist fatalities in  the world. Foreign intelligence agencies now estimate ISIS ranks are as  large as 200,000 fighters from 90 countries. ISIS and its affiliates  either control or hold influence in nearly 20 nations: Iraq, Syria,  Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Morocco, Mali, Saudi Arabia, Yemen,  Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Russia, Bosnia, Philippines, Indonesia,  and Malaysia.   Whether they manifested themselves as the Iranian mullahs, ISIS, Boko  Haram, Hezbollah,  [[Page H384]]  Hamas, or a dozen other names, Barack Obama refused to even call Global  Jihadists by name and he fundamentally refused to marshal the resources  of his presidency to bear on behalf of the thousands of helpless  victims they slaughtered. It is a disgrace that leaves me without words  to describe.   Mr. Obama released five of the most dangerous Taliban leaders along  with other terrorists held in Guantanamo Bay including 182 violent  prisoners who have been released from Guantanamo Bay, nearly 20 percent  of whom returned to the battlefield to fight United States forces and  interests the world over. Mr. Obama's ``slap on the wrist'' approach to  national security needlessly added and continues to add to the dangers  our men and women face in the fight against jihadist terrorism.   President Obama abandoned the Iranian freedom movement in 2009 when  the citizens of Iran took to the streets to protest the rigged  presidential election and to remove the Khamenei regime peacefully. He  supported the release of the Lockerbie bomber. He supported Civilian  trials for terrorists. Then due to those very procedural protections in  civil court that prevented introduction of crucial evidence, that Mr.  Obama had been specifically and repeatedly warned about in advance, the  civilian trial for the evil terrorist Ahmed Ghailani led to his  acquittal on more than 280 criminal charges of a man who openly  admitted his terrorist activities. And Mr. Obama specifically chose not  to prosecute the Muslim Brotherhood in the Holy Land Foundation trial  when the evidence against them was absolutely overwhelming. One week  after three Americans and our Ambassador were killed by Terrorists in  Benghazi, Mr. Obama and his administration stood in front of flag  draped coffins and lied to the American people about what really  happened.   The average number of Innocents killed by terrorists before the Obama  presidency was 3000 per year; now under Barack Obama it is thirty  thousand per year. And the number of terrorists willing to blow  themselves up to kill others is growing across the world. The chances  of radical Islamists getting weapons of mass destruction are also  growing.                                     iran    ``President Obama's has been the leading apologist in the world for  the Islamic Republic of Iran throughout his presidency. In his  relentless quest for a nuclear deal with the Islamic regime of Iran,  Mr. Obama simply chose to ignore the fact that Iran is the world's  leading state sponsor of terrorism.   The notion that the only alternative to seeking a nuclear deal with  the corrupt Khamenei regime is war is an illusion created by the Obama  administration. Obama communicated directly to Tehran through secret  back-channels his willingness to support Khamenei. The truth is that  the oppressed majority of the Iranian people did not then, and do not  today, support the Khamenei regime's nuclear program and in fact  desperately want to be rid of this poisonous regime.   Mr. Obama, with the help of liberal Democrats in Congress and the  embrace of the left, got his deal with Iran at all costs. The left  embraced it. But did Iran open its doors to U.S. goods? No. The  Ayatollah banned them. Did Iran renounce its support for terrorism? No.  It renewed support for Hamas, sent troops to Syria and armed rebels in  Yemen. Is Iran acting like a responsible regional power? No. In blatant  violation of U.N. sanctions, Iran is testing nuclear-capable missiles  and firing rockets near U.S. ships. And when the U.S. threatened to  respond to Iran's missile violations, did Iran back down? No. Iran's  ``moderate'' president ordered his military to accelerate Iran's  missile program. The Iranians believe Mr. Obama is a total pushover.  Mr. Obama said he was promoting peace, but he really only projected  weakness and the world's dictators took notice.   To pave the way for his insane nuclear agreement with Iran, Mr. Obama  ordered the CIA to sever contacts with green movement supporters and  even ended U.S. programs to document Iranian human rights abuses. It  seems there was nothing the Mr. Obama was not willing to sacrifice upon  the altar of the Iranian nuclear deal. To begin finalizing the Iran  agreement, Mr. Obama brought in John Kerry and the same basic team  which negotiated the nuclear deal with North Korea that paved the way  for North Korea to gain the nuclear weapons they have today--North  Korea, if you need to be reminded, is the same country which just this  year conducted a nuclear test, an ICBM test, and a submarine launched  ballistic missile test. From day one and the eight years that followed  it has overwhelmed comprehension how divorced the Obama Administration  has been from reality.   And Mr. Speaker, what exactly did the U.S. from the Iran Deal? A  completely unverifiable and tacit agreement from Iran that it will not  make a nuclear weapon in the next ten years. And that promise from the  jihadist government of Iran was good enough for Barack Obama. And Mr.  Speaker, what did Iran get out of the deal? The world's leading sponsor  of terrorism received $1.8 Billion in freed assets, a lifting of the  arms embargoes in five years, the toothless U.N. ban on Iran missile  development--which of course they are actively and continuously  violating. And after eight years, Iran will [quote] ``then be allowed  to build an industrial-scale nuclear program, with hundreds of  thousands of machines, after a ten year period of restraint.'' [end  quote] In order to reach this agreement, Obama ordered the executive  branch to cease categorizing Iranian human rights abuses, and now he  has also illegally paid $400 Million in ransom for American hostages  abducted by the Iranian regime, he has ceded control of Iraq to Iran,  he has ignored Iranian development of missiles capable of delivering  nuclear weapons, and--most significantly--he has ensured the Iranian  regime may legally develop nuclear weapons in the coming decade.   After the nuclear deal, Iran became only more arrogant and bold. They  seized two American naval vessels, took ten sailors hostage, and only  released them after the Administration apologized. An Iranian general  said the seizure of our ships was a warning to Congress against  imposing new sanctions for Iran's illegal nuclear missile tests. Iran's  intent and track record is crystal clear to almost everyone it seems,  but to President Obama.   The hallmark of Barack Obama's presidency has been that of weakening,  disarming, diminishing and apologizing for the United States of  America. For years many of us watched in utter disbelief at the great  lengths to which the Obama Administration has gone in order to secure a  deal at any price with Iran on their nuclear weapons program. He has  capitulated on every red line and minimum requirement that both he and  the United Nations had required. He has now squandered away every form  of leverage we had against this theocratic radial regime which has  broken every promise it has ever made to us. The jihadist leaders of  Iran came to the table with nothing and walked away with everything.  And now, instead of making sure they never get a nuclear weapon, Barack  Obama's politically motivated, peace-in-our-time capitulation has  strengthened Iran's ability to foment terrorism throughout the world as  it has for the last 40 years. And, now, because of his delusional  negotiation and acquiescence, this Islamic Republic of Iran, the number  one sponsor of terrorism in the world, has become a nation on a path  (cleared for them by President Barack Obama) to obtaining a nuclear  weapons capability. Indeed, Mr. Obama's actions may place the finger of  Jihad on the launch button of an entire nuclear arsenal; and America's  children and future generations may thereafter be forced to live their  lives in the shadow of nuclear terrorism.                                 Constitution    Perhaps Mr. Obama's biggest broken promise to all Americans was when  he said, ``I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will  execute the office of President of the United States faithfully, and  will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the  constitution of the United States. Whether we're talking about  Obamacare, or Mr. Obama's administration weaponizing the IRS to target  conservative groups, seizing the phone records of the Associated Press,  Suggesting that Fox News reporter James Rosen was a criminal without  evidence as an excuse to monitor his phone and e-mail, appointing Czars  with no accountability, appointing Assistant AG Thomas Perez who  steadfastly refused to affirm 1st Amendment Rights, called the  Constitution an ``imperfect document'' that ``reflected the fundamental  flaw of the country that continues to this day'', the seizure of the  press' phone records by the Justice Department, the walking of guns to  cartels during Operation Fast and Furious, unconstitutional recess  appointments, unconstitutional executive orders or the Administration's  intentional selective enforcement of the laws--This President has shown  complete and open contempt for the Constitution as a mere obstacle to  his preferred `pen and phone' method of governing through an executive  autocracy.   When Barack Obama came into office only one of the 13 federal appeals  courts had a majority of liberal Democrat appointed judges. Now, nine  of the 13 appeals courts have liberal Democrat appointees. Barack Obama  nominated to individuals to the Supreme Court who have no regard  whatsoever for the plain meaning and original intent of the  Constitution. The lawlessness of Obama's Progressive Utopia, was one  governed by the Pen and the Phone rather than the People. If Hillary  Clinton had been elected in November she would have almost certainly  appointed At Least Three more Supreme Court Justices which would have  completely abrogated the United States Constitution along with the  first second fifth and 14th amendments and all of the others for  generation or more. For the first time in its history, America would no  longer have been governed by the United States Constitution as the  supreme law of the land. There are simply no words to describe the  existential threat to the American Republic that Hillary  [[Page H385]]  Clinton would have inevitably represented if she had been elected  president of the United States. Without the American Constitution there  would have been no free America and without a free America there would  have been no free world. The implications would have been beyond  comprehension.                              Religious Liberty    Barack Obama's record is that of having assaulted centuries of legal  precedent and medical ethics, pushing forward his effort to roll back  regulations that protect physicians' rights of conscience. Amazingly,  the Obama administration accused the Catholic nuns Little Sisters of  the Poor, an entirely voluntary and Catholic organization dedicated to  hospice care for the indigent, of promoting a war on women . . . for  not agreeing to offer birth control as a Catholic health benefit, and  then threatened them with $70 million a year in fines for not  complying.   The Obama administration essentially argued before the Supreme Court  that the religious ministerial exception that had been bedrock law  since the Constitution was written did not actually exist and that  neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has  anything to say about a church's relationship with its own employees.  In a 9-0 opinion, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the  Administration's position, stating that ``imposing an unwanted  minister, the state infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which protects  a religious group's right to shape its own faith and mission through  its appointments.'' Despite Barack Obama's supposed expertise on the  Constitution, his administration has lost more 9-0 Supreme Court cases  than any other Administration in history and no president in history  ever posed more overt danger to religious freedom in America than  Barack Obama.   Mr. Obama casually ignored the historical and constitutional fact  that religious liberty involves much more than freedom of worship  alone, and that the fundamental rights of free speech and the free  exercise of religion do not stop at the exit door of the local house of  worship, but instead, extends to every area of life. Mr. Obama refused  respect the public component of religious liberty, and failed to  accommodate religion in our generally applicable laws, and placed in  grave danger, the religious freedom in the Constitution which  undergirds everything that is America.                                Race Relations    Barack Obama blatantly stoked racial tensions and in the process he  painted a target on the backs of the noble men and women in blue who  risk their lives every day to protect the innocent citizens of this  country. Some people even went looking to assassinate police officers.  And the result was that innocent Americans within both law enforcement  and the minority community died across America for no reason. Barack  Obama had an historic opportunity to unite America in a profound way.  Instead, he chose for temporary political gain to become the divider  and chief by seeking to divide America by race and class.             MR. OBAMA'S CONDESCENSION TOWARD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE    Barack Obama consistently subjected Americans to condescending  lectures. Because he was a Progressive Politician who had attended the  right schools held the right internships, and had the right credentials  he knew what was best for us farm better than we did that he was  morally empowered to properly order the minutiae of the lives of all of  the American people.   If we opposed Obamacare we didn't want people to have health  insurance.   If we opposed wasteful stimulus spending, we hated school teachers  and firemen.   If we opposed the nuclear deal with Iran, we were compared to  terrorist sponsoring Iranian Mullahs.   If we believe in God and exercise our Second Amendment Right, we were  bitter.   If we didn't believe in open, unsecured borders and vetting those who  come into this country, we were un-American.   And If we believed unborn baby girls should be protected under the  law, we were waging a war on women.   And Mr. Obama was also fond of using politically correct euphemisms  and constantly use them to distort nearly every issue:   (1) Evacuation of our Embassy in Yemen was ``a reduction in staff'   (2) Terror attacks are ``man-caused disasters''   (3) Global war on terror is an ``overseas contingency operation''   (4) An Islamic terrorist murdering 13 American soldiers is  ``workplace violence''   (5) Terrorists beheading children, crucifying women, and burning men  alive in the name of Islam are ``individuals from various religions''  who practice ``hateful ideologies''   (6) Veterans, pro-life groups, and state rights' advocates were  listed as ``at-risk'' to become domestic terrorists                                  obama care    Mr. Obama's signature policy achievement was the so-called Affordable  Care Act. As we have learned year after year, essentially nothing Mr.  Obama said about the Affordable Care Act was true. He told us his  mother's health insurance denied her paying for her cancer treatments-- but it was a blatant falsehood. He told America--many, many times--that  if we liked our plan and our doctor, we could keep our plan and our  doctor--but it was a blatant falsehood. In fact, Mr. Obama's speech  writers joked about deliberately putting that blatant falsehood over on  Charlie Rose, who, like many in the media, never pressed the issue.   Mr. Obama even deceived and betrayed Bart Stupak from his own party  and used a myriad of special political handouts like the Cornhusker  Kickback and the Louisiana Purchase to scrape together the support to  shove a giant government takeover of the healthcare industry down the  American people's throats and then raided the coffers of Medicare to  the tune of over $700 billion to help pay for it.   Anyone with a basic understanding of economics warned was going to  wreak havoc upon the insurance market. Barack Obama said, ``Obamacare  means more choice, more competition, lower costs.'' But now under Mr.  Obama's presidency, the Cost of Average Family Health Insurance Plan  has gone from $12,680 to over $25,000. Barack Obama said the ACA will  cost around $900 billion over 10 years; in reality it is at least $2  trillion or more. Mr. Obama said that it would lower health insurance  premiums by $2,500 per family. In 42 states, many premiums increased by  over 100 percent. Mr. Obama said, ``If you like your doctor, you can  keep your doctor'' That was a blatant falsehood. Mr. Obama said, ``I  will protect Medicare.'' That was a blatant falsehood. He robbed  Medicare to pay for Obama care. He said, ``Obama care will cover every  American.'' That was a blatant falsehood. Millions remain uninsured.  Healthcare costs have never been higher and the entire debacle called  Obamacare is now catastrophically collapsing before our very eyes.                                foreign-policy    From day one Barack Obama considered the Cold War a giant  misunderstanding. He did his famous reset with Russia and then turned  and caved into everything they wanted. Mr. Obama cancelled the missile  defense site and betrayed the Czech Republic and Poland to placate  Russia. He told Russian President Medvedev he would be more flexible  after his re-election on missile defense.   Barack Obama lifted sanctions on the communist dictatorship of Cuba  and the Islamist dictatorship of Iran. He has held our allies and the  enemies of human freedom to different standards, restoring diplomatic  relations with Cuba and making economic concessions to their government  with no reciprocity on human rights. President Obama praised the  murderous dictator when he offered condolences after Castro's death.  For decades, Democrats and Republicans alike maintained consistent  policies. At the end of the Obama administration, the only countries in  the world that we have better relations with under Barack Obama are  Iran and Cuba--and even that has been entirely on their terms. The  Saudis are so furious with Obama's surrender to Iran that they are  threatening to develop their own nuclear weapons.   Mr. Obama's policies of weakness and appeasement yielded Crimea, the  South China Sea, the rise of the Islamic State, the return of Iran, and  the unspeakable desecration of the innocent in Aleppo.   Mr. Obama said we were exercising leadership in Syria. But under his  ``leadership,'' he drew a red line and then ran from it. Iran and  Russia are now taking the lead in Syria. While he talks about  leadership, his lack of action contributed to 400,000 human beings dead  and generated 4 million migrants who are now destabilizing Europe.   The commentary of Jared Hatch of the Young Leaders Program at the  Heritage Foundation said it this way:   ``Contemplating the extermination of Aleppo and its people, I was  reminded of a sentence that I read this summer. It appeared in an  encomium to Elie Wiesel shortly after his death. It was a sterling  sentence. It declared: ``We must never be bystanders to injustice or  indifferent to suffering.'' That was Wiesel's teaching, exactly. The  problem with the sentence is that it was issued by the White House and  attributed to President Obama. And so the sentence was not at all  sterling. It was outrageously hypocritical.   How dare Obama, and members of his administration, speak this way?  After five years and more in which the United States' inaction in Syria  has transformed our country into nothing other than a bystander to the  greatest atrocity of our time, they have forfeited the right to this  language. Their angry and anguished utterances are merely the  manipulation of the rhetoric of conscience on behalf of a policy  without a trace of conscience. You cannot be cold-hearted and high- minded at the same time. Historians will record--they will not have to  dig deeply or interpret wildly to conclude--that all through the  excruciations of Aleppo, and more generally of Syria, the  [[Page H386]]  United States watched. As we watched, we made excuses, and occasionally  we ornamented our excuses with eloquence. The president is enamored of  his eloquence. But eloquence is precisely what the wrenching  circumstances do not require of him. In circumstances of moral (and  strategic) emergency, his responsibility is not to move us. It is to  pick up the phone. ``Elie did more than just bear witness,'' Obama said  in his eulogy, ``he acted.'' And he added: ``Just imagine the peace and  justice that would be possible in our world if more people lived a  little more like Elie Wiesel.'' Just imagine.   If Obama wants credit for not getting us into another war, the credit  is his. If he wants credit for not being guilty of ``overreach,'' the  credit is his. If he wants credit for conceiving of every obstacle and  impediment to American action in every corner of the globe, the credit  is his. But it is a shameful and incontrovertible fact of our history  that during the past eight years the values of rescue, assistance,  protection, humanitarianism and democracy have been demoted in our  foreign policy and in many instances banished altogether. The ruins of  the finest traditions of American internationalism, of American  leadership in a darkening world, may be found in the ruins of Aleppo.  Our ostentatious passivity is a primary cause of that darkening. When  they go low, we go home. The Obama legacy in foreign policy is vacuum- creation, which his addled America-First successor will happily ratify.  Aleppo was not destroyed by the Syrian army. It was destroyed by a  savage coalition led and protected by Russia. While they massacred  innocent men, women and children, we anxiously pondered scenarios of  ``deconfliction.''   We need to be unforgivingly clear. The obligation to act against evil  in Aleppo was no different from the obligation to act against the evil  in Sarajevo and Srebrenica. (Has anyone ever heard Mr. Obama mention  Bosnia?) It was no different from the obligation to act against the  evil in Rwanda. It was no different from the obligation to act against  the evil in Auschwitz. And we scorned the obligation. We learned  nothing. We forgot everything. We failed. We did not even try.   No, that is not quite right. It would be incorrect to analyze our  delinquency in Syria in the dichotomously simple terms of action and  inaction. The administration creatively pioneered a third option, which  it pursued not only in Syria but also in Ukraine and elsewhere: Between  action and inaction, it chose inconsequential action. There is the  Obama doctrine! We backed moderate Syrian rebels, but not as seriously  or as generously as the immoderate Syrian rebels were backed. We sent  in small numbers of special operators. The CIA ran a few programs. We  acted, in sum, only in ways certain not to affect the outcome. We were  strategically feckless. I suspect that the president believes that the  United States has no moral right to affect an outcome in another  country. I suspect that he regards such decisive action as imperialism,  or at least as Iraq-like. What this means in practice is that we will  not help people who deserve our help. In the spirit of respecting other  societies, we will idly gaze at their destruction. How would  disrespecting them be worse?   As a direct or indirect consequence of our refusal to respond  forcefully to the Syrian crisis, we have beheld secular tyranny,  religious tyranny, genocide, chemical warfare, barrel bombs and cluster  bombs, the torture and murder of children, the displacement of 11  million people, the destabilization of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the  ascendancy of Iran in the region, the emergence of Russia as a global  power, the diminishment of the American position in the world, the  refugee crisis in Europe, the resurgence of fascism in Europe and a  significant new threat to the security of the United States. It is  amazing how much doing nothing can do, especially when it is we who do  nothing.   Not long after he mourned Wiesel, the president engaged in another  one of his exercises in empathy without consequence. At the U.N. Summit  for Refugees and Migrants, he spoke of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian boy who  washed up dead on a beach in Turkey. ``That little boy on the beach  could be our son or our grandson,'' the president moistly said. ``We  cannot avert our eyes or turn our backs.'' And then we proceeded to  avert our eyes and turn our backs. The people who had the power to  prevent, stop or even mitigate this catastrophe should now bow their  heads and fall silent and reflect on how it is that they brought us so  low. Aleppo is no more, and we are weakened and disgraced.   Mr. Speaker, it is ironic and tragic that the fall of Aleppo comes as  Barack Obama is to leave office. Because it is one of the clearest  demonstrations of how his cowardly foreign and domestic policies have  consistently left tens of thousands of innocent helpless victims dead  in his wake.   When Islamic terrorists bombed Brussels, killing and injuring  hundreds of people, including Americans, President Obama was eating  cracker jacks at a baseball game rubbing elbows with a communist  dictator.   When the Benghazi tragedy occurred in the middle of a presidential  election, and three Americans and our ambassador were murdered by  terrorists the Obama Administration's spin-masters told us it was  because of a YouTube video. It was a dark and deliberate lie to the  American people in front of flag-draped coffins and was an egregious  example of the Obama Administration's astonishing lack of  accountability and transparency.   At a time when noble Americans were fighting and dying in the sands  of Iraq to secure a lasting peace and bring stability to the region,  Senator Obama vigorously opposed the Surge in Iraq and said [quote] ``I  am not persuaded that 20,000 additional troops in Iraq is going to  solve the sectarian violence there, in fact I think it will do the  reverse . . . I am going to actively oppose the president's proposal.''  [end quote]. In spite of the opposition to the Surge from Senator  Obama, Senator Reid, and many other partisan Democrats notwithstanding,  General Petraeus and our unbelievably courageous men and women in  uniform were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat--decimating  Al-Qaeda in Iraq, halting sectarian violence, and achieving a  sustainable peace. As thanks for this historic military feat, the Left  in America called him ``General Betray Us,'' and Senator Hillary  Clinton said his reports to the Senate by General Petraeus required the  ``willing suspension of disbelief.''   This was a despicable display of hyper-partisanship on the part of  Mr. Obama and the Democrats who refused to accept American victory in  Iraq. But then of course, the Obama Administration would go on to claim  the peace in Iraq as one of their foreign policy achievements.   Then in spite of the prescient advice President Bush gave on July 12,  2007 and the warnings of countless generals, Obama ignored his  commanders and precipitously withdrew our troops from Iraq. Even as we  withdrew our troops, Vice President Biden said of Iraq [quote] ``I  think it's going to be one of the great achievements of this  Administration. You're going to see 90,000 troops come marching home by  the end of the summer, you're going to see a stable government in Iraq  that is moving towards a representative government . . . '' [end quote]    is precisely because of President Obama's petulant decision to keep  his politically motivated campaign promise to remove all our troops  from Iraq that the Islamic State was able to form, spread across the  region, and bring about a brutal reign of evil the likes of which the  world has not seen since the Mongols rampaged across Asia.   Right after the Islamic state entered Iraq, many of us in Congress  wrote a letter to Mr. Obama beseeching him to understand the danger of  this terrorist organization and imploring him to respond while there  was time. Astoundingly, Mr. Obama labeled the Islamic state a junior  varsity team and his administration stood by with the collective golf  club in their hand while ISIS raped and murdered and beheaded its way  across Iraq, selling six-year-old girls into slavery and burning people  alive. The Islamic State now keeps an estimated 3,000 young girls and  women in sexual slavery, and they are being beaten and raped day after  day. It is mind-numbingly horrific to know what these innocent girls  are going through every day while Mr. Obama runs out the clock on his  term of office and hands the fight against ISIS off to the next  president. Under Mr. Obama's administration the murder of innocent  people by terrorists increased almost tenfold. Then when President  Obama drew his famous red line in Syria, Bashir Assad had been paying  attention and he knew he could simply ignore this red line in the sand  for what it was. And he proceeded to do just that and he remains in  power to this day slaughtering the moderate rebels and the Kurds  fighting ISIS.   In response to the onslaught of ISIS, President Obama launched one of  the most anemic and pathetic air campaigns in modern history and ISIS  grew to somewhere around 40,000 fighters under President Obama's watch.  He enabled ISIS to grow and metastasize, attract and radicalize  countless young men from the West who will attempt to return home and  unleash their virulent brand of Islam upon innocent Europeans and  Americans as we have so tragically seen in France, Brussels, and even  in the United States. During the so-called Arab Spring the Obama  administration sided with the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt.   Barack Obama mocked Mitt Romney during their second presidential  debate, saying ``The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign  policy back.'' Mr. Speaker--would to God that we could get the foreign  policy from the 1980s back! For eight years Barack Obama ignored the  fact that Vladimir Putin is a KGB killer intent on restoring Russia to  its Soviet-era in prayer for error. And it has been an absolute  national embarrassment to watch this Russian thug unceremoniously mop  the floor and the map of the world with the President of the United  States.  [[Page H387]]    In his first year of office, and on the very day of the 70th  anniversary of Soviet Invasion Day in Poland, President Obama betrayed  our European allies. The Czechs and the Poles had risked the survival  of their governments by agreeing to implement a missile-shield in their  countries that could have significantly devalued Iran's entire nuclear  missile pursuits and even one day may have protected America from the  Iranian nuclear missiles. But to placate a revanchist Russia Barack  Obama blatantly betrayed both the Czechs and the Poles and unilaterally  withdrew from the plan.   Under Barack Obama, U.S. agreements with our understandably nervous  friends in Eastern Europe were not worth the paper they were printed  on. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons with the written assurance from  Russia and the United States of America that its national sovereignty  would be protected. Then, in response to the unconscionable Russian  invasion of Ukraine and seizure of the Crimean Peninsula, the Obama  Administration would not even provide lethal armaments to the  Ukrainians. Instead he offered MREs. Then Mr. Obama evidently did not  deem that humiliation complete until he had turned to the Russians to  assist with Syria. The complete and total lack of leadership from the  Obama White House once again came full circle.   Ben Rhoades made an attempt to analyze the mindset of Barack Obama.  He said, [quote] ``He is smarter than everyone and more than willing to  actively lie and obfuscate to the American people and media to effect  his desired outcomes, despite, or in spite of, the will of the American  people, the law, and even common sense.''                               our ally israel    Barack Obama pledged [quote] ``unshakeable commitment'' [unquote] to  Israel's security. Mr. Obama stood before a group of thousands of  supporters of Israel and proclaimed that ``when the chips are down, I  have Israel's back.''   But then as President, he blatantly refused even to acknowledge  Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Then Mr. Obama consistently expressed  more open rebuke toward Israel for building houses in its capital city  than he expressed for Iran's efforts to build nuclear weapons with  which to existentially threaten the state of Israel along with the  peace and security of the entire human family.   Mr. Obama all but ignored Iran's call for Israel to be wiped off the  map. He supported the unification of Fatah and Hamas. He pressured  Israel to release over 100 murderers, rapists, and terrorists. He  suggested that Israel return to 1967 border lines which would have made  national security for the tiny nation of Israel almost impossible.   Benjamin Netanyahu came to Congress and said ``obviously we are going  to have to continue to prepare to defend ourselves by ourselves.''   On December 23, 2016, two days before Christmas and one day before  the start of Hanukkah, in the waning days of his administration, in the  safety of a lame-duck presidency, President Obama and Secretary Kerry  broke with over 20 years of bipartisan precedent and betrayed America's  best friend in the world when he orchestrated and then refused to veto  a United Nations Security Council resolution that undermined Israel's  very right to exist.   Under the manifestation of this resolution, Jewish citizens of Israel  could not legally step foot into the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem (where  they have resided for thousands of years) and they could not even stand  in front of the Western Wall, the holiest site of Judaism. In accepting  the factually and morally incorrect label of ``occupied'' proclaimed in  this resolution, President Obama and Secretary Kerry have reinforced  the position of the plethora of anti-Semites at the U.N.   This anti-Semitic resolution fueled and lent legitimacy to the  ongoing murderous hatred of Jews, which manifested itself once again  two weeks later when an ISIS-inspired murderer rammed his truck into a  group of 16 Jews who Obama helped label ``occupiers'' by his  abstention.   In an all-too-familiar scene, thousands of people poured into the  streets in Gaza to celebrate the murder of Jews. Amidst the  celebrations, candy was passed out and Fathi Hamad, the leader of the  Hamas, issued the following statement: ``The message of our Islamic  party Hamas is a message of encouragement and support for every jihadi  who carries out an attack that puts an end to the acts of the Zionist  enemy.''   Despite lending credence to the casus belli of the ISIS-inspired  attack, the President has yet to comment on this despicable act of  terrorism.   When the Security Council Quartet meets on January 15 and the full  UNSC meets on January 17, I am gravely concerned that Barack Obama will  overturn U.S. precedent going back to Lyndon Johnson and use the  opportunity to stab Israel in the back one final time by allowing the  anti-Semites at the UN to redraw the map to Israel's indefensible pre- 1967 borders--leaving the world's only Jewish state less than 9 miles  wide.   Up until Barack Obama became President, America protected the State  of Israel against the anti-Semitic mob we call the United Nations. The  only thing United about the United Nations has been their consistent  opposition to America and the state of Israel.   Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker. Orchestrating and then failing to  veto this resolution that undermined Israel's right to exist was a  cowardly act of political treachery by Barack Obama that has disgraced  the United States of America and it will send Barack Obama's name down  the corridor of history as an overt traitor to Nation of Israel.   It is an absolute disgrace that this President has been willing to  sacrifice the security and stability of this vital ally and our  greatest friend in the world, upon the altar of perceived international  civility. It is a betrayal that history will never forget.                               Innocent Victims    Perhaps the singularly saddest tragedy the Barack Obama leaves behind  are all of the innocent victims that needed his help so desperately and  for whom now that help is forever too late. Mr. Obama's Administration  consistently and unconscionably implemented policies across the board  that negatively impacted the most vulnerable in human society.   The Obama administration loosened restrictions on regimes using child  soldiers. The Obama administration officials repeatedly ignored Chinese  human rights abuses during trips to China.   FBI statistics indicate that hate crimes against the Jewish  population are up, but Mr. Obama was silent about that. There was and  is genocide against Christians taking place in the Middle East, but he  was also silent about that.   He stood by and let ISIS, Boko Haram, Russia, Syria and Planned  Parenthood brutally desecrate the innocent.                                   Abortion    Only three days after he took office, on January 23, 2009, President  Obama overturned America's long-standing policy, which prohibited  taxpayer dollars from being used to fund the killing of unborn children  by abortion overseas. In a time of economic crisis, President Obama  proceeded to give millions of U.S. Taxpayer dollars to abortion  providers in foreign countries.   Pastor Rick Warren asked candidate Obama, ``Forty million abortions,  at what point does a baby get human rights, in your view?'' Mr. Obama's  response was, ``Well, you know, I think that whether you're looking at  it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective,  answering that question with specificity, you know, is above my pay  grade.''   President Barack Obama had one of the greatest opportunities ever  afforded to any president to take his place among history's most  respected heads of state by defending the rights of the defenseless  which is the ultimate measure of every true statesman.   Not only did he fail that opportunity, lie went to great effort to  proactively promote the indiscriminate killing of the most defenseless  of all human beings. Barack Obama worked diligently to expand abortion  on demand in America and throughout the earth. He relentlessly worked  against taxpayer's wishes to give billions of taxpayer dollars to  Planned Parenthood, the largest promoter and perpetrator of abortion on  demand on Earth.   Throughout his presidency, Mr. Obama surrounded himself with some of  the most radical pro-abortion officials in public office, including  Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, who supports  Partial Birth Abortions, and White House Science Advisor John Holdren,  who has written openly about his support of radical policies like  forced abortions and forced sterilization.   In August 2010, authorities entered the clinic of Dr. Kermit Gosnell,  and found a torture chamber for little babies that defies description  within the constraints of the English-language.   According to the Grand Jury report: quote ``Dr. Kermit Gosnell had a  simple solution for unwanted babies: he killed them. He didn't call it  that. He called it `ensuring fetal demise.' The way he ensured fetal  demise was by sticking scissors in the back of the baby's neck and  cutting the spinal cord. He called it `snipping.' Over the years there  were hundreds of `snippings'.   Mr. Speaker, these were born alive children murdered by having their  spines snipped with scissors without anesthetic.   Ashley Baldwin, one of Dr. Gosnell's employees, said she saw babies  breathing and she described one as two feet long that no longer had  eyes or a mouth, but, in her words, was like making this ``screeching''  noise . . . and it ``sounded like a little alien.''   For God's sake Mr. Speaker, is that who we truly are?   As President of the United States of America at the time, Barack  Obama did not utter one syllable against these gut wrenching atrocities  of Kermit Gosnell or Planned Parenthood. He lectured this country on  almost everything and yet he was shamefully silent in  [[Page H388]]  the face of this insidious and horrifying genocide against these  helpless little born alive human children.   When he was in the state legislature, Mr. Obama actually voted no  four times on a bill that would have protected crying, kicking,  breathing babies after they were born alive.   Mr. Obama, also consistently supported the policy that allowed more  than 18,000 late-term, pain capable unborn babies were torturously  killed without anesthesia in America in just the last year. Many of  them cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid  going over their vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them.   In his position, President Barack Obama could have easily and  successfully enacted policies that would have saved the vast majority  of the little babies like the ones Dr. Kermit Gosnell killed, yet all  of his adult life he has actively and vigorously supported policies  that not only allowed but were the direct result of them being killed.   In 2015, the Center for Medical Progress released numerous video  recordings that incontrovertibly documented corporate officers and  employees of Planned Parenthood casually discussing the harvesting and  sale of the little body parts of countless little babies among the  hundreds of thousands of innocent babies they are killing in many of  the hundreds of existing abortion clinics owned by Planned ParenthoOd  across this nation. It was a revelation so ugly and evil that it still  casts an indelible stain of shame on all of us as Americans. Yet,  Barack Obama arrogantly and heartlessly did all that was necessary to  force American taxpayers to continue to fund this organization of human  butchery called Planned Parenthood.   In the U.S. Senate, Mr. Obama voted no on a bill that would have  prohibited someone from taking a minor child out of state for an  abortion without at least notifying the child's parents. He voted no on  a bill that would have allowed unborn babies in low income households  to be included for health insurance coverage.   As President he appointed an Empire of radically pro-abortion judges  and government bureaucrats. He vowed to veto The Prenatal  Nondiscrimination Act which would prohibit discriminating against an  unborn baby girl by subjecting her to abortion simply because she is a  little girl instead of a little boy.   He promised to veto the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act  after its historic passage in the United States House of  Representatives. This is a bill that would protect both mothers and  their little pain capable unborn babies between the beginning of their  sixth month of pregnancy and live birth from the unspeakable cruelty of  Planned Parenthood and evil monsters like Kermit Gosnell.   The House of Representatives later passed The Born Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act. This was a humane and reasonable bill that in  the name of humanity would simply protect those babies who had survived  the process of abortion and were born alive. born alive, Mr. Speaker.  Yet astonishingly, Barack Obama, the President of the United States and  the leader of the free world wrote a letter to Congress and said he  would veto this bill to protect these born alive babies if it ever  reached his desk. I can only say Mr. Speaker, that there is a moment in  the life of every policymaker when he or she makes a decision either to  protect the innocent or to embrace the Cimmerian darkness where the  light of human compassion has gone out and the survival of the fittest  has prevailed over humanity. President Barack Obama failed that moment.   President Barack Obama's record is crystal clear. For his entire his  political life, Mr. Obama has strongly supported the full legalization  of abortion on demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy for any  reason or no reason whatsoever including sex selection throughout all  nine months of pregnancy and he supported forcing American taxpayers to  pay for it whether the taxpayers liked it or not. Under President  Barack Obama, nearly 9 million innocent, defenseless little American  babies were aborted before they saw the first smile of their mother.   So ironically, Mr. Speaker, President Obama once spoke very noble and  poignant words that, whether he realized it or not, apply so profoundly  to this subject. Mr. Speaker, let me quote excerpted portions of his  comments:   Mr. Obama once said, ``This is our first task--caring for our  children. It's our first job. If we don't get that right, we don't get  anything right. That's how, as a society, we will be judged.''   He asked, ``Are we really prepared to say that we're powerless in the  face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard? Are we prepared  to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after  year is somehow the price of our freedom?''   He also said ``Our journey is not complete until all our children . .  .'' are ``cared for and cherished and always safe from harm.''   ``That is our generation's task'' he said, ``to make these words,  these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of  happiness real for every American.''   Mr. Speaker, never have I so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken  by President Obama as those I have just quoted. How I wish he could  somehow open his heart and his ears to his own words, and ask himself  in the core of his own soul, why these words that should apply to ALL  children, cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all  children?   Are there any children more vulnerable than little pain capable  babies are before they are even born? Could we not at least agree we  should all come together protect them when they are between the  beginning of the sixth month of pregnancy and birth when we know that  the thousands upon thousands of babies Planned Parenthood kills at this  age feel agonizing pain in the process of being murdered? Could we not  agree that little human babies who survive abortion and are born alive  should be protected? Could the President not have agreed to that much,  Mr. Speaker?   Ironically, Barack Obama was in the unique position, perhaps among  all other presidents in history, to bring this country together to  protect these helpless little babies. Yet as the most powerful human  being in the world, Mr. Obama chose to become the most powerful enemy  of the most helpless human beings in the world. Nothing will stain his  legacy or his claims of looking out for the little guy with more shame  than going down in history as the ``Abortion President''.   Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. Obama will hold to the standard line and  cloak it all in the name of freedom of choice as he is done throughout  his political life, but I wish he could just ask himself, what is so  liberating about dismembering living, helpless little human babies?   Mr. Speaker, I once prayed and hoped that Barack Obama would take a  different road than he did when it came to protecting innocent  humanity. Just before he first took office eight years ago, I wrote the  President of the United States an open letter on this very issue of  protecting the innocent unborn child that was published in Human Events  Magazine the very day he raised his hand to take the oath of office,  swearing before God that he would preserve and protect the Constitution  of the United States. Several days later in the White House I  personally handed Mr. Obama that original letter which he promised to  read.   In that letter I wished him well, hoping that he would use his unique  and historic opportunity to bring together Americans in their common  humanity to a moment of renewed commitment to recognize and protect  every member of the human family including the innocent unborn child.   The letter is as follows:   Dear President Barack Obama,   History and the human family find themselves at a crossroads as you  take the oath of office to become the 44th President of the United  States. I am told you are the first to request to be sworn in with your  hand on the same Bible used by Abraham Lincoln when he took the same  oath.   In the days, years, and generations to come, many voices will speak  to the profound symbolism of this gesture on your part. History will  also record whether or not you honored those noble principles held in  the heart of Abraham Lincoln; that all of God's children have the right  to live, and be free, and to pursue their dreams.   This is one Republican with the sincerest prayer that history will  confirm that you did.   May I submit that the surest hope of such a confirmation is for you  and the Nation to remember why we built that grand white granite  memorial along the Potomac to Mr. Lincoln, and why we revere him so  deeply.   We honor Abraham Lincoln most because he found within himself the  humanity and courage to transcend the politics and convention of his  day, to recognize the child of God in a slave, which both the tide of  public opinion and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision had declared  to be a nonperson, and unprotectable by law.   History found Abraham Lincoln a faithful steward of the hope, human  dignity, and deliverance of those who bore the image of God in the  shame of slavery; and now it waits to witness President Barack Obama's  stewardship of the hope, human dignity, and deliverance of those who  bear the image of God in unborn silence.   Yes, it is true, Mr. President, that no issue since slavery has  divided Democrats and Republicans so deeply as abortion. Yet, the two  issues are so profoundly similar. In both cases, the innocent victims  were arbitrarily dehumanized in the name of freedom. And yes, it will  be easy for you to listen to the voices of those who still today, in  the name of freedom, would deprive the innocent of both life and  liberty. Certainly, their familiar phrases prevailed for a time in the  days of slavery.   However, is it possible that in hindsight, and with the weight of  history on your shoulders, that you might find the courage to reject  this insidious deception that has crushed so many  [[Page H389]]  lives across history, and that relentlessly pursues this nation still?   Mr. Lincoln did. He said, ``Those who deny freedom to others deserve  it not themselves, and under a just God, cannot long retain it.'' That  is why we love him, and built our memorial to him.   So, as you lay your hand upon his Bible, Mr. President, may I adjure  you to listen, in the stillness of your own heart, to the faint cries  for mercy from those little souls who now look to you for hope; and to  the words printed in red on the pages beneath your hand which will be  declared again in eternity's final day;   ``Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my  brethren, you have done it unto me.''   Mr. Speaker, I truly and sincerely wished God's best for Barack Obama  when he took office, just as I do now. And it gives me no pleasure to  lay out what I believe to be the profound failures of Mr. Obama's  presidency. However, in a Republic like ours where the people are the  final arbiters of our public policy, and where those who would subvert  this Republic consistently resort to deception and historical  revisionism, an accurate record is vital to our nation's survival and  its future generations.   So, alas Mr. Speaker, I am afraid President Obama tragically wasted  his precious and historic opportunity. However, this is the true record  of President Barack Obama, and to paraphrase William Wilberforce, ``We  may choose to look the other way but we can never say again that we did  not know.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 19 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, January 12, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
