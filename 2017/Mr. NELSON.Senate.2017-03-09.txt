 Madam President, I come to the floor with a heavy heart  because 10 years ago today, Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent, was  detained in Iran on the tourist island of Kish Island in the Persian  Gulf.   Bob is a very respected, long-time FBI agent who had served his  country for 28 years and had since retired. He is the longest held  civilian in our Nation's history. He is a husband, a father of seven,  and now a grandfather of six, and he deserves to be reunited with his  family.   Since Bob's detention, American officials have sought Iran's  cooperation in locating and returning Bob to his family. Of course,  Iranian officials have promised over and over their assistance, but  after 10 long years, those promises have amounted to nothing. Bob still  is not home.   The bottom line is, Iran is responsible for returning Bob to his  family. If Iranian officials don't have Bob, then they sure know where  to find him. So today we renew our call on Iran to make good on those  promises and return Bob, return him to where he ought to be, with his  family.   Iran's continued delay in returning him, in addition to the very  serious disagreements the United States has with the Government of Iran  about its missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its human  rights abuses, is just another obstacle Iran must overcome if it wants  to improve relations with the United States.   We also urge the President and our allies to keep pressing Iran to  make clear that the United States has not forgotten Bob and will not  forget him until he is home. Obviously, we owe this to Bob, a servant  of America, and we certainly owe it to his family.   To Bob's family, we recognize your tireless efforts over those 10  long years to bring your dad home, and we offer our sympathies.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.
