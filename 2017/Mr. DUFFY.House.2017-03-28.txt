 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to  recognize the loss of four members of our greater-Wausau community. It  was last week that four lives were taken from us all too early.   Karen Barclay was warm and caring to everyone around her. At Marathon  Savings Bank, she made sure that no child left the bank without a  lollipop.   Dianne Look, known as Dee-Dee, celebrated her 25th wedding  anniversary last month. Dianne loved to make jewelry, raising money for  the American Cancer Society.   Sara Quirt-Sann had an infectious laugh. She ran her own law  practice, and she proudly served as a guardian ad litem for kids in our  community.   We also lost Detective Jason Weiland of the Everest Metro Police  Department, who was killed in the line of duty. Serving 18 years in  what was described as his dream job, Detective Weiland wore the Everest  Metro PD uniform because he wanted to protect people and keep his  community safe.   On behalf of this institution, I rise to extend my deepest regrets to  their families, their mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, and  children, who no longer have a special member in their homes.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 201 on motion to table the  appeal of the ruling of the chair, I am not recorded.
