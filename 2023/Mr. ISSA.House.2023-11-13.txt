 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1505) to modify the prohibition on recognition by United States  courts of certain rights relating to certain marks, trade names, or  commercial names, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1505         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``No Stolen Trademarks Honored       in America Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF PROHIBITION.         Section 211 of the Department of Commerce and Related       Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (as contained in section       101(b) of division A of Public Law 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-      88) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(2)--        (A) by inserting ``or entity of the executive branch''       after ``U.S. court'';        (B) by striking ``by a designated national''; and        (C) by inserting before the period ``that was used in       connection with a business or assets that were confiscated       unless the original owner of the mark, trade name, or       commercial name, or the bonafide successor-in-interest has       expressly consented'';        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) by inserting ``or entity of the executive branch''       after ``U.S. court''; and        (B) by striking ``by a designated national or its       successor-in-interest'';        (3) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (e);        (4) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:        ``(d) Subsections (a)(2) and (b) of this section shall       apply only if the person or entity asserting the rights knew       or had reason to know at the time when the person or entity       acquired the rights asserted that the mark, trade name, or       commercial name was the same as or substantially similar to a       mark, trade name, or commercial name that was used in       connection with a business or assets that were       confiscated.''; and        (5) in subsection (e), as so redesignated, by striking ``In       this section:'' and all that follows through ``(2) The term''       and inserting ``In this section, the term''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1505.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is hard for the American people to believe, but it is  true that foreign actors--foreign countries--have, in fact, stolen  trademarks, absconded with the actual factories and the ability to  produce various items and then had the gall to, in fact, use American  law to sell America products that they in reality had already stolen.   This is no more truer than in the case of the communist nation of  Cuba.   Under Fidel Castro, Cuba took everything. They took Coca-Cola. They  took every possible item they could take, and then they took trade  names. In some cases, like Coca-Cola, Coke continued to be produced in  the United States, so it had no rights.   In the case of Bacardi, Bacardi moved to Puerto Rico and began making  it there and selling it in the United States. In the case of, for  example, Havana Club, they found themselves without any factories, so  they worked together with other producers to continue their brand.  While their brand was, in fact, being produced in America, the Castro  regime--and now the Cuban Government--continued to apply year after  year until eventually, due to what we would consider to be a wrongful  act by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, awarded this  country, who had stolen and still to this day uses the factories and  the lands belonging to the family that produced Havana Club, they  continue to sell Havana Club.   Now, to make matters worse, we are only talking about the United  States because most of the world, in fact, took that brand name and was  able to sell it in other countries. So the family that owned worldwide  rights lost all but the United States, and if not for this piece of  legislation, they and others would lose even their right here.   I am delighted to join with my colleague, Ms. Wasserman Schultz of  Florida, to introduce this bill. It has 17 cosponsors, and it passed  through the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis.   We all agree that the U.S. Government should not award those who  steal and exploit trademarks or any other intellectual property from  its legitimate owners to then benefit from U.S. law. Allowing Cuba to  propagate its misappropriations would be and is currently a travesty.  [[Page H5677]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I will make it very clear, if this  product's trademark becomes available to its rightful owners again, the  well-known company Bacardi will, in fact, have this product on the  shelves again. If it is not passed, Cuba will not be able to sell under  this name. In fact, these products would be prohibited if they came  from Cuba.   The only purpose of Cuba trying to take this was to deny Cuban  Americans the ability to sell a product that they owned before it was  taken from the country.   There was an injustice that occurred before many in this room were  born. We can only cure that injustice now by, in fact, passing this  legislation.   I join with the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) in  urging all to vote for this bill as they have in this body, and then we  will work on the people across the dome.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1105) to amend the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000  to reauthorize the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1105         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Debbie Smith Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.         Section 2(j) of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of       2000 (34 U.S.C. 40701(j)) is amended by striking ``fiscal       years 2019 through 2024'' and inserting ``fiscal years 2024       through 2029''.       SEC. 3. AUDITS TO PROTECT INTEGRITY OF GRANT AWARDS.         Section 2(c)(4) of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act       of 2000 (34 U.S.C. 40701(c)(4)) is amended by striking       ``2022'' and inserting ``2029''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert extraneous material on H.R. 1105.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, much has been said, but I am going to close with just  two important items. One is that there is no question at all but that  this has been a good reauthorization because it calls for the  accountability and the audit to find out why the backlog persists and  to find ways to eliminate it. Second is its original purpose. Its  original purpose, more than anything else, is very simple. There are  hundreds of rapists out there, and they will continue to perpetrate  their crimes until they are caught. This DNA evidence, in fact, takes  rapists off the street that otherwise will be committing these crimes,  violating other persons, until they are stopped. For that reason, we  must reauthorize and appropriate for this legislation. It is critical  that we take these evil people off the street. This is the way to do  it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
