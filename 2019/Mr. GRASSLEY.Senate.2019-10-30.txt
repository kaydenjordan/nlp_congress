 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate as in morning business for 1 minute.    Mr. President, before I read, I want to apologize to  the Small Business Women of America because October is National Women's  Small Business Month, and my apologies because this speech should have  been given on October 1 rather than at the end of the month.   October is National Women's Small Business Month, and I want to  recognize the many women-owned businesses. They really help make our  economy stronger. In Iowa, we work hard to inspire women to start  businesses and support them in their entrepreneurial journeys.   According to American Express, Iowa ranks eighth out of 50 States for  growth in the number of women-owned businesses, as well as in their own  growth in employment and revenues.   The network growth for women entrepreneurs and access to resources  have helped make the difference in these women's lives and our  communities. I hope that this growth will continue and that we will  continue to have a massive increase in the number of women's small  businesses in America.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 further minute  as in morning business.    Mr. President, I know you aren't going to believe  this--what happened in addition to President Trump being sworn in--but  on January 20, 2017, President Trump was sworn into office and became  our Nation's 45th President. Most Presidents enjoy what political  scientists refer to as a ``honeymoon'' period. During that honeymoon  period, these new Presidents are given a chance to push their agenda,  and partisan politics usually takes a back seat--but not for this  President.   On his Inauguration Day, January 20, 2017, a Washington Post headline  read--so it had to be coming out even before he was sworn in--``The  campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.'' That campaign has been  in full swing ever since. Let's make no mistake: This process about  concerns over alleged high crimes and misdemeanors, as the Constitution  speaks about the reasons for impeachment, doesn't really mean much  compared to an effort to impeach this President that started before he  ever was sworn in. No, instead, this is about the Democratic Party,  still bitter years later, trying to undo the 2016 election.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  that article in the Washington Post, dated January 20, 2017.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, Jan. 20, 2017]              The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun                               (By Matea Gold)          The effort to impeach President Donald John Trump is       already underway.         At the moment the new commander in chief was sworn in, a       campaign to build public support for his impeachment went       live at ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.org, spearheaded by two liberal       advocacy groups aiming to lay the groundwork for his eventual       ejection from the White House.         The organizers behind the campaign, Free Speech for People       and RootsAction, are hinging their case on Trump's insistence       on maintaining ownership of his luxury hotel and golf course       business while in office. Ethics experts have warned that his       financial holdings could potentially lead to constitutional       violations and undermine public faith in his decision-making.         Their effort is early, strategists admit. But they insist       it is not premature--even if it triggers an angry backlash       from those who will argue that they are not giving the new       president a chance.         ``If we were to wait for all the ill effects that could       come from this, too much damage to our democracy would       occur,'' said Ron Fein, legal director at Free Speech for       People. ``It will undermine faith in basic institutions. If       nothing else, it's important for Americans to trust that the       president is doing what he thinks is the right thing . . .       not that it would help jump-start a stalled casino project in       another country.''         The impeachment drive comes as Democrats and liberal       activists are mounting broad opposition to stymie Trump's       agenda. Among the groups organizing challenges to the Trump       administration is the American  [[Page S6262]]       Civil Liberties Union, which plans to wield public-records       requests and lawsuits as part of an aggressive action plan       aimed at protecting immigrants and pushing for government       transparency, among other issues.         ``We think that President Trump will be in violation of       the Constitution and federal statutes on day one, and we plan       a vigorous offense to ensure the worst of the constitutional       violations do not occur,'' said Anthony D. Romero, the ACLU's       executive director.         ``We may have a new president, but we have the same old       system of checks and balances,'' he added.         Strategists behind the campaign for impeachment said they       are confident that other groups will soon join their cause.       They argue that Trump will immediately be in violation of the       U.S. Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause, which       prohibits a president from accepting a gift or benefit from a       foreign leader or government.         Fein cited several examples, including rent paid by the       Industrial & Commercial Bank of China for its space in Trump       Tower in New York and potential ongoing spending by foreign       diplomats at the Trump International Hotel in Washington and       other Trump properties. In addition, he said, royalties       collected by the Trump organization from the president's       business partner in the Philippines, who was recently named       special envoy to the United States, could violate the clause.         Trump said this month that he would donate ``profits''       from foreign business clients to the U.S. Treasury. However,       neither Trump nor representatives of the Trump Organization       have provided details on how such payments would be tracked,       collected and disbursed.         The foreign emoluments clause has never been tested in the       courts, and some scholars argue that violating it would not       qualify as ``treason, bribery or other high crimes and       misdemeanors,'' the grounds for impeachment of a federal       official.         But Fein noted that former Virginia governor Edmund       Jennings Randolph, a delegate to the Constitutional       Convention and later the first U.S. attorney general, argued       during Virginia's debate over ratifying the constitution that       a president who was found to have taken a foreign emolument       ``may be impeached.''         His group has mapped out a long-shot political strategy to       build support for a vote in the House on articles of       impeachment.         The first step is fairly simple: getting a resolution       introduced that calls for the House Judiciary Committee to       investigate whether there are grounds to impeach Trump--a       move that Fein said a number of members of Congress are       interested in taking. ``Getting it introduced is not going to       be a problem,'' he said.         Still, the idea that a majority of the GOP-controlled       House members would ultimately vote to launch an       investigation of the new president seems highly improbable.       Fein said he is confident the political climate will change       and lawmakers will eventually support the effort.         ``I think that at a certain point, the combination of new       revelations coming out and, importantly, calls and pressure       from constituents in their own districts will be a deciding       factor,'' he said. ``And at some point, they will decide it       is in their own interests to support this.''         While half a dozen federal judges in American history have       been impeached by the House and successfully convicted in the       Senate, no U.S. president has ever been removed from office       through such a process. The closest was Andrew Johnson, who       narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate in 1868 after the       House charged him with removing the secretary of war in       violation of the Tenure of Office Act.         In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved articles       of impeachment against then-President Richard Nixon, but he       resigned before they could be voted on by the full House.       President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House on charges       of perjury and obstruction of justice, but the articles of       impeachment were defeated in the Senate in 1999.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
