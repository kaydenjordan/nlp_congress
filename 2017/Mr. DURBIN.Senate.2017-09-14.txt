 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, each year the Department of Defense funds  billions of dollars in military-relevant medical research--research  that offers our servicemembers concrete treatments for the particular  diseases and afflictions that impact them the most, research that  offers families hope, research that improves lives, and research that  saves lives.   Last summer, during consideration of the fiscal year 2017 Defense  Authorization Act, there was a question as to whether Congress would  permit this lifesaving research to continue or whether instead we would  wrap it up in so much redtape that it would basically go away.   I was proud that this Senate Chamber, on a bipartisan basis, voted  resoundingly to continue medical research in the Department of Defense  by a vote 66 to 32. It was an important, bipartisan vote, especially in  a Senate where we have a difficult time finding common ground. When it  came to medical research in the Department of Defense for members of  the military and their families, we said unequivocally that we are  committed to it on a bipartisan basis. I was proud to lead that fight,  along with Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a Republican, to protect  defense medical research. Altogether, 40 of my Republican and  Democratic colleagues co sponsored our effort.   That vote was not just a vote for medical research, it was a vote for  the men and women in the military and their families. The vote  recognized that right now, we are closer than ever to finding cures for  dreaded diseases like cancer; closer than ever to understanding how to  delay the onset of neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and  Parkinson's; closer than ever to developing a universal flu vaccine.  That vote recognized that now is the time to be ramping up our  investment in medical research, not scaling it back. The Senate spoke,  but unfortunately it didn't end the debate.   This year, the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act  now pending on the floor of the Senate repeats last year's research- killing provisions and, for inexplicable reasons, adds two more. Just  like last year, these provisions in the bill pending on the floor of  the Senate would effectively end the Department of Defense medical  research program. Like last year, these provisions wrapped this  research in more redtape than you could possibly explain. And we face  the prospect for the second year in a row of the end of this critical,  lifesaving medical research.   These provisions are dangerous, and by cutting medical research, they  will cost lives--the lives of our military and their families. So I  filed a bipartisan amendment, along with 53 additional cosponsors and  my lead cosponsor, Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, to remove  these provisions from this Defense authorization bill so that  lifesaving research can continue.   The underlying Defense authorization bill has four provisions that,  if enacted, will end the DOD's research.   The first provision, section 733, would require the Secretary of  Defense to certify that each medical research grant awarded is  ``designed to directly protect, enhance or restore the health and  safety of members of the Armed Forces''--not veterans, not retirees,  not the spouses of military members, not the children of military  members.   To make matters worse, after the Secretary makes this certification  in writing to the Armed Services Committee, the Defense Department is  then required to wait 90 days before awarding the grant. It is not only  redtape, it is built-in delay.   In my view, veterans, retirees, and spouses and children of  servicemembers are all vital members of the Department of Defense's  military community. They use the Department of Defense healthcare  system. They deserve to be counted. When a member of the military  deploys, the family deploys, and we ought to stand by all of them.   The second provision, section 891, requires that medical research  grant applicants meet the same accounting and pricing standards that  DOD requires of procurement contracts. That sounds simple enough,  doesn't it? But these are regulations that private companies have to  meet to sell the Department of Defense goods and services, like weapon  systems and equipment.   The third provision, section 892, changes the ground rules for how to  handle the technical data generated by this research--information  related to clinical trials and manufacturing processes. How does this  bill change it? This should sound familiar: by wiping away the existing  regulations and imposing overly burdensome and unappealing regulations  that would scare off research partners.   I am sympathetic to what this section may be attempting to do. In the  face of ever-increasing prescription drug costs, it does make sense for  the Federal Government to have more rights when it comes to products  and treatments developed with Federal taxpayer dollars. However, we  must be more strategic about how to approach this. I look forward to  working across the aisle on ways to beef up the government's role in  helping to keep drug costs down, especially for products that would not  have been possible without Federal investments.   The fourth provision, section 893, requires the Defense Contract  Audit Agency to conduct audits on each grant recipient.   For those who aren't familiar with this audit agency, it is currently  backlogged with tens of billions of dollars' worth of procurement  contracts that it has to audit. This provision in the bill would add to  this pile, requiring it to conduct an additional 800 audits per month  on medical research grants--more redtape; no real reason.   Taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent, and the  existing system does that. The grant application must show that the  research is relevant to the military. No grant makes it through the  first round without showing clear military relevance. If an applicant  fails this test, that is the end of the story. If they clear the  hurdle, then they are subjected to a long list of critical defense  researchers  [[Page S5719]]  and issue experts in the disease in question to ensure that their  research proposal is worth the investment. But that is not it.  Representatives from the National Institutes of Health and the  Department of Veterans Affairs also have input at that point to make  sure it doesn't duplicate any existing research. These rules are in  place to protect taxpayer dollars, and they work.   This year's Defense authorization attempts to add redtape to the  program in the name of protecting it but in reality ends it. Simply  put, these provisions would strangle the Department of Defense medical  research program in suffocating redtape. Don't take my word for it. The  Coalition for National Security Research, representing a broad-based  coalition of research universities and institutes, said:         [These sections] could jeopardize funding for research       activities that have broader relevance to U.S. military,       including the health and wellbeing of military families and       veterans, and the efficiency of the military healthcare       system.    We asked the Department of Defense how the new system proposed in  this bill would work. Here is their analysis:         This language would, in essence, eliminate military family       and military retiree relevant medical research, inhibit       military medical training programs, and impact future health       care cost avoidance. Impacts will take place across all       areas. . . . [Researchers] would most likely not want to do       business with the DOD. . . . [The provisions] may create a       chilling effect on potential awardees of DOD assistance       agreements.    A ``chilling effect'' on medical research--is that what we want to go  on the record to vote for with this bill? Is that what the Senate  wants? Is that what we want to say to members of the military, their  families, and retirees? I don't think so.   These provisions are simply put in the bill to erect roadblocks to  critical, important medical research.   Let's talk for a minute about the medical research funded by DOD, the  real-world impact.   Since fiscal year 1992, the Congressionally Directed Medical Research  Programs has invested almost $12 billion in innovative medical  research. This medical research command determines the appropriate  research strategy, filling research gaps, and creates a public-private  partnership between the Federal Government, private universities, and  those who desperately need this research.   In 2004, the Institute of Medicine, an independent organization,  looked at the medical research program that I have discussed, and what  did they find? ``The CDMRP has shown that it has been an efficiently  managed and scientifically productive effort.'' That is a pretty solid  endorsement of $12 billion worth of medical research. They found that  this program ``concentrates its resources on research mechanisms that  complement rather than duplicate the research approaches of major  funders of medical research in the United States, such as the National  Institutes of Health.'' They also found that ``the program appears to  be well-run, supports high-quality research, and contributes to  research progress.''   The Institute of Medicine also reviewed the program in 2016. This was  their conclusion just last summer about the same program:         CDMRP is a well-established medical research funding       organization, covering many health conditions of concern to       members of the military and veterans, their families, and the       general public. . . . In general--    And this is highlighted--       the committee found CDMRP processes for reviewing and       selecting applications for funding to be effective in       allocating funds for each research program.    This program has been closely vetted, as it should be. It is a matter  of medical research critical to members of the military and their  families. It is a matter of life and death. It is a matter of the  integrity of spending taxpayers' dollars. It is a good program, a solid  program. It has not been wrought with scandal. There is no reason for  us to turn it upside down or to turn the lights out in the offices of  these researchers.    The Institute of Medicine had this right. We have real results to  back up the way we feel about this. What areas have they embarked on  with critical successful research? One of the greatest success stories  of this program is advances we have made in breast cancer treatment. In  1993, the Department of Defense awarded Dr. Dennis Slamon two grants  totaling $1.7 million for a tumor tissue bank to study breast cancer.  He began his work several years earlier with funding from the National  Cancer Institute. The DOD kicked in to help.   Dr. Slamon's DOD-funded work helped to develop Herceptin, which is  now FDA approved, one of the most widely used drugs to fight breast  cancer. This research has not only saved the lives of countless women  in the military, but it has had application far beyond the military.  The same thing is true when it comes to prostate cancer and Parkinson's  disease. What we found over and over is that money invested in this  program for medical research is money well spent. Why, then, would we  bury this program in redtape?   I am happy that some 54 or 55 Senators from both sides of the aisle  are going to stand with me, and I see I have other colleagues preparing  to speak. I will return to speak more specifically about the programs  of this agency.   Is there a person in this country who believes that America is  spending too much money on medical research? Well, perhaps there is,  but I haven't met them. What I have found over and over is that Members  of both political parties are committed to medical research. The  Department of Defense does a great job with the resources given to  them.   Let's continue this program as a salute to our men and women in the  military, their families, and our veterans.   I yield the floor.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez), and the Senator from Florida  (Mr. Nelson) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, this week, we mourn the loss of Pete  Domenici, a former Senate colleague, a respected and leading voice in  bipartisanship, and, most of all, a friend.   Pete had the distinction of being the longest serving Senator in New  Mexico's history. He spent almost half a century as a public servant.   Most knew Pete for his outspokenness on energy and budget issues, but  I remember him best for his commitment and dedication on behalf of  Americans struggling with mental illness.   In 2008, two Senators--Paul Wellstone, a liberal Democrat from  Minnesota, and Pete Domenici, a conservative Republican from New  Mexico--came together to pass legislation that prohibited health  insurance companies from treating mental health differently from  physical health benefits.   The Wellstone-Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act  finally set mental health and substance abuse benefits on equal footing  with other health benefits, ensuring fairness in deductibles,  copayments, provider networks, and lifetime limits.   Those two Senators couldn't have been more different, but they each  had family members who were touched by mental illness.   Pete Domenici and Paul Wellstone asked, Why should we treat illnesses  of the brain any different than a cancer, diabetes, or heart disease?   That shared bond brought them together. It is why they spent years  fighting with insurance companies about the importance of mental health  coverage and ultimately got a law passed.   The Wellstone-Domenici Parity Act laid the groundwork for so much of  what we fought for in the Affordable Care Act: the idea that people  should have access to coverage, regardless of what their medical needs  are.   You see, the ACA built off this law by requiring that all individual  market insurance plans cover mental health and substance abuse services  as an ``essential health benefit.''   Thanks to Pete's hard work, millions of Americans no longer have to  fight for mental health benefits or addiction treatment benefits, so  important in the face of today's opioid crisis.   Pete taught us that mental illness is exactly that--an illness--and  that those who suffer from any illness deserve equal rights and access  to care.   Senator Domenici was also a strong advocate for immigration reform.   Back in 2002, he signed on as a cosponsor of the original DREAM Act,  legislation that I introduced to give a path to citizenship to talented  young immigrants who grew up in the country.   As the son of an Italian immigrant mother and an Italian-born father  who earned citizenship after his service in WWI, Pete understood  firsthand the immigrant experience.   He once said, ``I understand this whole idea of a household with a  father who is American and a mother who is not, but they are living,  working, and getting ahead. I understand that they are just like every  other family in America. There is nothing different. They have the same  love, same hope, same will and same aspirations as those of us who were  born here have.''   Pete didn't just talk; he put his money where his mouth was.   In 2006, he voted for the McCain-Kennedy comprehensive immigration  reform bill that included the DREAM Act.   It passed the Republican-controlled Senate on a strong bipartisan  vote, but unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the House of  Representatives never brought it to a vote.   Senator Domenici's work in the Senate is a great example of the good  that can come from bipartisanship--of what can happen when we start  working together to get something done for the American public.   It is my hope that we can carry on Pete's legacy of equal rights for  all through bipartisan means.   My condolences to the Domenici family and thank you for sharing such  an earnest man with us.
