 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   As a Virginian, I am proud that my State is currently one of the 27  that protects the fundamental right to work. Because of Virginia's pro- business and pro-employer stance, it has once again been ranked the  number one State in which to do business by CNBC.   Unfortunately, this is being threatened both at the State level in  the Virginia General Assembly and now at the Federal level through this  bill, the PRO Act.   Every American should have the right to get a job or keep a job  without being required to join a labor union. This bill would  inappropriately preempt and prohibit that right, while concurrently  violating the privacy of workers by forcing the sharing of their  personal contact information with union organizers, even when this has  been shown to enable harassment and intimidation of those very workers.  This is unacceptable.   The PRO Act would have grave impacts on workers and businesses at a  great cost to the fabric of our workforce.   Founding Father and fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson said: ``To  compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of  opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.''   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and  to stand for the freedoms and success that our Founding Fathers  believed in.
