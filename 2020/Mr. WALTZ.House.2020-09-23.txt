 Madam Speaker, H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy and Jobs  Innovation Act, authorizes research and development activities across  the Department of Energy's applied energy programs.   As my colleagues have noted, while there are several bipartisan  provisions in this package, they are outweighed, unfortunately, by  partisan priorities in a rushed and irresponsible legislative process.   I think, by now, we can all recognize how many missed opportunities  for true bipartisanship have been complicated by this approach.  Critical minerals is certainly one of them.   Critical minerals play a vital role in our everyday lives. Battery  storage, defense systems, healthcare equipment, medicines, things that  impact U.S. national security, economic growth, and energy independence  are all reliant on secure and safe access to critical minerals.   However, currently, the United States is dependent on other countries  for 31 of 35 critical minerals identified by the Department of the  Interior; and of these, 14 are imported to the U.S. at a rate of 100  percent.   On the list are lithium and graphite that power clean energy  solutions, all of which are controlled by China. China, in fact, holds  an overwhelming advantage in access to critical minerals, and the  COVID-19 pandemic has made it dangerously clear that we cannot, as a  nation, rely on China for our essential resources.   In May, I introduced H.R. 7061, the American Critical Mineral  Exploration Act, which builds on the successes of the Senate's American  Mineral Security Act by taking a more comprehensive approach to  onshoring these critical mineral supply chains.                                time  1800    Earlier this year, it seemed like many of these provisions would be  considered in good-faith negotiations with Science Committee Democrats,  but unfortunately, despite our shared goals, we have had to pause  negotiations in order to now consider this partisan messaging bill that  is on the floor today. This is a waste of the taxpayers' money, and a  waste of the few remaining legislative days.    This is why I offered an amendment to replace the critical  materials text in H.R. 4447 with the American Critical Mineral  Exploration Act, and I was disappointed to see it was not made in  order. I find this surprising, since my bill serves as an expanded  companion to the Senate's Critical Mineral Security Act, which was  included in Chairwoman Murkowski's American Energy Innovation Act, and  House Democrats claim the goal of H.R. 4447 is to mirror that package.  We clearly see that is not to be the case.   It is time to get back to work on clean energy solutions, on  bipartisan solutions, and addressing China. It is time to act on our  promises of bipartisanship. The majority has now canceled our  agreements on the China Task Force, clean energy, and critical  minerals.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
