 Madam Speaker, I rise today on the 47th anniversary  of the Republic of Turkey's deadly and unprovoked military invasion of  Cyprus.   This is a dark time in the history of the Greek Cypriot people and a  stark reminder that we must never forget Turkey's ethnic cleansing of  200,000 Greek Cypriot people less than 50 years ago.   The tragedy that is the illegal Turkish occupation of Cyprus that  occurred on July 20, 1974, continues to this very day. I speak before  you at a time when the Republic of Turkey is actively engaged in an  aggressive, illegal, and unilateral reopening of Varosha, a once- bustling Greek Cypriot resort town and international tourist  destination in the Famagusta District of the island.   Following the Turkish approach to Varosha in August 1974, the town's  native Greek Cypriot population fled for their lives, only to later be  denied the right to return by the occupying Turkish Armed Forces. Many  of the Varosha refugees are still alive today, yearning to go back to  their homes, while President Erdogan has moved to reopen Varosha to  tourists.   The suffering in Cyprus is not just limited to Varosha. The Turkish  Armed Forces have illegally occupied more than one-third of the island.  They have destroyed and converted over 500 Greek Orthodox churches to  mosques in the course of their invasion. They stole over 60,000  archaeological treasures, part of Greek civilization's cultural  heritage. Their violence led to the disappearance of over 20,000  Christian icons, and even worse, 1,130 people who remain missing since  1974--five of them, American citizens.   Madam Speaker, over the years, the United Nations has taken a stand  against Turkey's illegal occupation of Cyprus, going so far as to  deploy thousands of U.N. Peacekeepers to prevent further Turkish  incursions into the southern half of the island. In addition, the U.N.  Security Council gathered in 1984 and 1992 to pass Resolution 550 and  Resolution 789, respectively, to draw red lines when it comes to  Turkish activity in sensitive areas like Varosha.   Specifically, these resolutions state that the Council ``considers  attempts to settle any part of Varosha by people other than its  inhabitants as inadmissible, and calls for the transfer of that area to  the administration of the United Nations,'' and that, ``the area at  present under the control of the United Nations peacekeeping force in  Cyprus be extended to include Varosha.''   As we grow one year closer to the 50th anniversary of Turkey's  illegal invasion of Cyprus, the United States must take a strong stand  at the United Nations and other international fora to address the  growing threat posed by Turkey, its increased aggression, and to ensure  the eventual return of homes and land to its native Greek Cypriot  inhabitants and reunification of this island nation.   If we, as a governing body, truly claim to stand for liberty and  justice for all, we must speak in a unified voice on this issue. And it  is a bipartisan issue. When he was chairman of the Senate Committee on  Foreign Affairs, then-Senator Joe Biden promised the Greek Cypriot  refugee community that they would return to their homeland, if he was  ever elected President. During our first Committee on Foreign Affairs  hearing with Secretary of State Blinken, he committed to me and my  colleagues from both sides of the aisle that brought up this concern  that the reunification of Cyprus would be a priority for this  administration.   Yet, we saw our President meet with President Erdogan, and we don't  even believe the issue was brought up, so we will continue to speak out  against this. I encourage my colleagues to speak out, call for action,  and take a stand for our Greek Cypriot friends who need our support now  more than ever.   If we are to see the end of this occupation in our lifetimes, the  United States must lead the way.                            ____________________
