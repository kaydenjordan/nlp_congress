 Madam President, like many of my fellow Americans I  listened to the President's State of the Union Address 1 week ago, and  while there are any number of the President's false or misleading  assertions that I could refute, I want to take a minute to highlight  just a few.   The President began his remarks with a focus on cooperation and  compromise, calling for unity among both political parties to work  together and break what he described as ``decades of political  stalemate.'' The reality is that last Tuesday's address followed the  longest shutdown in our government's history--a shutdown that resulted  from the President's stubborn refusal to work with Congress--and was  delivered by a President who has made a daily practice of making  unfounded, personal attacks against Democrats and anyone else who  opposes his xenophobic, ill-conceived policies.   The President went on to call on Congress to make needed commitments  to ``defeat AIDS in America and beyond.'' Who doesn't support that? The  problem is that his administration proposed a $1 billion cut in fiscal  year 2018 and a $1.2 billion cut in fiscal year 2019 to combat HIV/AIDS  around the world. This is typical of this White House. The President  makes outlandish claims, whether in ignorance or reckless disregard for  the truth, in a transparent attempt to appear to care about solving  problems his administration is actually making worse.   Funding for these programs has been restored by Congress--not in  partnership, but rather in spite of, the White House. Many Members of  Congress, myself included, are waiting for the President's upcoming  budget request for fiscal year 2020, to see if his professed support  for HIV/AIDS programs will be backed up with the necessary funding.   The President also mentioned a new ``government-wide initiative  focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.''  That is a laudable goal that Republicans and Democrats have been  supporting for years, but the reality is that this administration has  repeatedly cut funding for family planning and other health programs  that directly contribute to women's health and economic prosperity, as  well as funding to combat gender-based violence and to support UN  agencies focused on women's health, economic empowerment, and human  rights.   The President stated that our country has ``a moral duty to create an  immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.''  There is nothing remotely moral about forcibly and needlessly  separating young children from their parents at our border and not even  caring enough to keep a record of their whereabouts so they can be  reunited with their parents. The President stated that he wants legal  immigrants ``to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever.''  Is he even aware that his administration has slashed the refugee  admissions cap from 110,000 per year down to 30,000, a record low for  our country?   The President recalled the countless Americans, like the soldiers who  stormed the beaches of Normandy 75 years ago, whose selfless sacrifices  helped freedom triumph over fascism and solidified our Nation's place  as the world's only superpower. He challenged us not to squander what  we have inherited from ``the blood and tears and courage and vision of  the Americans who came before.'' The irony of that message isn't lost  on those of us who have worked, if sometimes unsuccessfully, to  mitigate the impact of the President's relentless efforts to undermine  the international order that those Americans strived to create to  protect global peace and security for future generations.   The President routinely injects uncertainty into our support for  NATO, has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal despite Iran's  compliance as confirmed by his own administration, removed the United  States from the Paris Climate Accord, the Global Migration Compact, the  UN Human Rights Council, and has otherwise threatened or taken steps to  walk away from numerous multilateral commitments that provide the  United States with a platform for global leadership. Without U.S.  engagement in these arenas, our adversaries are unchecked to pursue  their own interests, which are often at odds with ours.   The President should heed his own words. The American soldiers at  Normandy were not answering a call to unilateralism or isolationism.  President Roosevelt, 4 years earlier, cautioned the country against  those who ``believe that we can save our own skins by shutting our eyes  to the fate of other nations.'' Addressing the threat of the Axis  powers, he stated, ``I make the direct statement to the American people  that there is far less chance of the United States getting into war if  we do all we can now to support the nations defending themselves  against attack.'' Now, as then, we must do everything in our power to  strengthen global alliances and confront threats to peace and stability  head on. International diplomacy should be a tool of first resort, not  a casualty of domestic politics. The President declares that his  actions advance U.S. national security interests, but we know better.   These are but a few examples of how the President's lofty rhetoric  bore no factual relationship to the actions of his administration. The  American people deserve to know the truth, not to be misled by the  President of the United States.                            ____________________     Madam President. I read an article about Sarducci's  celebrating 25 years in Montpelier.   Marcelle and I have enjoyed eating at Sarducci's since it first  opened and are thrilled with what Carol Paquette and Jeff Butterfield  have done with the restaurant.   I remember when they first opened and how Dorothy Korshak, the  original founder, wondered whether anybody would come in. I remember  telling Dorothy that, if they keep providing food that good, people  will show up.   My mother was born in Vermont, a first generation Italian-American.  We always ate Italian food, both at my grandparents' home in South  Ryegate, VT or at our home in Montpelier, VT. It feels like going home  to go to Sarducci's. It is one of our favorite restaurants.   I ask unanimous consent that the article from thebridge entitled  ``Sarducci's Celebrates 25 Years in Montpelier'' be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [From thebrigde Jan. 23, 2019]                Sarducci's Celebrates 25 Years in Montelier                              (By Tim Simard)         On a recent sunny and chilly January afternoon, Sarducci's       Restaurant founder and co-owner Carol Paquette relaxed by a       front table and looked back on 25 years. Sitting alongside       head chef and new co-owner Jeff Butterfield, Paquette       marveled at surviving two-and-a-half decades in the       restaurant business--a momentous achievement. This past       weekend, the Montpelier institution quietly celebrated the       milestone birthday.        Paquette can remember Sarducci's first day quite clearly--      Jan. 19, 1994. It was a Wednesday.        ``We opened at 4 pm. It was freezing outside. Dorothy       Korshak [founder and former business partner] and I had no       idea who might or how many people might stop in. We really       hadn't done any advertising to let people know we were       opening,'' she said.        But people knew. Oh, they knew. Within the first hour of       business, it was clear that Montpelier was ready for       Sarducci's.        ``The doors opened and people just kept coming in. We       hadn't planned on so many that night, but by the end we had       served close to 200 people,'' Paquette said, still in awe of       that first night's success.        Paquette attributes Sarducci's early success to a lack of       restaurants in Montpelier at that time. She said locals were       ``desperate'' for a place where families could sit down in a       cozy atmosphere with the whole family and have an amazing,       authentic Italian dinner.        The signature wood-fired oven was also a unique feature for       a Montpelier restaurant. Paquette and Korshak--who started       their partnership as coworkers at Julio's--researched Italian       restaurants in Boston, New York, and Chicago and noted the       popularity of these ovens.        ``We saw the restaurants that had the wood-fired ovens were       becoming more and more popular,'' Paquette said.        Since those first days, Sarducci's has become a go-to       dining spot in the Capital City. In its 25 years, the       restaurant has renovated its space, added a deck overlooking       the Winooski River, and doubled its seating capacity, all       while keeping its menu remarkably consistent. Today,       Sarducci's enters a new chapter as it celebrates a quarter       century.  [[Page S1271]]         At end of 2018, Butterfield bought in to the business and       is now a co-owner alongside Paquette. Butterfield, an East       Montpelier native and graduate of the New England Culinary       Institute, has been with Sarducci's for nearly seven years.       His experience pre-Sarducci's included running kitchens in       tourist locales from Charleston, S.C. to Stowe.        ``When a sous chef position opened [in 2012], I jumped at       the chance. I was ready to move back home, and I fell in love       with this place on day one,'' Butterfield said.        Butterfield said that Sarducci's has a family atmosphere       amongst its employees that's unique to other places he's       worked. Paquette added that several employees have been with       the restaurant for years and even decades.        Butterfield was promoted to head chef in 2014; around the       same time Korshak decided to retire, leaving Paquette as sole       owner. But the demands of running one of the city's most       popular restaurants became challenging for one person.       Butterfield pitched himself to be Sarducci's next co-owner.       Paquette knew it would be the right fit.        ``He's so good at what he does, he's super smart, and his       ego doesn't get in the way. That last part is very       important,'' she said.        Sarducci's 25-year story is one of growth and consistency.       Customers know what they'll get each time they walk through       the doors. The pollo al marsala and salmone cucina remain the       most popular menu items, as they have since the first year.        ``Montpelier has changed a lot, but we're still here. We're       still serving great Italian food that's affordable, fresh,       and locally sourced,'' Butterfield said.                            ____________________
