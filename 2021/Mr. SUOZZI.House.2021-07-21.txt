 Madam Speaker, I have two unrelated topics that really  got me going this morning.   The first is vaccinations. Over 40 percent of Americans are still not  vaccinated. I mean, come on, what is going on? We need to wake up,  America. We need to get vaccinated.   People are saying, ``I want to live free or die.'' Well, people are  living free and other people are dying. We need to get everyone  vaccinated. Cases are rising every day. It is becoming a pandemic of  the unvaccinated.   Madam Speaker, 97 percent of hospitalizations are unvaccinated; 99  percent of the COVID deaths are unvaccinated. We need to wake up.   There are people using social media poisoning the American people's  minds and jeopardizing their health in the process. We need to work  together to convince people that vaccinations are safe and that it  makes sense to get vaccinated.   I want to applaud   Steve Scalise and Mitch McConnell for getting  vaccinated and promoting it to the American people. We need everyone in  this body to please do the same. You need to get vaccinated, not only  for yourself, not only for your family, do it for other families, do it  for the country, do it so the economy can stay strong.   Please, get vaccinated.                                 DACA Program     Madam Speaker, the second topic I would bring up is the  Dreamers; the DACA program.   So many families are living every day with so much stress and anxiety  because of their immigration status.   Last week, a Federal judge ruled that DACA must end, causing more  anxiety and stress for these families. Congress should fix this. Give a  pathway to legalization and citizenship, for Dreamers, for TPS  recipients, and for the farm workers and other essential workers that  make our country work. This is personal for me.   Madam Speaker, 100 years ago, August 22 of 1921, my father was born  in a small medieval village on the mountains of Southern Italy. He  immigrated to the United States as a young boy. He was the first kid  from the neighborhood to go to college. He fought in World War II as a  navigator on a B-24 and got the Distinguished Flying Cross. He came  home and went to Harvard Law School on the GI Bill.                                time  1030    My father would always say, ``What a country.'' He went on to live a  great American success story. So, like I said, this is personal for me.   Twenty-seven years ago, I served as the young mayor of my hometown,  the city of Glen Cove, New York. I addressed the growing issue of new  immigrants from Central and South America who were gathering on street  corners looking for work by creating the  [[Page H3763]]  first day-workers site anywhere on the East Coast of the United States  of America in 1994.   I relied on a fundamental American principle: All men and women are  created equal. It is not that all men and women with a passport are  created equal, or all men and women with a green card are created  equal. Every human being should be treated with human respect and  dignity, and we have failed to address this problem for 30 years.   Those same men who gathered on the street corners 27 years ago now  have their own businesses, own their own homes, and their children went  to school with my children.   One Dreamer graduated high school with my daughter, went on to  graduate from college with a degree in biomedical engineering, got a  master's degree in biomedical engineering, and is now pursuing a  doctorate in the same subject. But, now, he is suffering every day,  worrying about his immigration status, worried about how this court  ruling will affect him and his family.   Dreamers have been shaken yet again. Let's fix this. Let's do it.  Dreamers are ready to live the same American success story that my  father lived.   Let's give Dreamers, TPS recipients, farmworkers, and other essential  workers a path to citizenship, and let's do it now.                            ____________________
