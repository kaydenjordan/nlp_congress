 Madam Speaker, with regard to Israel, the mask has  finally come off the woke left whose center of gravity, sadly, is  situated in American universities.   Following the barbaric attacks on Israel by Hamas, student groups at  universities across the country demonstrated support for the  terrorists.  [[Page H5204]]    Let me pause to say that again. Demonstrations are happening at  universities across the United States in support of terrorists.   A student group at my alma mater, George Washington University,  called for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people.   The liberal ideology is emanating from universities and spreading  throughout our corporations and tainting the world view of the next  generation of Americans. This is dangerous and must be rejected.   That is why I am an original sponsor of Representative Owens'  resolution condemning the support of terrorists at our institutions of  higher education.   I urge all Americans to join me and my colleagues in stating in no  uncertain terms that we support our Jewish students and affirm the  statehood of Israel and the right of her people to live and to thrive.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 798.
