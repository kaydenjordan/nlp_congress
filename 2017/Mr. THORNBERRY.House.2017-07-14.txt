 Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the  time in opposition, even though I am not opposed to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Texas?   There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. I have  supported it in the past. And as Mr. Emmer just mentioned, the House  has supported it in the past in each of the last 2 years.   I admire the persistence of the gentleman from Massachusetts in  pursuing this issue. I think it is the right thing to do.  Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to convince our colleagues  across the Capitol or the Pentagon to do this. I know of no opposition  to the amendment.   I think the House should continue to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Emmer for his support, and I  want to thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for their  support in the past.   As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee has stated, the House  has, by voice vote, approved this twice before in the NDAA bills.  Unfortunately, the Senate has chosen to not respect the wishes of the  House, so I think it is important that we show a strong bipartisan vote  on this. So I will ask for a recorded vote because I think it is  important to send a signal to the Senate that we are serious about this  and we are serious about honoring our Atomic Veterans.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from  Massachusetts will be postponed.         Amendments En Bloc No. 3 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas     Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 440, I  offer amendments en bloc.   The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Smith) each will control 10 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman).

Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  amendments offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis) and the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).   As we all know, North Korea has targeted the United States with cyber  attacks, and they are well on their way to being able to strike the  United States with conventional and nuclear weapons. These two  amendments would prohibit the Department of Defense from contracting  with telecom companies found to be complicit with North Korean cyber  attacks or Chinese companies found to be providing support for the  North Korean regime. There is no reason that we should be contracting  with countries that are enemies of the United States.   I also support the amendment offered by my friend from Michigan (Mr.  Bishop). Without a doubt, NATO is the greatest military alliance in the  world, but that alliance works most effectively when the members of  those various countries are pulling their weight and fulfilling their  commitments in regard to their own defense budgets. This amendment  calls on the President to encourage NATO allies to fulfill their  commitments and to recognize those who are currently doing so.   I wholeheartedly agree with these amendments, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chairman, neither do I have other speakers on  this en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Mac  Thornberry for his extraordinary leadership and for the opportunity to  speak on amendment No. 76.   In the past few years, we have seen a clear rise in how terrorist and  extremist groups use propaganda and sophisticated messaging operations  to increase their reach to recruit new members, execute attacks, and  raise funds.   These violent extremist organizations represent a new type of threat  to the United States and our families, and we must identify how  existing agencies should work together to address the threat.   This amendment requires the President to submit a comprehensive  interagency strategy for countering violent extremist groups that pose  a threat to American families or their interests. Any plan would  identify how to counter the violent messaging, combat terrorist  financing, support existing law enforcement activities, support  counterradicalization organizations, and offer military support.   Additionally, the amendment provides for accountability by requiring  an annual assessment of the progress made implementing and achieving  the strategy. The time is now to bring a whole-government approach to  combat violent extremism. This strategy will serve a vital role in this  effort.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the passage of this amendment and the en bloc  package.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins).   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry  for yielding me the time.   Mr. Chair, my amendment proposes to increase the authorized funding  for the Counterdrug Program by $10 million.   For 30 years, the National Guard has successfully performed drug  interdiction and counterdrug activities to support our local  communities and our national security. The National Guard partners with  local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies, and community  organizations to effectively combat the supply and demand for illegal  drugs. The National Guard Counterdrug Program works.   In the past 4 years, the West Virginia National Guard successfully  seized more than $500 million of illegal drugs, black market drugs that  are devastating our communities and towns. And as our Nation copes with  the devastating drug epidemic, we must fund programs to stop drug  trafficking and keep drugs out of our communities.   For more than a decade, Congress has consistently provided funding  above the budget request. It is important that we continue that  support.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry and his hardworking staff that  helped to make this amendment possible. I urge adoption of this  amendment.

PLAN FOR VERIFICATION, DETECTION, AND MONITORING                     OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FISSILE MATERIAL.         (a) Findings and Sense of Congress.--        (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (A) A January 2014 Defense Science Board report found that       ``The nuclear future will not be a linear extrapolation of       the past. . . [and] [t]he technologies and processes designed       for current treaty verification and inspections are       inadequate to future monitoring realities''.        (B) Section 3133 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck''       McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2015 (Public Law 113-291) required an interagency plan for       nuclear monitoring of nuclear weapons and fissile material,       and section 3132 of the National Defense Authorization Act       for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328) required an update       of such plan. In both instances, the reports submitted failed       to answer the congressional requirements, and instead       provided only a brief summary of the National Security       Council structure and processes.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       verification, detection, and monitoring of nuclear weapons       and fissile material should be a priority for national       security, and that the reports submitted to date do not       reflect this priority, or the current and planned initiatives       related to nuclear verification and detection.        (b) Plan.--The President, in consultation with the       Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary       of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the       Director of National Intelligence, shall develop a plan for       verification and monitoring relating to the potential       proliferation of nuclear weapons, components of such weapons,       and fissile material.        (c) Elements.--The plan developed under subsection (b)       shall include the following:        (1) A plan and road map for verification, detection and       monitoring, with respect to policy, operations, and research,       development, testing, and evaluation, including--        (A) identifying requirements;        (B) costs and funding requirements over 10 years for such       nuclear verification, detection and monitoring; and        (C) identifying and integrating roles, responsibilities,       and planning for such nuclear verification, detection and       monitoring.        (2) A detailed international engagement plan for building       cooperation and transparency, including bilateral and       multilateral efforts, to improve inspections, detection, and       monitoring.        (3) A detailed description of--        (A) current and planned research and development efforts to       improve monitoring, detection, and in-field inspection and       analysis capabilities, including persistent surveillance,       remote monitoring, and rapid analysis of large data sets,       including open-source data; and        (B) measures to coordinate technical and operational       requirements early in the process.        (4) Engagement of relevant departments and agencies of the       Federal Government and the military departments (including       the Open Source Center and the United States Atomic Energy       Detection System), national laboratories, industry, and       academia.        (d) Designation of DOE.--The President shall designate the       Department of Energy as the lead agency for development of       the plan under subsection (b).        (e) Briefing.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy, acting       through the Administrator for Nuclear Security, shall provide       to the appropriate congressional committees an interim       briefing on the plan under subsection (b).

Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Smith) each will control 10 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I fully agree with the gentleman from Washington when  he expresses his appreciation to the members of our committee. Each one  of the 62 members of our committee has contributed to the bill that is  here before us today and, as the Chair knows, we have had more  amendments considered over the last 3 days than ever before for a  National Defense Authorization bill. So Members of the whole body have  contributed in many ways.  [[Page H5860]]    I also agree with the gentleman that our staff on both sides of the  aisle, led by Jenness Simler and Paul Arcangeli, have done a terrific  job in helping to manage this process and to shape and guide what has  been historic levels of interest by Members on particular provisions.   Mr. Chairman, I think that you would find among our committee  virtually, if not unanimous, agreement on two points. One is we live in  an increasingly dangerous world. The second one is we have done deep  damage to our military because of the budgets cuts, the continuing  resolutions, the erratic nature of funding over the last few years.   Certainly, the members of our committee who go out and actually talk  to the people who serve have heard, seen, witnessed firsthand airplanes  that can't fly, ships that can't sail, training that has not gone on,  movers--we are trying to save money for the military, so we are hiring  cut-rate movers, and members of the military are experiencing  incredible damage to their household goods as they are shuffled about  from place to place involuntarily. Sometimes there are movers with  criminal records who can't actually get on the military base they are  supposed to be delivering to. I mean, just example after example of how  these cuts have affected the men and women who serve.   And as Secretary Mattis says, the only reason we are doing so well  around the world is because they have sucked it up and borne the  burden. Deep damage that this bill starts to reverse.   I appreciate all the Members who support fixing our planes, getting  the training, having ships that sail, better missile defense, all the  things that are in this bill.   I am not going to engage in a detailed discussion about the budget.  The gentleman and I discuss this frequently.   I would just say, Mr. Chairman, I believe the first obligation of the  Federal Government is to defend the country. Article I, section 8 says  that Congress has the power and the responsibility to raise and support  armies, provide and maintain navies, provide the rules and regulations  for the military forces of the United States. That is our job, and I  think that is our first job.   So I agree that some of the cuts that have been proposed in other  domestic programs, discretionary programs, are inappropriate, and we  ought to evaluate each of them on their merits. And that continues to  be my point when it comes to defense.   We evaluate our obligations to the country and to the men and women  who serve, based on the merits of this argument. We don't tie it to  other domestic programs. We do not say we are only going to increase  defense to fix our planes if we can increase the EPA an equal amount.  We don't tie it to other things.   The obligations to the men and women who risk their lives stand on  their own, and that, at least in my view, is our first obligation.   Now, when we start talking about budgets, we get into all sorts of  conversations about how mandatory spending is really where more than  two-thirds of the budget is; how that is what has been growing; how  defense is down to about 16 percent of the budget, and as it has been  shrinking, the deficit has been going up. Obviously, defense is not the  cause when it comes to deficits.   We can also, when we talk about tax, start talking about economic  growth and this lackluster growth that the economy has suffered, at  least over the last 8 years, and the need to get things going to help  with the deficit.   Lots of issues to discuss, but the issue before us today is how we  fulfill our responsibilities to the men and women who serve and to the  country that is relying on us to protect them from missiles, to help  protect them from terrorist attacks, to support the men and women who  are actually performing those missions.   I think this bill advances that cause. A number of Members on both  sides of the aisle have contributed to it. I think and hope it deserves  the support of most all Members of the House, and I urge support for  this en bloc package.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I have tremendous respect and admiration for the  gentlewoman from New York and her efforts to represent her district,  her people, and try to make life better. It kind of relates to some of  the conversations Mr. Smith and I were just having about tax policy,  about industrial policy, about regulations, about how we have, in this  country, become less competitive internationally than we should.   However, I must oppose this amendment because the bottom line is that  it is not a matter of national security where the DOD buys its knives,  forks, and spoons.                                time  1030    If Members needed further evidence of the wide range of issues which  we deal with in the National Defense Authorization Act, this bill is a  key example.   I think the gentlewoman accurately described the history. The Berry  amendment was passed in 1940 to make sure that food and textiles were  procured from the United States to support our military efforts.   In the 1970s, they put in a specialty metals provision, and attached  to that was a comma that said ``including flatware.'' So then it turned  out there wasn't anybody here at home that made flatware because of  these international competitive issues, and DOD came to us more than a  decade ago and said, ``Would you please get rid of that portion of the  Berry amendment?'' and we did.   Now the question is: Are we going to start adding back specific sorts  of items which DOD may buy and say you can only buy it from one place,  whether or not it is critical to our country's national security?   Now, the gentlewoman mentioned that GSA is buying some spoons and  knives and so forth from this manufacturer, and that is great. If we  do, I hope that happens, and I hope more jobs come to her district. But  to put into Federal law that the only place the Department of Defense  can buy its knives and forks and spoons is from this one company, I  think, starts to get us into micromanagement of industries and takes us  away from the focus of this bill, which should be the troops, what is  the best thing for them.   So with all my admiration for the gentlewoman, I oppose this  amendment. We cannot go down the road of adding category after category  after category of items to help our districts at the expense of our  troops and the best use of dollars when it is not a matter of vital  national security. I just don't think that the knives and forks we use  qualify as vital national security.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR.

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule,  the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Collins of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military  activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction,  to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for  other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 440, he reported the  bill, as amended by House Resolution 431, back to the House with sundry  further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from  the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.   The amendments were agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit    Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I have a  motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. I am opposed in its current  form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico moves to recommit       H.R. 2810 to the Committee on Armed Services with       instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith,       with the following amendment:        At the end of subtitle D of title X, insert the following       new section 1039:       SEC. 1039. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING USE OF DEPARTMENT                     OF DEFENSE FUNDING OF A BORDER WALL.         None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act       or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2018 for the       Department of Defense may be used to plan, develop, or       construct any barriers, including walls or fences, along the       international border of the United States.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, this is the  final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it  back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to  final passage, as amended.   The National Defense Authorization Act has passed Congress 56 years  in a row, and that is a testament to the collaborative, bipartisan work  the Armed Services Committee has done to support our troops who put  themselves in harm's way every single day to defend our country.   This year, the House Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment  introduced by Congressman Gallego to ensure that none of the funds  meant to support our troops and safeguard our Nation's security can be  used for building President Trump's border wall.   The amendment was debated, amended, and ultimately adopted without  objection by every single member of the Armed Services Committee.   If you ask the people who know the border the best, whether it is  companies, lawmakers, border communities, trade groups, economists, or  law enforcement officials--both Republicans and Democrats--most agree  that building a wall is unnecessary, impractical, ineffective, and,  frankly, a complete waste of time and taxpayer money.   Furthermore, the United States already maintains approximately 650  miles of border fence in areas that most effectively stop the  unauthorized entry of people, vehicles, drugs, arms, and other illicit  items.   Instead of a costly border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, the  Armed Services Committee chose to fully fund military healthcare, raise  the pay of military personnel, and improve our Nation's cybersecurity.   They agreed that President Trump's ongoing effort to build a wall is  wasteful and has absolutely nothing to do with advancing U.S. national  security interests.   I want to emphasize that this amendment incorporated both Democratic  and Republican ideas, and passed unanimously in a bipartisan manner.  But late Tuesday night, House Republican leadership stripped  Congressman Gallego's amendment from the NDAA with the use of a  glaringly undemocratic, procedural gimmick to help Trump fulfill his  campaign promise.   Republican leadership's actions to unilaterally open the door for  funding the wall through the use of this defense bill is an insult to  every single member of the Armed Services Committee, to our democratic  principles, and to the spirit of bipartisanship.   They chose to undermine the unanimous judgment of the Armed Services  Committee without the courage to test their proposal with a vote or  even a debate on the floor.   You may hear my colleague on the other side of the aisle claim that  prohibiting the construction of the wall doesn't fall within the  jurisdiction of the Defense Department. However, I am not sure why the  8 members of the Rules Committee believe that they are more qualified  to judge what should be included in the NDAA than the 61 members of the  Armed Services Committee or the 435 Members of this deliberative body  as a whole.  [[Page H5866]]    Further, I am not sure why the Rules Committee thought that a  discriminatory amendment preventing the Department of Defense from  providing medically necessary healthcare services to transgendered  military personnel was more appropriate for debate than preventing  Trump from usurping funds intended for our troops.   You may also hear that my Republican colleagues claim that President  Trump can't use any funds in the NDAA to start construction of the wall  anyway. But that is not true. Under title 10, the Secretary of Defense  could transfer funding for that purpose this afternoon if he wanted,  all without approval of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, the only way this body can guarantee that Trump cannot  use Department of Defense funds to construct the border wall is to put  that prohibition in the bill explicitly. The only way we can do that is  by passing my motion to recommit to restore Congressman Gallego's  bipartisan amendment in the bill and ensure that our troops are not  robbed to pay for a border wall.   But I want to be clear: the adoption of this amendment will not  prevent passage of the underlying bill. If the amendment is adopted, it  will be incorporated into the bill and the bill will immediately be  voted upon.   We all have an opportunity to stand united to support our Nation's  servicemembers and to protect hard-earned taxpayer dollars from the  President's political pipe dream.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my final amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this is a procedural motion that, in my  view, should be rejected.   We could spend all day and night arguing provisions that prohibit  what is not in the bill. There is nothing in this bill that authorizes  a border wall. The focus of the bill is the men and women who serve our  Nation in the military and the national security of the United States.  And that is what I want to take a moment to talk about.   I would suggest that all of us think back just to the events of the  last 10 days. On July 4, North Korea launched what most observers  believe is an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching  parts of the United States. And we know they already have nuclear  weapons.   On July 9, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi went into Mosul to celebrate  the ousting of ISIS with U.S. advisers, U.S. airpower, and U.S.  intelligence.   Also, this week, the Chinese navy conducted drills in the  Mediterranean on their way to conduct joint exercises with the Russians  in the Balkans.   This is just a taste of the world we live in, and there are  provisions in this bill that address every one of these incidents, from  more missile defense to getting more ships in the water faster and  cheaper, to supporting our efforts against ISIS, al-Qaida, and  terrorist groups.    But there is another event this week that I hope we all keep in mind.  On Monday, July 10, a KC-130 crashed on its way across the country,  resulting in the death of 15 marines and one sailor. We do not know  what caused this crash, but the early evidence indicates that there was  a catastrophic failure when it was cruising at altitude.   It will be fully investigated. But in the meantime, I think we always  have to remember that, even on routine training missions, even on  routine deployments, the men and women who serve are risking their  lives for us. We owe them the best equipment, in the best shape, with  the best training that our Nation can provide. Unfortunately, that is  not what they have been getting.   This year, our committee has heard testimony that, under the budget  caps, the Army is outranged, outgunned, and outdated. More than half  the Navy aircraft cannot fly. More than half the planes in the Air  Force qualify for an antique license in the State of Virginia. More  than half the planes the Navy has can't fly. Unfortunately, accident  rates are going up.   Sometimes I have heard the argument that: Well, we are not going to  give them any more money until they can pass an audit or they can do  this and that or the other thing.   But as everybody rushes out to get on their airplanes, just think  about this: What if the board of directors of your airline decided that  they are not going to spend any more money repairing planes until there  is a bookkeeping problem solved in headquarters?   Yet that is exactly what we have been doing to our military. We have  not been giving them the planes and other equipment in good repair.   Every year for 55 straight years, Congresses and Presidents of both  parties have passed into law a National Defense Authorization Act.  There is a lot of credit to go around, including the Members on both  sides of this aisle who have contributed to this product. I am very  grateful for what they have done. But what I am really grateful for are  the men and women who serve and inspire us, the men and women who are  counting on us.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say, whatever our differences on other  issues, which we will have time to debate in another time and place,  whatever our differences about what is in or not in this bill, we need  to put those differences aside and continue to support the men and  women who serve and defend us. Let's not let them down.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.
