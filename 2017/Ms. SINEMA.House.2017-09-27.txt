 Mr. Speaker, September is Suicide Prevention Month, a  [[Page H7568]]  time for our Nation to raise awareness about the recurring tragedy of  suicide.   This epidemic is too common for the men and women who wore our  country's uniform and put their lives on the line to defend our  freedom. An estimated 20 veterans lose their lives to suicide each and  every day.   A new VA report shows the risk for suicide is 22 percent higher among  veterans than civilians, and 250 percent higher amongst female veterans  than female civilians. This is unacceptable.   Twenty veterans a day lost to suicide should be a call to action for  our country and for this Congress. We must take action, and we must do  it now.   Typically, the time in this Chamber is split. Republicans have 1 hour  and Democrats have 1 hour, but we believe this issue is too important  to be overshadowed by partisan politics. That is why, tonight,  Congressman Tim Murphy and I have brought together Members from both  sides of the aisle to show our commitment to solving this problem  together and finding real solutions for our veterans.   This is the fifth year that we have assembled this team to raise  awareness and send a clear message that the epidemic of veteran suicide  must end. We have so much work left to do. So tonight we demonstrate  our ongoing support for individuals, organizations, and agencies  devoted to preventing the epidemic of veteran suicide. We challenge the  VA, the Department of Defense, and our fellow lawmakers to do more. We  are failing in our obligation to do right by those who have sacrificed  so much for our freedom.   Finally, we stand here tonight, unified, for the military families  who have experienced this tragedy, and we say to you: Your family's  loss is not forgotten. We work for the memory of your loved ones, and  we will not rest until every veteran has access to the care he or she  needs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), who  understands the importance of addressing this epidemic, a colleague and  friend of mine.   Thank you for being here this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my thanks and  gratitude to Congressman Johnson. Not only is he an amazing  Representative for the people of Ohio, he is also a veteran who served  our country ably and proudly, and his story of a veteran in his  district lost to suicide should be a call to all of us around the  country to take care of the veterans in each of our districts.   We have made some progress since last year. I have often shared the  story of a young veteran in my district, Sergeant Daniel Somers.  Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran of two tours in Iraq. He served on  Task Force Lightning, an intelligence unit. He ran over 400 combat  missions as a machine gunner in the turret of a Humvee. Part of his  role required him to interrogate dozens of terror suspects, and his  work was deemed classified.   Like many veterans, Daniel was haunted by the war when he returned.  He suffered from flashbacks, nightmares, depression, and additional  symptoms of post-traumatic stress, made worse by a traumatic brain  injury.   Daniel needed help. He and his family asked for help, but,  unfortunately, the VA enrolled Sergeant Somers in group therapy  sessions, which Sergeant Somers could not attend for fear of disclosing  classified information. Despite requests for individualized counseling  or some other reasonable accommodation to allow Sergeant Somers to  receive appropriate care for his PTSD, the VA delayed providing  Sergeant Somers with appropriate support and care.   Like many, Sergeant Somers' isolation got worse when he transitioned  to civilian life. He tried to provide for his family, but he was unable  to work due to his disability.   Sergeant Somers struggled with the VA bureaucracy. His disability  appeal had been pending in the system for over 2 years without  resolution. Sergeant Somers didn't get the help he needed in time.   On June 10 of 2013, Sergeant Somers wrote a letter to his family. In  the letter he said: ``I am not getting better, I am not going to get  better, and I will most certainly deteriorate further as time goes  on.''                                time  1900    He went on to say:   ``Thus, I am left with basically nothing. Too trapped in a war to be  at peace, too damaged to be at war. Abandoned by those who would take  the easy route, and a liability to those who stick it out--and, thus,  deserve better. So you see, not only am I better off dead, but the  world is better without me in it.   ``This is what brought me to my actual final mission.''   We lost Sergeant Somers that day.   No one who returns home from serving our country should ever feel  like he or she has nowhere to turn. I am committed to working on both  sides of the aisle to ensure that no veteran ever feels trapped like  Sergeant Somers did, and that all of our veterans have access to  appropriate mental healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy) a  freshman representative and a great addition to our Congress.    Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Somers' story is familiar to too  many military families. Sergeant Somers' parents, Howard and Jean, were  devastated by the loss of their son, but they bravely shared Sergeant  Somers' story and created a mission of their own. Their mission is to  ensure that Sergeant Somers' story brings to light America's deadliest  war--the 20 veterans that we lose every day to suicide.   Howard and Jean are working with Congress and the VA to share their  experience with the VA healthcare system and to find ways to improve  care for veterans and their families. We worked closely with Howard and  Jean to develop the Sergeant Daniel Somers Classified Veterans Access  to Care Act, and ensure veterans of classified experiences can access  appropriate VA mental healthcare services.   After more than 3 years of work, I am proud to say that the Sergeant  Daniel Somers Classified Veterans Access to Care Act is now law. But  this is just one small step forward, and our work with Howard and Jean  doesn't stop here. We have so much work left to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott),  who has served veterans bravely in Congress and home in his district  for many years.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Sinema for that  very nice introduction.   Ladies and gentlemen of the Nation who are listening or watching us  on C-SPAN, I want to impress that we have exactly, right now, 40,000  soldiers--veterans--who are committing suicide each year.   This is a national crisis, but it is more than that. It is a national  tragedy, but it is more than that. It is an American national shame.   These soldiers go where they are commanded to go. They go into a hail  of bullets. They go and they fight and they die. They leave an arm,  they leave a leg, they leave so much of themselves on the battlefield,  and so many leave their minds there because of the devastation. And  when we bring them back home, the level of treatment that many of them  are getting, and even not getting, is, again, a national tragedy and a  national shame.   It is my home that the plea that America will hear this day from  these Members of Congress will awaken us to what I believe is, and  should be, the number one issue facing this Nation: take care of our  veterans.   Twenty a day, 40,000 every year, is terrible.   Now, myself, what am I doing?   Each year, I put on a jobs fair. But I don't put on that jobs fair by  myself. Partnering with me is the VA, where we have, in Atlanta,  Georgia, at that convention and trades center, a jobs fair each year  with the VA, and we are averaging about 450 jobs each year.   But we don't stop there. We have a health fair because it is the  PTSD--post-traumatic stress syndrome--that is this archenemy that we  are not examining. The reason for that is that there is a severe  shortage of psychiatrists in the VA and there is a severe shortage of  primary care physicians in the VA.   So right here in this legislature, my good Republican friend, Larry  Bucshon from Indiana, and I--and he is a doctor--have worked together.  We put together legislation 2 years ago, in 2015, for the special  appropriations for veterans that we would pay the tuition, pay the loan  forgiveness, for those physicians who are psychiatrists and who will go  and work in the VA.   But we didn't stop there. Knowing how the vagarious income levels are  structured and the pay scales are structured according to where you  live in the United States--and we have VA hospitals, VA centers all  over this country, and the salary levels vary--we made sure that an  added incentive would be to those graduating psychiatrists who will go  and help our veterans and go help us fulfill this shortage, that we  would make sure that their incoming salary would be at least 2 percent  higher than that average.   My only heartbreak in all of this is that we were only able to get  12. And I can tell you how much that broke my heart by this Congress.  But it is a start.   This bill will be replenished. And if you in the public can help us,  if we want to do something right now about cutting down on the number  of suicides that our veterans are having, help us get more  psychiatrists into the VA system, help me and Larry Bucshon and many  Democrats and Republicans who voted for the initial piece of  legislation--we only got 12 the first time, but we should get 300, 400,  500. We should be willing to make that appropriation.   We can talk, we can sympathize, we can do all of that, but we need to  get better treatment, psychiatric treatment, for our veterans. That  will not happen, ladies and gentlemen, if we don't get more  psychiatrists into the VA system.   So give Larry Bucshon from Indiana, my Republican friend, a call. My  office, give me a call. But better than that, call your Congressman and  say: Let's get this bill expanded so we can get more psychiatrists.   The Congress will move if the American people say move.   Now, finally, I must say this. There is no one that embodies the  final words of Jesus Christ before he was crucified. Those final words  that he spoke to his disciples 24 hours before he was crucified were:  ``Love one another as I have loved you.''   And there is no greater love than that one who will lay down his life  for his friend. That, ladies and gentlemen, is our veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott for being here and  for his passion for veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy)  to talk about this important issue we have been working on together.   Mr. Murphy has been serving in Congress since 2002. He is our only  practicing psychologist serving in Congress, and he is the co-chair of  the Mental Health Caucus. In addition, Congressman Murphy is a  commander in the Navy Reserve and provides services to veterans at the  Walter Reed National Military Medical Center specializing in treating  those individuals who are suffering from traumatic brain injuries and  post-traumatic stress disorder. It is a privilege to serve with him in  Congress and work on this important issue.    Thank you so much, Congressman Murphy, and thank you for  partnering with me on this important effort this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from New York, Thomas Suozzi,  who serves on the Armed Services Committee and has been a great  addition to our caucus this year.   Thank you for joining us.    Thank you so much, Congressman Murphy, and thank you for  partnering with me on this important effort this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from New York, Thomas Suozzi,  who serves on the Armed Services Committee and has been a great  addition to our caucus this year.   Thank you for joining us.    Thank you so much, Congressman Murphy, and thank you for  partnering with me on this important effort this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from New York, Thomas Suozzi,  who serves on the Armed Services Committee and has been a great  addition to our caucus this year.   Thank you for joining us.    Thank you so much, Congressman Suozzi, for your  commitment to taking care of veterans in our community.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from California, Congresswoman  Julia Brownley.   Congressman Julia Brownley has served on the Veterans Committee for 5  years now and is the ranking member on the Health Subcommittee for  Veterans. She has been doing a yeoman's amount of work to help ensure  that our veterans get the care they need when they return home.   Congresswoman, thank you for joining us again.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Brownley for her  dedication not just to this event every year, but to taking care of  veterans at home and here in Washington.   I thank all of the colleagues from both parties who joined us this  evening. Our thoughts are with all the families who have lost a loved  one to suicide. But our efforts to end veterans' suicide do not end  today or even this month. We are committed to continuing this fight to  ensure that our veterans always know that they have a place to turn.   We can do more. We need a VA that provides real and meaningful help  to veterans in need; a VA that puts veterans first and works  aggressively with community providers to improve the quality and  accessibility of care. We need a VA that is transparent and open to  restore the trust and credibility it has lost. The VA can and must do  better. No one deserves our gratitude and respect more than those who  put their lives on the line for our freedom. And when the VA fails, our  heroes suffer.   We, who enjoy freedom every day, thanks to the sacrifices of our  military servicemen and -women, must all step up to end the epidemic of  veteran suicide.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
