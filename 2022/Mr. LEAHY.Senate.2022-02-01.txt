 Madam President, from the sweeping Green Mountains to the  shores of the iconic Lake Champlain, one need look no further than  Vermont to find the beating heart of America. To this day, communities  across Vermont are welcoming refugees from around the world and most  recently from war-torn Afghanistan. It is our history as a nation of  immigrants that make these United States, as George Washington put it,  the Great Experiment.   But with each passing moment, it seems this simple foundation of our  Nation is under attack. Nationalism is on the rise and, with it, the  threat that bedrock principles of our democracy are threatened. The  strength of our Nation rests not in what divides us, but in what unites  us. By sharpening the division, we edge toward authoritarianism, as  Vermonter Haviland Smith wrote earlier this month in his column,  ``Rural Ruminations.''   Another of our great Presidents, Abraham Lincoln, so clearly said,  ``A house divided cannot stand.'' Those words, now nearly 164 years  old, are as true today as ever.  [[Page S437]]    I would invite everyone to read Haviland's recent column, and I ask  unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.   Its observations, and importantly the questions he pose, deserve  thoughtful consideration.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    [From the Times Argus, Jan. 3, 2022]             Rural Ruminations: Edging Toward Authoritarianism                            (By Haviland Smith)         At the onset of 2022, The United States of America appears       to be heading for possible major change. Opposing forces and       ideologies are so hostile toward each other that there is       clearly the possibility that this former relatively pure       democracy will be taken over by an entirely authoritarian       management.        Authoritarianism is defined as ``the enforcement of strict       obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom and       a lack of concern for the wishes and opinions of others''.       Does that not define the United States at this moment? All we       need to do now to be true to the ongoing world pattern is       codify the situation governmentally.        If you look around the world you will see case after case       of countries being taken over by authoritarianism. Look at       the Philippines, Brazil. Nicaragua, and Venezuela. One       rationale for these takeovers is to ``restore order''.        How is it possible that the United States could fit into       this mold? To understand that question, it is important to       look at the religious and ethnic makeup of today's       authoritarian states. What you will see right away in many if       not most of those states are ethnically and/or religiously       divided countries. Authoritarianism in the Middle East has       not only ethnic divisions (Arab, Persian, Kurd, Druze,       Turkish, etc.), but the religious split between Shia and       Sunni. The Chinese have the Uighurs and over 50 other ethnic       groups. The Russians have over 120 ethnic groups within their       borders. And so it goes on and on, with many, if not most       countries dealing with minorities that are not always       friendly and that are often sufficiently hostile for the       majority to install authoritarianism to gain and maintain       power and to cope with those minority groups and their       concomitant disorders.        Where many if not most of such divided countries have       simply evolved that way through the realities of geography       and simple migration, the United States is in class by       itself. It has voluntarily created what may well be the       world's most diverse country and it has done so purposefully       and eagerly. Let's face it, the only people who have always       lived here are the native Americans. Europeans changed all       that when they arrived in numbers on this continent in the       middle of the 16th century. Since then, largely for economic       reasons, we have seen every kind of migration that has ever       existed. Over the centuries we have benefitted from       immigration from over 100 countries in Africa, Asia, Central       America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, North Africa,       Europe, South America and North America.        Many of those immigrants, particularly black Africans, were       brought here against their will as slaves to work for the       European settlers. Others, mostly from more adjacent       countries to our south, came here to work for better       compensation, but it is critical to understand that they have       played an incredibly important role in the advancement of the       United States on the economic front. How are we Americans to       survive if today's politicians succeed in forbidding or even       limiting the migration of Latin Americans who come to work       mostly in agriculture? Who will do that work?        Nativism has always existed in United States history. Some       of the original colonists despised people who did not share       their own religious faiths. Nativism was particularly strong       during the major periods of immigration in the 19th Century.        Somewhere along the way, America's nativists came to       believe that people who were born in the United States were       somehow better that those born abroad. Given our history and       recognizing today's realities, one simply has to ask whether       the remnants of nativism are playing a role in the philosophy       of a large chunk of the American population.        We have imported diverse groups of people over the years.       In the main, they have been encouraged to maintain their       original identities and cultures. This has created here in       immigrant America the kinds of frictions between those groups       that have always existed around the world. With a positive       attitude toward immigration, whether for justified reasons or       not, we have created the kind of situation that has led to       authoritarian coups throughout the world.        One could speculate that the negative attitudes of one       third of our population toward immigrants and foreigners is       nothing more than a holdover of attitudes that have existed       here since the first European settlers arrived on our shores.       That certainly does not make those attitudes appropriate, but       it would provide some understanding on how they got here and       why they continue to exist.        ls America to have the next authoritarian regime?                            ____________________     Madam President, they are sometimes called the Fourth  Estate. The dedicated writers, researchers, editors, and investigators  of the media, new and old. Their reporting writes the first draft of  history. What an awesome responsibility.   But today, I want to recognize one particular set of reporters: the  press photographers. Their images, also part of the first draft of  history, bring the words to life. The photos they capture tell stories  through images--sometimes moving, sometimes horrific--a language so  universal that, sometimes, they need no words.   Many have written about the events of January 6, when a violent mob  of insurrectionists attacked the Capitol and, indeed, our very seat of  government. I was here that day, like so many Members of Congress, both  the House and Senate, and so many staffers. And what I saw was unlike  anything I have seen in my 47 years in the U.S. Senate. The press saw  it, too--going on air to give accounts of what was happening, filing  stories on the wires as the events were unfolding--and snapping the  photographic evidence of the violence, the fear, the vandalism, and,  yes, the determination of that day.   Scott Applewhite, a longtime photographer for the Associated Press,  earlier this month published a piece for ``The Public's Radio,''  recounting his experiences that day and sharing several of the  photographs he took that document the events that unfolded. It is well  worth a read, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record.   For anyone who is unaware of or who doubts the role of the press, and  of its vigilant photographers, know this: While we work to make  history, it is they who write it, as they capture and document it in  their images. And make no mistake: Their jobs are as critical today as  ever before.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Public's Radio Jan. 5, 2022]        `We have to be there': AP Photographer Recalls Capitol Siege                          (By Scott J. Applewhite)         When the U.S. Capitol came under siege a year ago,       Associated Press photographer J. Scott Applewhite was in the       House chamber. In some respects he was the eyes of the world.       All these months later, he is still processing the events of       Jan. 6 as a photojournalist and as an American. When he       thinks about it, Applewhite's ultimate assessment is this:       The job of the photojournalist, is to show people what they       can't see on their own. And to do that, journalists have to       be there--as he was.        Washington (AP).--The U.S. Capitol was under siege. By       Americans.        It was Jan. 6, 2021, on Capitol Hill in Washington, and       Associated Press photographer J. Scott Applewhite was in the       middle of it all--and was the eyes of the world in some       respects. His camera recorded images that we are still gazing       at today.        Here, he remembers some moments that stood out to him--      moments that, so many months later, he is still processing as       a photojournalist and as an American.        ``The Capitol has been breached!'' the Capitol Police       officer shouted to lawmakers. Tear gas was in the Rotunda.       ``Get out your escape hoods and prepare to evacuate!'' the       officer said.        Glass was breaking in the main door to the chamber of the       House of Representatives--the very door where you see the       president enter for the State of the Union address. Quickly,       the police and a few lawmakers grabbed benches and cabinets       and barricaded the door.        From the officers came loud commands: Evacuate. Now.       Stragglers were not tolerated--members of Congress, staffers,       journalists, all.        But the move to safety was not immediate. Because they       didn't know what was on the other side of the door.        You could hear the growl of the mob just outside. In the       chamber, the officers were focused, their guns aimed. And I       was trained on the door as well--with a telephoto zoom.        It was pretty sure I was right where I was supposed to be.       I kept my lens focused on that reinforced door. Then: There       was an eye, trying to see inside--the face of one of the       rioters wearing a Trump hat. What he did not see were the       guns aiming inches from his face.        I kept steady and held tight on that spot.        When the breach of the Capitol was announced and evacuation       began, it was a chaotic and uncertain process. Evacuate to       where? The mob was on the other side of the doors.        Eventually, the officers announced that tear gas had been       deployed in the nearby Rotunda. All were instructed to don       escape hoods that were stashed under the seats. That was part       of the preparedness in the  [[Page S438]]       wake of 9/11. I didn't put one on because I needed to see to       use my camera.        After the evacuation order came, AP photographer Andy       Harnik lingered and took many important images: lawmakers       taking cover, and Capitol Police holding rioters at gunpoint.        Andy and I were both in the balcony that overlooks the       House chamber. Andy had been on a side where some members of       Congress were watching and the police presence was plentiful.       I had been on the opposite side with about 30 reporters and       photographers. The officers eventually pushed everyone out.        Andy must have been among the last. He said the final frame       he shot in the chamber was one of me sitting alone in the       House press gallery. Andy caught the terror in the faces of       elected members of Congress as they dived for cover. When       police rushed the members out, Andy kept his camera up,       capturing rioters held at gunpoint by tactical officers       outside the chamber.        The Capitol is where I work every day, and I am a familiar       face to most police. When those on the chamber floor shouted       up at me to get out, I told them I was fine and refused to       leave. This is what we do: We stay and report.        One got more belligerent until another officer, a special       agent in the protection division who guards the leadership,       intervened. He shouted over, ``Scotty's OK!'' Two words is       all it took (that and the obvious--they had their hands full       with a mob on the other side of door).        The officer, in plain clothes, was Lt. Michael Byrd.       Moments later, outside the House chamber, he shot and killed       protester Ashli Babbitt as she climbed through a broken       window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker's Lobby.        From that point on, I was the only journalist and the only       person remaining in the balcony to witness the standoff in       the House chamber.        When the mob began to break the glass in the door, I could       barely see the face of one of the rioters. The cops and a new       congressman with a law enforcement background tried to de-      escalate the situation even as guns were pointed at the hole       in the glass.        The room was pretty dark. I was looking through a long zoom       lens usually used outdoors for shooting sports or wildlife. I       had brought it along for a little extra reach--closeups of       faces and details during Electoral College voting, which is       normally illuminated with TV lights.        The siege at the chamber door lasted about 45 minutes,       until tactical units moved the intruders away. I was then       able to move around the balcony above the House floor to       record the deserted room and the debris. The gavel used by       House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sat on the dais, surrounded by       discarded emergency escape hoods and debris.        After the lawmakers and press evacuated, those doors were       secured. For another two hours, I was locked in. Then an FBI       tactical team swept through and threw me out of the building.        The joint session of the House and Senate resumed about 9       p.m. Andy Harnik and I persevered through the night and       finished about 3 a.m. I went back to my office in the Senate       Dirksen building, ate some soup and slept from 5 to 7 a.m.       Then we started the next day's coverage.        The news went on, as it always does.        People have given me a lot of applause in the past year for       what I did on Jan. 6, 2021, for the photos I took, for       refusing to leave during the final evacuation. But I want to       make one thing clear: I was simply doing my job. As were many       of my colleagues.        AP photographers John Minchillo and Julio Cortez suffered       the brunt of the riot as they bravely threw themselves       between the mob and the police. Manny Ceneta maneuvered his       way around the Senate side of the Capitol to capture Trump       supporters as they were stopped outside the chamber.       Freelancer Jose Luis Magana took the photos of demonstrators       scaling the wall of the west side of the Capitol. Jacquelyn       Martin and Carolyn Kaster were also at the Trump rally and       the march to the hill.        I was working directly with Washington photo editor Jon       Elswick, who expedited my photos to the wire. Jon was patient       with me because I was sending lots of pictures in a short       time. This is usually not good form; we normally use judgment       and discretion in how many we send in a short time so that       the photo desk isn't overwhelmed.        In this case, I told Jon I was going to move as much as I       could. Why? My previous experience in conflict zones and       working around the military and police reminded me that my       cameras might be destroyed by the mob or my disks confiscated       by police. The ability to transmit from the camera ensured       that the AP--and the world--would get the photos.        The fact is, I never really came face to face with the mob,       except through a telephoto lens. And it really did take every       one of us to record this story. Most of us in the Capitol       that day--Getty, Reuters, AFP and others--couldn't move       around without interference from the mob or the Capitol       Police. Each of us covered what we could.        The result, if you will, was like a mosaic--views from       different photographers all around the Capitol that composed       a more complete picture.        I've witnessed plenty of violence and upheavals before,       coups and revolutions, when I was doing conflict coverage       abroad, but I am still shocked to experience it here. It was       Americans attacking America.        What I saw, and what my camera captured, during the       standoff at the House chamber a year ago was this: a place       where a line was drawn--with courage, duty and guns.        And though they ultimately failed, in a very real way the       rioters succeeded. It was an hour of anarchy, with an       unchecked mob bringing one of the country's most sacred       ceremonies--and the peaceful transfer of power--to a       screeching, scary halt.        I often think about what might have happened if Pelosi had       not called the Electoral College back immediately. Postponing       a few days might have seemed the normal thing, but that       didn't happen. The rioters had mostly escaped the police.       Donald Trump was still in the White House for two more weeks.       Jan. 6 was one of the longest days in our short American       history. Imagine how long 14 more days might have been.        I've been at this a while, and I've learned: Some moments       are hard to look at and some are hard to look away from. But       whatever the moment might be, the job of the       photojournalist--the responsibility--is to show people what       they can't see on their own.        To do that, we have to be there.                            ____________________
