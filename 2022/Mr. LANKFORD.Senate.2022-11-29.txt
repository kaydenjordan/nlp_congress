 Madam President, on behalf of Senator Rubio, I call up  amendment No. 6493 and ask that it be reported by number.    I would like to also call up amendment No. 6496 and ask  that it also be reported by number.    Madam President, in 2015, after the Obergefell decision  came down from the Supreme Court, putting same-sex marriage as the law  of the land, President Obama made a statement to the country. He came  and spoke to the country when there was a lot of heat and a lot of  emotion going on around the country around that particular decision. He  was supportive of the Obergefell decision, but he made this statement.  At that time, President Obama said:         I know that Americans of goodwill continue to hold a wide       range of views on this issue. Opposition in some cases has       been based on sincere and deeply held [religious] beliefs.       All of us who welcome today's news should be mindful of that       fact; recognize different viewpoints; revere our deep       commitment to religious freedom.    That is a wise statement from President Obama during that time period  to be able to say: There are going to be a lot of views. We as  Americans need to have a wide set of conversations about same-sex  marriage and about how we revere marriage in general. There are  different religious views, different perspectives.   Now we are approaching a bill that will be voted on in just about 2  hours. This bill has a section in it dealing with marriage, and it says  it has certain religious protections in it.   As I read the bill initially to be able to check the religious  protections that are in it, I was surprised at some things that were in  it, and I was surprised at some of the things that were left out. So  our team went to work writing an amendment to address the specific  issues in this bill. We narrowly tailored this bill for our amendment,  and we addressed it. Why? Because we were the only ones who thought  there was a problem? Actually, no, we weren't the only ones who saw  this bill as a problem dealing with religious liberty. In fact,  religious liberty groups all over the country and religious  institutions started contacting our office and putting out their own  statements in opposition to this bill, saying the bill as currently  written, even with the ``religious protections'' in it, does not  actually protect the religious liberty of all Americans.   This is just a short list of groups who are in strong opposition to  this bill: the Alliance Defending Freedom, the American Association of  Christians Schools, CatholicVote, the Center for Urban Renewal and  Education, the Centennial Institute, the Christian Employers Alliance,  Concerned Women for America, Eagle Forum, the Ethics and Public Policy  Center, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the Faith and  Freedom Coalition, the Family Research Council, the Family Policy  Alliance, Focus on the Family, Heritage Foundation, Liberty Counsel,  Lifeline Children's Services, the National Religious Broadcasters, the  Religious Freedom Institute, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops,  Samaritan's Purse. The list goes on and on and on of organizations and  entities that read through this bill and said there are major concerns  with the religious liberty portions of this bill.   Now, I am well aware that there are also groups who have put out a  statement and said that they are comfortable with it, that it would  protect them, but other organizations are putting out statements and  saying: Yeah, that is nice for you, but it actually wouldn't protect us  and our members.   There are three major concerns that are in the bill itself under the  issue of religious liberty, and if these three things are not changed  in this bill, it will put the issue of religious liberty at great risk  for millions of Americans who, as President Obama said, hold sincerely  held beliefs that are different.   The first is this: There is a section in the very beginning of the  bill where it  [[Page S6838]]  says any entity that is acting under the color of State law, and then  it puts all the restrictions there on them. That is a broadening,  actually, of what Obergefell actually did. This says any entity,  actually, or individual who is acting under color of state law. What  does that mean? Most people don't live in that legal kind of counsel.  Well, this would be an entity that a State actually hires to fulfill  something for them on behalf of the State.   Let me give you a for-instance on this. A private prison may be one  of those examples, but it could also be adoption agencies, foster care  agencies. It could be an entity that actually does housing for  immigrant and migrant families. It could be a homeless shelter that is  contracted by the State to be able to provide services. It could be any  number of entities. Many of these entities are actually done by  religious organizations that the State actually contracts with them to  be able to do those services. In this new statute, if this passes in 2  hours, there would be a new restriction on those religious entities  that formally held contracts that then would very well be pushed out  from providing those services.   Let me remind you, our Nation functions under not just government  operations but cooperation with families and with faith-based entities  and nonprofit entities around the country. Our safety net, I talk about  often--our first safety net is the families, the second safety net is  nonprofit entities, and the third safety net is government. Many  governments partner with nonprofit--including faith-based--entities to  be able to carry out social services. For those entities, they would  now have a target on them because they are functioning under the color  of State law, and they would have new restrictions. So their choice  would be either not to provide those services or to abandon their  faith.   Now, what are the challenges to them in particular in this? Well, the  first challenge is that they would face litigation from the Attorney  General's Office. The second challenge would be they now face a new  what is called a private right of action. That is what the second area  my amendment specifically deals with. First, it corrects this looping  into lots of new faith-based entities and saying: You are now a State  actor; you are under new restrictions. The second one would be this  private right of action.   The private right of action would now be--anyone who is functioning  ``under the color of State law'' would now be a target from an  individual who senses that they have been harmed by the entity. Now, it  is not defined--what ``harmed'' means--in this new statute; it just  says that if someone feels they have been harmed by it, they would now  have the opportunity to be able to sue someone else because of that.   It is not hard for me to be able to say something that is fairly  obvious; that is, if Congress creates a new right to sue people, there  will be a lot more lawsuits, and there will be new tests and  evaluations on that. For anyone who believes that this new right to be  able to sue people won't be used and won't be used quickly by lawyers  and outside groups all around the country, you are kidding yourself.  What will happen in the days ahead, there will be--who knows?-- countless numbers of lawsuits testing every new definition of what,  under the color of State law, what a partnership with government might  look like. Whether that is a vendor who is at an official State event  or whether that is an entity that is providing something like a private  prison or adoption services, they will all face lawsuits and challenges  in the days ahead by entrepreneurial attorneys testing out the limits  of this new law.   We don't know what those limits will be determined by the courts. We  have no idea because it is not defined what it means when they say they  have been harmed and what that definition might mean to different  courts around the country. But we do know this is going to be a major  issue.   My first question is, Why is this even included in this bill at all?  There is already a protection that the State has the opportunity to be  able to make sure they are enforcing the law within their State. This  new private right of action, though, goes above and beyond that and  gives the opportunity for entrepreneurial lawyers to be able to  practice their craft at the detriment of entities all over the country.   What it really does is it silences any individual who may disagree  and discourages any faith-based entity from cooperating with  government; to say, if you want to be able to partner with the State in  the area, you probably aren't welcome here because you don't share the  same beliefs.   The third big issue that we try to correct in this that is a major  problem in this bill is, in the bill, if you actually read from the  text 7(a)--now, 7(a) probably means nothing to many people outside this  room, but the 7(a) section is designed to be able to protect the rights  of individuals or entities not to be able to lose their nonprofit  status or grants or contracts or whatever it may be, but it has very  specific language that is built into this. The specific language is, if  that benefit or right does not arise from a marriage. It is very  carefully written.   When I passed it around to different attorneys to say what does it  mean, it has been fascinating to me to learn different interpretations  of this statute. This particular section 7(a) is written so vague that  it is very difficult to understand what it does mean, but it is very  clear what it doesn't mean.   When it says all these different rights that have been granted based  on does not arise from a marriage, it doesn't include your belief about  marriage. It just says does not rise from a marriage.   Why do I say that? Our amendment actually includes the belief about  marriage included into it to make it very, very clear that if you have  a different belief about marriage, you won't lose your nonprofit  status, you won't lose your opportunity to have grants or contracts,  but that is not included in this statute.   What is included in the statute is just does not arise from a  marriage. That will be a problem in the courts and, unfortunately, that  will have to be litigated until that is actually determined what it  would mean.   What we could do instead is pass my amendment. The amendment makes it  very clear. What I hear from even some of the bill's sponsors is they  say: No, this is what it is intended to mean. I look at it and say:  That is not what it actually says.   So let's have that section say what you actually intended for that to  say to make it clear. Let's take away the private right of action so  that people around the country aren't perpetually worried about a  lawsuit coming at them constantly. Let's take away this under the color  of law section so that there is not a fear of faith-based nonprofits  not partnering with their own government for fear government would step  in and say: Oh, if you are going to partner with us, then you have to  surrender these different beliefs.   Again, I have had individuals who are sponsors of this bill say none  of those things are what we intend. But courts don't rule on intentions  of Congress; they rule on the text that we actually put out.   Those are three major problems in this text. If they are not  corrected and if they are not corrected today, my fear is President  Obama's statement of just 7 years ago that we would not ``recognize  different viewpoints [and] revere our deep commitment to religious  freedom'' would today be ignored.   I encourage the adoption of my amendment, and I encourage everyone in  this body to ask a very simple question of themselves: Is today about  respecting the rights of all or is it about silencing some and  respecting others?   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this amendment is very, very narrowly  tailored. It is in response to the bill. I have talked to several of  the bill's sponsors, and they have told me their intent is to be able  to protect religious liberty, which I appreciate that to be able to  have a balanced perspective in this particular bill because people of  good will on both sides have disagreements in this area.   The problem is, there are three certain areas of the text that do not  actually meet that standard of being a balanced protection. So this  amendment goes into those three areas and corrects the text to make  sure it actually says it is going to protect religious liberty. It is  three areas.   One is a very wide perspective of operating under the color of State  law. That has a very broad net on it. We tried to be able to correct  that one.   The second one deals with striking the private right of action on  this, which will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits. I can  assure you, if Congress passes a law that opens up a new lane for  lawsuits, there will be lots of new lawsuits in that area.   The third area is in 7(a), where it talks about protecting all these  rights if it does arise from a marriage, not from a belief in a  marriage. So we are trying to correct that text to make sure it is not  just the action of marriage but also the belief of marriage.   That is what this amendment does.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
