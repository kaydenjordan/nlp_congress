 Madam President, as a fellow Commodore, I would  like to congratulate the Vanderbilt University women's bowling team on  winning the National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA,  championship, the second national championship for the women's bowling  program and the fourth national championship in Commodore athletic  history.   John Williamson, the head coach of this program for 14 years, has  done an excellent job of training and guiding these exceptional  student-athletes. He has worked hard to build this program from its  inception in 2004 into one that annually contends for championships.   Vanderbilt is a very special university, one that produces student- athletes of exceptional character and integrity. These are student- athletes that have pride in themselves and their school, in both  academics and athletics. In fact, Kristin Quah of the bowling team  earned the NCAA's Elite 90 Award for having the highest grade point  average at the championships, a 3.953, while double majoring in  biomedical and electrical engineering. Seven members of the team were  recently named to the spring sports All SEC Academic Honor Roll.   I am filled with pride for my alma mater, and I wish the bowling team  and all of Vanderbilt University the best.   This achievement would not have been possible without the hard work,  talent, and teamwork of the following outstanding student-athletes:  Kelsey Abrahamsen, Maria Bulanova, Samantha Gainor, Bryanna Leyen,  Jordan Newham, Ariana Perez, Lauren Potechin, Kristin Quah, Emily  Rigney, Katie Stark, and Adel Wahner.   These student-athletes were coached and mentored by a dedicated team  of coaches and athletic department staff, including: head coach John  Williamson; assistant coach and former All-American Josie Earnest  Barnes; associate athletic director and sport administrator Kevin  Colon; strength and conditioning coach Darren Edgington; facility  manager Kenny Moore; academic counselor Candice Johnson; athletic  trainer Alda Burston; and volunteer sports information director Rod  Williamson.   I would also like to acknowledge chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos; vice  chancellor and athletics director David Williams II; deputy athletics  director Candice Storey Lee; and senior associate athletics directors  Lori Alexander; and Martin Salamone for their vision and leadership.   Anchor Down, Commodores. We are proud of you.                            ____________________
