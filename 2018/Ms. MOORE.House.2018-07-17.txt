 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the intent of the amendment is to reserve funds  for the Smithsonian to do an exhibit in conjunction with local groups  and organizations focused on celebrating the United Nations  International Decade for People of African Descent. I am so proud to  offer this amendment.   Mr. Chair, January 1, 2015, through December 21, 2024, has been  designated as the United Nations International Decade for People of  African Descent, with the theme, ``People of African Descent:  recognition, justice, and development'' by the United Nations General  Assembly.   The population comprising the African diaspora is expansive, spanning  across the globe from the Americas and the Caribbean, to Asia and  Europe, with persons of African descent having a historic presence on  every continent.                                time  2130    Around 200 million people identifying themselves as being of African  descent live in the Americas. The goal of this initiative is for the  United Nations and its member states, among others, to take advantage  of the auspicious period of history by undertaking activities in the  spirit of recognition, justice, and development for people of African  descent around the globe.   Among the goals of this international initiative is to underscore the  important endowments made by people of African descent to our world  societies and to promote a greater knowledge of and respect for the  diverse heritage, culture, and contributions of people of African  descent to the development of societies.   Now, in this country, Mr. Chairman, the Smithsonian is uniquely  positioned to celebrate the launch of this International Decade at the  national level here in this country by creating temporary and maybe  permanent exhibits that can help promote the cultural and artistic  goals of the International Decade and to create an effective exhibit or  series of exhibits across its museums on the contributions of African  descendants in the United States, where Black history is inextricably  and integrally woven since this country's founding and even before.  Yes, Mr. Chairman, Africans explored these shores long before Columbus  and archeological findings here do prove.   The Smithsonian has a history of undertaking efforts to commemorate  and tell the story of the impact of African descendants on African  American history, politics, culture, and society, including the opening  of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and  Culture.   The Smithsonian has a wealth of artifacts and holds the resources to  put together a well-regarded national showcase to weave together a  compelling and concise study and story of some of the most notable  contributions across sectors of African descendants. Likewise, it can  work with local organizations to borrow or make available artifacts,  documents, and relics related to telling the story in a way that no  other institution in our country can.   Simply put, the Smithsonian has the right mix of expertise, archives,  and artifacts to help tell the story as well as the ability to work  with local groups throughout our Nation that are guardians of some of  these narratives but may not have the resources.   With these additional resources, it is hoped that the Smithsonian  will partner with other State and local institutions to help create a  story reflective of the U.N. International Decade for People of African  Descent and promoting the history and heritage of people of African  descent and their impact on our country here.   In an era of xenophobia and rising intolerance, now, more than ever,  we need to join in helping to publicly recognize the culture, history,  and heritage of people of African descent and their impact on the  Nation and the world and have the International Decade for People of  African Descent be more than an empty rhetorical platitude to African  Americans on this shore.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague, because we will turn the  light on the contributions of Africans on this continent during this  decade.   I yield back the balance of my time.
