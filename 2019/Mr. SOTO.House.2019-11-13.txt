 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Espaillat), my dear friend, for yielding.   You know, we had a rally a while ago where I got to hear my dear  friend from New York talk about, as he was addressing Dreamers, that  they were the tears of their grandparents, they were the dreams of  their parents, and how generations led up to the moment where their  children can experience the American Dream. And it really got to me.   It was an emotional moment for all of us, thinking about that story  that all of our families, other than our Native Americans, experienced  at one time or another, that someone had to make a choice, someone had  to cross an ocean or a desert, or so many other barriers to get here to  the United States.   You know, as we look at what the Supreme Court, yesterday having  their oral arguments, is set to rule upon, it is pretty clear that  terminating DACA would not be in the best interests of the Sunshine  State. It is pretty clear that ending DACA would be bad for Florida,  President Trump's new home State.   When you look back, our State passed in a bipartisan fashion in the  Florida legislature when I was there in-state tuition for Dreamers. We  also passed a bill that I filed and was able to pass to admit Dreamers  to the Florida Bar, all defined as DACA recipients.   So in a State that many people refer to as purple, being Democrats  and Republicans going back and forth on close issues and in close  elections, we came together to protect our Dreamers.   So I hope as the Trump administration is examining their arguments  and working before the Supreme Court, that they recognize that this  wouldn't serve in Florida's best interests.   In Florida, we have over 80,000 Dreamers, 30,000 of whom were DACA  recipients. I wanted to spend a few minutes tonight talking about their  stories, about my constituents.   The first Dreamer I would like to speak about, a DACA recipient, is  Herman Younger, otherwise known as Herman to us affectionately.   Herman Younger grew up in the city of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Wanting  to give him and his sister a better life, his family decided to migrate  to Miami, Florida, in 2002.   During this time, his parents instilled in him a respect and  curiosity for the law. This led him to join the Miami-Dade Police  Explorers while in high school.   In 2012, Herman applied for DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals, which allowed him to pursue educational opportunities post  high school.   After graduating, he moved to Gainesville, Florida, where he studied  political science at the University of Florida with a focus on ethics  and moral law.   During this time at UF, he joined the College Democrats; prelaw  fraternity, Phi Alpha Delta; and Assembly for Action, a conference that  aims to build community relations with local organizations.   During his junior year, Herman interned for our office in D.C., where  he helped draft a bill I introduced earlier this year, the Artificial  Intelligence JOBS Act, otherwise known as AI JOBS Act.   After his internship, Herman worked not only on our campaigns, but  oversaw phone bankers and canvassers as our district coordinator.   Herman has since graduated from the University of Florida, receiving  his bachelor's degree.   In May of this year, he spearheaded a group advocating for restaurant  workers to unionize against unfair treatment and pay, and now currently  holds a position with the Sierra Club as their organizing  representative for the Wildlands Red Tide Campaign.    Herman continues to be an advocate for other Dreamers and hopes to  fight the structural inequities and racism stemming from colonization.   Another amazing DACA recipient, an amazing Dreamer from my district  is Mariana Castro.   Mariana came to the United States from Peru at the age of ten with  her mother, leaving her brothers and father behind.   While her mother worked three jobs to keep food on the table for her  family, Mariana excelled as a central Florida high school student. In  tenth grade, she realized that regardless of her excellent grades,  involvement in hundreds of community service hours, that  [[Page H8819]]  her undocumented status would impact and potentially stop her academic  career.   Opportunity shined when DACA became a reality a few months before her  graduation. She graduated from Celebration High School in 2013,  received the highest academic scholarship in the State, and chose the  University of Florida to be her home for the next 4 years.   At the time, even with DACA, she was denied an in-state tuition rate  in college and her scholarship was revoked.   Mariana paused her education and fought for the in-state tuition,  that I previously mentioned in my speech here tonight, for undocumented  students in the State of Florida.   Her efforts came to fruition, as she stood side by side with so many  other Dreamers when we finally passed the in-state tuition bill for  Dreamers 1 year later.   And what happens when we give someone like Mariana an opportunity?  She returned to the University of Florida, where she graduated with a  degree in biological sciences this past May.   As a DACA recipient, Mariana was unable to receive any state  scholarships, Federal aid, or loans.   While being a full-time student, she worked 40 hours every week at  restaurants to pay for her education out of pocket.   During her college career, she interned at my congressional office in  2018 and was later hired as a legislative aid in the Florida Senate.   She also helped start university programs that provide visibility to  undocumented students, most recently institutionalizing a training for  professional staff about relevant immigration laws that affect the  student body, while raising funds for the Out of the Shadows  scholarship, a scholarship specifically for undocumented students in  Florida that she oversaw for 3 years.   Over the years, she received several awards for her advocacy in the  immigrant community, including being named the only female Outstanding  Student Leader in her graduating class.   Today, Mariana Castro serves as the central Florida business manager  for Impact Fund, working to change public policy around immigration  through coalition building and bipartisan action.   Mariana plans to obtain a combined JD and PP degree and continue to  use legislation and grassroots organizing in order to fight for  disenfranchised communities in the Nation.   Also, as the Civil Rights Action Task Force chair for the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I wanted to talk a little bit about the  issues before the Supreme Court.   We know, with the DACA program, that the Federal Government created a  promise, a promise to these eventual DACA recipients that their  deportation would be deferred, and it was for an obvious reason: there  are over 10 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, and  these were the lowest priority for deportation because they were young  people who came here through no fault of their own, that knew no other  country other than this one. And I can tell you, as we heard from  Mariana's story and from Herman's story, that they are indeed  ambitious, and they are indeed contributing to our society.   So a promise was made to these young people, and they relied on that  promise, to their detriment, by giving their information to the Federal  Government every 2 years periodically. And then from there, the Federal  Government should be estopped from being able to use that to deport  them, to single them out in any way.   If the program is going to be wound down, it should be wound down in  an ordinary and orderly fashion. And I think those who are in the  program should at least be able to stay in the program, or if not, not  be targeted by the Federal Government. So I think it is right that the  Federal Government should be estopped from using this information to  the detriment of these young people.   Then we look at the reasoning, and it is hard to see under either a  rational review or a higher scrutiny that the court may apply, that  there is enough information to strike down this executive order. It was  done through the ordinary process.   And now the reason they originally proffered was simply that it was  unconstitutional. You know, that is the purview of the Supreme Court.  That is not a reason for an administration to be able to strike down a  program. They actually have to give a reason beyond their own opinion  that something is unconstitutional. Of course, the Trump administration  didn't do that in all their procedures to try to end the law.   Then eventually in the appellate courts, they tried to come up with  some statistics, come up with some justifications after they had  already gone through the process, and now they want to put the genie  back in the bottle. Now they want to say, ``Well, our rationale was  given in the appellate court, so we should be able to just use that  from the beginning,'' and that is not the way the process works.   Even then, it was the same xenophobic misrepresentations that we hear  about these young people being spouted to this day.                                time  1815    Whether it is under estoppel or whether it is simply under the  court's scrutiny, I think it is pretty clear. We hope the Supreme Court  will decline to end the program or, at the very least, have an orderly  termination of it, protecting these kids and stopping the Federal  Government from hurting them any further.
