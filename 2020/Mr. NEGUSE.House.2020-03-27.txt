 Mr. Speaker, one of the many leaders of the talented  freshman class.   Thank you to Majority Leader Hoyer for his leadership. Thank you to  Speaker Pelosi for her leadership and our very distinguished committee  chairs for their work on this incredible, important bill.   As many have said, this bill is far from perfect, but let us be clear  about one thing: The American people need relief now, not tomorrow, not  next week, not next month--now.   And so the question before this Chamber is very simple: Will we step  up for the American people? Will we step up for the healthcare workers  sacrificing their own health to save the lives of others? For the  millions of unemployed across our country in each of our States  struggling to make ends meet to pay their rent, to be able to feed  their families? For the small businesses in Boulder and Fort Collins  and Broomfield and across our country on the brink of collapse? For the  scientists at CSU and at NIH and everywhere in between working to  develop a vaccine to the COVID-19 pandemic?   I pray and I hope that we will step up for them by passing this bill  today. Let's get it done. Let's meet this moment.
