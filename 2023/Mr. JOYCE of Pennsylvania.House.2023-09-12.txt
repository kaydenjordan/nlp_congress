 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Leah Shackley of Bedford County, Pennsylvania, who won a  second gold medal this past Thursday at the World Junior Aquatic  Swimming Championship in Israel as a member of Team USA.   A senior in high school, Leah has won races across the country, and  now around the world. Through her commitment to training at both the  Blair Regional YMCA in Hollidaysburg and in her family's pond in  Bedford County, Leah has shown that hard work and determination can  provide an incredible recipe for success.   As she represents both our district and our Nation, Leah faced tough  competition from over 600 athletes representing 100 nations. During the  team relay event, Leah set a personal record in the 100-meter butterfly  with a time of 57.75 seconds.   With Leah's continued success in the water and her support of friends  and  [[Page H4234]]  neighbors in Bedford, she continues to set an incredible example for  student athletes in central Pennsylvania.   On behalf of all of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, I  congratulate Leah and all of Team USA on their success in the World  Junior Aquatics Swimming Championship.               Pass a Farm Bill that Ensures America's Security     Madam Speaker, during the August district  work period, I traveled over 3,200 miles across central and western  Pennsylvania.   As I met with members of our agricultural community, from orchard  growers in Adams County to dairy farmers in Cambria County, I saw  firsthand the need for Congress to pass a farm bill that supports the  farmers in our rural communities.   This legislation is vital to ensuring America continues providing our  country with abundant and affordable food. Very simply put, food  security is national security, and now more than ever we need a farm  bill that addresses the concerns facing our Pennsylvania farmers.   As production costs continue to soar because of President Biden's  inflationary policies, we must find ways to ensure that our food  remains affordable for families, while also protecting our local  farmers.   We need to better target resources to maintain our commitment to  rural farmers and the rural development that is at the cusp of what  they do. What we don't need is legislation that overregulates and  overburdens the farmers that we rely on to grow the food and provide  the dairy products and the wholesome grains that are so important to  the economy and to the health of all Americans.   It is time to pass a farm bill that ensures our security and allows  at the same time for our farmers to prosper.                            ____________________
