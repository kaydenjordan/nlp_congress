 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment  to the INVEST in America Act to ensure the future of transportation is  convenient, affordable, and sustainable.   My amendment would help local governments sustainably fund innovative  public transportation options, including on-demand transit. These new  transit services will be required to follow FTA rules and to protect  the labor force that makes public transit possible.   Expanding mobility-as-a-service--like bikeshare, scooters, and  rideshare--will bring in new transit ridership, meaning less traffic  and pollution and more walkable, vibrant downtowns.   I am grateful for Chairman DeFazio's leadership on this  transformational bill and the diligent work of his staff. I urge my  colleagues to support my amendment and the underlying bill.
