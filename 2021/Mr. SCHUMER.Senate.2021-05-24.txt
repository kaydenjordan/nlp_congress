 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday was the last day that members  of the National Guard were stationed at the Capitol. In the wake of  January 6, they have all done us an extraordinary service providing an  additional layer of security here. I want to thank everyone on behalf  of the Senate and the entire Capitol Complex.   It was never our intention to have an element of the U.S. military on  guard at the Capitol for an indefinite period. It was always a  temporary solution to a temporary security threat caused by the former  President--a reality acknowledged by the House and Senate minority  leaders in the immediate aftermath of January 6 but not much since.   Going forward, we must establish and maintain a critical balance  between security and access. The Capitol is a place that belongs to the  people. We want visitors and tourists to be able to come and go. We  want constituents to be able to meet their representatives and make  their voices heard. We also have an obligation to make everyone-- Members, staff, media, employees of the Capitol--feel safe when they  come to work. Our Senate committees and the new team at the Sergeant at  Arms are working very hard to strike that perfect balance.   We thank once again the National Guard for helping us protect this  place during a very difficult period for our democracy.                          Business Before the Senate    Madam President, now on Senate business, this week, the Senate will  consider at least two nominations for important positions in the  executive branch: Chiquita Brooks-LaSure to be the next Administrator  of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and Kristen Clarke to be the  next Assistant Attorney General.   Ms. Clarke would become the first woman and the first woman of color  to formally lead the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division since  it was established in 1957.   I look forward to confirming both nominees this week.   The Senate will also continue its work on the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act--the largest stand-alone investment in American science  and technology in decades. With a once-in-a-generation investment in  the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the  Department of Commerce, and other vital entities, this legislation will  set our country on a path to outinnovate, outproduce, and outcompete  the world in the industries of the future.   As the week goes on, we will consider a number of amendments from  both sides of the aisle, as well as a managers' amendment, to bring  together a package of bipartisan changes to the bill. This is regular  order in action.   The bill itself is the product of at least six Senate committees and  includes input from nearly every Member of the Senate. As promised, we  are working in a bipartisan way and a much more open way than the  Senate used to act to allow amendments and debate. When a bill passes  22 to 4 out of one of its major committees and 21 to 1 out of another,  it is truly bipartisan, and we should be able to move this bill forward  without any dilatory obstruction. With so much cooperation happening, I  see no reason why we can't finish the legislation by the end of the  week.   So far, this bill has flown a bit under the radar, but it is an  incredibly important piece of legislation. At its core, the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act is about maintaining America's role as  the global economic leader. Few issues could be more important. Just  because it may have its effect 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now and not the  day after it passes doesn't mean that it isn't one of the most  important pieces of legislation we could pass.   The next century will be won or lost on the battleground of  technological innovation. The country that leads the world in science  and tech will create a generation of millions of good-paying jobs,  economic growth, and prosperity for its citizens, with profound  implications for national security as well.   We want American workers, American businesses, and American values to  lead the way in the 21st century, just as they did in the 20th century.  That is what the Innovation and Competition Act is all about.   I look forward to working with Members from both parties to complete  this legislation by the end of the week.                             January 6 Commission    Madam President, now on a final matter, the Senate will soon consider  bipartisan legislation passed by the House to create an independent  Commission to investigate and report on the January 6 attack on the  Capitol. I have already taken procedural steps to make the legislation  available for consideration on the Senate floor. I will bring the bill  forward for a vote very soon. I will have more to say on that in the  coming days.   The formation of the Commission is more important now than it has  ever been in the months since January 6. Washington Republicans have  tried to rewrite history and recast the attack on January 6 as little  more than peaceful protests that got out of hand. One Republican Member  said the rioters were more like a group of ``normal tourists.'' Did you  see the tapes? Did you see the films, America? Those were normal  tourists? Another went so far as to say the mob--not the staff who were  terrorized or the police who were brutalized--were the real victims of  January 6. Give me a break.    For the sake of our democracy, it is crucial to establish an  independent and trusted record of what truly transpired. According to  an Ipsos poll today, 56 percent of Republicans believe that the  election was rigged, and 53 percent of Republicans believe that Donald  Trump is the true President, not Joe Biden. That is what the Big Lie  has caused. The majority of one of America's two major political  parties doesn't believe our President is the actual President.   Now more than ever, both parties must stand up to the Big Lie and  shine a light on the truth of the 2020 elections and what happened on  January 6. Yet it seems our Republican colleagues would rather avoid  the subject entirely. The Republican leader, after moving the goalposts  week after week, announced his opposition to the Commission, despite  the fact that Democrats agreed to every single request made by the  House Republican leader.   One Republican Senator said this weekend that it was ``too early'' to  establish a Commission. Another admitted that many Republicans opposed  the Commission because they feared it would hurt the Republican message  in the midterm elections. Talk about saying the quiet part out loud.   The prevailing view among Republicans seems to be that we should  sweep the Big Lie and all of January 6 under the rug like it never  happened. Look, I am sorry that some Republicans believe that a  bipartisan investigation of the attack on our democracy is inconvenient  for their midterm campaigns, but the Democratic-led Congress of the  United States is not going to sweep January 6 under the rug. We are  going to vote on the January 6 Commission in the Senate, and the  American people will see where every Member stands: on the side of  truth or on the side of Donald Trump's Big Lie.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due for a second reading en bloc.    Madam President, in order to place the bills on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceeding en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 230, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 231, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  May 25; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of Executive Calendar No. 117, Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, to  be Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,  postcloture; further, that all time on the Brooks-LaSure nomination be  considered expired at 11:45 a.m.; that the Senate recess following the  cloture vote on the Clarke nomination until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly caucus meetings; that if cloture is invoked on the Clarke  nomination, all postcloture debate time be considered expired at 2:30  p.m.; and finally, that if any of the nominations are confirmed, the  motions to reconsider be considered made  [[Page S3383]]  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:41 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, May 25, 2021, at 10 a.m.
