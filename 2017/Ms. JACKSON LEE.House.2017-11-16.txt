 Mr. Speaker, this is not the American Dream tax  plan. This is the American nightmare, a tax scam of the worst  proportion.   With over 8,000 of my constituents last evening on a teleconference  town hall meeting, overwhelmingly they disagreed with a tax plan that  cuts Medicare or Medicaid to finance tax cuts, eliminates the mortgage  tax deduction, so that those who are suffering from Hurricane Harvey,  trying to rebuild their lives, seeking a new home cannot, in fact,  deduct their mortgage.   The same thing with the 200,000 Texans who are going to pay more  because we are eliminating the deduction for State and local taxes, and  eliminating deductions for student loans, casualty losses; by next  year, $25 billion in Social Security cuts.   My seniors on the phone last night asked me about those cuts. They  asked me about the medical expenses cuts for seniors. All of that is  eliminated.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a sample of tele-townhall survey  questions and answers               Tax Tele-Townhall Survey Questions and Answers         (1) Do you agree that a tax bill should cut tax at the       expense of Medicaid and Medicare? 95 percent said no.        (2) The current tax reform bill will eliminate the tax       deduction for student loan interest and the lifetime learning       credit. Do you support the elimination of these tax credits?       91 percent said no.        (3) The current tax code allows homeowners to deduct       interest on mortgages. Would you support a tax plan that       includes a reduction in credit for first-time home buyers? 95       percent said no.     Mr. Speaker, this plan will show no growth. The  neutral tax policy entity said you will get no growth, no growth in  wages, and you will send jobs overseas in waves.   It is a tax scam and it is an American nightmare. Vote against this  tax scam   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong  and unyielding opposition to H.R. 1, the so-called ``Tax Cut and Jobs  Act,'' which more accurately should be called the ``Republican Tax Scam  Act.''   I oppose this cruel and immoral $1.7 trillion tax giveaway to wealthy  corporations and the top one percent because it raises taxes on poor,  working, and middle class families; explodes the deficit by adding an  additional $2.2 trillion over ten years; and will require an estimated  $5.4 trillion cut in funding for the programs ordinary Americans depend  on for health security, educational opportunity, and economic progress.   Mr. Speaker, Americans are not fooled; they know trickle-down  economics has never worked, and they see right through this phony tax  plan and recognize it for the scam that it is.   That is why Americans reject this Republican tax giveaway by an  overwhelming 2:1 margin according to a poll released yesterday by  Quinnipiac.   Specifically, 61 percent think the Republican tax scam will benefit  the wealthy the most; only 16 percent say the plan will reduce their  taxes.   59 percent think it is a very bad idea to eliminate the deduction for  state and local income taxes.   Nearly half of respondents (40 percent) think it a bad idea to lower  the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.   This Republican tax plan is even more toxic to my constituents in the  Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, as you may know, my constituents and others in Texas are  still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane  Harvey, the worst storm ever to make landfall in the continental United  States.   Yet last evening, nearly 8,000 of them took time out of their busy  schedules to join me in a tele-townhall to discuss the tax scheme that  has been rushed to the floor for a vote by the Republican leadership in  the hope of passing it before the American people learn its insidious  details.   But I have got news for them: too late.   My constituents understand and let me know that they believe it is  important that the United States has a tax system that is fair,  balanced, smart, and provides the resources and opportunities to allow  all Americans to reach their potential.   And by margins exceeding 90 percent, they reject:   1. Any cuts to Medicare or Medicaid to finance tax cuts for wealthy  corporations and the top 1 percent;   2. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction;   3. Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes;   4. Eliminating existing deductions for student loan interest or  making taxable college endowment funds or college fellowships expenses.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents, and Americans across the country,  oppose this unfair Republican tax giveaway because nearly half of the  $1.7 trillion tax cut goes to just the top one percent.   In fact, the average annual tax cut for the top one-tenth of one  percent is $320,000; for the top one percent it is $62,000, and for  those earning $1 million a year it is $68,000.   Nearly 25 percent of the tax cut goes to households in just the top  one-tenth of one percent, who make at least $5 million a year (2027).   While super-wealthy corporations and individuals are reaping  windfalls, millions of middle-class and working families will see their  taxes go up:   1. 13 million households face a tax increase next year.   2. 45 million households face a tax increase in 2027.   3. 29 million households (21 percent) earning less than $100,000 a  year see a tax increase.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794  increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families  struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   It is shocking, but not surprising, that under this Republican tax  scam, the total value of tax cuts for just the top one percent is more  than the entire tax cut for the lower 95 percent of earners.   Put another way, those earning more than $912,000 a year will get  more in tax cuts than 180 million households combined.   The core of this Republican tax scheme is a massive tax cut from 35  percent to 20 percent for corporations, but that is not the only way  that the wealthy are rewarded.   The massive tax cuts for corporations are permanent but temporary for  working and middle-class families.   Another immoral aspect of this terrible tax scam is that it abandons  families that face natural disasters or high medical costs by repealing  deductions for casualty losses and medical expenses.   Mr. Speaker, in what universe does it make any sense to eliminate, as  this bill would, a deduction for:  [[Page H9404]]    1. Teachers who purchase supplies for their classroom;   2. Moving expenses to take a new job and taxes employer-provided  moving expenses; or   3. Dependent care assistance, making it harder for families to afford  day care, nursery school, or care for aging parents?   This Republican tax scam jeopardizes American innovation and  competitiveness by eliminating the deduction for student loan interest,  which affects 12 million borrowers, and cuts total education assistance  by more than $64 billion.   Under the extraordinary leadership of President Obama and the  determined efforts of ordinary Americans, we pulled our way out from  under the worst of the foreclosure crisis when the housing bubble burst  in 2007.   Inexplicably, Republicans are now championing a tax scheme that will  make the homes of average Americans less valuable because deductions  for mortgage interest and property taxes are much less valuable than  under current law.   A tax plan that reduces home values, as this one does, puts pressure  on states and towns to collect revenues they depend on to fund schools,  roads, and vital public resources.   Mr. Speaker, an estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state  and local taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   But this is not the end of the bad news that will be delivered were  this tax scam to become law, not by a long shot.   The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions  of Texans by taking away the $4,050 deduction for each taxpayer and  claimed dependent; in 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions  were claimed in the Lone Star State.   Equally terrible is that this Republican tax scam drastically reduces  the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7 million  low-income individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet with an  average credit of $2,689.   The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans,  including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year.   So to achieve their goal of giving more and more to the haves and the  ``have mores,'' our Republican friends are willing to betray seniors,  children, the most vulnerable and needy, and working and middle-class  families.   The $5.4 trillion cuts in program investments that will be required  to pay for this tax giveaway to wealthy corporations and individuals  will fall most heavily on low-income families, students struggling to  afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   America will not be made great by financing a $1.7 trillion tax cut  for the rich by stealing $1.8 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid,  abandoning seniors and families in need, depriving students of  realizing a dream to attend college without drowning in debt, or  disinvesting in the working families.   America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global,  interconnected, and digital economy by slashing funding for scientific  research, the arts and humanities, job retraining, and clean energy  just to pay for a tax cut to corporations and individuals who do not  even need it.   Mr. Speaker, the tax scheme presented here by Republicans is not a  plan but a scam that represents a betrayal of our values as a nation.   This tax scam is not a revenue policy adapted for the real world that  real Americans live in but a fantasy resting on the monstrous belief  that the wealthy have too little money and that poor, working, and  middle-class families have too much.   Our Republican friends continue to cling to the fantasy belief that  their tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves despite all  precedent to the contrary and evidence that their tax scheme is  projected by experts to lose between $3 trillion and $7 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, in evaluating the merits of a taxing system, it is not  enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the plan must also pass  a ``moral test.''   The Republican tax bill fails both of these standards.   I strongly oppose H.R. 1, the ``Republican Tax Scam Act,'' and urge  all Members to join me in voting against this reckless, cruel, and  heartless proposal that will do nothing to improve the lives or well- being of middle and working class families, and the poor and vulnerable  `caught in the tentacles of circumstance.'    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record The Washington  Post op-ed, ``The Republican tax plan's five worst dangers,'' by  Secretary Rubin, dated November 15, 2017                 [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15, 2017]                The Republican Tax Plan's Five Worst Dangers                             (By Robert Rubin)         The deficit-funded tax cuts advancing through Congress are       a fiscal tragedy for which our country will pay a huge price       over time. While the details of the tax plan remain in flux,       its fundamental contours will not change. Nor will its $1.5       trillion of deficit funding, the amount stipulated in the       recently passed budget resolution.        Perhaps it's hopeless to expect those in Congress who have       long bemoaned deficits and the debt to oppose the plan. If,       however, as a matter of conscience or renewed reflection they       decide to take heed, here are the fiscal dangers posed by the       plan.        To start, the tax cuts will not increase growth and, given       their fiscal effects, would likely have a significant and       increasingly negative impact. The nonpartisan Tax Policy       Center's latest report estimated that, over 10 years, the       average increase in our growth rate would be roughly zero,       counting the crowding out of private investment by increasing       deficits but not counting other adverse effects of worsening       our fiscal outlook. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, using the       same approach, estimates virtually no increase in long-term       growth. Goldman Sachs projects an increase of 0.1 percent to       0.2 percent in the first couple of years and an average       increase over 10 years of just 0.05 percent per year, not       counting any of the adverse fiscal effects.        These estimates reflect three underlying views held by       mainstream economists. First, individual tax cuts will not       materially induce people to work more. Second, corporate tax       cuts will likely have limited effect on investment or       decisions about where to locate  [[Page H9405]]       business activity, given the many other variables at play.       Third, deficit-funded tax cuts will have little short-term       effect on growth, except perhaps for some temporary       overheating, because we are at roughly full employment.        With no additional revenue from increased growth to offset       the tax cuts' cost, the publicly held debt of the federal       government would increase by $1.5 trillion. An additional       danger is that the actual deficit impact would be increased       by abandoning the Congressional Budget Office's nonpartisan       evaluation that has been used for decades by both parties in       favor of partisan calculations by those pushing the tax cuts.        Adding $1.5 trillion or more to the federal debt would make       an already bad situation worse. A useful measure of our       fiscal position is the ratio of publicly held government debt       to economic output or gross domestic product, called the       debt/GDP ratio. In 2000, the debt/GDP ratio was 32 percent.       The ratio is now 77 percent. Looking forward, the CBO       projects the debt/GDP ratio to be 91 percent in 2027 and 150       percent in 2047. After $1.5 trillion of deficit-funded tax       cuts, those future ratios have been estimated to increase to       roughly 97 percent in 2027 and 160 percent in 2047. These       estimates likely substantially understate the worsening of       our fiscal trajectory. That's because they do not account for       the increasingly adverse effect on growth of the difficult-      to-quantify effects of fiscal deterioration.        Exacerbating our already unsustainable fiscal trajectory       with these tax cuts would threaten growth in five respects.       These are highly likely to be substantial and to increase       over time.        First, business confidence would likely be negatively       affected by creating uncertainty about future policy and       heightening concern about our political system's ability to       meet our economic policy challenges.        Second, our country's resilience to deal with inevitable       future economic and geopolitical emergencies, including the       effects of climate change, would continue to decline.        Third, funds available for public investment, national       security and defense spending--a professed concern of many       tax-cut proponents--would continue to decline as debt rises,       because of rising interest costs and the increased risk of       borrowing to fund government activities.        Fourth, Treasury bond interest rates would be highly likely       to increase over time because of increased demand for the       supply of savings and increased concern about future       imbalances. That, in turn, would raise private-sector       interest rates, which could also increase due to widening       spreads vs. Treasuries, further reflecting increased concern       about future conditions. And even a limited increase in the       debt/GDP ratio could focus attention on our fiscal       trajectory's long-ignored risks and trigger outsize increases       in Treasury and private-sector interest rates. The ability to       borrow in our own currency, and to print it through the       Federal Reserve, may diminish these risks for a while, as       might capital inflows from abroad. But these mitigating       factors have their limits; at some point, unsound fiscal       conditions almost surely would undermine our currency and       debt markets.        Finally, at some unpredictable point, fiscal conditions--      and these market dynamics--would likely be seen as       sufficiently serious to cause severe market and economic       destabilization.        We have an imperative need to address our unsustainable       longer-term fiscal trajectory with sound economic policies.       Few elected officials want to face this fact, but, at the       very least, they should not make matters worse. We can only       hope that responsible elected officials will prevent this       irresponsible tax plan from being adopted.     Mr. Speaker, I rise for the very sad task, as we  begin the season of Thanksgiving, of announcing the passing of my dear  friend,  [[Page H9415]]  Steve Mostyn, a great Texan, a great American, husband, father, and  friend. We pray for him; his beautiful wife, Amber; and his children.   Today, I ask, in the spirit of our faith, if Members will join me in  a moment of silence for the passing of Steve Mostyn.                            ____________________
