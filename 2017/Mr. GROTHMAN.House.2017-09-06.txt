 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1215, line 25, after the dollar amount insert       ``(reduced by $177,362,500)''.        Page 1216, line 8, after the dollar amount insert       ``(reduced by $177,362,500)''.        Page 1304, line 22, after the dollar amount insert       ``(increased by $177,362,500)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chairman recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chair, this amendment reduces the total funding for  public housing tenant-based rental assistance, excluding veterans,  elderly, and the disabled, by $177 million. Our President, Donald  Trump, who was trying to do what he could to balance the budget,  actually had less funding for this program than what there was last  year.   Because I am a person who believes in getting things done through  compromise, I am reducing the increase in this program to only 2  percent from the 4 percent as the bill was shot out of the  Appropriations Committee.   I have always had problems with this program. Like a lot of these  programs, it kind of discourages work in that the more you work the  more your rent goes up. I think, like a lot of these programs, it  discourages marriage, because if you are married to somebody with a  good job, you could lose your apartment. And, finally, like a lot of  these programs, you could take the time to look at some of these  projects. I talked to some of the people in my area who administer  them. The apartments or rental units given to people who get Section 8  are better than a lot of working people, which doesn't seem right  either.   I will also point out, since these appropriations bills were  originally looked at, I mean at that time we already knew we were  looking at blowing through a $20 trillion deficit, since that time, we  have had a couple major hurricanes out there which I think would cause  everybody to look for ways to reduce the spending that was put in these  bills in July.   Mr. Chair, I am going to ask that amendment No. 39 pass. I am going  to ask that we restrict the increase to 2 percent. I can't believe I  compromised so much on that, but we will go for a 2 percent increase  instead of a 4 percent increase, and hope you will all be glad.  Consider it a down payment to help the struggling people in Texas and  Florida.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, we have scrubbed this bill for savings  in overhead and administration, and I want to thank the gentleman for  always bringing up these important issues. We have funded vouchers at a  level that meets HUD's commitment to those currently receiving  assistance, many of whom are elderly and disabled. I know obviously  that is not what the gentleman is going after, or both. But again, we  scrubbed this bill, and we think that the funding is where it needs to  be at this stage. I would respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I don't see how in our current position we  can afford 4 percent increases on anything. Like I said, I think there  is kind of an inference here that this is overall a good program, and  people ought to be looking at this program. Like so many of these  means-based programs, they kind of create a situation in which we both  discourage work and discourage marriage. I am disappointed that there  would be any alliance in this budget that people would feel a 4 percent  upper was appropriate.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for  yielding time to me, and I join him in opposition to this amendment.   There are some conflicting accounts about what the underlying bill  would do. Certainly there has been an attempt to contain the damage in  the bill. Some groups like the National Low Income Housing Coalition,  however, estimate that housing vouchers would be lost under the current  bill, and then we have this amendment? This amendment would compound  many times whatever problems are involved in the legislation. It would  have a horrible impact on low-income families.   The gentleman has asserted here tonight that veterans wouldn't be  harmed, that the disabled wouldn't be harmed, the elderly wouldn't be  harmed. Read the amendment. Where is any of this stated? How can he  make such statement? All these groups and more would be harmed.   Mr. Chair, I urge this amendment's rejection.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, just one more time I will point out, it is  all fine and good to say the Federal Government ought to be spending  more money. We are broke, and we got a lot more broke in August when  those hurricanes hit. I think it would be appropriate for everybody  around here to remember that the day will come when we can no longer  borrow money, and that will be a very ugly day indeed.   Like I said, we could have introduced the amendment to go back where  Donald Trump wanted. I know he is a warrior and cares a lot about this  country's children and grandchildren. I put a 2 percent upper in there.  I think it is sad when people feel a 2 percent increase is being  difficult on people. If there are problems back home, there is nothing  that prevents local States or counties or individuals out of their own  pocketbook to put more money in this sort of program.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 44 Offered by Mr. Courtney    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 44  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1247, line 2, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $266,000,000)''.        Page 1304, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $266,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the chairman and  ranking member for their collaborative effort to bring this bill  forward. I do rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 3354, which  should be amendment No. 46.   This amendment deals with project-based rental assistance rather than  tenant-based rental assistance. It suffers from the same problems,  however. One more time, our President, when he introduced his budget  looking at the $20 trillion deficit, decided to reduce this program a  little bit. And it probably would be good to reduce the program a  little bit because, like many of these programs, it is fundamentally  flawed in that it discourages work and also discourages marriage.   I have looked at some of these housing projects in my district, and  it is again irritating that people who are getting free housing  sometimes have better housing than people who are paying for their own  housing; therefore, I make the modest request to get rid of the  increase in the current budget. I am not going as far as our President  who actually decreased this line, but I think it is fair to reduce the  current bill by $266 million, which is the increase in the current  year.   Again, I think, as opposed to when this bill was originally put  together, we have had a couple hurricanes which I think would cause  everybody in this building to realize that insofar as we can spend any  more money in this budget, it should be focused a little bit more on  the people in Texas and Florida, and we should not be increasing other  programs.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would cut funding as  was explained to what I believe is a vital HUD program that houses 1.2  million low- and very low-income households across the country. Now, a  majority of those households include folks with either disabilities or,  frankly, folks who are elderly. The average household income is less  than $12,000.   This funding level would not allow HUD to renew all expiring housing  contracts with private owners. It also would cause some other issues of  instability in that program, that platform, and it could cause housing  providers to leave the program.   The gentleman has, I think, some very valid points about some of his  concerns with all of these government programs. I just don't think this  is the right way to do it.   Mr. Chair, again, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 48 Offered by Mr. Stivers    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 48  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division H (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  Each amount made available by this Act for title       II of division H (other than an amount required to be made       available by a provision of law) is hereby reduced by 2       percent.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman and  ranking member for their collaborative effort to bring this bill  forward.   As we all know, we are heading towards $20 trillion in debt. One of  the agencies that I think has been criticized for a long period of  time, to a certain extent for incompetence and to a certain extent  wondering whether a lot of their functions are even things appropriate  for the Federal Government, is the Department of Housing and Urban  Development.   President Trump, who got elected to look out for our children and our  grandchildren, proposed cutting this budget overall by 18 percent. I  commend President Trump for trying to look out for our children and  grandchildren.   The Appropriations Committee has shaved that reduction to 1 percent.  The purpose of my amendment is to increase it to approximately a 3  percent reduction, only about one-sixth of the reduction that President  Trump wanted.   Since we last met in July, we have gone through two hurricanes. We  already voted on an $8 billion appropriation. We know that is just a  small downpayment on the new obligations that we are going to have.   I would ask this House to increase that 1 percent reduction to a 3  percent reduction, which is what we have here. I think that is very  modest. It is not at all what the President wanted. It is just one- sixth of what the President wanted.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, we have taken a responsible and  thorough approach to HUD's funding. We have actually reduced HUD's  budget by $487 million below last year. We have done so while keeping  as a priority, for example, housing assistance to the most needy among  us: the elderly, the disabled, our veterans. This amendment would  potentially hurt some of these vulnerable citizens.   Again, the across-the-board approach goes against, frankly, what I  think we  [[Page H7060]]  have to be doing in government, which is do the tough work and go line  by line and identify lower priority or functioning programs for  reductions so that we can then target resources to where they are  actually most needed.   Let me just give you a few examples, Mr. Chairman, of where we have  targeted resources: CDBG, veterans' voucher renewals, vouchers for the  disabled. I cannot agree to an amendment that would, again, cut those  programs across the board.   Also, another issue, which I know is not the Honorable Member's  intent, but I understand CBO has scored this amendment at zero savings.  If we had a lot of time, we could talk about why. So, again, it is  actually not even achieving what the gentleman is trying to achieve.   I do thank him for his passion in looking out for the taxpayers. I  think that is a very needed thing here in Congress. But I respectfully  urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.
