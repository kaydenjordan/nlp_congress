 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, today is a sad day in  the people's House. Since Donald Trump was elected in 2016, Democrats  have been on a crusade to stop him by any means.   I believe the American people are the fairest people on this Earth.  They believe that everyone should be treated equally under the law, no  matter what station you occupy in life: rich or poor, President or  factory worker--fair. This process has been anything but fair.   For 2 years, we have been told that then-candidate Donald Trump  colluded with Russians to interfere with our elections. Two years and  millions of dollars spent on the Mueller investigation: no collusion.   You would think, after being that wrong, Democrats would finally  decide to work on the problems that the American people sent us here to  do. You would be wrong again.   Then, we were told that the President withheld money to the  Ukrainians in a quid pro quo. No, no, a bribery. No, abuse of power. I  guess whatever polls best--to gather information on a potential  political rival.   Well, here are some facts about what happened:   Fact number one: The transcript of the July 25 phone conversation  that the President released shows no pressure.   Fact number two: President Zelensky did not know the money was  withheld.   Fact number three: No investigation occurred or was announced.   Fact number four: The money was released September 11, 2019.   Facts are stubborn things. One Member on the other side of the aisle  said: ``I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he will  get reelected.'' That, Madam Speaker, says it all.
