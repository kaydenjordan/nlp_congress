 Madam President, yesterday, the Senate was given an  opportunity to begin debate on a subject that by all rights should be  beyond debate: protecting the right to vote.   As we all know, Republican legislatures across the country are  passing some of the most draconian restrictions on the right to vote in  decades--a throwback to Jim Crow.   Every single Democrat yesterday voted to begin debate on legislation  to fight back against this assault--and that is what it is, an assault  on our democracy--every single one. It was the first time in this  Congress that we have united all 50 Democrats on moving forward with  strong and comprehensive voting rights legislation.   Senate Republicans, to the very last Member, voted against allowing  the Senate to even have a debate on voting rights. Not a single  Republican voted to move forward with a simple debate. In fact, the  Republican leader went so far as to say that ``regardless of what may  be happening in some states''--voter suppression laws, phony audits, or  the partisan takeover of election boards--he believes the Federal  Government should not intervene. Who said that? Southern Senators from  the Civil War all the way through said States' rights--used as a tool  to prevent particularly people of color from voting. And to invoke that  in 2020? The majority leader is way off--way off base. It is  disgraceful that he would even invoke that.   Yesterday's vote was another piece of evidence that voter suppression  is now part of the official platform of the Republican Party. But I  want to be clear about one thing. As I said last night, the fight to  protect voting rights is far, very far from over. Yesterday's vote was  the starting gun, not the finish line.   As the Senate majority leader, I reserve the right to bring up this  issue for debate again. Yesterday was the first time we tried to  consider major voting rights legislation, but it won't be the last.  Democrats will explore every option available to us for reconsidering  legislation on this topic. We will leave no stone unturned. Voting  rights are too important. The fight against modern-day voter  suppression is just beginning.   One other point. Some of them like to make this point: Oh, this is  just a partisan fight. Bull. This is a fight for the soul of America,  and it shouldn't be partisan, and it never was in the past. When  legislatures try to prevent poor people, people of color, urban people,  and young people from voting, that is not a political fight; that is  what America is all about. So don't try to hide under that guise.   It is Republican legislatures doing this. But in the past, when  legislatures, usually in the South, tried to do these things--and in  other places--both parties united to stop it. No more, sadly. Shame,  shame, shame, shame on my Republican colleagues. This is a very bad day  for them that history will recognize.  [[Page S4708]]                                ____________________     Madam President, now on another matter, this week, the  Senate will continue restoring balance to the Federal courts by  considering more of President Biden's judicial appointments.   Over the next 2 days, we will consider Deborah Boardman to serve as  district judge in Maryland and Candace Jackson-Akiwumi to serve as  judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Together, Ms. Boardman  and Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi have had over 20 years of experience as Federal  defenders.   I believe that bringing professional diversity as well as personal  diversity to the bench should be and is now a top priority. There are  plenty of former prosecutors and corporate lawyers wearing black robes.  It is time that some voting rights attorneys, civil rights attorneys,  and former Federal defenders, like these two nominees, bring their  perspectives to the bench.   A final vote on Ms. Boardman's nomination will come this afternoon,  and then we will proceed to the nomination of Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi,  which we will finish before the end of the week. Again, the Senate will  not leave for the week until we finish considering these judges. The  Democratic majority in the Senate will continue to swiftly fill  judicial vacancies.   On a related note, today, Chairman Peters will ask the Senate to  approve two critical cyber security nominees: Jen Easterly to be the  Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and  Robin Carnahan to be the Administrator of the GSA. Both of these  Agencies play a critical role in our Nation's cyber security.   The threat of ransomware attacks and other cyber crimes is on the  rise from State actors as well as cyber bandits who were given  sanctuary by our adversaries. We need people at the helm on these  important Agencies to focus on hardening our Nation's cyber security.  This should be a completely nonpartisan issue, and my Republican  friends should not object                            ____________________     Madam President, in addition to our important work on  judicial appointments, the Senate is moving forward on multiple  legislative proposals to make historic investments in our Nation's  infrastructure.   We have a chance in this Congress to get something big and bold done  on infrastructure--something we haven't managed in a very long time. If  we want America to prosper in the 21st century, we can't do it with  infrastructure that is stuck in the last century. This is our chance to  update, modernize, repair, and rebuild for another century of American  economic growth, creating thousands upon thousands of good-paying jobs  in the process.   Later today, Speaker Pelosi and I will meet with representatives from  the White House to discuss the next steps on this very topic. Here in  the Senate, Democratic members of the Budget Committee continue to  build on the fruitful conversations we had last week. In fact, earlier  today, I spoke with all of our committee chairs about a forthcoming  budget resolution.   As I have said, discussions about infrastructure are progressing  along two tracks. The first is bipartisan, and the second incorporates  elements of the President's American jobs and families plan. The second  track is something we must support even if it doesn't get any  Republican support. For several weeks, the trains have been chugging  down both tracks quite well. When the Senate returns after the July 4  work period, it will be time to take the next step forward.   This summer, the Senate will begin considering the fiscal 2022 budget  resolution and a bipartisan infrastructure bill on the floor. It is my  hope to have both a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a budget  resolution for the Senate to consider this summer. I believe the  progress we have made in recent weeks will ultimately produce the  result that will set our economy on a path to prosperity for  generations to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, one final matter: student loans. Today,  I have joined Senator Warren and a number of my House and Senate  colleagues to urge the Biden administration to extend the pause on  payments and interest for the vast majority of Federal student loans.   For millions of student borrowers, one of the most difficult  challenges is balancing their debt with their dreams of starting a  career, starting a family, and buying a home. When the pandemic hit,  these challenges were magnified a hundredfold. Job opportunities  disappeared, and our economy came to a halt. The pause on student loan  repayment during the pandemic was a life-altering policy that allowed  tens of millions of young people to escape financial ruin.   Right now, the current pause on repayment of student debt is set to  expire on September 30. I believe that is too soon. Our economy is  still recovering. Americans are still pulling themselves up and dusting  themselves off after one of the greatest economic crises in our  history. The October 1 expiration date could risk putting millions of  student loan borrowers back into financial hardship.   Very simply, I am urging the Biden administration to extend the pause  on student loan repayment by another 6 months, until March 2022. Even  as the economy recovers, young people, borrowers with a load of debt,  will struggle more than most to get back on their feet. Why not give  them a little more breathing room?   I urge the Biden administration to extend the pause, and I will  continue working with Senator Warren on ways to provide even more  comprehensive, life-changing student loan forgiveness--a policy, I  believe, that will expand opportunity for millions, millions of young  Americans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
