 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the American people are hurting. We are  in the thick of one of the worst national crises in modern memory, and  people's eyes are fixed on Congress. They need the House and the Senate  to stop chasing our tails and make a law.   There are small business employees who have held onto their jobs all  this time because of the Paycheck Protection Program but are facing the  prospect they might be laid off now, with vaccines just around the  corner, because Washington fumbles the ball in the red zone.   There are medically vulnerable Americans who have watched Operation  Warp Speed appear to succeed at a historic pace, but Congress can't  even agree to fully fund the distribution efforts that will get the  vaccines to people.   There are Americans who have been thrown out of work, through no  fault of their own, who are watching Federal aid programs tick toward  expiration in a few weeks, even though neither side in Congress opposes  extending them.   Senate Republicans have made one offer after another after another to  try and make law on all the significant areas where nobody even  disagrees. We spent July, August, September, October, and November  trying different ways to create common ground, but the Speaker of the  House and the Senate Democratic leader have been just as consistent. At  every turn, they have delayed, deflected, moved the goalposts, and made  the huge number of places where Congress agrees into a hostage--into a  hostage--of the few places where we do not agree.   Back in the summertime, I pointed out the obvious. I said leading  Democrats simply just didn't want any more help to reach American  families before the election occurred. The other side claimed great  offense; how insulting to even suggest that such cynicism might be at  play.   And now they are admitting it out loud. Yesterday, on CNN, the  Democratic whip was asked point-blank why the Speaker and the  Democratic leader were so unwilling to play ball back in the autumn.  The No. 2 Democrat responded: ``[Well], there was some exuberance  involved because an election was coming.'' Well, he gets points for  candor: ``because an election was coming.''   A few days ago, Speaker Pelosi told reporters why she reversed months  of  [[Page S7290]]  statements and suddenly began discussing comparatively more reasonable  sums of money. Her answer was simple. She thinks the Presidential  election went the way she wanted. The Speaker of the House views it as  a success that she denied struggling people relief they badly needed  for months because she thinks she got the political result she was  after.   I count no fewer than 10 separate times that top Democrats rejected  or blocked various Republican efforts to jump-start the process, so  here is just a partial sampling.   In July, Republicans sketched a comprehensive plan for safe schools,  jobs, and healthcare. We could have made law in July, but the  Democratic leader wouldn't even engage with it. Just before August,  Republicans tried to at least extend unemployment aid before it  expired. Democrats blocked that as well.   In September, we tried something else: a targeted effort to spend  hundreds of billions of dollars for PPP, vaccine development, and other  priorities. Every Democrat who voted blocked us from even debating it,  and they did it a second time a month later in October.   Last week, after speaking with the administration, I made yet another  overture. The Democratic leader said: No thanks. And just yesterday,  the Speaker and the Democratic leader brushed off two different  overtures in the space of about 2 hours.   I suggested that both sides drop what seemed to be the most  controversial demand in the eyes of our counterparts. Democrats  continued to oppose commonsense legal protections that university  presidents have been begging for, and Republicans see no need to send  huge sums of money to State and local governments whose tax revenues  have actually gone up--gone up.   Negotiating 101 suggests we set those two controversial pieces aside  and plow ahead with a huge pile of things that we agree on, but that  would require both sides to truly want to get an outcome.   Just hours after Democrats poured cold water on that, Secretary  Mnuchin tried another new tack and sent over an offer, and in a bizarre  and schizophrenic press release, the Speaker and the leader said the  administration was obstructing negotiations by negotiating. Two more  brush-offs in about 2 hours. More deflection, more delay, and more  suffering for innocent Americans.   Can anyone point to a single sign--a single sign--from April through  now, that Democratic leaders have seriously wanted another bipartisan  deal to become law? Can anybody name one way--just one--the Democratic  leaders would have behaved differently if their singular goal was to  kill any compromise? That hypothetical world looks suspiciously like  the world we have been living in.   Think of it. We have a Speaker of the House from San Francisco who  has spent months ensuring that unemployed Californians can't have  jobless aid extended and California restaurants can't get another round  of PPP unless the Governor of California gets a Federal slush fund out  of proportion to any proven need.   Do working families agree they should not get any more help  themselves unless the Governors and State legislators get a  controversial bailout? Are struggling Americans saying: Thank goodness  the Democrats are bravely--bravely--blocking help for me and my family  unless my State politicians get some more cash? I would say not.   Our people need more help. There is a huge list of helpful policies  that both sides agree on. This need not be rocket science. But we can't  do a thing unless the Democrats decide they actually want to make a  law.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on another matter entirely. Last  week, the struggle to preserve freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong was  dealt another disturbing blow.   On Thursday, Jimmy Lai, a prominent media figure and pro-democracy  activist, was denied bail. The Chinese Communist Party continues  cracking down on dissent and free speech. Not long ago, the  international community hoped China's modernization would create more  respect for basic freedoms. Unfortunately, the CCP has just marshaled  new tools for making its oppression even more stifling.   Internationally, we have seen the Chinese Communist Party find more  success exporting its warped vision into the global public square than  the free world has had getting Beijing to respect the rules of the  road.   For the last 4 years, thanks to this administration's leadership and  this Senate, we have begun exchanging the old naivete about China for a  smarter and tougher approach. Through new national security and  national defense strategies, the United States has committed to  deterring a new wave of threats from near-peer competitors like China  and Russia.   Reforms to our budgets and policies are underway. We have used NDAAs  and appropriations to invest in a military that is prepared to meet and  defeat these threats. Maintaining our edge will mean sustaining these  reforms, along with strong diplomacy, to counter China's influence.   In coordination with the executive branch, our Intelligence Committee  has highlighted the need for everyone to strengthen their defenses  against the CCP's espionage, intellectual property theft, and political  influence campaigns.   Senators Cornyn and Feinstein, in particular, have led bipartisan  efforts to reform CFIUS and protect against predatory foreign  investments aimed at threatening or stealing high-tech and critical  infrastructure. Allied countries are following our lead, and public and  private sector cooperation has improved to defend the institutions,  alliances, and international order the CCP wants to disrupt.   The administration has worked with international partners to ensure  the security of 5G, reassert freedom of navigation in the South China  Sea, and blunt harmful elements of China's exploitive Belt and Road  Initiative.   Of course, more needs to be done, particularly on human rights. The  treatment of Hongkongers in the spotlight reminds the world of the ways  we know Beijing is treating Uighurs and Tibetans in the shadows.   And if China treats its own citizens with brutal violence, just think  how it plans to treat its neighbors. So I welcome the latest sanctions  imposed by the administration and the latest authorities granted by  Congress. We are raising the stakes for China's repression, but our  work isn't over. Our partners will continue to look to us to lead with  a tone of zero tolerance for this behavior. The United States must  continue to work alongside China's peaceful neighbors and our  democratic allies, like Japan and Australia. We must give voice to  those in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet who have been repressed and  jailed. We must stand against the worst instincts and actions of the  Communist Party.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, last week,  students and families in Kentucky were met with tragic news. On Friday,  Manny Caulk, the superintendent of Fayette County Schools, passed away  unexpectedly.   Manny was the first member of his family to graduate from college. In  2015, he assumed responsibility for the second largest school district  in Kentucky. An education had changed his life, literally, and he  wanted to share that gift with others. And by all accounts, he did just  that.   Manny encouraged his students to aim high and helped them exceed  expectations, starting with his first students in a county detention  center, and, in 2018, his colleagues chose him as Kentucky's  ``Superintendent of the Year.''   I was glad to have Manny's partnership as we worked to protect  Kentucky families from COVID-19. At every step, he kept focused on the  well-being of Lexington students.   Over the weekend, condolences poured in as we reflected on Manny's  lasting contributions. I would like to add the Senate's gratitude for  this top-tier educator. Our prayers are with Manny's wife Christol and  their children at this very difficult time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the conference report to accompany H.R. 6395.    I send a cloture motion to the desk for the conference  report.
