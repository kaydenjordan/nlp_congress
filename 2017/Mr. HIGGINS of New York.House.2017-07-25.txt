 Mr. Speaker, the Servicemen's Readjustment  Act of 1944, also known as the GI Bill, has since provided tens of  millions of returning Active-Duty veterans with help buying a home,  starting a business, and going to college. Also, in addition to doing  the right thing, the GI Bill fundamentally transformed the American  economy from an industrial-based economy to a knowledge-based economy.   I was proud to support H.R. 3218 this week that would renew this  commitment. The bill provides expanded educational benefits for  servicemembers and their families, including the elimination of time  restrictions on education credits for veterans who reenter civilian  life in 2013 or after.   GI benefits should not come with an expiration date. Our veterans  deserve our respect unexpired for their service to our country. This  bill affirms that obligation.                            ____________________
