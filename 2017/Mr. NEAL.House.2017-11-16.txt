 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this is a historic moment, but, most importantly, it is  a missed opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, we are taking the proposal of the Republican Party today  and the financial architecture of our revenue system, based on their  request, to the casino.   Their argument is premised on one thing today, and one thing only.  Maybe. But what about maybe not?   This could have been done between the two parties, as we requested  and wanted to do.   In 1986, 450 witnesses offered testimony on tax reform, thirty  hearings were held, and the Secretary of the Treasury attended most of  them. The two parties found commonality in reaching an accord that was  well received by the American people.   What we are being asked to do here today is to raise taxes on 36  million middle class Americans. The previous speaker, my friend from  California, a quarter of the households in his district claim the State  and local tax deduction, with an average of $10,000 per family.  $10,000. So they are going to tell you today that they are giving you  this and they are giving you that.   Take a look at the distribution tables. That is the most certain  opportunity for people to examine precisely what is in this  legislation.   A gentleman earlier this morning was heralding Alzheimer's month.  They give Alzheimer's a tax during Alzheimer's month. For those who  stay together with loved ones for as long as they can, they need that  deduction that is so important to keeping that family together.   This is the same old, same old. In 2001, tax cuts of $1.3 trillion  all premised on maybe we will have economic growth.   Remember the argument that tax cuts pay for themselves?   Well, they, today, call it dynamic scoring. Now we are being asked  again to premise the argument on maybe there will be enough growth to  generate some return on revenue.   In 2003, another $1.3 trillion in terms of a tax cut was offered with  no or slow economic growth.   And the granddaddy of them all, in 2005, how about repatriation?   Foreign earnings were brought back at 5\1/4\ percent, all based upon  the idea that there was going to be widespread broad-based hiring.  [[Page H9382]]    What did we discover in the aftermath of that?   Almost 20,000 layoffs in the weeks after it. The money was used for  stock buybacks and dividends with no employment gains across the  country.   They keep telling us: Well, you are going to get 3 percent, 4  percent, 5 percent, and the President says 6 percent growth.   I want to find that economist who says we are going to get 6 percent  growth.   Most projections are that we are being asked here today to  participate in the following, because this is the context of the  argument this morning: They are borrowing $2.3 trillion over 10 years  for the purpose of giving a tax cut to people at the very top of our  economic system.   We should be investing in human capital, community colleges,  vocational education, internship programs, and aligning the American  people with the skill sets that are necessary, as the Department of  Labor reported this week, for the 6 million jobs that are available.  That is the most gainful way to do long-term investment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), who has a long and distinguished history in this  Congress and as a member of the Ways and Means Committee.                                time  0930    (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis), who has the highest professional and personal  esteem of every Member of this institution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis), who has the highest professional and personal  esteem of every Member of this institution.    Mr. Speaker, under the Republican tax bill, 570,000  Michigan households earning less than $160,000 a year will see a tax  hike.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson), a thoughtful member of the Ways and Means Committee, whose  admonitions to all of us should be something we could all rally around.    Mr. Speaker, 22,000 constituents of the gentleman from  Miami's district will eventually face the Alzheimer's tax increase that  is included in this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Larson), who is a neighbor, a really nice guy, and a very thoughtful  member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), who is one of the most thoughtful Members of  Congress, a leader in the field of renewable energy, and my friend    Mr. Speaker, 17,000 people in Mr. Hensarling's district  will now pay higher interest on their student loan deductions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Kind), who is a great advocate for the heartland of America.    Mr. Speaker, one-third of the gentleman's constituents  claim the State and local tax deduction, totalling $11,684 per family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a great friend to all of us here in this  institution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), a thoughtful member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional  15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), whose knowledge of new markets tax  credits is second to none in this institution.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record  two letters: one from the National Education Association and one from  the American Council on Education.                                                 November 15, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the three million members       of the National Education Association (NEA), and the 50       million  [[Page H9391]]       students they serve, we urge you to Vote No on the Tax Cuts       and Jobs Act (H.R. 1), a rewrite of the U.S. tax code being       voted on this week. This multi-trillion dollar plan is a tax       giveaway to the wealthiest and corporations paid for on the       backs of working families and students, and jeopardizes the       ability of states and local communities to adequately fund       public schools. Votes associated with this issue may be       included in NEA's Legislative Report Card for the 115th       Congress.        Tax plans reveal the priorities of a nation and in a number       of respects this one tells working and middle-class families,       students, and educators that they must sacrifice in order to       further enrich the wealthy and corporations. We oppose the       bill as currently crafted for several reasons outlined below.     A Giveaway to the Wealthy and Corporations sets up Drastic Cuts to                     Medicaid, Medicare, and Education         Analysis of the Joint Committee on Taxation's estimate of       H.R. 1's impact shows that the bill is overwhelmingly skewed       to the wealthy. Households with annual incomes over $1       million would receive 16 times the percentage increase in       after-tax income as other taxpayers. In addition, 45 percent       of the cost of the bill's tax cuts would go to households       with incomes above $500,000--less than one percent of filers.       Meanwhile, JCT estimates show that taxes would actually       increase for filers with incomes between $20,000 and $40,000       over the life of the bill.        For now, much of the tax cuts will be deficit-financed, but       the budget resolution that helped pave the way for this plan       previews the next phase: future legislation to cut the       growing deficit caused by tax cuts by demanding cuts to       critical services that help working people, children,       seniors, and others--Medicaid, Medicare, education, and more.       In fact, some of this impact will be immediate. According to       the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), without enacting       subsequent legislation, the tax bill will trigger automatic       spending cuts to pay for the tax changes under a ``paygo''       law. The CBO analysis concludes that Medicare would face an       FY18 reduction of $25 billion with a remaining $111 billion       to be sequestered from remaining mandatory programs.        Kansas provides a window into what this approach looks       like. In 2012, the state's former governor pushed through       similar massive tax cuts to individuals and businesses that       allegedly would boost the economy. In reality, Kansas' job       growth was anemic and the governor and legislature starved       state services. Kansas cut funding for public schools,       infrastructure, and other services, and scrambled to close a       $350-million budget deficit. After voters spoke at the ballot       box, lawmakers reversed course, raising taxes and       overriding--in a bipartisan manner--the governor's veto.       Rather than rushing forward with a partisan bill, Congress       would do well to heed the recent lesson from America's       heartland.       Eliminating SALT Deduction is a Tax Increase and Will Devastate                             Education Funding         H.R. 1 would eliminate most of the state and local tax       deduction (SALT)--taking money out of the pockets of as many       44 million middle-class families across the nation. While the       bill hammers middle-class families on this, it oddly       preserves the ability of businesses to deduct state and local       taxes--yet another example of how the bill takes from working       families to provide tax giveaways to those who are wealthier.        Eliminating any part of the state and local tax deduction       could lead to a tax increase on middle class families and       have a negative, ripple effect on the ability of states and       local communities to fund public services, like education.       That could translate into cuts to public schools, lost jobs       to educators, and overcrowded classrooms that deprive       students of one-on-one attention.        NEA conducted a detailed analysis of the plan to eliminate       most of SALT. In total, education funding could take a $250       billion cut over the next 10 years and put up to 250,000       education jobs at risk. It is no secret what is likely to       follow if Congress eliminates SALT. If there is any doubt,       one need only to listen to what far-right groups like ALEC       are saying right now. Their letter about the SALT deduction       lays out their plan--to lobby for lower taxes at the state       and local level. This means even fewer available funds for       students and public education.   Turning Popular 529 College Savings Plan into a Voucher-like scheme for                                the Wealthy         The tax plan distorts a popular education tax program for       middle-class families by creating a voucher scheme with no       income limits that is aimed at benefitting the wealthy to set       aside up to $10,000 annually in a tax-free account for       private school expenses. Both the Heritage Foundation and       Education Secretary Betsy DeVos agree, noting to the       Washington Post that the backdoor voucher plan is ``. . . a       good step forward . . .'' in allowing public dollars to       follow children to private school. Make no mistake. This       poorly veiled voucher program will only benefit the       wealthiest families who can already afford private school       tuition at the expense of our students, communities, and       taxpayers. In the end, no matter what form or name a voucher       program takes, the impact is the same. This risky voucher       program will hurt students and neighborhood schools--where 90       percent of children attend.               Elimination of the modest Educator Tax Deduction         While offering huge giveaways for wealthy individuals and       corporations, the plan inexplicably eliminates the popular       educator tax deduction that allows educators to deduct       eligible unreimbursed out-of-pocket classroom spending--      books, paper, pencils, and art supplies purchased to       supplement meager school budgets--up to $250 annually. The       popular plan made ``permanent'' by Congress just two years       ago, was claimed on 3.7 million tax returns in 2015. Almost       every educator pays out of pocket for school supplies. The       most recent study by the National School Supplies and       Equipment Association (NSSEA) estimated that public school       educators spent $1.6 billion of their own money during the       2012-2013 school year on classroom supplies. An estimated 99       percent of public school teachers spent some amount of money       out of pocket for their classrooms, with typical amounts       ranging from $500-$1,000.                 Making College Even More Costly for Families         The plan also eliminates the student loan interest       deduction. This is bad news for students and families. Under       current rules, borrowers paying off education loans can       annually deduct up to $2,500 of interest paid on student       loans. H.R. 1 essentially raises the long-term cost of       attending college by eliminating the deductions for interest       paid on student loans. According to the IRS, over 12 million       individuals claimed this deduction in 2015. Further, the bill       eliminates a provision that allows universities to waive       tuition for graduate students. Graduate students would be       taxed on the value of that tuition as if it were income,       making it almost impossible for many students to afford       graduate degrees. In a time of rising college costs and       skyrocketing student loan debt, it is unthinkable to take       away provisions that assists students and families struggling       to pay for college.           Eliminating Successful School Construction Bonds Program         The Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) Program has proven       to be an efficient and cost-effective way to help       disadvantaged communities address pressing renovation and       repair needs in schools. Investors receive a federal tax       credit equal to the amount of interest payable on the bonds,       thereby relieving local taxpayers and municipalities of the       interest burden. A school that is awarded a QZAB may use the       funds to renovate and repair buildings, invest in equipment,       and update technology which are all vital to student well-      being and success. Eliminating this program will only ensure       that more and more students will go to school in yesterday's       buildings with out-of-date technology and often unsafe,       crumbling infrastructures.           Putting State and Local Public Pensions Funding at Risk         Section 5001 of H.R. 1 could subject certain investment of       state and local government pension plans to the unrelated       business income tax (UBIT). Investment earnings pay for       approximately two-thirds of state and local government       pension benefits, which are taxed when distributed to       participants. In addition to the revenue lost from the tax       itself, subjecting these pension plans to UBIT could pose       significant and complex compliance costs that could       dramatically affect pension funds. Further, the UBIT will       result in a drag on these critically important investment       returns, sets a dangerous precedent for taxation of state       entities, and will ultimately increase costs to taxpayers.                 Rewriting the Tax Code Should Not be Rushed         In 1986, Congress undertook a yearlong, bipartisan effort       to deliberately and carefully rewrite the tax code. Measured       consideration should again be taken in understanding the       near-term and long-term impacts a tax code rewrite will have       on families, communities, and public services. Instead,       Congressional leadership is rushing the process and putting       forward a bill that further tilts the scale in favor of the       wealthy and corporations, and paid for by working families.       For all of the reasons outlined above, we urge you to Vote No       on H.R. 1.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,      National Education Association.                                   ____                                    American Council on Education,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.      Re Higher Education Provisions in H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and           Jobs Act.       Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Ways and Means Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Ways and Means Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal: On behalf of       the American Council on Education and the undersigned higher       education associations, we write to express grave concerns       with H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.        This legislation, taken in its entirety, would discourage       participation in postsecondary education, make college more       expensive for those who do enroll, and undermine the       financial stability of public and private, two-year and four-      year colleges and universities. According to the Committee on       Ways and Means summary, the bill's provisions would increase       the cost to students attending college by more than $65       billion between 2018 and 2027. This is not in America's       national interest.        It is possible to offer tax relief to hard-working middle-      class and lower-income  [[Page H9392]]       Americans in a way that does not increase college costs and       does not make a quality higher education less accessible. We       are eager to work with Congress to enact such legislation,       but this bill heads in the wrong direction.        Our main objections to the bill are listed below, in the       order in which they appear in the legislation. The order is       not meant to reflect prioritization:        Sec. 1002: Changes to the standardized deduction, which       will reduce charitable contributions to our institutions;        Sec. 1002: Repeal of Lifetime Learning Credit, while not       substantially increasing the American Opportunity Tax Credit       (AOTC);        Sec. 1204: Repeal of the Student Loan Interest Deduction       (SLID);        Sec. 117(d): Repeal of the qualified tuition reduction;        Sec. 127: Repeal of educational assistance program;        Sec. 1303: Changes to the state and local tax (SALT)       deduction, which will reduce state budgets and, in turn,       funding for public higher education;        Sec. 3601: Termination of private activity bonds; and,        Sec. 5103: Creation of a new excise tax on endowments at       private colleges and universities.        Colleges and universities also have a number of concerns       about other provisions that would negatively impact students       by lessening charitable giving, limiting university-industry       partnerships, and compromising educational quality.                    Title I--Tax Reform for Individuals   subtitle a--simplification and reform of rates, standard deduction, and                                 exemptions         Sec. 1002. Enhancement of the standard deduction        Colleges and universities are concerned that doubling the       standard deduction for individuals and couples will reduce       the number of taxpayers who itemize, significantly reducing       the value of the charitable deduction and leading to a drop       in donations to all nonprofits, including colleges and       universities. For private nonprofit and public colleges and       universities, the charitable deduction is vital for       generating private support to higher education institutions       to help achieve their educational missions of teaching,       research, and public service. While the bill preserves a       modest charitable giving incentive, its value would be       significantly curtailed and charitable giving would decline       to all nonprofits, which provide essential services to all       Americans. We are disappointed that the bill did not include       a proposal that would expand the charitable deduction to non-      itemizers, like the universal charitable deduction.        subtitle c--simplification and reform of education incentives         Sec. 1201. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)        H.R. 1 would repeal the Lifetime Learning Credit, while       only expanding AOTC to include a fifth year of reduced       support. This would be a large step backwards, not an       improvement, for many students and their families who benefit       under current law. We appreciate that the bill maintains the       expanded eligible expenses of the AOTC, which includes       required course materials, as well as the current income       thresholds. But we are extremely concerned that the       ``enhanced'' AOTC, as written, would preclude graduate       students, part-time students, lifelong learners (particularly       those seeking retraining), and any student taking longer than       five years to finish their education from accessing the AOTC,       adversely impacting their financial ability to pursue a       degree or lifelong learning. Indeed, under the changes       proposed in the bill, many non-traditional students--the       fastest growing segment of students in higher education--      would lose significant tax benefits they currently rely upon       to help finance their higher education.        Sec. 1204. Repeal of other provisions relating to education        The legislation as written would repeal the current Student       Loan Interest Deduction (SLID). Under current law, any       individual with income up to $80,000 (or $160,000 on a joint       return) repaying student loans can currently deduct up to       $2,500 in student loan interest paid. In 2014, 12 million       taxpayers benefited from SLID. Eliminating this provision       would mean that, over the next decade, the cost of student       loans for borrowers would increase by roughly $13 billion.        H.R. 1 would also repeal two important provisions meant to       exclude tuition waivers and tuition exemptions from income       for campus employees and graduate students.        Section 117(d) permits educational institutions to provide       their employees, spouses, or dependents with tuition       reductions that are excluded from taxable income, helping       them afford a college education and providing an important       benefit to many middle- and lower-income college employees.        Section 117(d)(5) is also an important provision that       reduces the cost of graduate education and mitigates the tax       liability of graduate students teaching and researching as       part of their academic programs. Roughly 145,000 graduate       students received a tuition reduction in 2011-2012. Repeal of       this provision would result in thousands of graduate students       being subjected to a major tax increase. The provision is       also critical to the research endeavor at major universities,       particularly in the crucial science, technology, engineering       and math (STEM) fields. According to data from the Department       of Education, 57 percent of tuition reductions went to       graduate students in STEM programs.        Section 127 allows employers to offer employees up to       $5,250 annually in tuition assistance, which is excluded from       taxable income. This provision has been an important means of       building and adding to the competencies of the workforce and       is a critical tool to help our nation accelerate its economic       growth.        For all of these reasons, we strongly believe that Sections       117(d) and 127 should be preserved.             subtitle d--simplification and reform of deductions         Sec. 1303. Repeal of deduction for certain taxes not paid       or accrued in a trade or business        Changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction will       have a significant negative effect on state budgets, forcing       state governments to make very difficult and harmful funding       decisions. The SALT deduction helps state and local       governments fund public services that provide widely shared       benefits. Limiting the deduction will almost certainly make       it harder for states and localities--many of which already       face serious budget strains--to raise sufficient revenues in       the coming years to fund higher education and other       priorities. There has been a long-term decline in state       support for higher education and cuts to SALT will exacerbate       this problem. Cuts in state support for public higher       education can lead to increased tuition and potentially cuts       to state student financial aid programs, raising the cost of       attending college for students and their families. History       has shown that when states need to make cuts, support for       higher education is often a primary target.                       Title III--Business Tax Reform                           subtitle g--bond reforms         Sec. 3601. Termination of private activity bonds        H.R. 1 would eliminate private activity bonds, which are       used by private nonprofit colleges and universities to       finance capital projects. This repeal would essentially       prevent institutions from using lower-cost tax-exempt bond       financing. Higher borrowing costs can result in diminished       investments in infrastructure, fewer jobs, reduced services,       and increased service charges and other fees to students.                       Title V--Exempt Organizations                           subtitle b--excise taxes         Sec. 5103. Excise tax based on investment income of private       colleges and universities        H.R. 1 fundamentally changes the way nonprofits are treated       by creating a new and unprecedented tax on endowments of some       private colleges and universities. This provision undermines       the very nature of the tax-exempt status of private colleges       and universities. While the new excise tax is currently       focused on private institutions, we strongly oppose this new       excise tax and the precedent it sets for all of higher       education.        Investment income from endowments is used every day to       support nearly every aspect of an institution's operations,       including all the components vital to its mission and the       delivery of a high-quality, affordable education, from       financial aid to research and student retention and success       programs. An endowment is not a single entity that can be       used for any purpose. Rather, it is a permanent investment       fund consisting of often thousands of separate accounts       designed for the needs of the present and the future. Under       H.R. 1 potentially large amounts of endowment dollars would       be redirected to the federal government, taking them away       from providing scholarships to our students and supporting       research and education. It also would effectively be a tax on       donors' contributions and shift money from the dedicated       purpose for the donation. Roughly 160 institutions will       likely be affected by this provision, and we strongly object       to it.        For all of these reasons, we cannot support H.R. 1 and       strongly oppose the proposed changes outlined above.

Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax bill  is a dangerous bill that raises taxes on 36 million middle class  households; takes healthcare from tens of millions of Americans;  skyrockets the cost of health insurance for all Americans, but  especially for those who are sick or have preexisting conditions; and  directly results in cuts to Medicare and safety net spending next  year--all to give corporate special interests immediate, permanent, and  monumental tax cuts.   Cut, cut, cut is all that I have heard this week: cut the safety net;  cut service for the needy; cut service for the physically challenged;  cut the poor; cut the homeless; cut Medicaid; cut education; cut out  low-income tax credits; cut out new market tax credits; cut out social  services; cut block grants; cut student loans.   Winter is here. Cut the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. If  you live in Chicago, Minneapolis, the Midwest, or the Northeast,  without any heat, you are subject to catch pneumonia and die. There is  no doubt about it.   I can imagine that college residents, hospital administrators, and  managers of programs are wringing their hands, wondering what they are  going to do.   I heard a minister last Sunday at one of the churches in my community  asking this, and he said: Pray, organize, vote.   Vote against this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins), one of the most knowledgeable members of the Ways  and Means Committee.   Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, this is nothing more than a hit  job on middle America to pay for a massive tax cut for corporate  America. The only certainty from this charade is slower economic  growth, more income inequality, and exploding budget deficits.   When you take away tax relief from sick people who were born into  illness and for whom insurance doesn't provide enough coverage, that is  a hit on middle America.   When you remove help for people who are just trying to make college  affordable, who are trying to make themselves better, that is a hit on  middle America.                                time  1015    And when you take away healthcare from 13 million Americans and raise  the cost for millions more because you needed another $300 billion to  give more to corporate America, that is a hit on middle America.   And when 152,000 people from my community and millions more from New  York lose 100 years of protection from State and local taxes,  protection worth more than $8,000 per household, that is a hit on my  community, it is a hit on New York State, and it is a hit on each and  every community in America.   And when you take away the essential needs of middle America to feed  the rapacious needs of corporate America, it is a hit on fundamental  fairness, and that, Mr. Speaker, is a hit on all of America.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), a very successful businesswomen in her own  right, who understands the modern economy.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, in this Ryan-McConnell tax bill,  Republicans are touting the largest set of corporate tax cuts in our  country's history. They are raving that their corporate cuts will  create jobs, even though we know that trickle-down economics has never  worked and never will.   Instead of bringing Democrats and the public into the process,  Republicans have made the most cynical tradeoffs, only hurting people  who need help the most.   This is wrong. Tax reform should be about coming together and making  choices that reflect our values.   Yet, under this plan, teachers, who buy supplies for their students,  like pens, pencils, and paper, will lose the ability to deduct those  costs from their tax returns, but corporations still can deduct supply  costs.   Firefighters will no longer be able to deduct their State and local  income or sales taxes, but corporations still can.   Homeowners will no longer be able to deduct all of their property  taxes, but corporations still can.   And if workers have to move because their employer is forcing them to  relocate their families or lose their jobs, they will no longer be able  to deduct their moving expenses, but corporations, even those  offshoring jobs, still can.   This bill increases taxes on 36 million working families and rips  away key lifelines that help people struggling with long-term illness,  childcare, and education expenses. It blows a $1.5 trillion hole in the  deficit and burdens our children and grandchildren with debt,  triggering an automatic $25 billion cut to Medicare. This bill gives  massive permanent tax cuts to corporations,  [[Page H9394]]  but working families will have to live with the temporary scraps thrown  at them.   Bottom line: this bill hurts Americans from cradle to retirement, and  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have Mr. Kelly--as he  describes sports teams, we discovered he is a closet Patriots fan.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Judy Chu), whose history, in terms of revenue and revenue  collection, is well known to the Congress.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, one thing is clear about the  GOP tax scam: corporate interests get a huge giveaway. They get a  windfall tax break. Who pays for it? The middle class. Who wins?  Corporations, billionaires, millionaires, the Trump family. Who loses?  Women, families, seniors, teachers, students.   As a former Los Angeles Community College teacher of 20 years, I  can't believe what Republicans are doing to students. They rip away  critical benefits that help our students pay for their college  education. They eliminate the student loan interest deductions and  choose to tax graduate students on money they have never even received  by taxing the tuition assistance they get for working for their  schools.   This bill even pinches students when they are still in elementary  school by taxing their teachers who claim a deduction for the school  supplies they pay for out of their own paycheck. One teacher in my area  even pays for the ink in her classroom printer. They don't ask to be  repaid, just to be able to deduct the expense.   If corporations get to keep this deduction, why not our teachers? And  then if that is not cruel enough, they eliminate the deduction for  extraordinary medical expenses for those with Alzheimer's and cancer.  And this week we learn that Republicans plan to pay for these corporate  cuts by causing 13 million people to lose their health insurance, a  move that will increase premiums by 10 percent and result in  individuals with preexisting conditions losing access to lifesaving  affordable coverage.   Then Republicans eliminate the State and local ta deduction, which is  used by over 6 million California households, to prevent their hard- earned dollars from being taxed twice. Of all the States, Californians  will actually face the largest net tax increase  [[Page H9395]]  from this bill of $12.1 billion in 2027 alone.    California Republicans who vote for this bill ought to be ashamed of  themselves, and the voters need to hold them accountable. Thirty-six  million middle class families will be stuck holding the bag under this  plan. For what? For tax cuts for corporate interests. This is  unacceptable.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), a Marshall Scholar and attorney.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), a Marshall Scholar and attorney.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Lewis) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. LEWIS of Georgia asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and  one of the most knowledgeable Members of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan).  [[Page H9400]]        Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, this bill put forward  by congressional Republicans isn't a tax plan; it is a tax scam.   Republicans are going to borrow money on the backs of working  families to give a tax cut to corporations in the top 1 percent. This  will increase taxes on the middle class. This will add to our Nation's  debt and pass the bill to our children.   This Republican tax scam hurts seniors and families with long-term  medical needs by eliminating the medical expense deduction that 9  million Americans, and nearly 120,000 people in my home State of New  Mexico, depend upon.    Destroying the medical expense deduction delivers a staggering blow  to New Mexico families. Listen to this story sent to me by Lisa, a  constituent of mine from northern New Mexico:   ``My husband and I are lifelong native New Mexicans who grew up here,  went to college here, and have opened and operate our two businesses in  our home State. We are the proud parents of two wonderful children. New  Mexico's our home, and we're proud to live here, contribute to our  State's economy, and realize our version of the American Dream.   ``Like most families today, life isn't always easy. The kids and I  have medically complex conditions which require expensive medications,  and my husband and I struggle with student loan debt, housing and  transportation costs, and making a good life for our family. We incur  $5,000 to $7,000 in out-of-pocket medical costs each year. Without the  medical expense deductions, I am not sure we could continue to meet the  demands of raising healthy, happy children while keeping our businesses  going and growing.   ``For us, this deduction is a lifeline, and the thought of losing  that lifeline means we could drown in debt. That's not the American  Dream--that's a nightmare.''   This is real and this is personal to people all across the country.  Let's vote this bill down today, come back, work in a bipartisan  fashion, work with our ranking member, Mr. Richard Neal, and come up  with real tax reform that puts American working families first.   Mr. Speaker, let's do the right thing today and put hardworking  families first with our decision today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), a very thoughtful member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), and I ask unanimous consent  that he may control that time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, as we wind down this debate on tax reform or, what we  should really call it, tax cut, I think that we should tabulate this as  a missed opportunity. This could have  [[Page H9406]]  been done between the two parties. Instead, much of this was  constructed without any Democratic input.   Reminder: In 1986, the historic Tax Reform Act included President  Reagan and Speaker O'Neill, Chairman Rostenkowski, Dick Gephardt, and  Bill Bradley. In this instance here, 32 years later, not one hearing  was held on this tax bill that is about to be voted on in the next 45  minutes.   The significance of that is that there was never any back-and-forth,  and in 1986, expert testimony was sought from 450 witnesses. We had not  one witness who commented on the legislation.   It has been advertised as a middle class tax cut. Wait until you get  the bill. How can you say that this is a middle class tax cut and  compare that to repeal of the estate tax?   How many middle class people in America pay the estate tax?   That is how many people pay the estate tax. No middle class American  pays the estate tax. There is no such thing as a death tax, in addition  to which a middle class tax cut is described as doing away with the  alternative minimum tax. 4.5 million families pay an alternative  minimum tax in America. That is it.   I fixed the problem years ago for the middle class, and 27 million  people stopped paying AMT. So now we are down to people at the very  top.   So how are we paying for this? Or how are they paying for it, better,  because they are not going to get much help on this side?   Well, they decided that that teacher who used to have $250, that they  could deduct on their income taxes, that is going to be abolished.   So if you have Alzheimer's and you exceed the 10 percent number in  terms of cost in your healthcare for caring for that loved one at home  who is sick or has dementia, that is how they are going to pay for the  tax cut. They are going to take that away.   State and local property taxes, they are going to take that away--the  deduction. They are going to pare back the mortgage interest tax  deduction. All of this advertised on the basis of a middle class tax  cut?   People at the bottom end are not going to get much from this tax cut.  I want to take you back again, as I have repeatedly, because I have  cast three great votes in this House during my 29 years: against the  Iraq war, and there weren't many of us; against the cuts in 2001; and  against the tax system in 2003; all advertised as progrowth economics.   There was no economic growth in the tax cuts of 2001, which totaled,  by the way, $1.3 trillion. For people who said at the time, ``everybody  gets a tax cut,'' they were correct. Then you looked at the  distribution tables to see what people got at the top and then what  people got at the bottom. Then we came back in 2003 and cut another  trillion dollars in taxes--advertises progrowth economics--zippo growth  occurred.   Then, by the way, the granddaddy of them all: How about repatriation.  Repatriation, bringing back those earnings to the United States for  investment in job growth, at, by the way, 5\1/4\ was the tax burden  they carried, all based on job growth. It was for stock buybacks,  dividends, and layoffs.   We had a chance here to do something historic. We had a chance here  in this debate and discussion because there is a genuine affability on  that committee. We had this opportunity to take the Tax Code and  transform it for the gig economy in the modern age. We didn't do that,  though. Four days we had to examine this tax proposal with no hearings.  Not one chance for a Democratic amendment to proceed.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, let me acknowledge the support of the Democratic staff  that are here as well: Kara Getz, Karen McAfee, Aruna Kalyanam, Peg  McGlinch, Deva Kyle, Ji Prichard, and Suzanne Walsh. They did a  magnificent job as well, and we are much dependent on the good staff  work, particularly, on the Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I spoke earlier of the missed opportunity that we have  here. We have a real problem in America with labor participation rates.  Six million job go unanswered every day now in America, 18,000  precision manufacturing jobs in New England, and 1 million tech jobs,  because skill sets don't align with the job opportunities that are out  there.    Two million Americans sit home with opioid addictions who should be  in the workforce. This was a chance to invest in human capital as well,  to invest in our community colleges, to invest in apprenticeship  programs. Yes, the other challenge that we have in America is, clearly,  to invest in vocational education for many of the jobs that are  available.   Instead, we pushed that off to the side and decided that, once again,  if we just had tax cuts, all of these challenges and problems would go  away.   The idea of investing in the human side of American opportunity is  then  [[Page H9407]]  people do what we would like them to do in terms of home buying,  raising families, caring for neighborhoods, and practicing the art form  of citizenship.   Once again, what we are witnessing today--and we need to be alarmed  about it--is the greater and greater conservation of wealth in America.  Now, I understand it is complicated. It has to do much with technology  and globalization, but it is also about the gig economy, and we, today,  reward capital more than we reward labor.   When we get done, if they are successful on the other side, we are  going to further concentrate wealth amongst those few families in  America. We serve here in the House of Representatives, not in the  House of Lords. This is not about peerage, where you are entitled to a  seat in this House of Representatives. That is what is wrong. That is  what Jefferson and Madison envisioned when they signed those bonds of  the Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution to break  with Europe. We don't practice divine right here.   I wish the outcome here today, Mr. Speaker, would have been more  genuine and it would have been different.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), a very capable legislator, the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), a very capable legislator, the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the very capable Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on passage of the bill will be followed by a 5-minute vote  on suspending the rules and passing H.R. 3109, if ordered.
