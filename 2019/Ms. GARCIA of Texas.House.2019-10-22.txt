 Madam Speaker, our democracy is under attack. In  2016, Russia engaged in misinformation campaigns aimed at influencing  our election results. Earlier this month, the Senate Intelligence  Committee released a report that warns that these campaigns could  evolve, intensify, and inspire other bad actors to make similar  attempts in 2020.   Just yesterday, Facebook reported it shut down new accounts linked to  Iran and Russia that are trying to influence our elections next year.  Each and every one of us swore an oath to uphold and defend our  Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.   Now is the time to live up to that oath. No foreign government can be  allowed to jeopardize the future of our democracy. I, therefore, ask  each and every one of you today, what will you do to defend our  democracy?                            ____________________
