 Mr. Speaker, this Black History Month, I ask my colleagues  to join efforts to illuminate the legacy of a true American hero, the  late Major League Baseball All-Star center fielder Curt Flood.   In addition to 12 stellar seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, Curt  Flood struck a blow for dignity and civil rights by challenging a rule  which allowed players to be traded against their will.   He noted in his refusal: ``After 12 years in the major leagues, I do  not feel I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of  my wishes. I believe that any system which produces that result  violates my basic rights as a citizen and is inconsistent with the laws  of the United States.''   My great friend Congressman Trone and I are asking Members to join in  a letter supporting the induction of Curt Flood into the Baseball Hall  of Fame.   Flood's struggles might have ended his career, but he blazed a trail  for the rights enjoyed by players today. It is this type of leadership  and lasting contribution we recognize this Black History Month.                            ____________________
