 Madam Speaker, ironically, it was my bill, the Election  Reform Act of 2001--after the closest Presidential election in history,  decided by about 350 votes--and my Election Reform Act, after all that  hostility, passed 38-2 in the Senate and 120-0 in the Florida House,  and that is how election reform bills should pass. If they don't pass  with an overwhelming majority of both sides, they are not fair and they  shouldn't be enforced.   Americans are feeling the rise in prices at the gas pump and in our  grocery stores. Favorite products are in short supply, and some are  even not available. To make matters worse, they are discovering that  the resolution before us is full of wasteful spending and big tax  increases.   The administration only responds to our economic crisis by making  excuses and pointing fingers. Claiming supply chain disruptions and  inflation are just high-class problems is incredibly wrong.   Madam Speaker, you can call it what you want on TV, but at the end of  the day, it is just, plain and simple, bad policy. All this resolution  does that we are asked to vote for is to green-light more of it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  resolution.
