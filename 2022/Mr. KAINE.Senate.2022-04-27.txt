 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Too Narrow to  Succeed Act with my colleagues Senators Booker, Murray, and Menendez.  Enacting this bill would increase opportunities for women- and  minority-owned asset management firms to direct investments and  strengthen our Nation's retirement security.   Women- and minority-owned firms are significantly underrepresented in  asset management, managing just over 1 percent of the sector's assets  under management. This severe underrepresentation also extends to  employment within the industry. This is not due to a lack of diverse  talent; women- and minority-owned asset management firms have  consistently performed just as well as or better than other firms in  terms of returns on investment. In fact, women- and minority-owned  firms are overrepresented among top-performing firms.   Having a diverse portfolio is a key part of having healthy finances  because diversifying investments mitigates risk and improves long-term  returns. Far too often, however, those making investment decisions at  our Nation's financial firms are not diverse. If asset managers have  too narrow a perspective, the/place the financial success of their  clients at risk. This commonsense legislation supports asset managers'  fiduciary responsibility to deliver returns to investors, and it will  help ensure a safe financial future for workers and their families.   I hope my colleagues will support this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Too Narrow to  Succeed Act with my colleagues Senators Booker, Murray, and Menendez.
