 Mr. Speaker, my commitment to supporting veterans  suffering from toxic exposures has been ironclad since I first met the  late Michael Lecik, a father, a husband, a firefighter, and a veteran  who died of cancer related to his exposures.   It continued when I met Gillie Jenkins, an atomic war veteran from  Chesterfield, Virginia, who in his 90s is still fighting for the  recognition of his brothers in arms and the sacrifices that they made.   Today, when I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 3967, I am  doing so inspired by William G. Collins, a veteran from Louisa County,  Virginia. My amendment would require the VA to investigate the long- term health impacts of jet fuel exposures on our country's  servicemembers.   Mr. Collins, a veteran from Louisa County, Virginia, is living with  Parkinson's. As a former Air Force crew fire chief, his years of  constant exposure to jet fuel put him at risk, but now the VA does not  recognize Mr. Collins' condition as having a service connection. Mr.  Collins served honorably, and he should know that his country has his  back.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment would bring us one step closer to ensure  that veterans like William have the healthcare benefits they deserve  and the acknowledgment of their sacrifice.   Mr. Collins says, ``This disease has impacted my health, my economic  security, and potentially my wife and I's dream of spending our last  years on our beloved farm where we raised our family.''   Mr. Speaker, today I urge my colleagues to support this long overdue  amendment as we support all of our Nation's veterans.
