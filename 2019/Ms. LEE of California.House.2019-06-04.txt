 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, but I also want to thank her for her tireless and  longstanding steadiness and leadership in support of our Dreamers.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, which ensures the  Dreamers, temporary protected status recipients, and individuals with  deferred enforcement departure status are protected from deportation.  This bill will also establish a path for 2.5 million people to become  lawful permanent residents.   These young people have lived in the United States for decades and  have made a life for themselves and for their families.   Now, let me be clear. Dreamers, TPS, and DED recipients make our  Nation better. They are active members of our community and contribute  to our economy and make America a stronger nation.   I am so proud to represent so many Dreamers in my district. They are  American in every way except on paper, and it is beyond cruel to deport  them to countries many of them barely know.   By passing this bill today, House Democrats are maintaining the  promise of the American Dream to immigrants around the country.   It is time to protect our young people, recognize their love for  America, and finally help their dreams come true.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 6.
