 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the National  Alliance on Mental Illness and to show support for my community and the  millions of Americans living with a mental illness.   This weekend, I marched in the NAMI Walk to help raise awareness. I  was inspired to hear the brave stories of so many survivors who have  not given up on their mental wellness.   Before the Affordable Care Act was enacted, mental health coverage  was lacking or missing altogether from most health plans. Medicaid  expansion, a cornerstone of the ACA, has dramatically expanded access  to treatment in many States, including Arizona.   But the Trump administration is again trying to eliminate the ACA and  remove protections for people with mental illness and preexisting  conditions.   Republicans have no health plan other than fighting to take away  America's healthcare. We must raise our voices and reject this again.  We must fight for our healthcare and the coverage that treats our most  vulnerable communities.                            ____________________
