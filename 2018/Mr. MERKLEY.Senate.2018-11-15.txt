 Mr. President, today, we honor and celebrate Joan  Middleton's commendable service to the Senate Employees' Child Care  Center. On September 30, 2018, Ms. Middleton retired from the Center,  where she worked as a floater assistant teacher for no less than 32  years. She was an admired and respected member of the Senate Employees'  Child Care Center Team, her devotion to which was only rivaled by her  love for the Washington Redskins.   Ms. Middleton carried important responsibilities at the center,  including regularly assisting in each and every classroom, as well as  supervising and closing the center each evening. She not only took  these responsibilities seriously, but went well beyond the essential  tasks of her post. Her deep care for the community was palpable, as was  evidenced by her consistent, inclusive, and thoughtful leadership.   Without a doubt, Ms. Middleton played an integral role in each  student and faculty member's day. For the students, she prepared snacks  and lunches every day. All faculty went to her for anything from a  ballpoint pen to a safety pin, garnering her the name ``Ms. Resource''  among her colleagues. Whenever anyone had forgotten where to find  something or where it belonged, Ms. Middleton knew.   For over three decades, Ms. Middleton was a compassionate adviser who  shared her wisdom with the many faculty members she took the time to  mentor. While her invaluable institutional knowledge will be missed in  her absence, her kind, diligent commitment to the center will live on  through those members she guided throughout her tenure. The Senate  Employees' Child Care center is deeply grateful for Ms. Middleton for  all the positive ways she shaped the Center and enriched the lives of  its students over these past 32 years.                            ____________________
