 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3293 and ask  that it be reported by number. This is an amendment by Shelby, Inhofe,  Wicker, and others, dealing with defense infrastructure.    Mr. President, this amendment provides $50.2 billion to  meet defense infrastructure needs across this Nation. I believe we need  to modernize our shipyards, our test ranges, our depots, ammunition  plants, install 5G technology at military bases, support our nuclear  defense infrastructure, and so much more.   These infrastructure projects are absolutely critical to our national  security. They impact millions of jobs across the country, both  military and civilian. We are talking about projects not just in my  home State of Alabama but in Arizona, Georgia, Virginia, Rhode Island,  Connecticut, Maine, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico,  and many more--actually, all of us.   My Democratic colleagues inexplicably blocked a vote on a related  amendment in the infrastructure bill that just passed the Senate. Now  it is time, I believe, to stand up and be counted for America, for  national security.   Will my Democratic colleagues now support this multitrillion-dollar  social spending binge while continuing to turn a blind eye to the  military infrastructure needs in their own States? I certainly hope  not.   This reflected neglect of our national security and the millions of  jobs that support it is reckless. It must stop. I urge my colleagues to  support our military and vote yes on this amendment.
