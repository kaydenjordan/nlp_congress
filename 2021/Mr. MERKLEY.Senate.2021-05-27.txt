 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to support amendment No. 2103,  which addresses a very important issue in the world, which is the issue  of governments that undertake to destroy populations, either in other  countries or within their own country; that is, to commit genocide.   Now, this topic comes up because China is committing genocide against  its own Uighur population--a million Uighurs who are enslaved, who are  trapped, who are assaulted in every possible way by the official  authorities operating out of Beijing.   The finding of genocide is one that the State Department takes very  seriously. It involves long investigations, collection of evidence,  analysis. It is not something to say lightly. But we now have two  Secretaries of State who have led our State Department through this  process and reached the same conclusion--Secretary Pompeo, under  President Trump, and Secretary Blinken, under President Biden. And both  find that this is, in fact, genocide.   Now, at this very moment, athletes are preparing to compete in the  Olympic Games in China, and I find it horrific that the prestige of the  Games is going to be carried on for a country that is committing  genocide.   Now, we have a Commission that works on human rights issues, known as  the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and it hauls a whole  team of experts who work to analyze human rights issues. This  commission, which is bipartisan and bicameral and includes executive  branch appointees, when they are actually appointed, has held a  hearing.   At that hearing, various experts came and testified on what China is  doing. It reinforced what the Secretary of State under our former  President and the Secretary of State under our current President found:  Genocide is being conducted by the government in China against the  Uighur population   And that is not all China is doing. There are other afflicted groups  that it is assaulting. In addition, it has proceeded to start stripping  the political rights of the people of Hong Kong.   It is very much in the news. We have seen the citizens protesting in  the streets, hundreds of thousands, saying: China, honor the commitment  you made when Britain transferred Hong Kong back under a 50-year  agreement to China.   And China has not honored that agreement.   Now, China, when it was awarded the Games back in 2015 to be held in  2022--7 years in advance--made human rights promises to the  International Olympic Committee--promises that have not been upheld. In  fact, during those years, China has become an even worse violator of  human rights in Hong Kong, in Xinjiang, and in other ethnic areas,  including Tibet.   So we have echoes of 1936--the year the summer Olympics were held in  Germany and Hitler was in charge. He used those Olympic Games to shine  prestige on his country and to essentially help distract enormously  from his already horrific actions against Jewish Germans and other  groups within Germany.   So how is it here, nearly a century later, that, again, the Olympics  are going to be used to shine a little bit of light and a lot of  prestige on a country engaged in genocide?   I want to compliment my colleague Senator Romney of Utah. He has  placed in the underlying bill, as it came out of the Foreign Relations  Committee, a provision that says: When the Olympics are held, there  should be a diplomatic boycott to protest and draw attention to this  egregious situation. I hope, also, that the sponsors of those games  will start to withdraw their sponsorships.   Now, my friend and colleague Senator Romney is an expert on the  Olympic Games because he organized the Olympic Games in Utah. Nobody in  America probably knows more about what it takes to prepare for them.  And it is not, at this moment, possible for the structure that has been  established to host the athletes to be redone and to pivot for just  next year, which I find unfortunate, but I understand the point.   So let's do this together. Let's send a strong message to the Olympic  Committee, the IOC, that never again should they allow a country to  host the Olympic Games that is engaged in genocide. This should be a  message that every American can say together--that never should a  country be given the prestige of hosting the games when they are  committing genocide. Never should a country be able to host the games  when it is something like what China is doing to the Uighur  population--enslaving them, stripping them of their dignity, their  autonomy, their culture, controlling them in every way, enslaving them.  Never again should the Games be able to be hosted by a country like  China that is restricting the political rights of Hong Kong--what China  is doing, stripping the freedom of speech, stripping the freedom of  assembly, and breaking the deal that it signed when the deal was struck  with Britain for the return of Hong Kong.   So this amendment, cosponsored by Senator Rubio, who is the cochair  in the Senate of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China;  cosponsored by Senator Romney, who knows more about the Olympic Games  than anybody else in this country; cosponsored by Senator Young, who  has been a terrific champion against the abuse of citizens in Yemen and  the abuse of citizens in Burma--let's adopt this amendment as part of  this package while we are on the topic of China, while we are on the  topic of trade.   Let's not let this moment bypass us without saying with a unified  voice that this is wrong, and that the Olympics, which were designed to  lift up the human spirit, to celebrate the best of competition, to have  kind of the thrills and the agonies of victory and defeat--that never  should the Games, the focal point of world attention, be hosted by a  country that is committing genocide.   Thank you.    Mr. President, last September, the Echo Mountain  Complex Fire swept through Lincoln County in my home State of Oregon.  Nearly 300 homes were destroyed. At least 50 other buildings and  structures were burned as well. In just a few days, the lives that  residents spent decades building literally went up in smoke. These  devastated families began looking around for help--for safety and  security; for support getting back on their feet and rebuilding their  lives. And they quickly found that help coming from the Confederated  Tribes of Siletz Indians.  [[Page S3890]]    Even as the fire raged and families raced out of its path, leaving  their homes and belongings behind, the Siletz worked with the Red Cross  to open the doors of the Chinook Winds Casino to provide shelter and  safety for their displaced neighbors in need. Sadly that safety and  security provided by the Siletz was short lived as the casino itself  was forced to be evacuated as the fire made its way dangerously close.  And with the loss of power and phones lines and people in their cars on  the way to the casino while others were leaving, it was hard getting  any clear information. How harrowing it must have been for all those  who believed they had escaped the worst, only to be forced once more to  run from the path of an oncoming inferno. But the Tribe used the  casino's shuttles to bring evacuees to the Newport Red Cross site,  while staff volunteered to help deliver meals to those in need.   Fortunately, the casino was not damaged, and everyone who was there  made it to safety. And after the fire subsided, leaving a path of  destruction in its wake, the doors of Chinook Winds and its hotel were  once again opened to those in need. Families and members of the  community who could not be in their homes--whether because those homes  were completed gone or damage to roofs and other parts made them  unlivable--were able to stay for up to 3 months at no cost to  themselves until they could return to their own houses or found a new  permanent living situation.   But all these months later, many Oregonians impacted by the Echo  Mountain Complex Fire are still struggling to rebuild their lives. Many  still don't have a place to call home. Fortunately, they once again  have the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians looking out for and  working with them, in partnership with FEMA, to get them back on their  feet.   Since March, the Tribe has been hosting FEMA provided trailers on  their lands to house Oregonians impacted by the fire until they can  find permanent housing--something that could take anywhere from 18 to  24 months in this part of the State that continues to struggle with a  shortage of affordable housing.   This is the first time in Oregon's history and potentially in the  history of the whole country that FEMA has partnered with the  leadership of a Tribe to host housing units on Tribal lands. FEMA was  originally working with Lincoln County and Lincoln City to put these  homes on another site, but that effort was stalled when the Agency  found several problems with the site. Hearing about the problems and  recognizing the urgent need to get roofs over the heads of these  families, the Siletz jumped at the chance to help out.   Thanks to the partnership between the Tribe's leaders, FEMA, Lincoln  City, which had to change a zoning law to help make it happen, and  Siletz Tribal Business Corporation staff, this project was developed  and completed in record time--a testament not only to the real need for  this help but to everyone's commitment to making it happen. And today,  all 25 trailers are fully occupied, and the people living there have  developed their own little community to support one another.   We all owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the Confederated  Tribes of Siletz Indians for not only opening their doors and helping  those in need in the middle of two crises--the pandemic and the Echo  Mountain Complex Fire--but for continuing to step up and help their  neighbors in need all these months later. It really speaks to the  spirit of the Tribe and to the entire Oregon community to see that,  when times get tough and people are in need of help, they can count on  others to be there for them.                            ____________________
