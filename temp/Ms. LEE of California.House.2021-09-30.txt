 Madam Speaker, I thank Chair DeLauro for her  tremendous leadership, as well as our Speaker, for ensuring that our  government stays open and responds to key emergencies here at home and  abroad.   It is really a shame that we have to vote on this measure here today  a second time with the end of the fiscal year looming because of the  refusal of Senate Republicans to protect the full faith and credit of  the Federal Treasury.   Nonetheless, we must get this bill done and to the President's desk  today. This bill contains crucial funding for my State in the West, our  Western communities that have been so badly impacted by wildfires. In  California, we are on the front lines of this climate emergency.   This bill includes $28.6 billion to directly address the rising cost  of climate change. Californians have lost homes, crops, livelihoods,  and even lives because of the climate crisis. We need to get them this  urgent help right away.   As chair of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Subcommittee, I am really pleased that this legislation  also includes over $6.3 billion to continue support for Afghan  evacuees, refugees, and the growing humanitarian needs of the Afghan  people.   At least 18.4 million people in Afghanistan require humanitarian  assistance due to the conflict, severe drought, and the COVID pandemic.  President Biden was right to end our war in Afghanistan. Now we have a  moral responsibility to provide safe harbor for vulnerable Afghans who  fear for their lives, but to also provide humanitarian assistance to  those suffering inside Afghanistan.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.
