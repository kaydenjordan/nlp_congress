 Madam President.    Madam President, I would like to direct a question to the  junior Senator from Oregon through the Chair.   I thank both my colleagues from Oregon. I especially thank my  colleague Senator Merkley, who contacted me last weekend when the  situation was unfolding in Portland and talked to me about his reaction  to it and what he was hearing from the people of the State he  represents.   Of course, there was genuine concern in the city of Chicago, which I  am honored to represent, because this President in the White House had  been taking swipes at that city for years now, and we fully anticipated  that the atrocity that was occurring in Portland could occur in Chicago  as well.   I just want to say to the Senator from Oregon: Thank you for your  leadership on this. Thank you for bringing this issue to the floor and  to the floor of the Senate.   This is an issue we should be voting on. We should have voted on it  this week. There was no excuse for it. We have risen to the occasion  before when a historic occurrence brings to our attention that the  Senate should speak and express itself. We should have done it this  week on the issue that you brought, and I hope we can resort to this  issue quickly--if not today, as quickly as possible afterward.   I am a cosponsor of the legislation the Senator is offering, and it  is basic. It is fundamental. As I recall, and I will ask the Senator  from Oregon, what you are asking for is, if the Federal Government is  going to send out the so-called law enforcement protective forces and  such, that they identify themselves and that they not come into a  community anonymously, without any indication of who they are.   I am reminded of the Russian invasion of Ukraine--eastern portions of  Ukraine, the Donetsk region--and Vladimir Putin was very careful that  his invaders not wear Russian uniforms. They were known as little green  men. We have a comparable situation here where the Federal forces are  not identifying the agencies they represent but coming to the streets  of Portland in camouflage.   The Senator from Oregon, I would like you to please, if you would,  respond. Has this not been the case? Has this been documented?  [[Page S4441]]         I would like to ask another question through the Chair to  the Senator from Oregon.   Is it not also true that many of these Federal agencies have defined  responsibilities and defined areas of jurisdiction? For example, in the  city of Chicago, as probably is the case in Portland, OR, there is a  Federal protective service that has a specific building and facility  and personnel in that facility that they are responsible for. Is that  not the case in Oregon?    And in this situation, have these Federal agents of some  different agency or whatever extended their reach of jurisdiction  beyond that Federal protective facility?    How far?    Directing another question to the Senator through the  Chair.   What has been the coordination of this Federal activity with local  and State law enforcement in Portland, OR?    Well, I don't know if I am on my own time at this moment  or----    Fine. So I will still continue, without objection, with  colloquy between myself and the junior Senator from Oregon.   Let me say to the Senator that we were concerned at the beginning of  this week, because of your experience, with what might happen in the  city of Chicago. Senator Duckworth and I sent a letter to the President  of the United States expressing that concern.   I ask unanimous consent that the letter dated July 21, 2020, to  President Trump, along with the press release dated July 22, 2020,  describing its contents, be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, July 21, 2020.      President Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Trump: You have indicated that you may send       additional federal agents to the City of Chicago to conduct       policing activities that traditionally are handled by local       law enforcement. We strongly urge you to refrain from taking       this action, which is opposed by Governor Pritzker, Mayor       Lightfoot and other local leaders. This week, we introduced       legislation with other Senate Democrats to prevent you from       overriding local authorities in this manner.        Any involvement by federal law enforcement in community       policing activity must be conducted in coordination with, and       with the approval of, local officials. In this time of       heightened tension, we cannot have federal law enforcement       operating at cross-purposes with local leaders.        In recent days, your Administration has deployed federal       law enforcement agents in the streets of Portland, Oregon,       without any visible identifying information. These federal       agents have reportedly used excessive force against peaceful       protestors and detained residents in unmarked vehicles. Such       conduct is unacceptable anywhere in the United States and       must not happen in the Chicagoland area.        On February 10, 2017, we sent you a letter suggesting a       range of ways in which the federal government could play a       helpful and supportive role in reducing violence in Chicago.       We noted that ``[p]ublic safety is primarily a local       responsibility, but the federal government must be an engaged       partner in public safety efforts alongside local officials,       law enforcement, and community stakeholders.'' We recommended       that your Administration take steps to assist local violence       prevention efforts, including:        Enhancing Department of Justice (DOJ) programs that improve       community policing;        Directing DOJ to promote mentoring and job training       programs for youth and formerly incarcerated individuals;        Improving mentoring and violence prevention initiatives and       boosting funding for recidivism reduction programs;        Directing DOJ to abide by its commitment to help implement       policing reforms recommended by the Department's Civil Rights       Division;        Closing gaps in the FBI gun background check system and in       federal firearm laws that enable straw purchasers and gun       traffickers to flood Chicago's streets with illicit guns;        Prioritizing career and youth training programs to address       lack of economic opportunity in neighborhoods hit hard by       violence; and        Redirecting resources that you are devoting to construction       of your border wall and committing those resources instead to       the efforts discussed above.        It has been more than three years since then, and you have       not replied to our letter nor followed through with our       suggestions. We reiterate that these steps would be more       effective in reducing violence in Chicago than replicating       the destabilizing role that you have directed federal law       enforcement to play in Portland.        With the right leadership, federal law enforcement can       serve as valuable partners in supporting local efforts and       helping reduce violence in American communities, rather than       contravening local efforts and exacerbating tensions. It's       not too late for you to demonstrate such leadership.            Sincerely,      Richard J. Durbin,        U.S. Senator.      Tammy Duckworth,        U.S. Senator.                                   ____                        [Press Release, July 22, 2020]    Durbin, Duckworth Statement on Expansion of DOJ Operation Legend to                                  Chicago   The Expansion Of Operation Legend Will Consist Of An Increased Federal   Law Enforcement Presence From FBI, DEA, ATF, U.S. Marshals, and HSI,     Focused On Providing Support To Existing Violent Crime Task Forces         Washington.--U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy       Duckworth (D-IL) today released the following statement       regarding the Department of Justice (DOJ) announcing an       expansion of Operation Legend to Chicago, Illinois. Operation       Legend is DOJ's violent crime reduction initiative with the       stated goal to provide support and assistance to state and       local law enforcement partners as they work to combat violent       crime, and gun violence in particular. Durbin and Duckworth       are set to speak with U.S. Attorney John Lausch about       Operation Legend today.        ``After needless threats from the President, we're relieved       the Trump Administration says they plan to work with local       officials and authorities in Chicago rather than undermine       local law enforcement and endanger our civil rights, as their       agents have done in Portland. We will continue closely       monitoring the Administration's efforts to ensure they follow       through with this commitment.        ``More than three years ago, we sent President Trump a       letter suggesting a range of ways in which the Federal       Government could work in partnership with local officials to       provide support and resources to assist in public safety,       violence prevention, and economic development efforts in       Chicago. While we are hopeful that today's announcement means       the Administration has reconsidered and will take a more       positive approach, President Trump still has not replied to       our letter nor followed through with our suggestions. We       reiterate that these steps would be more effective in       reducing violence in Chicago than any effort the       Administration may take to replicate the destabilizing role       it played in Portland.''        In their 2017 letter which they reiterated yesterday,       Durbin and Duckworth recommended that the Trump       Administration take steps to assist local violence prevention       efforts, including:        Enhancing Department of Justice (DOJ) programs that improve       community policing;        Directing DOJ to promote mentoring and job training       programs for youth and formerly incarcerated individuals;        Improving mentoring and violence prevention initiatives and       boosting funding for recidivism reduction programs;        Directing DOJ to abide by its commitment to help implement       policing reforms recommended by the Department's Civil Rights       Division;  [[Page S4442]]         Closing gaps in the FBI gun background check system and in       federal firearm laws that enable straw purchasers and gun       traffickers to flood Chicago's streets with illicit guns;        Prioritizing career and youth training programs to address       lack of economic opportunity in neighborhoods hit hard by       violence; and        Redirecting resources that are being devoted to       construction of border wall and committing those resources       instead to the efforts discussed above.        The expansion of Operation Legend will consist of an       increased federal law enforcement presence in Albuquerque,       New Mexico, and in Chicago, Illinois. This federal law       enforcement presence will consist of experienced       investigative agents from FBI, DEA, ATF, U.S. Marshals, and       HSI, focused on providing support to existing violent crime       task forces.     Madam President, I would say to the Senator from Oregon  that the Department of Justice made an announcement yesterday that they  were, in fact, sending, I assume, a number of Federal agents--150--into  Chicago in pursuit of an operation known as Operation Legend. This is  an operation which began July 8, 2020, by the Federal Government  starting in Kansas City because of the death of a 4-year-old young man,  Legend Taliferro, shot and killed in the early morning hours in Kansas  City on June 29.   I received a phone call this morning from John Lausch, the U.S.  attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, a man whom I was  instrumental in selecting and supporting and still do support to this  day--his professional activities--who gave me his personal assurance  that what happened in Oregon was not going to happen in Chicago; that  this Operation Legend, as he described it to me, was in coordination  with State and local law enforcement in the city of Chicago, the State  of Illinois, to make certain that their activities were coordinated and  known in advance and that they were focusing on gun violence and drug  trafficking in the city of Chicago.   I have also been alerted by Mayor Lori Lightfoot that she has  received the same assurances and briefing, as well as Governor J.B.  Pritzker of Illinois.   So our circumstances are different from the ones that Portland faced.  I will tell you that we are going to hold Mr. Lausch and the Department  of Justice and all others to their word that we will not see in Chicago  anything like we witnessed in the streets of Portland, OR.   I just want to say in closing to the Senator from Oregon: Thank you  for bringing this to our attention because when we were alerted--the  Governor, the mayor of Chicago--Senator Duckworth and I both jumped on  this immediately and contacted the Trump administration for clarity  about what was going to happen in Chicago. We have been given these  assurances.   I ask unanimous consent that the lengthy press release, which  describes the activities that are going to take place, again, with the  knowledge and coordination of local law enforcement, be printed in the  Record at this point   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record as follows:                       [Press Release, July 21, 2020]   Durbin, Duckworth Call Out President Trump on Reports of Plan To Send                          Secret Police to Chicago    Senators Introduce Legislation To Block The Trump Administration From    Deploying Federal Forces as a Shadowy Paramilitary Against Americans         Washington.--Following reports that President Donald Trump       wants to send federal agents into cities, including Chicago,       to conduct policing activities that are traditionally handled       by local law enforcement, U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL)       and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today sent a letter to President       Trump calling on him to refrain from taking this action,       which is opposed by Governor Pritzker, Mayor Lightfoot, and       other local leaders.        ``With the right leadership, federal law enforcement can       serve as valuable partners in supporting local efforts and       helping reduce violence in American communities, rather than       contravening local efforts and exacerbating tensions. It's       not too late for you to demonstrate such leadership,'' Durbin       and Duckworth wrote.        Yesterday, Durbin and Duckworth joined Senators Jeff       Merkley (D-OR), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and 17 of their Senate       colleagues to introduce the Preventing Authoritarian Policing       Tactics on America's Streets Act, which was also introduced       as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.       The bill would block the Trump Administration from deploying       federal forces as a shadowy paramilitary against Americans.       The legislation comes after a week in which heavily armed,       unmarked federal forces in unmarked vehicles were filmed       grabbing protesters off the street in Portland, Oregon.        In February 2017, Durbin and Duckworth sent a letter to       President Trump suggesting a range of ways in which the       federal government could work in partnership with local       officials to provide support and resources to assist in       public safety, violence prevention, and economic development       efforts in Chicago.        Full text of today's letter is available here and below:                                                     July 21, 2020.        Dear President Trump: You have indicated that you may send       additional federal agents to the City of Chicago to conduct       policing activities that traditionally are handled by local       law enforcement We strongly urge you to refrain from taking       this action, which is opposed by Governor Pritzker, Mayor       Lightfoot and other local leaders. This week, we will       introduce legislation with other Senate Democrats to prevent       you from overriding local authorities in this manner.        Any involvement by federal law enforcement in community       policing activity must be conducted in coordination with, and       with the approval of, local officials.

It's       not too late for you to demonstrate such leadership.            Sincerely, * * *     Madam President, what happened in Portland, OR, is  unacceptable in the United States of America. We have heard the  historical analogies from the senior Senator from Oregon where  authoritarian central governments moved into an area and took control.  We have seen the historic parallel in the eastern reaches of Ukraine,  in Crimea. We know what it looks like because history has shown us. We  don't want this occurring in the United States of America.   I am sorry for those who were injured and bear the scars of this  Federal incursion in the city of Portland, OR. I stand with the junior  Senator from Oregon. We will call and we will pass, I hope, on a  bipartisan basis the reassertion of the basic principles of this  country when it comes to the separation of powers and when it comes to  the dignity which we ask in the streets of America under our  Constitution.   I thank the junior Senator from Oregon.   I yield the floor.    I announce the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine), the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders), and the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, on June 10, we lost an extraordinary  advocate for children and families in Illinois. For more than four  decades, Maria Whelan fought to ensure equal access to quality and  affordable childcare. Today, we pay tribute to her hard work and life.   Maria was born on December 4, 1950, in East Hampton, NY. She was the  third of 12 children. Ten cousins lived just down the road. Maria went  to Clarke College and completed her master's at the University of  Chicago. She supported herself working as a waitress and a janitor. It  was in Chicago that she met Jack Wuest. They married and raised three  daughters in Chicago's North Side neighborhood of Rogers Park.   In 1976, Maria was working with educators and advocates to help  families when the local afterschool program's sponsoring agency closed.  Maria and some of these folks formed what would later become the Carole  Robertson Center for Learning. She served as the center's first  executive director until 1989. Maria helped the center become a  thriving center for quality early childhood education. Maria continued  her fight for families as the director of children services for the  Illinois Department of Human Services and then the senior program  officer for the Chicago Community Trust. In 2000, she became the  president and CEO for Illinois Action for Children, which provides  150,000 children and families every year access to high-quality early  care and education opportunities.   Under Maria's leadership, Illinois Action for Children expanded its  scope. She helped create the Healthy Food Program, which helps families  stretch their dollars by reimbursing childcare providers for the cost  of feeding children with healthy food. Maria was instrumental in the  development of Innovation Zones that connect critically important  resources in some of Chicago's most underserved communities.   The Innovation Zones led to the transformative Community Systems  Statewide Supports Program, which helps communities improve early  childhood services with training, planning, and collaboration. Maria  also helped move Illinois Action for Children into direct early  childhood services with its early learning program centers in Chicago's  South and West suburbs.   There was no one like Maria. Maria was tough, smart, passionate, and  an authority on what needed to be done to best serve families in  Illinois. I made it a point to meet with her. She made partnerships  that mattered. Maria helped them launch the Lunch Bus with the Greater  Chicago Food Depository to provide free summer meals to children.   Maria enjoyed reading, classical music, and spending time with her  family in Vermont. And she always loved a good laugh. We will miss her  smile, her wit, and her heart. She is survived by her husband Jack; her  three daughters, Catherine Mary, Ellen Rose, and Maeve Margaret; her  three grandchildren, Teddy, Archie, and Evie; and her nine brothers and  sisters.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4314         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Retaining Educators Takes       Added Investment Now Act'' or the ``RETAIN Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to create a refundable tax       credit for early childhood educators, teachers, early       childhood education program directors, school leaders, and       school-based mental health services providers in early       childhood, elementary, and secondary education settings that       rewards retention based on the time spent serving high-need       students.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The shortage of experienced, qualified early childhood       educators and elementary school and secondary school teachers       is a national problem that compromises the academic outcomes       and long-term success of students.        (2) The shortage is the result of many factors including       low pay, frequent turnover in school leadership, poor       teaching conditions, and inadequate teacher supports.        (3) The shortage is worse in high-poverty areas where the       factors contributing to the shortage are particularly acute       and have an increased negative impact on teachers of color       remaining in the field.        (4) A child's access to high-quality early childhood       education is critical to supporting positive outcomes, and       early childhood educators--        (A) play an important role in setting the foundation for       future learning, and        (B) promote the development of vital skills, habits, and       mindsets that children need to be successful in school and in       life.        (5) In 2015, the national median pay of early childhood       educators was a mere $28,570, with many early childhood       educators relying on government assistance programs such as       Medicaid, the supplemental nutrition assistance program       established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7       U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), or the temporary assistance for needy       families program established under part A of title IV of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and struggling       to provide for their own families.        (6) Studies have demonstrated that well-qualified,       experienced teachers are the single most important school-      based element contributing to a child's academic achievement       and success.        (7) In 2016, the average teacher salary in public       elementary schools and secondary schools was only $58,950,       which is on average 21.4 percent less than other college       graduates working in non-teaching fields, and with many       teachers struggling with large amounts of student loan debt.        (8) An experienced, well-qualified education workforce must       also be reflective of the diversity of the student body       across race, ethnicity, and disability.        (9) Experienced, well-qualified school leaders and school-      based mental health service providers are essential for       providing strong educational opportunities and services for       students and promoting teacher retention through improved       professional supports and teaching conditions.
