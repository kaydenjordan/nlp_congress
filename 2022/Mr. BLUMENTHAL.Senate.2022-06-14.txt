 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Nelson W. Milner, Sr., and Clarence R. Milner, Sr.  Both men were beloved relatives of former Hartford, CT, mayor Thirman  L. Milner, the first elected African-American mayor in New England.  They passed away earlier this year and leave extraordinary legacies of  thoughtful, compassionate work.   Nelson was born in Hartford, CT, and was the brother of former Mayor  Milner. Upon graduating from high school, he joined the Air Force,  serving for 3 years. Stationed in Riverside, CA, Nelson remained in the  State with his late wife, Arthurrine, following his service. In the  1980s, Nelson returned to Hartford in support of his brother's mayoral  campaign.   Passionate about serving others, Nelson became an ordained deacon and  taught Sunday school. He also played the keyboard with the East  Hartford senior center band. Nelson focused his final years on  strengthening his relationship with his family, including his 10  children, 5 stepchildren, and many grandchildren and great- grandchildren. He passed away on February 15, 2022, at the age of 90.   Nelson and Arthurrine's son, Clarence, was born in California. He  would go on to have 10 children of his own, as well as 4 stepchildren,  41 grandchildren, and 7 great-grandchildren. Clarence dedicated his  life to his Christian faith and volunteered as a firefighter. Just like  his father, he moved back to Hartford to work on his uncle's mayoral  campaign. In addition to supporting his uncle's successful bid to  become the city's first African- American mayor, Clarence also  committed himself to running several businesses.   Family was at the heart of everything Clarence did. He was  inseparable from his identical twin, Carl, for many years. Clarence met  his wife in Hartford and spent as much time as possible with all of his  children and grandchildren. He passed away on January 11, 2022, at the  age of 64.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to former Mayor  Milner and all of Nelson and Clarence's loved ones. May their many  wonderful memories of both men provide them solace and comfort in the  days ahead. I hope my colleagues will join me in remembering Nelson W.  Milner, Sr., and Clarence R. Milner, Sr.                            ____________________
