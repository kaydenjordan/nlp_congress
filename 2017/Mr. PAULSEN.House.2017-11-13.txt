 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Paul Fogelberg from  Orono, Minnesota, on receiving the EveryLife Foundation for Rare  Disease's RareVoice Abbey Award from the EveryLife Foundation.   No one, Mr. Speaker, deserves this recognition more than Paul because  of his tireless work on behalf of those suffering from pulmonary  fibrosis, a disease that stiffens and scars the deep tissue in the  lungs, making it increasingly difficult to breath until eventually you  die.   Every year, more than 14,000 people die from the disease, essentially  the same number of people who die from breast cancer.   Paul himself has pulmonary fibrosis and is a strong advocate for  research, for awareness, and for more clinical trials to help those who  have contracted this deadly disease. There is no known cure for  pulmonary fibrosis, yet Paul is a fighter, a leader, and a great  advocate who is doing all he can to find one.   Congratulations again to Paul Fogelberg for being recognized as the  EveryLife Foundation for Rare Disease's RareVoice Abbey Award.                            ____________________
