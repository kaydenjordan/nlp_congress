 Mr. Speaker, this month offers a joyful opportunity to  celebrate the legendary love and leadership of President Jimmy Carter  and First Lady Rosalynn Carter, as they mark their 77th wedding  anniversary.   All Americans know of the greatness of President Carter, whose  dignity, decency, and devoted public service has touched countless  lives. Today, I rise to herald the many good works of First Lady  Rosalynn Carter, a revered leader in her own right.   In a moment where there was real stigma against mental illness,  Rosalynn Carter decided to make mental health one of her flagship  issues.   As First Lady of Georgia, she was deeply moved by the stories of  Georgians who shared their struggles with mental illness or caring for  a family member with a mental illness. Those stories informed her  service on the Governor's Commission to Improve Services for the  Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped, where many of her contributions  were later implemented as policy.   These stories informed her service on the Governor's Commission to  Improve Services for the Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped, as I  said.    When her husband went to the White House, she served as honorary  chair of the President's Commission on Mental Health, where the  recommendations became the foundation for decades of change.   In her compelling testimony before Congress on the landmark Mental  Health Systems Act, she declared:  [[Page H3482]]  ``The mental health problems facing our country are the problems of all  citizens.''   After leaving the White House, she founded the mental health policy  initiative and mental health journalism fellowship at the Carter  Center.   Alongside Betty Ford, she advocated for the Paul Wellstone and Pete  Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which ensures  that reimbursements for mental health are the same as for physical  health; mental or physical health, no distinction. Patrick Kennedy in  our House was such an important leader on this.   The same boundless compassion also fueled the First Lady's fervent  commitment to our Nation's caregivers. She has devoted herself to  bringing support and attention to tens of millions of families and  professional caregivers across the country.   For 36 years, the Georgia Southwestern State University Rosalynn  Carter Institute for Caregiving has advocated for policies to support  their work. She even wrote a handbook for caregivers: ``Helping  Yourself Help Others.''   At the same time, First Lady Carter has lent her voice to so many  causes: From childhood immunization, especially among vulnerable  communities, to gender justice, as she fought to ratify the Equal  Rights Amendment.   Beloved at home, First Lady Carter was also deeply respected abroad.  All are in awe of her historic visit to Latin America in 1977, where  she championed human rights, democracy, and a new chapter of engagement  in the region.   With her characteristic grace and grit, she embraced this high-stakes  diplomatic mission: Meeting with heads of state and speaking with  authority as an emissary for our Nation.   With her characteristic grace and grit, again, 2 years later,  Rosalynn Carter made history as the first sitting First Lady to address  the World Health Organization, when she shared her mental health  findings. In her memorable remarks, she argued that mental health was  an aspect of physical health, and that healthcare is a human right.   Since, through the Carter Center, she has helped strengthen mental  health care in Liberia: Caring for people exposed to the stress of  conflict, while training community workers to identify signs of mental  illness.   Personally, it was my special privilege 2 years ago to travel to  Plains to join in celebrating the Carter's 75th wedding anniversary, a  marvelous celebration of their eternal love and limitless partnership.   Rosalynn has long been Jimmy's closest friend and confidant, and the  Carter Center will forever stand as a testament to the true partnership  in service that the Carters share.   God has truly blessed America with the leadership of the Carters, and  our grateful Nation salutes them for their lives well-lived.                            ____________________
