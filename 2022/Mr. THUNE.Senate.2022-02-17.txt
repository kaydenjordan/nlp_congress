 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, farming and ranching are the lifeblood of  my home State and a way of life for many South Dakotans, and advocating  for farmers and ranchers is one of my top priorities here in Congress.   As a longtime member of the Senate's Agriculture Committee, I have  been able to help shape multiple farm bills and make sure that South  Dakota's agriculture producers' voices are heard here in Washington.   Lately, I have been hearing a lot of reports from South Dakota's  producers and ag exporters about ocean carriers refusing to transport  American agricultural products. This is, obviously, a major concern for  farmers and ranchers, who are already struggling with the burden of  inflation and high input costs and who rely on exports for part of  their livelihoods, which is why I recently introduced bipartisan  legislation to address violations of free and fair competition in  shipping and to create a more level playing field for American  producers.   Our bill gives the Federal Maritime Commission greater authority to  respond to discriminatory ocean carrier practices, and it provides the  FMC with the tools to more quickly resolve detention and demurrage  disputes.   This legislation will bring greater efficiency and transparency to a  process that leaves many shippers frustrated and will bring long-term  positive changes to the maritime supply chain, which, I hope, will  benefit ag exporters, importers, and consumers alike.   Another one of my priorities lately has been to address the Biden  administration's proposed Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, rule.  WOTUS concerns which water features are regulated at the Federal level.   Now, generally, the Clean Water Act only calls for navigable waters  to be regulated at the Federal level, which are things like rivers and  streams that connect to larger bodies of water. But, like President  Obama before him, President Biden is trying to expand Federal  jurisdiction to regulate things like ditches, prairie potholes, and  streams that only flow when it rains. Needless to say, this would  subject nearly every corner of South Dakota to this DC land grab.   Farmers and ranchers could be subjected to the time-consuming process  of having each and every pothole and ditch examined by Federal  regulators, and they could face massive fines should they run afoul of  DC regulators looking to halt everyday farming and ranching practices.  Those fines can be $25,000 a day. That is not acceptable.   Any WOTUS rule that is going to work for farmers and ranchers has to  include categorical exclusions for features like ditches, prairie  potholes, and stock ponds, which is why I recently led the entire  Senate Republican conference in writing to the EPA and the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers regarding the Biden administration's proposed WOTUS  rule. We urged the administration to suspend its WOTUS rulemaking until  the Supreme Court rules on the Clean Water Act case it is currently  considering, which would effectively invalidate the Biden WOTUS  regulations.   Implementing the WOTUS rule now, when it could be overturned in the  near future, would subject farmers and ranchers to an unacceptable  level of uncertainty as they plan for the upcoming planting season. It  is very likely that the Supreme Court will force the administration to  go back to the drawing board, which would, hopefully, result in a less  intrusive and more workable rule that won't subject farmers and  ranchers to even more Washington redtape.   As a supporter of South Dakota and our Nation's corn and soybean  farmers--and as a supporter of clean energy--I have long championed the  clean energy potential of biofuels. The EPA's renewable fuel standard,  which requires that a minimum volume of renewable fuel be sold in the  United States each year, is a significant tool for reducing the carbon  footprint of our transportation sector.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration has shown a willingness to  undermine the blending targets set by the renewable fuel standard,  going as far as a proposal to retroactively reduce the 2020 renewable  volume obligation, which had already been finalized.   The Biden EPA tried to suggest that these cuts would be made up for  with higher 2022 blending targets, but with a new precedent, there  would be nothing to stop the administration from again caving to oil  refiners and retroactively reducing volume obligations in the future.   That is why I recently joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues in  urging the EPA to prioritize the renewable fuel standard by maintaining  the increased blending requirements for 2022, denying all pending small  refinery exemptions, eliminating proposed retroactive cuts to the 2020  renewable volume obligations, and setting 2021 renewable fuel standard  volumes at the statutory levels.   Unfortunately, the administration remains almost singularly focused  on electric vehicles rather than on the readily available and proven  clean energy contributions of biofuels. Ethanol, biodiesel, and now  sustainable aviation fuel can drive down emissions and help reduce our  demand for oil--an important consideration given soaring gas prices and  the fact that this administration is forcing us to rely more on foreign  oil production.    Now, currently, some of my colleagues are promoting a report that was  conveniently issued right before yesterday's EPW Committee hearing on  the renewable fuel standard. My colleagues, who rarely pass on an  opportunity to malign biofuels, say the report undercuts the growing  body of research that says biofuels cut emissions by as much as 46  percent or more compared to gasoline.   To this, I will say that if you are concerned about accurate  accounting of biofuel emissions, I invite you to cosponsor my bill, the  bipartisan Adopt GREET Act. This bill would require the EPA to update  its greenhouse gas modeling for ethanol and biodiesel by using the  Department of Energy's GREET model. Let's put energy technologies head- to-head. I call on the chairman of the Environment and Public Works  Committee to mark up my bipartisan bill.   Biofuels also provide a highly important market for corn and soybean  farmers whose crops and their byproducts go into biofuel production.  And it is incredibly unfortunate that the administration continues to  overlook the clean energy potential of biofuels and the associated  benefits for our Nation's farmers.   I sent two letters to President Biden with a number of my colleagues  seeking a meeting to discuss all the ways biofuels could complement his  agenda and noting the bipartisan support for ethanol and biodiesel.  Unfortunately, it quickly became clear that the President and his  administration had little interest in the proven clean energy potential  of biofuels. But I will continue to do everything I can here in  Washington to promote this clean energy resource and to expand  opportunities for South Dakota producers.  [[Page S761]]    No matter the season, South Dakota farmers and ranchers will always  be one of my top priorities here in Washington. I continue to work to  help farmers and ranchers deal with the challenges of inflation, which  are hitting our farm communities hard, and I continue to press the  administration to ensure that the meatpacking industry is held  accountable for any unfair practices.   Whatever the challenges--and in the farming life, there are always  many--our Nation's farmers and ranchers keep pushing forward to feed  our Nation and the world, and I will continue to do all that I can to  ensure that they have the resources that they need to carry out that  mission.

On what seemed to be a typical morning in Miller, SD, on February 2,  2022, an explosion and fire suddenly took place in the Miller High  School.   A potentially devastating situation was thankfully prevented by the  swift actions of the Miller School District teachers and staff. Miller  superintendent Dr. Charlene Crosswait, junior/senior high school  principal Steve Schumacher, elementary school principal Drake  Bachmeier, Mr. Mark Ketelhut, and the teachers and staff efficiently  executed the evacuation plan, ultimately saving the lives of all 447  students from kindergarteners through the senior graduating class of  2022.   I would like to commend the teachers and staff members for their  diligent training, emergency preparation planning, and quick action to  lead students to safety. I would also like to recognize each and every  student for their attentiveness and exceptional conduct in an emergency  situation. Because of the rapid response, every child and staff member  made it out safe and unharmed. I would also like to commend Hand-in- Hand Daycare Center located adjacent to the school for safely  evacuating all staff and children.   In emergency situations like this, while people are moving swiftly to  get to safety, heroic emergency responders are always there running  toward the blaze. The well-coordinated response from Hand County  emergency manager Arlen Gortmaker, volunteer firefighters from Miller,  Ree Heights, and Wessington Fire Departments, and first responders from  Hand County and the city of Miller who secured the area and  extinguished the fire deserve recognition. The first responders endured  hours of freezing temperatures, frozen pump lines, and weather  challenges with equipment. These hard-working, generous volunteers, and  workers have big hearts and show up relentlessly under all  circumstances to ensure the safety and well-being of others. Thank you  to all of our firefighters and first responders for all you do.   In true South Dakota fashion, the entire community pulled together.  Despite fire and smoke damage, which made the school inaccessible,  thanks to the compassionate generosity of St. Ann's Catholic Church,  First United Methodist Church, First Presbyterian Church, and the  Community Church of St. Lawrence, students will be able to utilize  facilities to complete the rest of their school year. Sunshine Bible  Academy has offered their gym for Miller Rustler basketball team  practices and games. Communities across South Dakota have been reaching  out to offer support and assistance. I am proud to be part of a State  that strongly believes in joining together to help friends and  neighbors through tough times. The buildings need work, but they can be  repaired. Most importantly, everyone made it home safely to their  families and the community remains strong and resilient.   I commend the entire Miller community for their excellent response to  the emergency at the Miller School. The true spirit of our State shines  brightly in Miller, SD.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
