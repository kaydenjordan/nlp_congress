 Mr. Speaker, it seems every morning we are greeted by  another outrage from the Trump administration. Today, we find that the  Department of the Interior deliberately manipulated the information  surrounding the decision to amend the boundaries of national monuments.  They withheld information about the benefits of the monument  designation, benefits for Native Americans, for wildlife, for the local  economy, and for the environment.   The only way we found out about this manipulation is because they  inadvertently disclosed the entire memorandum, exposed for everybody to  see how they blatantly manipulated the process. But this is just  another example.   This last week, we have seen attacks on our long-time friends and  allies in Europe, undermining the NATO alliance, questioning the  integrity of our American intelligence service, and assaulting American  business and consumers with this ill-advised trade war and the tariffs,  which are just taxes on American families. This is, in part, due to the  fact that we are not getting any pushback on these outrages from most  Republicans in Congress, not standing up to Trump for America and for  our values.   It appears that most of my Republican friends are held hostage to the  most extreme elements in their districts. They are given enhanced  influence because of the practice of partisan gerrymandering, drawing  boundaries to enhance the power of the Republican majority, so you only  have to worry about voters in the primary.   I have long supported independent commissions to draw these  boundaries, have proposed legislation federally. Although there appears  to be little appetite in Congress, luckily, people out in the States  are taking matters into their own hands. We are watching citizen  initiatives in Michigan, in Utah, and in Colorado. Voters, this year,  will have a chance to vote on fair and honest redistricting if the U.S.  Chamber and the Republican Party are not able to block it from being  voted on, as they are trying to do in Michigan.   When voters, again, pick the politicians instead of politicians  picking the voters, it is much more likely that Congress will do its  job. Mr. Speaker, until we get fair districts, we will have to rely on  renewed, energized voter engagement to elect a Congress that will do  its job.   The good news is that the evidence all across America is that people  are responding to a new generation of political leadership. They are  getting involved in unprecedented numbers--more voters, more activism.  They are going to elect, as leaders, new Members who will provide the  accountability to hold in check this reckless administration.   It is too bad it looks like we will have to wait for the election for  the next Congress to do its job.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy  in permitting me to speak on this, and I am pleased to follow my friend  from California (Mr. Royce).   This is troubling for me, his reference here to 38 extensions without  reform. I have been working on this for 20 years. This is the 41st  time, and we had one back in 2004 with my friend, Doug Bereuter, where  we had some small steps, but they were anticipatory of being able to  make greater reforms.   I am vexed that we continue to move forward and dodge some hard  facts. We are subsidizing too much for people who grow complacent.   I am concerned about affordability. There are things we can do to  deal with affordability, but that doesn't mean to have massive  subsidization for people who don't need it and, in fact, encourage  people to be in harm's way and, in fact, after they are flooded out, to  go back, putting them in harm's way again.   There are simple, commonsense steps we can take. There were things  that Mr. Royce and I had that are sort of the lowest common  denominator. I am deeply troubled that we are going to do this again  without dealing with the problems.   I just want to say that it is not just financial hardship and it is  not just wasting of money. Our failure to reform the Flood Insurance  Program puts people at risk. Every one of these massive events shows  that people will go back, trying to deal with a family member; they are  dealing with their business, or they are dealing with a pet.                                time  1745    People die because we fail to take steps to reform and make it work  right.   I appreciate the ranking member, the chair, Mr. Duffy, and Mr. Royce.  There is a path forward. This bill is not the path forward.  [[Page H7128]]    I don't want it to lapse. I don't want disruption. But it is hard for  me to sit here and vote ``yes'' for something that doesn't do the  minimum. We don't do anybody any favors along this path.
