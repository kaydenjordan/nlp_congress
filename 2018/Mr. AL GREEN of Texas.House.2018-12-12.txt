 Mr. Speaker, once again I rise, and still I  rise, a proud American, always proud to have the preeminent privilege  of standing in the well of the Congress of the United States of  America.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today reflecting upon the words, the lyrics, if  you will, of a song that many of us have heard. The lyrics, as I  paraphrase them, are:         One day at a time, one day at a time, sweet Jesus. One day       at a time. Just help me to make, just help me to take, one       day at a time.    Many of us who are sons of the segregated South survived, to a  certain extent, understanding the lyrics of ``One Day At a Time,''  knowing that, if you just take one day at a time, it can become a  lifetime.   Sons of the segregated South learned early that they had to  compromise.   I saw something on television yesterday that caused me to reflect on  all of these things, Mr. Speaker, when I saw a President who was born  into plenty, not poverty, a President who was born with a pat hand, a  President who was born into a life unlike that of the sons of the  segregated South who were African American, who understand how to  [[Page H10110]]  negotiate and what negotiation is all about--of necessity they do. Not  all, but generally speaking they do.   I saw a President yesterday, Mr. Speaker, who proclaims himself to be  a great negotiator. Mr. Speaker, yesterday it was revealed to many of  us that what he sees as negotiation is dictation, a President who sees  compromise as capitulation for the other side, who has always walked  into his opportunities, if you will, knowing that the other side would  have to give in or he would muscle his way over them.                                time  1045    Well, I am proud to say that two Members of the Congress of the  United States of America, the House and the Senate--it is what the  Congress consists of--two Members stood their ground. Speaker Pelosi-- and I say Speaker Pelosi because once you are a Speaker, you are always  a Speaker--and Minority Leader Schumer did not allow themselves to be  dictated to. They understand that compromise is the methodology by  which we can realize significant change.   I am proud of the two of them, and I am proud to say to you that, as  a son of the segregated South, I saw hope when I saw them take a stand  for the American people, take a stand for justice, take a stand for the  great ideals that we all stand upon.   One day at a time, Mr. President, one day at a time, and we will have  dealt with all of the great issues of our time.   But I am proud to know that you will find, Mr. President, that  negotiation is more than your being a dictator, that you are going to  have to compromise if you want to realize some of the great things that  we have to accomplish.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time, and I thank the creator of all  of creation for giving me this one more day, and I pray that I will do  better today than I did yesterday because I still see life as one day  at a time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the  leadership on both sides of the aisle for according us this time. It is  an honor to have the privilege of standing here in the House of  Representatives to present a resolution tonight, and I am grateful that  the time has been allowed.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored tonight to present this resolution, H. Res.  1166, honoring and praising the American Jewish Committee, known as  AJC, on the occasion of its 112th anniversary.   I am honored to say that this resolution has other persons who are  sponsors: Ms. Clarke of New York, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Ms. Meng, Mr.  Gonzalez of Texas, Mr. Cohen, Ms. Moore, Mr. Brady of Pennsylvania, and  Mr. Rothfus. I am honored that  [[Page H10164]]  these Members have cosigned, if you will, in that they are cosponsors  of this resolution.   I am honored to say to you, Mr. Speaker, that this organization, the  American Jewish Committee, has been around now for 112 years in the  business of protecting Jews and other minorities from anti-Semitism,  racism, bigotry, hatred, and human rights violations.   When these things occur, you can count on the American Jewish  Committee standing up, speaking out, and making their position known.   The American Jewish Committee is currently fighting against the  rising tide of hate and bigotry. And there is empirical, as well as  anecdotal, evidence to support the fact that there is a rising tide.   Per the FBI, there were 6,121 hate crimes in 2016; in 2017, 7,125  hate crimes. A rising tide. Three of five hate crimes target ethnicity  or race; one of five will target religion. Hate crimes in this country  are being addressed by the American Jewish Committee. 2,013 hate crimes  against African Americans in 2017, 938 hate crimes against Jewish  Americans.   The American Jewish Committee is confronting hate and making a  difference in the lives of people.   This organization was founded November 11, 1906, in New York City by  a group of Jews who wanted to raise awareness about the persecution and  targeting of Jews in Russia.   I might also add that this was around the time that the NAACP was  founded. It was founded just some years later in 1909. And a good many  members of the founding persons associated with the NAACP were Jewish  people.   The NAACP and the AJC have had a partnership, a friendship, a  relationship for many, many years in this battle against hate and  bigotry.   The AJC supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964, supported the Voting  Rights Act of 1965, supported the historic decision in the Supreme  Court case of Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka. And I would  add, not only did the AJC support it by filing various briefs and doing  research, but also with money. Members supported this lawsuit with  money.   Thurgood Marshall was the lead counsel for the NAACP in Brown v.  Board of Education, but there were other persons who were not of  African ancestry associated with this litigation who helped to fund it.  It was a costly piece of litigation, and I am proud to say that AJC was  supportive of the NAACP in Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka.   The AJC has been at the forefront of strengthening ties between Jews  and Latinos. The AJC concerns itself with the human rights and human  dignity of all people regardless of ethnicity.   The AJC's Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council is a group of some 50  persons, Muslims and Jews, who have as their aim protecting and  expanding the rights of religious minorities in the United States of  America. Those who will divide us along religious lines are confronted  by the AJC, the American Jewish Committee.                                time  1730    It has launched a global campaign encouraging people of conscience  around the world to attend Jewish services, and especially this was  made known after the attack at the Tree of Life congregation in  Pittsburgh, where 11 worshippers were killed.   I was fortunate enough to attend a Shabbat service in Houston, Texas,  where our mayor, the Honorable Sylvester Turner, spoke and where we,  persons of goodwill, had the opportunity to express our desire and our  belief that we should combine our efforts to make sure that we  developed a symbiotic relationship as we moved forward with this global  campaign to encourage people of conscience to get to know persons of  different religions so that we could have together what we could never  accomplish apart.   The AJC, in 2015, launched what is known as the Mayors United Against  Anti-Semitism campaign to build a nationwide coalition of elected  officials committed to fighting anti-Semitism, a nationwide coalition.  I am proud to say that that continues to this day and that elected  officials are responding to the clarion call to unite against bigotry,  hatred, anti-Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia, sexism,  and nativism. The AJC is there to fight for the rights of people to  live in dignity with peace and harmony.   The AJC is international in scope. It has 11 international offices,  22 in the United States, and 36 international Jewish community  partnerships. In truth, it is international in scope. It is also an  organization that has been there for the State of Israel.   It is a steadfast supporter of Israel, becoming the first American  Jewish organization to open an office in Israel, and an effective  advocate for Israel's security. The AJC has been and continues to be a  strong partner for the State of Israel.   I am proud to tell you that I have a friend, who at one time was the  head of AJC. At the time, I was the head of the NAACP. I share this  brief vignette because I think it is important to explain how things  can really work and how people can work together.   My friend, David Mincberg, as I indicated, was the head of AJC, and I  had the good fortune to be a leader of the NAACP in Houston, Texas. We  had a city council person, whose name I need not mention, who made a  racial slur, said a very ugly thing, and David and I had the  opportunity to bring our organizations together.   Upon doing so, we concluded that we should talk to other persons of  goodwill in the city so as to build a coalition to confront the council  person who made the racial slur. With a strong coalition, the NAACP and  the AJC were able to call for the resignation of this council person.   These two organizations, taking the lead, were able to do something  that, in my opinion, could not have been done but for the unity  exhibited, and the coalition that was constructed could not have done  it, and that was to have this city council person leave city council.   This is the kind of strength that the AJC brings to issues associated  with hate and bigotry. The AJC does not tolerate hatred and bigotry.  Much of what I express with reference to hatred and bigotry I acquired  from associating with persons who are part of the AJC.   I have understood, as a result of working with my friends at the AJC,  that we can never, ever tolerate hatred and bigotry, regardless of  where it comes from, regardless as to what the source is. We have got  to be bold. We have to show courage. We have to stand up together  against hatred and bigotry.   These are some of the things that the AJC has exhibited over the  years in my presence.   And I said my friends at AJC. I call people friends who are persons  that I do more than have dinner with, persons whom I do more than  associate with, persons whom I have more than a relationship with. I  call friends persons whom I can disagree with and still maintain a  relationship with them.   Over the years, these friends and I have stood together, and we  continue to stand together.   So, tonight, Mr. Speaker, I call to the attention of this august body  H. Res. 1166, and I call to the attention of those who are within the  sound of my voice, those who may be viewing at home, I call to their  attention H. Res. 1166, a resolution that honors and praises the  American Jewish Committee on the occasion of its 112th anniversary.   I suggest that it be resolved by the House of Representatives that  the House of Representatives, itself, recognize the 112th anniversary  of the historic founding of the American Jewish Committee, and that the  House of Representatives should honor and praise the American Jewish  Committee on the occasion of this anniversary for its efforts regarding  human rights worldwide, for its interfaith dialogue, and for the  promotion of Israel's security and its place in the world.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to have presented this resolution, and I  would have the world know, and all of my friends know, that I look  forward to returning to Houston, Texas, and meeting with my friends who  are associated with the AJC, the American Jewish Committee, as we  continue our struggle to end hatred and bigotry--not to manage it, not  to make it less tolerable, but to eliminate it in its entirety wherever  it exists.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H10165]]                                ____________________
