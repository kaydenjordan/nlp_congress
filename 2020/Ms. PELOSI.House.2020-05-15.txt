 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for yielding  and thank her for her tremendous leadership.   My colleagues, a horrible virus has made a vicious attack on the  lives and the livelihood of the American people and, indeed, on the  life of our democracy. We have been given a momentous opportunity and,  therefore, a great opportunity to defeat the virus and to do so in a  way that brings us together and takes us forward to a stronger America.   Today, the House will consider the HEROES Act, to honor those who are  on the front lines, our healthcare workers, our first responders,  teachers,  [[Page H2222]]  sanitation workers, food providers, transit workers, and other  essential workers.   Many of them have risked their lives to save lives, and now they may  lose their jobs. For many of them, this is just what is happening right  now as governors across the country are planning their budgets.   As the coronavirus takes its vicious toll on the lives and  livelihoods in our country, it has also taken a toll on the States to  deliver services to the people. Governors are forced to either cut  services or increase taxes or both.   Congress must honor its responsibility to the American people, to  lessen the blow of the coronavirus, by making the same serious  investment of the HEROES Act to our State, local, Tribal, and  territorial governments.    The plan that we are voting on today will make a tremendous  difference, not only in the budgets of the States, but in the lives of  the American people: their public health, the education of our  children, the sanitation that is so important in defeating the virus,  with the support of so many essential workers.   The distinguished gentleman on the other side of the aisle talked  about the cost of the bill. The cost to the States, localities,  territories, and Tribal governments is less than the cost of the  Republican tax break, which gave 83 percent of the benefits to the top  1 percent. We think this is a major investment in the lives of the  American people and in the budgets of our States and localities.   Setting aside how we got here, we must approach this tragedy with the  deepest humanity, Mr. Speaker. All of our hearts are broken by the  87,000 Americans who have lost their lives and nearly 1.5 million who  have been infected by the coronavirus.   The number of 36-or-more-million Americans who have filed for  unemployment insurance is almost unimaginable. This is a moment when  our fellow Americans are in deep suffering. We must have empathy for  our heroes, the healthcare workers, for how exhausted they must be and  how stressed they are in doing their jobs. And, again, they are at risk  of losing their jobs in this economy.   We must also emphasize the pain of families who do not know where  their next meal is coming from or how they are going to pay next  month's rent. It is imperative that we address the needs of the  American people with clarity as we proceed.   It is always interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, to see how much patience  some people have with the pain and suffering of other people, a  tolerance level that is not acceptable in a great country like America,  with a sense of community and concern for each other.   We can all agree that we must open the economy, for sure, as quickly  as we can. But we must do so based on science and data. The key to  opening this door is testing, tracing, treating, and social distancing.  Overwhelmingly, the scientific community agrees.   The HEROES Act has a strategic plan, something that has been lacking  thus far, a strategic plan with a vision to end this plague, a  strategic vision, a goal, a timetable, milestones, benchmarks, put  forth by the Energy and Commerce Committee. That is really important. I  thank the gentleman from New Jersey. You have to have a plan to  succeed.   As families are devastated by the loss of life, this legislation of  putting money in the pockets of the American people, which is also a  stimulus for the economy, is essential. They are suffering so much in  so many ways. We want to lessen the pain for them.   As Federal Reserve Chairman Powell said--this is very important,  because it isn't one of us saying it to each other. The authority of  the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board said: ``Additional fiscal  support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term  economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This tradeoff  is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation  and spending.''   As elected officials, we have the responsibility and the opportunity  to think big, as he advised, and act now for the people.   The distinguished gentleman said, oh, my goodness, we put this bill  on the floor. Well, let me just do a little history of the last few  months.   I, too, am very proud of the fact that we were able to bring four  bills to conclusion in a strong bipartisan way.   The first one on March 4: Testing, testing, testing. Not really  fulfilled, but nonetheless intended.   Ten days later, on March 14: Mask, mask, mask, mask. Again, PPE, not  fully realized, but nonetheless intended.   March 28, the President of the United States signed the CARES Act,  the first CARES Act. And that was a bill that was developed by the  Republican leadership in the Senate. They put forth their proposal. We  responded, acted upon it, and came forth with a bipartisan agreement.   The next bill, the interim PPP bill, was also developed by the  Republican leader in the Senate. He put forth their proposal; we put  forth our suggestions; we negotiated; we came forth with a bipartisan  bill.   Don't you take pride in the House of Representatives having the same  opportunity and privilege as the Republican leadership in the Senate  for us to put forth legislation in this terrible fight?   More than 80 percent of what is in this legislation has already been  supported in a bipartisan way. We have agreed on State and local and  other bills. We have agreed on testing in at least two other bills. We  have agreed on supporting hospitals. We have agreed on unemployment  insurance. We have agreed on direct payments. So much that is in this  legislation has appeared in previous bipartisan legislation. So we are  not asking people to do something they haven't done before.   But there are some things that we want to add, the postal system,  more for voting--but they did vote for the vote-by-mail legislation  before--a very strong OSHA regulation that mandates certain conditions  so that our workers will be protected and that our employers will know  what the standards are clearly that they must honor and, therefore,  they are protected as well.                                time  1500    Now, some of the Members say: Let's take a pause.   Let's take a pause? Do you think this virus is taking a pause? Do you  think that the rent takes a pause? Do you think that putting food on  the table, or the hunger that comes if you can't, takes a pause? The  hardship of losing a job doesn't take a pause. Or tragically losing a  loved one, it doesn't take a pause.   So many lives may have been saved if we had testing, tracing, and  treatment earlier on. Now, that is a lesson to us that that is what we  must do so that we can end this. But we don't end it by pausing in the  fight.   This virus is relentless. It is possibly mutating, changing its  nature. This is a very difficult fight.   It gives us a moment that we must admit that the American people are  suffering deeply. We must have empathy for the healthcare workers who,  again and again, risk their lives to save lives and, again, are now at  risk of losing jobs of their own, as I said before.   We must have empathy for the families who are sick and the parents  who are struggling to pay the rent and put food on the table.   We must have empathy for families who have lost their loved ones. Can  you just imagine losing a loved one so mysteriously, so out of the  blue? Many people can't even embrace them or say good-bye because of  the way the virus is communicated.   We cannot abandon them in this time of need. To protect lives and  livelihood, Members of Congress, House and Senate, must come together,  as we have done, responding to the Republicans' bills that they  constructed on their own in the Senate, and now we offer back something  that contains much of what they offered, a little more, because the  needs are greater.   We must pass this bill to give the families the relief they need.  These are the American people. This is our family. They are suffering.  They need help. We have the resources and the opportunity to do so.   It is interesting to me, and so sad for me, as a mother and  grandmother of children who are younger and college age, that this is  the time that they would have been enjoying graduation. I have spoken  at many, many, many graduations, watching hundreds of thousands of  students walk across that  [[Page H2223]]  stage, to see the pride in their families, many of them the first in  their families to graduate from college, to see the symbol of success,  love, and joy that it is for those families. They will be missing that  ritual, sadly, whether it is college, high school, or, in my case,  grade school, and even going into middle school.   President Kennedy said that children are our ``greatest resource''  and our ``best hope for the future.'' They are our hope, but we must  also give them hope as they go forward by alleviating the challenge our  country is facing and make the future better for them. It is always  about the children and their future.   I urge our colleagues to consider all of those children all over  America, but also in their own States, in their own districts, as they  make their decision today that is so important to our country.   That is why I am so grateful, Mr. Speaker, to have a distinguished  chairwoman, Chair Nita Lowey of New York, as chair of the  Appropriations Committee. She and many of our chairs of committees have  been dazzling, dazzling with a depth of knowledge of the subjects, the  extent of legislative brilliance that they have brought to all of this,  knowing the challenge, understanding the policy, strategically thinking  about how we can best accomplish and use money.   This is not a Christmas tree. There is nothing joyful about this.  This is a very strategically planned piece of legislation that is  tailored strictly to meet the needs of the American people regarding  the coronavirus pandemic. To do anything less would not be responsible.  There is more we could have done, but again, we wanted to keep the cost  in line.   When you talk about the cost, you have to think about the opportunity  lost. The Chairman of the Fed has told us to think big. It is never  going to be cheaper, he said, because the cost of interest is so low,  the cost of credit is so low.   And I say, not to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian  way, but it is irresponsible because it is only going to cost more,  more in terms of lives and livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our  democracy, as Governors, city halls, and county executives struggle to  make their budgets so depleted by this virus.   This funding is to make sure that they have the funds to take care of  some of the funding for the coronavirus expenses directly, but also a  recognition of the loss of revenue to their budgets because of this  assault on our economy by this vicious little virus that we must  defeat.   As we do that, Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairwoman for  her extraordinary leadership. She has a few more bills to go, a lot of  time left, a great contribution to make. I had the privilege of serving  with her for decades, and I am sorry to see her leave the Congress, but  she leaves a tremendous legacy.   We all believe that a budget should be a statement of our national  values. What is important to us as a Nation should be reflected in our  budgets and how we allocate our resources.   Chairman Lowey has been just that messenger of values as she has put  forth her budgets, and she does so with respect for the Republicans on  her committee, in this Congress, and in this country. Bipartisanship is  the order of the day.   As a former member of the Appropriations Committee, where I was  forged, and the Intelligence Committee, I recognize full well the  product, as Mr. Cole said, of appropriators working together. I always  say, left to their own devices, they can get the job done, and they  will.   I have no doubt that this legislation will have bipartisan support. I  just want it to be soon because these Governors can't wait. Right now,  as I said, they have many layoffs because they don't have the money.  Are they going to raise property taxes? We can make that go away in  large measure if we pass this legislation because it is not just about  their budgets; it is about the services for the people of our country  that will be lessened if we do not help.    What are we here for, but for the American people? How are their  services delivered? In many ways by the statehouses and the State  legislatures, the city councils, mayors' offices, and the rest. We have  a responsibility to make the strategic spending that we need to do.  That is what this bill does.   It is not for us to praise our heroes. Everybody praises them, thanks  them, and honors them--words. We need deeds, and we need real support  for them. We must always--this is the saddest part, all these people  who have died.   I know, on both sides of the aisle, hearing our colleagues speak,  that all of us will always carry those people in our hearts, 87,000  now. Hopefully, we can curtail the growth of that number with our  testing, but we must make a decision to do so. That is the decision  that we have to make here today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues for their thoughtful and  prayerful consideration of the HEROES Act. I thank all of you for your  concern about the American people. Let us come together and give them a  real signal that we care by allocating the resources to meet their  needs.   We pray for all of them, all of our constituents, and we pray and  thank God for continuing to bless America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support the HEROES Act.
