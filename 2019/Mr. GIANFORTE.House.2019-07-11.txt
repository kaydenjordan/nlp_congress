 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the members of the  House Armed Services Committee for their hard work on this year's  National Defense Authorization Act.   Malmstrom Air Force Base is home to the 341st Missile Wing, which  maintains and operates one-third of the U.S. ICBM force. Servicemembers  at Malmstrom protect our country, but the base can do more to keep  America safe and secure. With some work, the base's runway can, once  again, host flying missions.   I especially thank and recognize Mr. Turner from Ohio. We worked on a  measure that could reform the basing process to focus on improving  existing facilities like Malmstrom instead of building new ones.   This bill begins the process of including Malmstrom in future Air  Force basing decisions to host aircraft, potentially increasing the  number of men and women serving there.   I appreciate the Montana Defense Alliance for its advocacy on behalf  of Great Falls and all the servicemembers at Malmstrom and elsewhere  who keep our country safe.                            ____________________
