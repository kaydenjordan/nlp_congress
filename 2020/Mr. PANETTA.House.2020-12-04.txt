 Mr. Speaker, the coronavirus is exploding, our hospitals  are bursting, and many parts of our economy are hurting. It is no  wonder why Fed Chair Powell and so many other economists are warning  about the long-term damage that could be done if we don't pass another  stimulus package soon.   We passed the CARES Act earlier this year, and that did keep our  economy afloat and our poverty rate flat,  [[Page H6850]]  but because of the pandemic, we are experiencing over 1 million cases a  week and 2,000 deaths a day.   Because of that, we are finding ourselves in more self-induced  economic comas, just like we are seeing in my State of California and  my district on the central coast of California.   We can't wait any longer for another economic package. That is why  Democrats and Republicans of the Problem Solvers Caucus worked with a  bipartisan group of Senators to come up with a targeted and temporary  package of close to $1 trillion to meet our most pressing needs. It is  a compromise that can be a way to ``yes'' for both Houses and both  sides to come together.    Mr. Speaker, it is going to be a dark winter, so it is our obligation  to our constituents to come to the table to negotiate and pass a  pandemic relief package to help us get on the road to recovery this  spring.                            ____________________
