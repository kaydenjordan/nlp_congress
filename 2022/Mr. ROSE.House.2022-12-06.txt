 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Lamborn) for yielding and for claiming the time this evening to  acknowledge and honor our Nation's 81st National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks 81 years since the world changed forever  when Japanese pilots attacked Pearl Harbor, killing 2,403 Americans and  pulling America into the Second World War. We will never forget their  sacrifices.   The day after that infamous day, the National Broadcasting Company,  the leading radio station at the time, began the day with the founders  of the National Bible Association. As the news of the gruesome attack  on U.S. soil broke, producers at NBC requested that the National Bible  Association continue reading the Bible all throughout the day.   Coincidentally, before the attack on Pearl Harbor, President  Roosevelt had invited the founders of the National Bible Association to  the White House to help commemorate the first National Bible Week.  However, they canceled and left a telegram for President Roosevelt  stating, ``May God bless and guide you in this emergency.''   This story reminds me of Mark 13:31, where Jesus says: ``Heaven and  earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.''   As we recognize our country's 81st National Bible Week, I remember  that although we may choose to leave God's words behind, the Lord's  words will never leave us behind.   Every day it seems as though there is a story in the news that shows  our  [[Page H8795]]  country turning away from God. High school football coaches are being  fired for praying on the field. The Bible is no longer being taught in  our schools, and it has become almost scandalous to want to live a life  practicing the traditional Christian values we are taught in the Bible.                                time  1915    But remember, no matter what, the Lord's words will never pass away.  I hope that one day, our country will embrace the Lord again.   As a devoted Christian, I am proud to recognize National Bible Week,  and I pray I will be able to bring more souls to know Jesus Christ as  their Lord and Savior. But until then, may God continue to bless our  great Nation.
