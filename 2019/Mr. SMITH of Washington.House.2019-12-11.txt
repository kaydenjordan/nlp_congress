 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  758, I call up the conference report on the bill (S. 1790) to authorize  appropriations for fiscal year 2020 for military activities of the  Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense  activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel  strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material on the conference report  to accompany S. 1790.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, this was not an easy process. This is an incredibly  important piece of legislation. It authorizes the Department of  Defense. It basically gives the authority to the men and women who work  at the Department of Defense to implement our national security policy  and defend this country. And there is a lot of money, a lot of policy,  and a lot of people interested in it.   We also have the problem that we have a divided government. We have a  Republican President, a Republican Senate, and a Democratic House, who  do not agree on a lot of issues. And those are the issues that tend to  get focused on.   But what this conference report reflects, for the most part, is that  we do agree on a lot; about 90 to 95 percent of what we were  negotiating there was substantial agreement on: doing oversight of the  Pentagon to make sure our taxpayer dollars are well spent and to make  sure that the men and women serving in our Armed Forces, who we are  asking to put their lives on the line to defend our country, will have  the training, the equipment, and the support they need to carry out  that mission. And there are more provisions than I can count in this  bill that help them do just that.   We all, in a bipartisan way, should be very proud of that  accomplishment.   I think, ultimately, the biggest difference between where the  Democrats in the House were at and where the Republicans in the Senate  were at: We believe in more aggressive legislative oversight,  particularly when it comes to matters of engaging in military action.   We remain deeply concerned about the war in Yemen. Now, it is not our  war. Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser degree, the UAE are engaged in that,  but we do support them. We want to make sure that we are not supporting  them in a way that is contrary to our values and contrary to peace in  the region.   Regrettably, we were not able to get the President, primarily, to  agree on that, but I think it is something we need to continue to put  pressure on.   We also believe that we shouldn't go to war without congressional  authority. We will continue to fight about that. We have the 2001 AUMF  and the 2002 AUMF still on the books 17, 18 years later. We need to  update that. We need to make sure that we don't go to war with Iran  without authorization.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional  30 seconds.   All of that said, ultimately, we pulled together what is an excellent  piece of legislation. The two big things I want to highlight in the  moments I have left:   We finally repealed the widow's tax. After 25 years of claiming we  were going to do it, this bill does it.   And we also give paid parental leave for all Federal employees.   I believe both of these things are integral to national defense. The  people are the ones who give us the national security. Taking care of  widows, taking care of employees is incredibly important. It was not  easy to do. We did it in this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the conference report, and I  reserve the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper), the chair of the Subcommittee on  Strategic Forces.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), chair of the  Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the chair of  the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), who is the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Readiness.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier), who is the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Military Personnel.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), who is the chair of the  Subcommittee on Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Madam Speaker, I just point out that there was nothing in the House  bill or any bill that would have ended the war in Yemen. It is not just  Orwellian to say that. It is breathtakingly dishonest to tell people  out there that there was something we could have done to end the war in  Yemen. We need to work hard to bring a peaceful solution to that  conflict. Being dishonest with the American public does not accomplish  that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Brown).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff),  [[Page H10088]]  the distinguished chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much  time each side has left.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close at  this time. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   As I said at the opening, this was an extraordinarily difficult  process. It is worth noting this final conference report also is not  anywhere close to what was passed out of the Senate. In fact, of the  nearly 1,400 provisions that were adopted, 70 percent of them were  House provisions. The House firmly put its stamp on this bill in a  bipartisan way, and I think the policies we adopted were very positive.   We tried to do more in this bill than has been attempted to do in an  NDAA in the 23 years that I have been here, and I am proud of that. We  didn't get everything, but we tried to do everything that we could,  that we felt was important for the national security of this country  and for our interests.   I am particularly disappointed that we weren't able to get some of  the provisions to help reduce the U.S. influence on the war in Yemen. I  completely agree with that. My quibble is with the fact that there was  something we could have done to stop it completely. But the  humanitarian crisis in Yemen is the greatest humanitarian crisis around  the globe right now. If there is anything we can do to reduce that, we  need to do it.   I will say that the pressure that was put on by the House-passed bill  that called for cutting off aid to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the  military aid, has put some pressure over there. The UAE has almost  unilaterally or almost completely pulled out of Yemen, and they  recently signed a peace deal with the southern part of Yemen to resolve  some aspect of that complex civil war.   Make no mistake about it, that is enormously important to me, and I  will continue to fight to get it done.   Lastly, I want to say this process, I think, has been incredibly  productive. The amount of work that the staff behind us and more people  than I could possibly count or name did to make this possible cannot be  overstated. It was an incredible amount of work, and it is so  important.   We are in an incredibly divisive time. There are people who are upset  about just about everything, sometimes justified, sometimes not.   Passing legislation in a democracy when we have to take into account  all of those voices is both extraordinarily difficult and unbelievably  important. We have to show the world that representative democracy  works, that we can listen to the people. You don't have to be a  dictatorship. You can listen to a bunch of people and still get a  product done that meets the needs of the people.   That is what we did in the defense bill. I will also say it is what  we have done in a couple of other bills. The agriculture and  immigration bill that we will vote on as part of this was another  example of that getting done. We are now working, knock on wood, to  pass the appropriations bills in that same spirit.    I hope we don't lose that spirit. I hope we don't realize that just  because when you participate in a representative democratic process and  you don't get everything you want, that that means the process didn't  work. Quite the opposite. The fact that you have that voice, the  ability to say your piece and advocate for what you want, it is  essential to freedom, essential to this country. Frankly, I think it is  essential to peace and stability throughout the globe. We should  continue to advocate for that passionately.  [[Page H10091]]    I thank all who were involved. This was a lengthy but important  undertaking. Ultimately, we produced something that I am very, very  proud of. I don't want to speak for anybody else. I know there are  probably a lot of people who are, but just for my part, I am incredibly  proud of what I was a part of creating. I think it represents the best  of our country and the best of this body, and I urge everybody to vote  for it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
