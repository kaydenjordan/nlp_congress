 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Her Eminence  Robiamny Balcacer, the Dominican Republic's first female Minister of  Youth in the nation's history.   Since a young age, Minister Balcacer has been critical in youth  political and social welfare activities within her community of Las  Guaranas.   After graduating college with a bachelor's degree in business  administration and a master's degree in public management and modern  public administration techniques, she was elected councilwoman in 2006  and, eventually, elected president of the Councilmembers Board,  becoming the youngest woman in history to lead it.   As Minister of Youth, she has quickly garnered praise for her work in  low-income communities throughout the Dominican Republic. She has  invested in social and workforce development programs intended to  reduce crime and strengthen community relationships, including  constructing brand-new community computing centers and playgrounds.   Her work has attracted the attention of Dominican American community  leaders in my district and all across the country, and I had the honor  of meeting Minister Balcacer this morning. I am glad that she is  joining us today in the gallery as her work is being recognized here on  the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I welcome Minister Balcacer.                            ____________________
