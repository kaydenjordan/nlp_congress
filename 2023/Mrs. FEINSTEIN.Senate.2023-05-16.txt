 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Help Independent Tracks Succeed (HITS)  [[Page S1681]]  Act, which Senator Blackburn and I introduced today. Representatives  Linda Sanchez and Ron Estes have introduced companion legislation in  the House of Representatives.   The U.S. Tax Code allows film, television, and theater productions to  fully deduct production expenses in the year they are incurred.   However, recording artists are not given the same treatment and  instead must amortize their production expenses over a number of years.   Moreover, many live performance stages and venues across the country  closed for months as a result of the pandemic. Independent musicians  and music makers, including both technicians and creators, suffered  more than most other professions during this period, and many continue  to recover.   Our bill would provide a measure of relief to music creators by  allowing independent musicians, technicians, and music producers to  deduct the costs of producing new musical and other sound recordings in  the year they are incurred, thereby putting them on a level playing  field with film, television, and theater productions.   Specifically, the bill would allow qualified sound recording  producers to deduct 100% of recording production expenses--up to  $150,000--in the year they are incurred, rather than in later years.   Because this change would simply accelerate a tax deduction that  already exists, the bill's cost would be modest.   In addition, because the deduction would be capped at $150,000 per  production, our legislation would benefit smaller, independent  musicians and music producers rather than large companies.   Music has inspired, comforted, and entertained each of us. Our bill  would help create parity between musical creators and other creative  producers and stimulate a sector of the economy that is a fundamental  part of each of our lives.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Moran):   S. 1628. A bill to prioritize funding for an expanded and sustained  national investment in agriculture research; to the Committee on  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
