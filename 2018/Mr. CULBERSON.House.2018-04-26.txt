 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  participating tonight may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic  of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege tonight to pay tribute  to the life of a great Texan and a great American: Barbara Pierce Bush.   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Burgess), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those remarks.   Barbara Bush and George H.W. Bush do exemplify all of the greatest  character traits that made the Greatest Generation what it is and made  this country what it is. It has been a privilege to represent the Bush  family and to succeed George H.W. Bush in Congress, who was followed by  Bill Archer.  [[Page H3696]]  I succeeded Bill Archer. He was chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee. He succeeded George H.W. Bush. The Bush family is revered  nationwide and admired and revered by all of us in Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be joined tonight by my colleague from  Dallas.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) to  honor the life of Barbara Bush.    Mr. Speaker, my colleague is right. All of America is  better because Barbara Bush has lived. All of us are better people for  having known and admired Barbara Bush. She has been a source of  inspiration to me, as I know she has been to my colleague from Dallas  and the millions of Americans.   People from all over the world poured into Houston to celebrate her  life and to pay tribute to her as she lay in repose at St. Martin's  Episcopal Church, people from all walks of life.                                time  1900    As my colleague, Dr. Burgess, said, she, in a very simple gesture,  with a patient who was ill with HIV, broke down the stigma that people  felt, the fear people felt that HIV might be contagious. Barbara Bush  just acted instinctively, as she always did, with courage and  compassion, in hugging that young man that was ill and demonstrating to  the world that no one needed to fear people who were ill with HIV. And  now that disease has been contained and rolled back. It is a treatable  condition.   She devoted her life to, as my colleague from Dallas said, helping  those who were less fortunate.   Barbara Bush was born in 1925, June 8, in New York City. And as my  colleague, Dr. Burgess said, she was one of only two women in American  history who was both a wife and a mother to a United States President.  She was the wife of the 41st President, George H.W. Bush; and mother to  the 43rd President, George W. Bush.   Barbara was only 18 years old when she married George Herbert Walker  Bush in 1945. They had six children together over the course of their  marriage.   As First Lady, she is best remembered for her untiring advocacy for  universal literacy, and she founded the Barbara Bush Foundation for  Family Literacy.   She first met George at a Christmas dance in Connecticut in 1941 when  she was 16 and he was 17. George Bush asked a friend if he knew  Barbara, and the two were officially introduced, but when the waltz  began to play, they sat out the dance, because he did not know how to  waltz. So they just spent their time getting to know each other.   As they spent more and more time together and fell in love, shortly  after George's 18th birthday, they both became each other's first kiss.   Their engagement was officially announced in the newspaper in  December of 1943. George was on leave during Christmas as a Navy pilot,  and they were reunited over that Christmas in 1943. Two weeks later, on  January 6, 1945, George and Barbara were married.   Barbara Bush told Time magazine in 1989 that: ``I married the first  man I ever kissed, and when I tell this to my children, they just about  throw up.''   While George was away at war, the two wrote letters to each other as  their only means of communication. They were deeply and passionately in  love, and she kept her sense of humor right to the very end.   In a letter to Barbara, George wrote, during the course of the war,  he said: ``I have climbed perhaps the highest mountain in the world,  but even that cannot hold a candle to being Barbara's husband.''   In another letter dated December 12, 1943, George wrote to his  darling Bar about his happiness in reading their engagement  announcement in the newspaper: ``I love you, Precious, with all my  heart. And to know that you love me means my life. How often I have  thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day, how  lucky our children will be to have a mother like you.''   This letter was released shortly after her passing.   She was an extraordinary woman, an inspiration to all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson). I  am honored to be joined tonight by my colleague from the 22nd District  of Texas.    America is a far better place because Barbara Bush  lived. She has been an inspiration to all of us.   George H.W. Bush has been a leader in Texas. He started out his  career as the Harris County Republican Party chairman and was elected  to Congress in 1966, and a new district was created on the west side,  the Seventh District.   When George Bush came into this House Chamber, he was assigned to the  Ways and Means Committee. He served on the Ways and Means Committee for  two terms. Then he ran for the United States Senate in 1970, and he ran  against Lloyd Benson in that race, and then he moved on to become the  United Nations Ambassador.   Then George Bush's successor in Congress, Bill Archer, who was  elected in 1970, went on to become chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee. Chairman Archer served there from 1970 to 2001, when it was  my privilege to succeed Bill Archer. And I joined the Appropriations  Committee. Right now, I chair a subcommittee.   The United States is very, very fortunate in that another Texan has  stepped up to serve as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,  Congressman Kevin Brady, who joins us here tonight. He represents the  Woodlands and the Eighth Congressional District.   As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he just successfully  passed the largest tax cut in American history, which is already doing  remarkable things to rejuvenate the American economy and to restore  immense prosperity to this Nation coast to coast, something that I know  George and Barbara Bush are immensely proud of.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady). We  are honored to have him join us tonight in celebrating the life of  Barbara Bush.    Mr. Speaker, as George H.W. Bush's successor,  representing the Seventh District, as I said, I succeeded Bill Archer,  I am keenly aware as well every day that I have the privilege of  representing the Seventh District, that I have an especially high  standard to live up to, the Bush standard of absolutely impeccable  integrity, honor, and consistency.   The Proverbs tell us that our greatest possession on Earth is our  good name, worth more than all the gold and the silver in the world.  And by that measure, the Bush family--Barbara Bush, George Bush, the  entire Bush family--are the wealthiest people on Earth.   In a memoir that Barbara wrote in 1994, looking back on their 50-plus  years of marriage, she wrote that George and she were ``the two  luckiest people in the world.''   She said: ``And when all the dust is settled and all the crowds are  gone, the things that matter are faith, family, and friends. We have  been inordinately blessed, and we know that.''   According to their granddaughter, Jenna Bush Hager, Barbara and  George gave thanks every night for their blessings and for each other  in their prayers. Each night before bed, George H.W. still said, ``I  love you, Barbie,'' to his wife, according to Jenna.   When the Bushes first came to Texas, they settled in west Texas and  went into the oil business.   We are privileged tonight to be joined by the chairman of the  Agriculture Committee, the Congressman representing Midland and Odessa,  the Bushes first home in Texas, the gentleman from west Texas, Mike  Conaway. We are delighted to have him with us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Conaway very much for  his comments.   When Barbara and George lived in the Midland-Odessa area early in  their marriage is when they lost their daughter, Robin. It, of course,  is an unimaginable and unbearable loss to lose a child. But Robin was  carried away by leukemia, and the Bushes devoted much of their lives to  raise money for leukemia research, to defeat that terrible disease, to  raise awareness of the disease, to give hope to others; because when  they lost Robin in 1953, there wasn't really anything the doctors could  do.   It is a great tribute to them both that they were so heavily involved  in helping to raise money for cancer research to fight leukemia through  the Texas Medical Center. MD Anderson, one of the greatest cancer  hospitals in the world, is located in the Texas Medical Center on the  edge of my district, and it has been my privilege as the chairman of a  subcommittee on Appropriations to spearhead record increases in funding  for the National Institutes of Health to help fight childhood cancers  like leukemia. The Bushes were an integral part of that. They have done  immeasurable good in so many ways and touched so many lives and  inspired so many people all over the United States and throughout  Texas.   I know that all of us in the Texas delegation, all of us across the  country, are praying for the Bush family and share in their grief. But  we also have the sure knowledge that Barbara Bush is in a better place;  that she has been reunited with her daughter, Robin, and that she was  at peace.   Mr. Speaker, we are honored tonight to be joined by my colleague from  Houston, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who joins us here tonight to  pay tribute to the life of this remarkable and extraordinary First  Lady, Barbara Bush.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee)    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Houston for  joining us tonight to honor the life of this great woman, Barbara  Pierce Bush, who, as my colleague mentioned, was a national leader in  literacy, focused her efforts as First Lady on building literacy in the  United States, and, in fact, in a televised event, an event that  really, I think, symbolizes who Barbara Bush was and how big her heart  was and the way she treated everyone that she met.   It was an event celebrating the bicentennial of the Constitution  where Barbara Bush met a man named J.T. Pace, who was a 63-year-old son  of a sharecropper, who had only recently become literate and able to  read.   And he was scheduled to read the Constitution's preamble out loud in  front of a large audience, Barbara Bush instinctively understood that  he was very, very nervous. She quietly slipped up alongside him and  asked him if she could help him read it out loud while standing next to  him.   Mr. Pace was very grateful and said, yes, of course. And soon they  went up on stage together and began reading out loud the preamble of  the Constitution.   As Barbara Bush detected that Mr. Pace became more comfortable in  reading in public, she continued to lower her voice until only his  voice could be heard. And he suddenly realized that he was reading the  preamble to the Constitution in front of this huge audience on his own.   Well, it brought tears to his eyes because Barbara Bush had stood  alongside him, understood his fear and anxiety, had lifted him up, and  given him the confidence that he needed to complete the task, and  allowed Mr. Pace to find his own voice.   She was an extraordinary woman, and I feel humbled every day to  represent the Bushes, to be their Congressman, to follow in his  footsteps, to follow in her footsteps, and to do my very best to live  up to the very high standards that they set for all of us as Americans,  and especially as public servants.   Every day that I have this privilege, I remember the standard that  she set for all of us, the standards that she set for her family.   Her granddaughter, Jenna Bush Hager, explained why her Ganny was  given the nickname ``The Enforcer.'' Jenna explained that there were a  few simple rules that her grandmother followed: Treat everyone equally;  don't look down on anyone; use your voice for good; and read all the  great books.   Barbara loved her family more than anything else on Earth. As she  liked to tell people repeatedly: In the end, when all the dust is  settled, when all the crowds are gone, the things that matter most are  faith, family, and friends.   She was abundantly blessed. In fact, her most prized possession was a  painted cow, because when her husband, George, saw that Barbara had  swooned over the painted cow statues installed around Houston in 2001,  he decided to surprise her with one. But as the former President paced  a warehouse full of colorful works of cows painted by local artists  with his longtime chief of staff Gene Becker, President Bush could not  decide which one his wife would like best.   So he bought a blank one, and, as he expected, Mrs. Bush turned it  into a family art project.   They had the white cow placed on the lawn of the family seaside home  in Kennebunkport, Maine, and in the years since, she and George had  each of their 5 children, 17 grandchildren, and 8-and-counting great- grandchildren decorate the cow with handprints and autographs, and it  became her most prized possession because it symbolized their entire  family and their deep bond of love and affection for each other.   Barbara Bush taught that humor, wit, and grace were the best  accessories that a woman could wear. Jenna Bush Hager shared that her  Ganny embodied uniqueness and authenticity, from her mismatched Keds,  her pearl earrings, to her snow white hair.   Barbara Bush always stressed the importance of internal beauty  because, as she said, your looks will fade, but your kind words and the  way you make people feel will be remembered by people forever, and you  are measured by the love of those around you and how you have loved  them.   Her family members stated that she was the glue that held them all  together. In a eulogy by her son Jeb, he stated that his mom was his  first and most important teacher. She taught him to, ``sit up, look  people in the eye, say please and thank you, quit whining and stop  complaining, and eat your broccoli.''   The little things that she taught turned into bigger life lessons.  ``Be  [[Page H3701]]  kind, always tell the truth, never discourage anyone. Serve others,  treat everyone as you would want to be treated, and love your God with  all your heart and all your soul.''   At Barbara's funeral, Jeb Bush told a story of the last time his  mother was in the hospital. He said that his father, in Jeb's opinion,  probably got sick on purpose just so he could go visit Barbara.   When George went into her room, he had a breathing mask over his  face, a hospital gown. His hair was uncombed--in fact, standing  straight up--and as he walked into Barbara's hospital room and held her  hand, Barbara opened her eyes, took one look at him, and said, ``My  God, George, you are devastatingly handsome.''   She kept her sense of humor and her perspective and her joy and love  for her family right to the end.   When Jeb asked her how she felt about dying, Barbara stated that she  knew that Jesus was her Lord and savior. She said she did not want to  leave her husband, but she knew she would be in a beautiful place.   We know that Barbara is now reunited with her daughter Robin, who  passed away when she was 3 due to leukemia. And as George W. Bush said  at the end of his mother's life, although ``Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and  I are sad, our souls are settled because we know hers was.''   We are all blessed as Americans, we are certainly blessed as Texans,  as Houstonians, to be neighbors, to be friends, to have known this  great good woman and this extraordinary family, the Bush family, that  has exemplified everything that has made America great: integrity,  duty, courage, commitment, self-reliance, religious faith, devotion to  family, the benefits of hard work, and remembering that your good name  is your most valuable possession worth more than all the gold and  silver in the world.    And truly by that measure, the Bushes are the wealthiest people on  Earth, and we are all so very fortunate to have known them, to have  learned from them, to be inspired by them, as I continue to be every  day as the Congressman from the Seventh District of Texas.   Every day that I represent this extraordinary district and these  amazing people in Houston, who all stepped up and helped each other  during Hurricane Harvey--and the Bushes were right there helping their  neighbors and friends--every day that I have the privilege to represent  this great city in this wonderful and amazing place, the Congress of  the United States of America, I will always remember the standard of  integrity that the Bush family left for me and for all of us. And I  will work very, very hard to continue to make Barbara and George Bush  and the Bush family and all Houstonians proud of my work on their  behalf, because we are all abundantly blessed to have had Barbara Bush  as First Lady, as a role model and a mentor, but we know that she is in  a better place and is reunited with her daughter Robin. And as George  W. said: We are all sad for the loss, but our souls are settled because  we know hers was.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
