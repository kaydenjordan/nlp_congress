 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2954.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to give all  members 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, this night, and this Women's History  Month, together with my colleagues in the Pro-Choice Caucus, I rise in  support of the women of the reproductive rights movement. Women who  stood up, spoke out, and reached out to protect the rights of women in  this country to determine whether and when to become parents. Of  course, this work required and requires to this day, a broad, bold  coalition of people, people whose work has necessitated tremendous  sacrifice and has resulted in tremendous progress.   Some of them were denied access to contraception, abortion care, and  healthcare, and agreed to become the face of legal challenges. Some of  them were strategists who shaped the arguments that became the fabric  of legal protections for reproductive rights.   Some of them were healthcare providers who saw the tragic  consequences of the denial of those rights. As a lawyer, I have known  some of their names through the landmark cases that bear them--Griswold  v. Connecticut, Roe v. Wade, and more.   Tonight, we celebrate them, we celebrate their courage, their  commitment, and their purpose in articulating, advocating, and ensuring  the rights to equality, privacy, and dignity that their work  represents.   Before yielding to my colleagues who are here this evening in person  and in spirit, I will start with one of them who holds a special place  in this work and in my own life. As a woman from Texas, it has always  been a source of great pride that some fearless Texas women have been  leaders in this fight.   In the late 1960s, a group of Texas women came together to challenge  our State's ban on abortion. They found as their lawyer and lifelong  advocate, a young woman named Sarah Weddington, who is pictured here  behind me. A recent law school graduate, Sarah Weddington was working  for the University of Texas at that time. Perhaps not surprisingly,  although she had good grades and a law degree, she had a hard time  finding a job in a law firm. But she was working to help people solve  their problems in Austin, and this group knew she would be a good  advocate.   I heard her tell the story once that when the group came to see her,  they told her that they thought the best way to deal with the law was  to challenge the law itself. She said that she had a law degree, but  she really hadn't practiced in Federal court before. She wasn't a  courtroom lawyer, and she hadn't handled a case like this one. So she  told them she thought they should get someone with more experience.   She recalled to us they asked her, Well, what would you charge us to  do this lawsuit?   And she said, Oh, I will do it for free.   And they said, You are our lawyer.   And that is how she got the case.   Sarah called her law school classmate, Linda Coffee, and they agreed  to work on the case together. Many UT law students and professors  helped Sarah and Linda with the case. They heard from women, of course,  and from doctors who treated women who had had complications from  illegal abortions and women who had died from illegal abortions.  [[Page H3965]]    Through their work, the strategizing, the organizing, the lawyering,  these trailblazing Texas women brought us the framework to protect the  health, privacy, dignity, equality, and freedom of women and families  across this country in the case of Roe v. Wade. And 26-year-old Sarah  Weddington and this team of Texas women took that case all the way to  the United States Supreme Court.   On January 22, 1973, the Court ruled in one of the most consequential  decisions in American history, the Texas State law banning abortions,  except to save a woman's life, was unconstitutional.                                time  1945    Sarah carried this fight with her for the rest of her life. She was  elected to the Texas legislature. She served in the Carter  administration where she helped get more women on the Federal bench.  She worked for many years as a lecturer and professor teaching at  schools, including the University of Texas.   This year, 2022, was the first one that we marked the anniversary of  Roe without Sarah Weddington. She left a legacy for us through her  life's work, the rights and protections for the health, privacy,  dignity, equality, and freedom of women and families enshrined in that  decision that has shaped our country and our opportunities as women for  the last 50 years.   She was part of a generation of trailblazing Texas women who made it  their life's work to make our world one of equality, opportunity, and  possibility for women. It is fitting to remember, honor, and celebrate  her tonight.   Madam Speaker, several of my colleagues are here to remember and  honor other women pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes of the  reproductive rights movement.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Stevens).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Veasey).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Veasey and I join him in  his remarks that we are so grateful to our State legislators and the  Members of our Texas delegation as we face these challenges at home.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Manning).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Manning for the  important points that she made, talking about the importance of access  to safe abortions.   Even today, the World Health Organization estimates that 47,000 women  die from unsafe abortions each year. That is 13 percent of maternal  deaths worldwide.   Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from New  Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Kuster for her  leadership and for her impactful story here tonight, one of the many  women of this reproductive rights movement.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois  Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Frankel for  sharing her stories from Florida.   At this time, it is a pleasure to yield to the gentleman from the  great State of Texas (Mr. Green).                                time  2015     Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Green.   Madam Speaker, I have worked closely with my colleagues in the Pro- Choice Caucus to identify stories that need to be told during this  Special Order hour this evening. I am grateful to my colleagues who  have taken to the floor this evening to share with us the stories of  their constituents, to share with us the stories of those who they know  have been fighters for reproductive rights, for reproductive justice,  for choice.   One of our Pro-Choice Caucus leaders could not be with us tonight but  has submitted a statement for the record that I would like to read now.  From Representative Judy Chu:   ``I rise today to honor the women of the abortion rights movement who  [[Page H3968]]  have come before us. I remember what it was like before the days of  Roe. So today, I am helping to remember and honor those who gave their  lives, who put their own bodies in harm's way so that we might have the  ability to decide what to do with ours.   ``Women like Pam, who lives in my district in Pasadena, California-- Pam is in her seventies, retired, and spends her time volunteering in  her community. But Pam told me about a time when she was 22 years old.  It was 1969, and even though she and her partner had been using birth  control, Pam found out she was pregnant.   ``This happened in the days before Roe v. Wade, which meant that her  options were limited. That is how Pam found herself standing on the  curb of an airport in Mexico City, waiting for someone to pick her up.  Finally, a large black car came up and rolled down the window. `Are you  Pam?' the driver asked. `Yes,' she replied, and got in the car, forced  to trust and hope for the best. Thankfully, Pam wasn't hurt during this  experience, but she told me she has never forgotten the fear and  uncertainty of putting her life in the hands of a stranger who could  have hurt her and abused her, especially when we know that this is a  procedure that is safe and can be done in a doctor's office, not  someplace unknown and unsafe.   ``That is why, now, Pam is determined to ensure that no one ever  feels as scared and alone as she did that day. Pam volunteers at the  Planned Parenthood Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley, serving as a  support system to women who need a hand to hold or a shoulder to lean  on. Pam is an abortion advocate in her community because she believes,  like I do, that everyone, no matter where they grew up, what language  they speak, or how much money they make, deserves to have a say in what  happens to their bodies.   ``I rise today, as part of Women's History Month, to honor Pam and so  many others like her who were forced to make history so that others  could have the choices that they were denied. The fight for  reproductive rights would not be where it is today without advocates  like Pam who stand up, time and time again, and demand that women have  the right to decide.''   Madam Speaker, this evening, the Pro-Choice Caucus and I also want to  recognize the women who launched and built the groundbreaking  reproductive justice movement. While women of color have long fought  for these principles, ``reproductive justice'' as a term was coined in  1994 when a group of Black women gathered in Chicago ahead of the  International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo.   Loretta Ross is one of a number of women who built the reproductive  justice movement. She was part of the 1994 meeting and went on to co- found the organization SisterSong, which defines ``reproductive  justice'' as the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy; to  have children, not have children; and to parent the children we have in  safe and sustainable communities.   A scholar who teaches both at Smith College and who has published  extensively on reproductive justice, she recently testified at the  House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in this legislative  session.   Dorothy Roberts is another pioneer of the reproductive justice  movement. From Pennsylvania, she is also considered one of the leaders.   There have been many leaders in our government and in our communities  who we celebrate tonight. We, in the Pro-Choice Caucus, have identified  a few women who we want to highlight this evening.   I will start with some of the lawmakers and legislators who helped  pave the way, including Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected  to Congress in 1968. She was also the first Black woman to run  for President. Throughout her trailblazing career, she was a strong  supporter of reproductive rights.    In 1969, she was named honorary president of the National Abortion  Rights Action League, NARAL. In 1970, she supported legalized abortion  in her home State of New York. In 1970, she described abortion as an  issue of economic and racial justice.   Louise Slaughter, a longtime Member from New York and chairwoman of  the Rules Committee, during her long tenure in Congress, served as a  founder and co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus.   In addition to championing legislation to protect and expand access  to abortion and contraception, Representative Slaughter condemned  efforts to expand the so-called conscience protections at the expense  of healthcare access and was an early leader on marriage equality.   First elected in 1972, Pat Schroeder was one of only 14 women in the  House at the time of the January 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. When a male  colleague asked her how she could be a mother of two small children and  a Member of Congress at the same time, she famously replied: ``I have a  brain and a uterus, and I use both.''   Other figures who are large in the women's reproductive rights  movement, of course, must include Ellen Malcolm, who, in 1985, led a  group of friends in creating an organization dedicated to electing pro- choice Democratic women, giving them the credibility and resources that  they needed through her organization, EMILY's List.   We began this evening talking about Sarah Weddington, and there are  many lawyers and judges who have been a part of this movement at some  time in their careers, including, famously, of course, Justice Ruth  Bader Ginsburg, Kathryn Kolbert, Priscilla Smith, and Linda Coffee.   Of course, we heard from several people tonight, several of our  Members, about the work done in their local communities at Planned  Parenthood health centers across the country. As we touch on some of  these important women leaders in our community and our country, we  certainly recognize the leadership that we have seen at Planned  Parenthood health centers, including Faye Wattleton, who was the first  Black woman to serve as the president of the Planned Parenthood  Federation of America, as well as the youngest; Cecile Richards, who  was president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the  Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and she is the daughter of the late  Texas Governor, another champion for reproductive rights, women's  rights, and women's equality, Ann Richards.   Alexis McGill Johnson, the current president and CEO of the Planned  Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action  Fund, is in charge of and oversees Planned Parenthood's vital health  services to 2.4 million people each year through more than 600 health  centers across the country. She is a champion for social and racial  justice, a respected political and cultural organizer, and a tireless  advocate for reproductive freedom.   The National Abortion Rights Action League, which I mentioned  earlier, has always had an incredible role to play in the fight for  reproductive rights. Its leaders--Karen Mulhauser, Nanette Falkenberg,  Kate Michelman, Nancy Keenan, Ilyse Hogue, and, today, Mini Timmaraju-- have left an incredible mark.   The Guttmacher Institute and its current leadership under Dr.  Herminia Palacio--the Guttmacher Institute's mission is to advance  sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States and  across the globe.   There are so many people, so many women, who have come together  around these issues, who have come together to protect the health, the  equality, the autonomy, and the dignity of women across this country.  Whether named or not this evening on the floor, those are the people  who we celebrate tonight.   Madam Speaker, we began this hour with a celebration of trailblazing,  fearless women from my home State of Texas. I am so grateful to my  colleagues from Texas who joined me this evening and to my colleagues  from across the country who spoke out tonight.   Today in Texas, and across the country, reproductive rights are under  attack. The passage of the draconian Senate Bill 8 in Texas, which  Representative Stevens discussed, which Representative Veasey  discussed, has created a healthcare crisis for women and healthcare  providers across our State. Sadly, but not surprisingly, other States  are quickly following suit.   As we have seen, and as we have heard from some of our colleagues  this evening, it is not merely abortion. Advocates with cases pending  before the  [[Page H3969]]  United States Supreme Court today, including Dobbs v. Jackson Women's  Health Organization, are arguing that the protections recognized in Roe  v. Wade and Griswold v. Connecticut, which gave married couples the  right to use birth control, that those principles should be rejected.   This is alarming. This is terrifying. This is not what the majority  of Americans want. It is not what people have fought so hard for so  long to achieve.   That is why it is so important that this evening we remember and  honor the work that people have done to ensure reproductive rights,  reproductive health, and reproductive justice. It is also important  that we recommit ourselves to continuing that work.   As my colleagues noted, in September, thanks to the leadership of  Representative Judy Chu and the Pro-Choice Caucus, the House passed the  Women's Health Protection Act to protect the right to access abortion  care against restrictions and bans in every State in our Union.   Passing this legislation is a critical step toward creating a world  where every person, whoever they are, wherever they live, whatever  their circumstances, is free to make the best healthcare and personal  decisions for themselves, their families, and their futures.   We must continue to defend and protect the fundamental rights  essential to our autonomy, our dignity, and our equality that are  represented in the case of Roe v. Wade and the Women's Health  Protection Act.   In times like these, it is important to me to remember, and it is  important for all of us to remember, that Texas gave us S.B. 8, but it  also gave us Sarah Weddington, Loretta Ross, Cecile Richards, and so  many other people who we talked about this evening and who we know have  been champions for women's health, women's reproductive rights, and  reproductive justice.                                time  2030     Like women across the country, from New Hampshire to  North Carolina to Florida to Michigan to California, all of whom spoke  this evening, Texas women have fought and will continue to fight for  the right to safe, legal, accessible abortion care, to reproductive  healthcare, and to reproductive justice. I am proud to be one of them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
