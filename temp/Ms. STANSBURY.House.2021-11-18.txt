 Madam Speaker, I want to take a moment this evening to  dedicate my remarks to my dear friends Jon Baran, Caitie Padilla, and  their beautiful daughter, Sophie.   This week, we celebrated the signing of the bipartisan infrastructure  bill. Now, it is time to pass the other half of the President's agenda  to ensure that our families and our communities can build a brighter,  more just, more equitable, and more sustainable future.   As a proud daughter of New Mexico, I represent the strong, beautiful,  resilient people of New Mexico's First Congressional District. Over the  pandemic, we have used every ounce of our grit, our determination, and  our heart to get by. Yet, so many families are still struggling.   That is why we must pass the Build Back Better Act and why it is a  must-pass bill for New Mexico.   We must invest in healthcare and community well-being. We must invest  in universal pre-K. We must invest in childcare and caring for our  elders.    Madam Speaker, we must invest in addressing global  climate change because that is our charge. Our communities are counting  on us, and that is why we must deliver this bill tonight.                                time  1845
