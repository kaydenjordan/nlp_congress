 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the  gentleman from South Carolina's resolution condemning the recent  remarks of our colleague Steven King.   As we celebrate the 90th birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., he  indicated that ``there comes a time when one must take a position that  is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because  conscience tells him that it is right.''   Unfortunately, the recent rhetoric of Mr. King not only highlights  the wrongs of our nation's dark past, but it promotes a spirit of  division, bitterness and fear.   At a time when our nation is looking to its leaders to bring  confidence and security, we must take the steps toward unity and seek  out understanding and denounce thoughts that are divisive.   There is no room for such rhetoric in the most diverse Congress ever  and I stand with my colleagues to censure Congressman Steven King.
