 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished minority  leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, let me say I am not here to defend any comments or actions  made by Representative Gosar or his staff. Let me be clear. I condemn  all acts of violence.   In fact, I am a recent victim of violence. Just a few months ago, a  political activist attempted to run me over with his car. When this  happened, I immediately contacted law enforcement.   If a Member of Congress, anywhere, anytime, feels threatened, they  should contact the police.   Unfortunately, this posted video is not the first video or statement  by a Member of Congress inciting or depicting violence. Members on both  sides of the aisle have made choices that I surely wouldn't have made.   But as the ranking member of the House Ethics Committee, I find  myself on the floor now for the second time this year to address an  issue that has been referred to the Ethics Committee but which has seen  no committee process before coming to the floor for a vote.   Yesterday afternoon, the majority party drafted this resolution and  scheduled this debate and floor vote today. The House Ethics Committee  has had no time to consider this matter through the Ethics Committee  process.   And there is a process. The nonpartisan staff should have had the  time to research and gather information, and the committee members  should have conversations before making a decision on whether and how  to move forward with any further investigation.   The chairman claims to have reached out to schedule an emergency  committee meeting last night, but the reality is that he did so at a  time when we had just been notified to appear on this resolution in  front of the Rules Committee last night.   Just for the record, the majority controls when this resolution was  introduced, when the Rules Committee was scheduled, when the Ethics  Committee meets, and when the resolution comes to the floor for a vote.  If there is a scheduling conflict or an excuse as to why we are  standing here today rushing this to the floor, it is a conflict that  was totally intended by the majority.   So, here we are today, voting to remove a Representative from his  committee and censure him on the House floor.   Traditionally, Members are placed on committees by their own party,  and they are removed from committees by their own party. Yet, this  majority has broken precedent again and is removing a second Republican  Member during this Congress from their committees.   Let me just say again: Members on both sides of the aisle have made  choices that many of us would not have made.   By rushing this vote to the floor today and ignoring the  institutional process, the majority is setting a precedent again that  may not serve this institution well in the future.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer), the ranking member of the Oversight and Reform  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rice).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I absolutely reject violence and calls for violence  against any Member of Congress or anyone else. But by rushing this vote  to the floor today and ignoring the process, the majority is setting a  precedent that I fear may not serve this institution well in the  future.   The majority should withdraw this resolution, and, if it chooses,  pursue this matter properly through law enforcement and/or the Ethics  Committee.   If the resolution is not withdrawn, then I am going to vote ``no''  and hope at some point that the Ethics Committee will, once again,  serve this body as it was intended.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
