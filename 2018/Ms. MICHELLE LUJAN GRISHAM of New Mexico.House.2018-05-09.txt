 Mr. Speaker, throughout  Military Appreciation Month, I join with my fellow Americans to  remember the brave servicemen and -women who gave the ultimate  sacrifice for this Nation and to honor the servicemembers who are still  answering the call to duty today.   New Mexico is the proud home of over 16,000 patriotic servicemembers,  who operate the premier military installations at Kirtland, Cannon, and  Holloman Air Force Bases, and the Army's White Sands Missile Range.   Thank you for all that you do to keep our country safe and safeguard  the freedoms and values that we all cherish.   I also want to recognize the devoted spouses, children, sisters,  brothers, and parents of our men and women in uniform for their  unending support. This month is dedicated to their service as well.  [[Page H3867]]    I hope everyone in this Chamber and those watching at home will take  the time to thank a servicemember and their loved ones who continue to  sacrifice so much for our country.                            ____________________
