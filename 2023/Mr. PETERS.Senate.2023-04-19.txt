 Mr. President, firefighters are on the front lines of  safeguarding our communities, often providing emergency care and  interacting with high-risk populations. Firefighters themselves may  also be at risk of COVID-19 infections. Vaccines are the safest and  most effective way to make sure an individual doesn't get severely ill  or spread COVID-19 to others.   This amendment would interfere with State and local governments'  ability to determine health policies for their own employees and how to  best keep their communities safe. This amendment would also require  FEMA to evaluate local and State government vaccination policies-- something well beyond the scope and responsibility to determine  eligibility for grants.   I would urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment to ensure that  local communities can continue counting on these resources that these  programs provide.    Mr. President, this amendment is intended to make changes  to an entirely unrelated program that is completely outside of the  scope of this bill. The Emergency Food and Shelter Program is an  important resource that provides aid to those who are at risk of  experiencing hunger. And any changes certainly must be thoroughly  considered. And I look forward to having an opportunity to work with a  sponsor on this amendment in some other manner. However, the bill  before us extends programs that firefighters are counting on to  purchase lifesaving equipment or receive important cancer screenings.  We should not jeopardize the enactment of this incredibly important  bill by putting in completely unrelated matters.    I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.                    Vote on Amendment No. 72, As Modified     Madam President, the funds this amendment targets have  already been obligated to States to help communities continue  recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, at the end of last  year, the Senate unanimously passed legislation led by Senators Cornyn  and Padilla that also allows States and localities to use these funds  to respond to natural disasters and fund infrastructure and community  development projects. Under this amendment, this funding would be  redirected to the U.S. Fire Administration--an account that should be  consistently funded through the annual appropriations process.   Firefighters deserve steady, dedicated funding for their programs.  Redistributing this funding could weaken our Nation's ability to  continue responding to and recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and  would pull funds from a program that is supporting our communities,  families, and small businesses in important ways.   Firefighters and the communities they protect are counting on us to  reauthorize these programs to help them get the safety equipment and  the training they need in order to do their job. We should not have to  choose between supporting our Nation's recovery and investing in our  communities and helping our Nation's firefighters.   I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
