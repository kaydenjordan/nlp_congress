 Madam Chair, I rise as the designee of Chairwoman Lowey,  and I move to strike the last word.    Madam Chair, I am a strong supporter of H.R. 3055, an  appropriations package that makes essential investments in economic  development, the rule of law, agriculture, our public lands, the  environment, our military servicemembers, and our veterans.   I rise today to highlight one particular set of provisions in this  appropriations package that are critical to  [[Page H4879]]  the communities that I represent, the 10-20-30 formula.   This formula requires that at least 10 percent of the funds in the  designated accounts be spent in counties with a poverty rate of at  least 20 percent for the past 30 years.   The Census Bureau has labeled nearly 500 counties as persistent  poverty counties. They are both geographically and ethnically diverse:  largely Black in the Deep South, White in Appalachia, Hispanic in the  southwest, and Native Americans all across the West. They are  politically diverse as well, with nearly three-fourths of them  represented by Republicans, one-fourth by Democrats.   The appropriations bills reported by the Appropriations Committee  apply the 10-20-30 formula or similar funding set-asides to 17  different accounts, three more than in fiscal year 2019. Sixteen of  these accounts are in the package we are considering today, ensuring  persistent poverty counties receive much-needed funds for rural  development.   This 10-20-30 formula has worked well. This year marks the 10th  anniversary of the first time it was enacted in the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act, where it was applied to three accounts.   In the decade since, thanks in no small part to former Appropriations  Committee Chairman Hal Rogers and former Speaker Ryan, 10-20-30  accounts have made thousands of investments in persistent poverty  counties, totaling billions of dollars.                                time  1700    One of these investments was in brownfields cleanup at the Mack  Theater in Irvine, Kentucky, which is in Estill County, Kentucky, in  the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, represented by Mr. Barr.   Community groups have long sought to restore this theater, which  closed in 1993, but previously were unable to address the  contamination. Thanks to 10-20-30, the River City Players, a community  theater group, is working to reopen the venue, which has the potential  to contribute to the revitalization of the entire area.   In addition to the expansion of the 10-20-30 formula in the bill, I  also appreciate the language in the committee reports, which expresses  support for new targeted funding for high-poverty census tracts that  may not be in persistent poverty counties but are often just as much in  need.   I look forward to working with the Appropriations Committee to build  upon this progress to include high-poverty census tracts in fiscal year  2021 and working with my friends Barbara Lee and Stacey Plaskett to  ensure all of the necessary communities and territories are included.   Madam Chair, there are many reasons to support this appropriations  package. I thank the committee for its longstanding collaboration on  10-20-30, and I am hopeful that Members on both sides of the aisle will  support these targeted investments in persistent poverty communities by  supporting this bill.
