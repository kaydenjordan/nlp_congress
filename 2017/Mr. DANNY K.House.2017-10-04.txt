 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  support of the CBC alternative budget, and I commend Representative  Scott and his staff for the tremendous work that they have done.   The CBC budget provides for all of the essentials, including defense  and infrastructure, but what I like most about it is that it is focused  on job creation, rebuilding our veterans' hospitals, rebuilding  infrastructure in our communities, and putting people to work.   Mr. Chairman, my constituents need jobs and opportunities to work.  The CBC budget focuses on jobs. I strongly support it, and I urge all  of my colleagues to do the same.
