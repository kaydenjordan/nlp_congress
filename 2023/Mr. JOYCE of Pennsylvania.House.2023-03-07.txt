 Mr. Speaker, if you lined up the $10  trillion that the Congressional Budget Office reports we will owe as  interest on our national debt, if you line that up in $100 bills, it  would stretch from New York City to Los Angeles and then back again.   This money does nothing to keep us safe, it does nothing to fund  Medicare, and it does nothing to secure our border.   This debt has caused skyrocketing inflation. It has decimated savings  accounts. It has mortgaged our Nation's future all for short-term  political gain.   It is time to stop the runaway spending on Green New Deal priorities  that fail to help the American people.   When President Biden unveils his budget on Thursday, it must include  a plan to reduce our debt. It must return to commonsense fiscal  restraint and protect American taxpayers who cannot afford to keep  wasting money on reckless budget proposals.                            ____________________
