 Madam Speaker, I stand before you to share a story of  West Virginia's Second Congressional District's own hometown hero,  Tyler Baldwin.   Tyler Baldwin is a 17-year-old young man from Newville, West  Virginia, who risked his own life to rush into his neighbor's burning  home.   On the morning of November 29, 2021, Tyler was going through his  daily routine of getting ready for school, and he noticed his  neighbor's house was on fire.   He knew his neighbor had mobility issues. Without hesitation, Tyler  sprinted into the blaze and smoke and helped his neighbor escape. Tyler  was treated for minor injuries, and the homeowner was shaken up but  okay.   It is an honor for my staff and me to present Tyler with a formal  letter of gratitude and a Congressional Certificate of Recognition at a  ceremony put together by his school. I want to thank him for selflessly  putting others first and congratulate him on being an upstanding  citizen in his community.                            ____________________
