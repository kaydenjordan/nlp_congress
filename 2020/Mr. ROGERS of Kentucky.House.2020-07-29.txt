 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio and  Ranking Member Graves for including my request to fund Section 531, the  program for Southern and Eastern Kentucky.   In the region that I serve, we are still fighting for clean water and  reliable wastewater systems for our families, our schools, and our  businesses. Many of our folks, like those in Martin County, are often  forced to boil water because lines are failing, and believe it or not,  we are still finding straight pipes dumping raw sewage into some of our  beautiful streams.   Thanks to Section 531, some 35,000 families in Southern and Eastern  Kentucky now have their own septic system or access to a reliable  wastewater system, and over 90 percent of my rural region now has  access to clean water.   But it should be 100 percent in every part of America. Anything less  is shameful. And that is why this funding increase and this bill are so  critical.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Graves, and Chairman  DeFazio for bringing a great bill out, and I urge its support.
