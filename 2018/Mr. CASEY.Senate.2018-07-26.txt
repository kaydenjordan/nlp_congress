 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am proud to be here this morning to  talk about a legislative matter that has taken many years to come to  fruition. We were able to work together in a bipartisan manner to  reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act and  make important updates that will support high-quality programs, foster  innovation, and improve access for all students. I am very proud to be  joined by Senator Enzi, who worked for years on this issue. I will say  more about Senator Enzi in a moment.   Perkins CTE--``CTE'' standing for ``career and technical  education''--is critical to creating jobs and growing wages and  ensuring our workers have the tools to outcompete wth anyone in the  world. This legislation will empower States and local districts to  create programs that provide better outcomes for all students,  educators, and our economy.   Since the last reauthorization in 2006--you heard that right, 2006-- there have been significant changes to both technology and our economy,  and we have a growing skills gap. In Pennsylvania, for example, jobs  requiring some postsecondary education and training but not a B.A.  account for 54 percent of Pennsylvania's labor market; however, only 43  percent of workers in the State are trained to fill these jobs. This  bipartisan legislation will help to close the skills gap by allowing  programs to better align with industry needs, ensuring that programs  serve as a pipeline to the high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand jobs of  today as well as the jobs of tomorrow.   In addition, this legislation creates more alignment with Federal  laws, such as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act--known  around here by the acronym WIOA--which deals with our workforce, and  better alignment with the Higher Education Act, as well as better  alignment with the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was the elementary  and secondary education law passed in 2015. All of that will help to  ensure that our education and workforce programs indeed work together.   Similarly, this legislation improves collaboration between secondary  schools, institutions of higher education, employers, and other  community partners. It increases stakeholder engagement and ensures we  have a workforce to support high-quality programs by increasing  recruitment of and improving professional development for CTE--career  and technical education--educators.   I am particularly proud of provisions in this bill that will promote  equity and ensure that all students, including students with  disabilities, have access to high-quality programs.   I am also pleased that provisions in the bill will allow for more  career and technical education exploration in both middle and secondary  grades. Exposing students to different career and academic pathways  early gives them more options and opportunities to succeed.   We have come together and passed a strong bill that is responsive to  the needs of our communities and will help students, programs, and  industries across Pennsylvania and across our Nation to thrive. I look  forward to continuing to work on these issues. Now that the House has  also passed this legislation, we are looking forward to having the  President sign it into law.   I want to say how much I appreciate the work that was done over many  years by Senator Enzi and his staff, working with my staff and working  with me, and the direct involvement of both the chairman of the Health,  Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Chairman Alexander, and  Ranking Member Patty Murray. We are grateful for their direct help in  getting this legislation through the Senate.   With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from Wyoming.    Madam President, I rise for two purposes today, and I will  start with the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This  is the 28th anniversary of that landmark legislation.   Former Senator Tom Harkin served the people of Iowa for more than  three decades, if you include House and Senate service. He was a  champion for people with disabilities, and I think that is an  understatement. For many years, he was the champion. Senator Harkin  used to say that the Americans with Disabilities Act was the last great  civil rights law of the 20th century.   The passage of what we know as the ADA helped to bring into focus a  picture that started to develop 150 years ago with the ratification of  the 14th Amendment. That great amendment guaranteed equal protection  under the law for all.   The passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act confirmed that  people with disabilities are included in that guarantee of the 14th  Amendment. I think it is important to review the goals of the ADA. We  have probably lost track of those goals with the passage of time. They  need to be repeated.   The first goal is equal opportunity. The second goal is independent  living. The third goal is full participation. The fourth goal is  economic self-sufficiency. That is what we want to achieve for people  with disabilities: equal opportunity, independent living, full  participation, and economic self-sufficiency.   The goals are not achievable, of course, without great support. To  achieve those goals, we need actions from governments, actions from  businesses, actions from schools and universities, and, indeed, actions  from every sector of our society. We need actions to promote and  protect the dream that is at the core of the ADA.   The ADA affirmed rights outlined in the 14th Amendment. Despite those  guarantees, this past year we have seen substantial and, I would argue  in many instances, very cruel efforts that threaten equality for people  with disabilities.   Earlier this year, we saw that the House of Representatives passed a  bill that would have gutted title III of the ADA, making public access  an afterthought for people with disabilities. In  [[Page S5398]]  the Senate, with many of our colleagues joined together, we stopped  that effort. If they try it again, we will have to stop them from doing  it. These threats continue.   In the past couple of weeks, we heard officials of this  administration claim that segregation and institutionalization with  regard to those who have a disability should be acceptable for these  Americans with disabilities.   The law of our land, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the  1999 Supreme Court Olmstead decision say otherwise. They say that the  values and policy of the United States are for the inclusion--the  inclusion--of people with disabilities. That statute and that Supreme  Court decision do not say that the United States supports segregation,  isolation, and institutionalization of people with disabilities.   I hope the administration will further clarify what their position is  because it is contrary to law, but it is also an insult to our values.  It seems that on many days in the last year and a half, if not longer,  the Republican majority, both here in the Senate and in the House, has  been focused on three objectives when it comes to healthcare: rip away,  decimate, and sabotage. Ripping away protections like those for  preexisting conditions in the Affordable Care Act, decimating the  Medicaid Program, and sabotaging our healthcare system are actions by  the administration that some Republicans have not interfered with. You  have an administration that on a daily and weekly basis over many  months now has sabotaged our system--sabotaged the individual market  and sabotaged people's ability to get healthcare.   We are going to continue to fight against that. One of the biggest  fights we are going to have is on Medicaid. Medicaid in Pennsylvania  affects more than 2 million people. It has an impact because of the  healthcare benefit it provides on 40 percent of the children of my  State, 50 percent of the people with disabilities, and more than 60  percent of folks trying get into nursing homes.   When it comes to Medicaid, I am going to fight to the end of the  Earth to protect it, not to sit down and have a nice discussion about  it but to protect it. If they want to take it on, we are going to  continue to fight against them as long as it takes. No matter how hard  or how long that fight is, we are going to fight it.   Despite the progress we have made with the Americans with  Disabilities Act and a lot of other progress in the interim, we still  have a ways to go for the promise and the dream that many Americans  with disabilities have had. We need further action, further  legislation, further work in a bipartisan manner. I hope that will be  the case on two of my bills.   Let me outline them quickly. No. 1, I just introduced a Disability  Employment Incentive Act, which encourages businesses to hire more  people with disabilities. The disability workforce is robust, creative,  reliable, loyal, and productive. We need more people with disabilities  in competitive, integrated employment to strengthen our economy and to  enhance the capacity of our businesses.   The second bill I have is to protect people with disabilities and  their families, so we have introduced the Office of Disability Policy  Act.   As sabotage continues to occur by the administration, we need  accurate, nonpartisan information about proposals that could harm  people with disabilities and the infrastructure that makes it possible  for them to participate in our society.   We have a responsibility to know when a law that is being proposed-- or an action by an administration--will benefit or adversely affect 56  million Americans with disabilities. During this month, when we  celebrate the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the 14th  Amendment and the 28th anniversary of the signing of the ADA, we need  to remember we all have a responsibility to complete the picture and to  help Americans with disabilities to realize the dream.   As a nation, our duty now is to take the actions that protect and  enhance the rights of all Americans, including those with disabilities,  and to make equality for all a reality.                                  Healthcare    Let me conclude with some thoughts about the recent debate about  protections for preexisting conditions. As I said before, it seems that  Republicans in Washington have a maniacal obsession with decimating  Medicaid, wiping out the ACA protections, including protections for  preexisting conditions.   Now that we have changed the law, we said: ``If you have cancer, you  can still get coverage or treatment.'' Now I guess some here want to  take us back.   We have 5.3 million people in Pennsylvania with preexisting  conditions; 643,000 of them are children. We are not going back. We are  not going back to those days when those 5.3 million people in  Pennsylvania don't have protection. We are not going back. If they want  to have a fight about it, we will fight about it.   Last year, I heard from Liz from West Chester, PA--suburban  Philadelphia--who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 26. Here is  what she told me:         For years I worried about losing my job and with it my       insurance because I have costly preexisting conditions. This       stress added to the stress of my diagnosis, treatments, and       work/life balance.    Then she goes on to say:         Weight lifted off my shoulders when the preexisting       condition protections became law. Now those protections are       threatened.    So a weight was lifted off her shoulders because of an advancement in  law because we protected people with preexisting conditions. Now some  people here want to add that weight back onto her shoulders. That has  to be stopped at all costs, and we will stop it.   This latest scheme, this court case trying to overturn preexisting  conditions protections, is why Senator Manchin and I are leading the  effort on a resolution to authorize the Senate legal counsel to  intervene in the case of Texas v. The United States.   This would be devastating for millions of people across the country.  I mentioned 5.3 million in Pennsylvania with preexisting conditions-- 133 million across the country. Any of us--all of us--are vulnerable  when the preexisting conditions protections are targeted. It is  outrageous--outrageous--that the Department of Justice is weighing in  against the law of the land and arguing that these protections for  individuals with preexisting conditions should be struck down. We must  defeat--defeat--this cruel attempt to rip away these protections. I  will fight every day to make sure every American--no matter where they  live or what their health status is--has access to the healthcare they  need.   It is good that we are celebrating the 28th anniversary of the  Americans with Disabilities Act. We are happy about that, but at the  same time, we need to be vigilant against attempts to undermine  progress we have made since the ADA and progress we have made more  recently.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rachel Cohen  of my staff be granted floor privileges for the duration of today's  proceedings.
