 Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Easton  Elementary School in Easton, ME, on being named a 2020 National Blue  Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. Serving 128 students from pre- kindergarten through sixth grade, this outstanding school is one of  only 367 schools across the country this year to receive Blue Ribbon  recognition from the U.S. Department of Education.   Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and  private schools that are either academically superior in their States  or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The  schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high  educational standards and accountability.   Easton is a rural community of 1,300 residents in Aroostook County,  just 20 miles from my hometown of Caribou. It is a small town with a  big commitment to education.   Easton Elementary School's mission is to achieve academic excellence  in a safe and nurturing environment of fairness, respect, and caring.  All students are provided with personal enrichment opportunities and  work with teachers and staff to set their own learning goals.   The core curriculum is math, literacy, and social studies, with a  particular focus on science. Students regularly visit the renowned  Francis Malcolm Science Center in Easton, which has a planetarium,  interactive laboratory, and nature studies area.   In addition to strong theater and music programs, the school places  an emphasis on helping students develop healthy lifestyles. The  relationship between the school and the Easton Recreation Department  provides students with opportunities for traditional sports  programming, as well as cooking lessons and babysitting courses.   Citizenship is an important part of the curriculum. Students  participate in activities to support polio vaccine distribution, cancer  research, and Down syndrome awareness. Easton is an agricultural  community, and the school continues the Aroostook County tradition of  starting the school year early to accommodate a 3-week break in the  fall so students can help local farmers with the potato harvest. An  active parent-teacher organization helps to forge a strong bond between  the school and the community.   I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Easton  Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to  build students' confidence and generate momentum for learning. I am  pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Easton  Elementary School for this well-deserved honor, and I congratulate the  entire community for this outstanding achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Mary Snow  Elementary School in Bangor, ME, on being named a 2019 National Blue  Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. Serving 240 students in the  fourth and fifth grades, this outstanding school is one of only 367  schools across the country this year to receive Blue Ribbon recognition  from the U.S. Department of Education.   Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and  private schools that are either academically superior in their States  or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The  schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high  educational standards and accountability.   The Blue Ribbon designation continues a tradition of quality  education in Bangor. Last year, the pre-kindergarten through third  grade Fruit Street Elementary School, which sends students to Mary  Snow, was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School.   Although students attend Mary Snow School for only 2 years, teachers  and staff strive to build positive relationships with students and  their families and create a welcoming atmosphere. The school involves  families by hosting 10 events each year that encourage parents and  guardians to become involved in their child's education.   The Bangor School Department's mission is ``Academic Excellence for  All.'' At Mary Snow, students are encouraged to develop their full  potential. The core curriculum of language arts, math, science, and  social studies is rigorous, yet provides the flexibility for individual  students to learn at their own pace.   Mary Snow is committed to helping students pursue their interests and  to discover new ones. Strong visual and performing arts programs  encourage creativity. Physical education encourages healthy lifestyles.  Technology is integrated into the classroom so that students develop  the skills to succeed in the 21st century economy.   Faculty, parents, and community members are committed to both  academic excellence and each child's social, emotional, and physical  health. Faculty work to ensure a safe and secure learning environment  and to develop strong and collaborative relationships with parents and  community members. An active parent-teacher organization supports  enriching educational activities and promotes excellence and innovation  by funding special projects and initiatives.   I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Mary  Snow Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission  to build students' confidence and generate momentum for learning. I am  pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Mary Snow  Elementary School for this well-deserved honor, and I congratulate the  entire school community for this outstanding achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Pond Cove  Elementary School of Cape Elizabeth, ME, on being named a 2020 National  Blue Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. This outstanding school  is one of only 367 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon  recognition from the U.S. Department of Education.   Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and  private schools that are either academically superior in their States  or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The  schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high  educational standards and accountability.   This prestigious designation continues Cape Elizabeth's tradition of  quality education. Last year, Cape Elizabeth High School was awarded  its second Blue Ribbon. Many high school and middle school students  serve as volunteer mentors for elementary pupils, making a strong and  positive impact on young learners.   Pond Cove serves 530 pupils from kindergarten through the fourth  grade. This award recognizes the hard work and determination of  students, teachers, and staff. It is a top-performing school on State- required assessments, and educators at the school use assessments  throughout the academic year as a tool for improving and customizing  instruction. A strong commitment to professional development ensures  that teachers and staff, as well as students, are lifelong learners.   Pond Cove excels as a school built on a foundation of the school  district's values of community, academics, passion, and ethics. Through  a unique tradition of adding links to a paper chain  [[Page S6071]]  throughout the school, teachers and staff recognize students who  demonstrate those values, instilling a sense of individual and school  pride.   In addition to a rigorous core curriculum and a focus on world  languages, the school is known for its extensive extracurricular  activities in academics, athletics, and the arts, and students are  encouraged to pursue their interests. A comprehensive health and  wellness program emphasizes good nutrition, physical activity, and  stress management. The schoolwide peacemakers curriculum helps students  develop the skills to work collaboratively and to respect others.  Students learn the value of community service through a variety of  opportunities, such as supporting the local food pantry and connecting  with senior citizens.   Family and community support is one of the school's greatest assets.  The Pond Cove Parents Association and other community organizations  provide supplemental funding and resources. Just last year, parents,  staff members, and local businesses joined together to create a new  playground and outdoor learning center with outdoor classrooms,  vegetable gardens, and nature observation areas.   This Blue Ribbon Award is a tribute not only to the students, but  also to the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Pond Cove  Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to  generate excitement and momentum for learning. They are making a  difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their  full potential as independent, responsible learners and citizens. I  congratulate the entire Cape Elizabeth community for this well-deserved  recognition.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise this afternoon in support of the  amendment that Senator Rubio and I have introduced to extend and  strengthen the Paycheck Protection Program. It would allow our Nation's  hardest hit small businesses to get a second forgivable PPP loan that  they so desperately need. Our amendment would make available $258  billion for new PPP forgivable loans.   Madam President, as I know you are aware from your experience in West  Virginia, the Paycheck Protection Program has been hugely successful.  In the State of Maine, three out of four of our small businesses have  received forgivable loans totaling $2.9 billion. To put that in  context, that is equal to approximately half of the entire State  budget. Most important of all, those loans have helped to sustain the  jobs of more than 250,000 Mainers.   Nationwide, the PPP has been a critical lifeline for more than 5  million small employers, helping to sustain upward of 50 million  American jobs.   As the Washington Post wrote in June following a dramatically better  than expected jobs report: ``Give some credit to the government relief  efforts, especially the Paycheck Protection Program, for bringing back  jobs.''   This program has provided one-time loans sufficient to support 8  weeks of payroll plus a limited amount to help cover certain overhead  expenses, which were completely forgivable as long as borrowers  retained and paid their employees. Our purpose was to help small  businesses save jobs and pay their workers, keeping that all-important  employer-employee relationship intact so that, when businesses could  reopen and Americans could go back to work, it could happen quickly  when the pandemic subsided.   When Chairman Rubio and I, together with Senators Ben Cardin and  Jeanne Shaheen, put the PPP together at the onset of the national  emergency, none of us could have envisioned that the pandemic would be  so persistent, that here in October it would still be forcing shutdowns  and mitigation measures that many months later.   Yet, the cruel fact is that the virus is still spreading, and many of  the steps taken to fight it, while necessary to protect public health,  threaten catastrophic damage to many small businesses and their  employees who have been sustained by the PPP loan funds, but they are  still unable to return to normal operations.   According to the NFIB, our Nation's largest advocacy group for small  business, 84 percent of its small business members exhausted their PPP  loan funds by mid-August. Many fear that they will have to lay off  their employees--the last thing they want to do--or even cease  operations altogether if more support is not forthcoming soon.   In a key letter in support of our amendment circulated today, the  NFIB also said that its most recent survey shows that 49 percent of its  members anticipate needing some sort of additional financial support in  the next 12 months.   Let me give you an example. I recently learned of a T-shirt printing  shop in Maine that received a PPP loan. It provided a lifeline to get  this business through the past several months, but with many youth  sports leagues and school activities still suspended, this business and  its employees need more help to sustain them until springtime, when  they hope to once again be printing T-shirts for little league teams  and other sporting events.   The impact of the pandemic has been critically acute for our hotels,  our restaurants, our B&Bs, and our seasonal businesses that rely on a  strong summer to pay their bills throughout the year. A State like  mine, which is so dependent on tourism, has been particularly hard-hit  since many of our tourism-based businesses lost the first part of the  summer.   A recent survey by the American Hotel and Lodging Association showed  that, if we do not act and act soon to provide additional assistance,  74 percent of our Nation's hotels will be forced to lay off more  workers, and two-thirds could even be forced to close their doors  entirely.   The same is true in my State of Maine. An article published last  month in the Bangor Daily News reports that the State could stand to  lose two-thirds of hotels and direct lodging jobs if Congress doesn't  approve more aid soon.   Our restaurants are also struggling. While tourists finally started  to return to Maine in August, this summer season has understandably  been one of the slowest on record for my State. With the warm weather  gone and outdoor dining no longer feasible, many of our restaurants can  accommodate only about half as many customers as they used to be able  to accommodate and  [[Page S6309]]  still comply with the CDC guidelines. They fear that they may not be  able to make it through the winter without further help.   A few days ago, I received an email from a couple who owns an award- winning restaurant in Portland, ME. This couple told me that they would  have closed without the PPP loan but that they haven't taken a paycheck  since March and simply cannot make it through the winter without a  second round.   They put it as follows:         [We] love that PPP enabled us to keep in contact with our       staff, even when they were not able to work in the beginning       [due to the State restrictions]. Furthermore, it helped us to       be able to hire them back so that we could reopen       immediately. [But] at this point, we are staying open only to       support our employees. The new PPP would give us the needed       funds to limp through winter, while still keeping our staff       employed and our customers safe.    I am sure that many other Members of the Senate are seeing the same  in their States, and that is why it is so important that we renew once  again this very successful program.   As you know, we went through the first $359 billion in just 13 days.  That is what the demand was like. Then we passed additional legislation  to replenish the program with $320 billion, but we only extended the  date to August 8 for applicants for the program. We need to reopen it  up to those who didn't apply the first time and now find themselves in  need and to allow the hardest hit businesses to receive a second PPP  loan.   We also need to do this to help our nonprofits that are also  struggling to survive, and that is why we simply must put aside any  partisan politics. This program was the product of bipartisan  negotiations that went on day after day, night after night, and we came  together.   Let me describe the key points in this proposal. First, the amendment  would allow those small employers that have seen their revenues decline  by 35 percent or more in the first, second, or third quarter of this  year compared to the same quarter last year to receive an additional  Paycheck Protection Program loan.   Second, because we want to target this additional assistance to the  businesses that need it most, we generally limit eligibility to  entities that have 300 or fewer employees, rather than 500.   Third, we expand the list of forgivable PPP expenses in some very  commonsense ways. We allow forgiveness for the supplier costs and  investments in facility modifications and personal protective equipment  for the business to operate safely for its employees and its customers.  Examples would be those plexiglass guards--the shields we are seeing  everywhere--masks for employees, of course, and patio insulations and  related outdoor furnishings. This is especially important to  restaurants facing dining restrictions and those struggling to get the  high-quality food supply needed to operate because they have fallen  behind in their bills.   Fourth, we extend PPP to small 501(c)(6) organizations that are not  lobbying organizations and that have 150 or fewer employees, such as  local chambers of commerce, economic development organizations, and  tourism offices. They are doing a great job representing their members  through this crisis.   Fifth, we would allow forgivable loan funds to be spent through  December 31 and clarify that borrowers can apply for loan forgiveness  at the time of their choosing after 8 weeks from the loan origination.   Sixth, we greatly simplify the loan forgiveness process for smaller  borrowers. Those who make a good-faith effort to comply with the  program's requirements would be able to use a one-page, simplified loan  forgiveness form if they borrowed no more than $150,000. We also make  the loan forgiveness process less complex for borrowers of loans  between $150,000 and $2 million.   Seventh, we provide the SBA with $50 million in additional audit  funding to ensure that it has the resources necessary to protect the  program against fraud. Regrettably, there are always going to be those  who attempt to exploit a program, and that is why we want to beef up  the audit capacity.   Finally, our amendment includes a series of set-asides to ensure that  smaller borrowers and underserved communities get the help they need.  These set-asides include money for borrowers with 10 or fewer  employees; $10 billion for community financial institutions, such as  small community banks and credit unions; and $10 million for the  Minority Business Development Agency. In addition, the amendment  directs the SBA to issue guidance addressing barriers to accessing  capital for minority, underserved, veteran, and women-owned businesses.   The Paycheck Protection Program is the result of a bipartisan  commitment to support our small businesses, our nonprofits, and their  employees during this pandemic. It has been a tremendous success, but  many small businesses and nonprofits simply require more help now in  order to survive, given the length and persistence of this pandemic.   This amendment provides that help. It is supported by the National  Federation of Independent Business, the National Restaurant  Association, the American Hotel and Lodging Association, the  International Franchise Association, and HospitalityMaine   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the letters of support for our amendment at the conclusion of my  remarks.   Madam President, I urge our colleagues to support this amendment, to  do so now, even if you disagree on other issues that may be taken up.  Surely, we can come together and extend this bipartisan, highly  successful program to secure the jobs of small businesses and also to  ensure that these small businesses stay afloat. We want to make sure  that small businesses, which employed the majority of people in this  country, are able to keep their employees employed.   We can continue to work to find common ground--and I am involved in  those efforts--on other policies to help support the health and safety  of Americans and the safe, responsible opening of our communities. We  need more resources for tests and vaccine development; for aid to  municipalities and schools; for assistance to our lobstermen, our  fishermen, our farmers, our loggers, and to our aviation and motor  coach industries. We need more assistance for childcare and for the  U.S. Postal Service.   Now is the time to move forward on this bill, on this proposal, to  extend and strengthen the PPP before we lose more small businesses,  before their employees are forced out of their jobs. So let's act  today. It is past time to put aside partisan bickering to provide this  much needed relief for the American people.   I urge all of our colleagues to join us in support of this important  action to renew and strengthen the PPP program   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                National Restaurant Association,                                                   October 20, 2020.      Hon. Marco Rubio,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins and Senator Rubio: The National       Restaurant Association writes to you in support of the       recently-filed amendment, ``Continuing the Paycheck       Protection Program,'' scheduled for a vote today.        As you know all too well, the restaurant industry has been       uniquely hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our industry has       lost more jobs and more revenue than any other. Over the past       7 months, nearly one in six restaurants (representing roughly       100,000 establishments) have closed, and more than 2 million       restaurant employees are still without a job today as a       result of furloughs and closures. The restaurant industry is       on track to lose a staggering $240 billion in revenue by the       end of this year.        Since March, the National Restaurant Association has called       for a comprehensive, restaurant-specific response from       Congress to assist the nation's second-largest private-sector       employer. We continue to call for this, but a comprehensive       agreement seems unlikely before the elections, and       restaurants are in danger of being left behind.        If Congress cannot approve comprehensive support this year,       a second round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program       (PPP) will at least provide transitional support for       restaurants as we approach the winter months. We appreciate       your leadership in developing the PPP, in providing more       flexibility in its use, and for your calls to ensure that       Congress does not leave Washington without providing       something for the short-term survival of restaurants.  [[Page S6310]]         On behalf of our membership, our state restaurant       association partners, and our workforce, we urge the Congress       to at a minimum pass a second round of PPP for implementation       this year.            Sincerely,                                                      Sean Kennedy,      Executive Vice President, Public Affairs.                                   ____                                                             NFIB,                                                   October 20, 2020.        Dear Senator: On behalf of NFIB, the nation's leading small       business advocacy organization. I write in strong support of       the Continuing the Paycheck Protection Program Act offered by       Senators Marco Rubio and Susan Collins. This amendment would       provide necessary and targeted financial assistance to small       businesses for the purposes of keeping workers employed and       keeping their doors open during the ongoing public health       crisis. A vote to advance the Continuing the Paycheck       Protection Program Act amendment will be considered an NFIB       Key Vote for the 116th Congress.        The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has been a vital       financial assistance tool to over 5 million small businesses,       helping these businesses maintain employees and assisting       with expenses such as rent, utilities, and mortgage interest.       Unfortunately. the negative economic consequences of COVID-19       on small businesses have lasted longer than Congress       anticipated when the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic       Security (CARES) Act was enacted in late March.        The amendment provides more than $250 billion in funds to       allow for second PPP loans for small businesses if they       demonstrate 35% quarterly revenue loss this year: NFIB       supports allowing a small business to receive a second PPP       loan. The opportunity for second PPP loans would       significantly help small businesses who continue to be       negatively impacted by economic disruptions of COVID-19.        Additionally. the amendment expands the definition of PPP       expenses to include certain operational expenditures,       property damage costs, certain supplier costs, and worker       protection expenditures, as well as allows small business       borrowers to select a flexible covered period to utilize       their PPP loan funds. NFIB supports expanding eligible       expenses to help small businesses cover essential reopening       and operational expenses and providing flexibility regarding       timing of PPP expenditures.        The amendment also simplifies the PPP loan forgiveness       process, allowing small businesses who received a loan of       $150,000 or less to attest to a good faith effort to comply       with PPP loan requirements and obtain forgiveness. NFIB       supports providing a more efficient way to demonstrate       compliance and receive forgiveness as the vast majority of       small business owners have exhausted their PPP funds and are       preparing to apply for forgiveness.        Economic conditions are putting significant stress on the       financial health of many small business owners struggling to       balance lower sales with fixed expenses, and longer-term       sustainability. More than one-in-five (21%) small business       owners report that they will have to close their doors if       current economic conditions do not improve over the next six       months. With the realization that lower than average sales       are likely for months to come, many small business owners       urgently need additional financial assistance. According to       NFIB's most recent survey, 49% of small business owners who       received PPP loan and/or an Economic Injury Disaster Loan       (EIDL) anticipate needing additional financial support in the       next 12 months.        There is bipartisan agreement to provide a targeted second       round of PPP loans to small businesses. NFIB urges Congress       to set aside disagreements on other policies and pass       legislation to help small business owners immediately.        NFIB strongly supports the Continuing the Paycheck       Protection Program Act amendment and a vote to advance the       legislation will be considered an NFIB Key Vote for the 116th       Congress.            Sincerely,                                                  Kevin Kuhlman,                                  Vice President, Federal Government      Relations, NFIB.                                   ____                                                  Hospitality Maine.      Senator Susan Collins,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: I am writing this letter in support       of another round of PPP. My understanding is that there are       those that feel funding restaurants through the RESTAURANTS       Act should be the only hospitality funding provided in a       Federal stimulus bill. As an association that represents both       small lodging and restaurant businesses in the State of       Maine, I can assure you that both have been hit equally as       hard. In the State of Maine, one could argue that with the       very stringent reopening guidelines and embargoes on certain       states to come here, that our small lodging properties may       have been hit harder. In a state where the average size       lodging business is 14 rooms, we are not talking big       business. We are speaking of mom and pop inns and bed and       breakfasts that will have a difficult time surviving the       winter.        We are not opposed to the RESTAURANTS Act, quite the       contrary, we support it wholeheartedly, along with a       reasonable form of assistance to the many other business       sectors both inside and outside of the hospitality space. In       Maine there are windjammers, attractions, museums, music       venues and yes small inns and hotels that could also use some       help. Let's make sure we don't leave them behind.            Sincerely,                                                        Greg Dugal,      Director of Government Affairs.                                   ____                                            American Hotel & Lodging                                                     Association,                                                   October 20, 2020.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer: On behalf of the       American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA), the sole       national association representing all segments of the U.S.       lodging industry, including iconic global brands, hotel       owners and franchisees, lodging real estate investment trusts       (REITs), hotel management companies, independent properties,       bed and breakfasts, state hotel associations, and industry       suppliers, I write in strong support of the Continuing the       Paycheck Protection Program Act (S. 4773) introduced by       Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Marco Rubio (R-FL). This       important legislation would enable hotels and other small       businesses access to a second draw of the historic and       bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program, giving them a       financial lifeline to keep their employees on the payroll and       doors open.        The hotel industry continues to be decimated by the COVID-      19 pandemic. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics       (BLS), the leisure and hospitality space has lost 4.1 million       jobs since February and the accommodations sector has an       unemployment rate of 34.5% compared to the national average       of 8.4%. The human toll on our employees and our workforce is       devastating. The economic impact to our industry is equally       as dramatic, estimated to be nine times greater than the       September 11th terrorist attacks. According to Oxford       Economics. the industry is expected to lose more than fifty       percent of its total revenue in 2020.        In a recent survey of hotel employers. AHLA found that 74%       of hoteliers reported they would be forced into further       layoffs without additional government support, such a second       PPP draw. Nearly half of hotel owners reported that they are       in danger of foreclosure due to the pandemic. The hotel       industry desperately needs additional relief to survive this       crisis.        On behalf of the more than 33,000 small business hotels and       the millions of associates they employ, I urge you to support       this legislation and to allow the many thousands of hotel       owners across the country access to this program. Without       immediate relief from Congress, hotel businesses and the jobs       they provide will be lost permanently. Thank you for your       consideration of this critical matter.            Sincerely,                                                    Brian Crawford,                      Executive Vice President, Government Affairs.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, shortly, we will be voting on whether  or not to extend the Paycheck Protection Program, which has been hugely  successful in helping our small businesses keep their employees.   In Maine, three out of four small businesses have received $2.3  billion in forgivable loans. Most important, these loans have helped to  sustain 250,000 jobs in the State of Maine and 50 million jobs  nationwide.   A bipartisan group of us--Senator Rubio, Senator Cardin, Senator  Shaheen, and I--put this bipartisan program together in March. We added  funding in April, and we extended it in June until August 8.   The pandemic, unfortunately, is still forcing shutdowns and  mitigation measures months later. Many of the small businesses that  were sustained by their PPP loans are still unable to return to normal  operations.   Without more assistance, without being eligible for a second PPP  loan, many of the hardest hit small businesses, including our  restaurants, our gift shops, our hotels, and our B&Bs, will be forced  to close their doors, and, worse yet, lay off their workers. That is  why it is so important that we reach bipartisan agreement quickly to  provide further assistance to small businesses and nonprofits that have  been kept alive by their first PPP loan, that have been able to retain  and pay their employees but now are still struggling to survive due to  this persistent pandemic.   The amendment that we are about to vote on would provide  approximately $258 billion in funding to allow eligibility for a second  PPP loan for the hardest hit small businesses and nonprofits, while  also expanding and improving the program in some commonsense ways.   This is all about keeping Americans employed. This amendment is  endorsed by the NFIB, the National Restaurant Association, the American  Hotel and Lodging Association, the International Franchise Association,  HospitalityMaine, the United Fresh Produce Association, the National  Fisheries Institute, and the International Foodservice Distributors  Association.   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important step to  renew and strengthen the PPP program to save our small businesses and  their employees' jobs.   Thank you.
