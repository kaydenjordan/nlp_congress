 Madam Chair, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E.  Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   I am delighted to have been asked to join with my colleagues Mr.  Pallone and Chairman Scott in authoring this historic legislation. It  delivers on a Democratic promise to meaningfully stabilize and lower  the very high costs of prescription drugs in the United States.   As a recent Ways and Means Committee report details, Americans pay,  on average, four times more for the same prescription drugs as patients  in  [[Page H10107]]  other similarly developed countries. An overwhelming majority of  Americans, 95 percent, believe this disparity is unacceptable. I  certainly agree with them.   H.R. 3 will level the playing field for patients and taxpayers by  giving the Health and Human Services Secretary the power to negotiate  better prescription drug prices in Medicare and throughout the private  market. It also caps Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-pocket prescription  drug spending at $2,000.   According to CBO, H.R. 3 will save American taxpayers over $500  billion. We will vigorously reinvest these tremendous savings into  unprecedented dental, vision, and hearing Medicare coverage expansions.   These are benefits that are directly associated with positive short-  and long-term health outcomes, and seniors deserve meaningful access to  them.   H.R. 3 also expands eligibility to low-income subsidy programs so  that seniors can get help to lower their out-of-pocket costs. These  changes ensure seniors can afford lifesaving medications, protect  Medicare beneficiaries with preexisting conditions from discrimination,  and give older Americans access to commonly needed and life- transforming health services. Millions of Americans will see  improvements to their quality of life and to their financial security.   I have long believed that we need to look at ways to reinvest in  healthcare across the spectrum, and H.R. 3 does that by doubling our  investment in maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting  programs, a proven tool to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity.   The bill also builds on the successful Health Profession Opportunity  Grant demonstration projects to provide a leg up for low-income adults  to fill good-paying healthcare jobs currently unfilled because of a  lack of trained workers. Expanding HPOG programs will help low-income  adults gain new skills, earn good jobs, and help address health worker  shortages that exist across our 50 States, in the U.S. territories, and  in American Indian communities.   I am pleased and proud of the medical innovation and research that is  undertaken daily around the Nation, especially in the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts. But I am concerned that this innovation is becoming out  of reach for consumers who simply cannot afford its discoveries.   H.R. 3 gives patients the ability to benefit from and afford  innovative drugs. In addition, the legislation reinvests savings from  lower drug prices back into a very important part of the Massachusetts  economy, the National Institutes of Health, to fund additional  groundbreaking, lifesaving research.   The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, is a commonsense  proposal that will allow Americans to live healthier lives and save  money as they move along the way.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Chair, I yield the gentleman from Oregon an  additional 15 seconds.    Madam Chair, if the gentleman asked me what a year of my  life was worth, I would have said: An awful lot.   But I am appreciative of the fact that you were mute on that issue,  Madam Chair.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell).    Madam Chair, a reminder that our bill will invest $10  billion in the National Institutes of Health for new and innovative  cures.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Chicago,  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).  [[Page H10110]]         Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada  (Mr. Horsford).    Madam Chair, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared  to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Addressing the rising cost of prescription drugs is a complicated  issue, as Mr. Brady has noted, and it needs a thoughtful approach. H.R.  3 is a critical step toward a long-term, sustainable solution.   A lot of hard work went into crafting this measure and, indeed,  bringing it to the floor. And there are a number of staff to thank.   From the Legislative Counsel's Office: Jessica Shapiro, Karl  Hagnauer, Lisa Castillo, Adam Schilt, Fiona Heckscher, James Grossman,  and Henry Christup.   From CBO: Tom Bradley--who, I might add, is retiring after long and  distinguished service, and we thank him for that--Paul Masi, Rebecca  Yip, Lara Robillard, Chad Chirico, Alice Burns, Stuart Hammond, Lori  Housman, Jennifer Gray, and Leo Lex.   From the Joint Committee on Taxation: Tom Barthold, Vivek  Chandrasekhar, Shelley Leonard, Chia Chang, Lin Xu, and James Elwell.   From CMS: Manda Newlin, Maia Larsson, Ira Burney, Lisa Yen, Jen  Druckman, Stacy Harms, Leigh Feldman, and Jenny Keroack.   And, of course, as always, I want to thank the staff of the Ways and  Means Committee, who, as usual, have worked tirelessly and effectively  on this legislation. The legislation before this House today is in no  small part because of their expertise and their commitment to improving  the healthcare for all members of the American family.   I thank Amy Hall, Sarah Levin, Melanie Egorin, Rachel Dolin, Orriel  Richardson, Neil Patil, and Morna Miller.   As we have heard today on the floor, there are a lot of views on how  to lower prescription drugs, and I am open to suggestions. One policy  is not going to be the final fix, but this legislation is an important,  impactful first step, and I welcome continued dialogue on both sides of  the aisle.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this historic  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
