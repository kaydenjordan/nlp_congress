 Mr. Speaker, the death of a child is a loss like no  other, and I extend my heartfelt sympathy to any parents who face such  circumstances, but our current laws leave no time for parents to grieve  and begin the recovery process before returning to work.   The current Family and Medical Leave Act allows Americans to take up  to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of a child or the care of a  loved one experiencing a serious health condition. We need to extend  these same protections to parents grieving the loss of a child, which  is why I introduced the Sarah Grace-Farley-Kluger Parental Bereavement  Act.   This is bipartisan legislation. I was proud to be joined by three  Republicans and two Democrats in introducing the bill. This is a  commonsense and compassionate step we should all agree on.   I am particularly inspired by the families of those in whose memory  the Sarah Grace-Farley-Kluger Act is named. They have turned the pain  of the loss of a child into advocacy on behalf of other families facing  the same terrible tragedy.   I urge my colleagues to join us in this bipartisan effort to support  parents in the toughest times imaginable.                            ____________________
