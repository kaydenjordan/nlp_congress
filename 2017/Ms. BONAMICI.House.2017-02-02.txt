 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res.  37.   President Obama's Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule reinforces  employment protections and laws that help veterans, individuals with  disabilities, older Americans, minorities, and LGBTQ workers. It  protects workers in our country so they receive a fair day's pay for a  fair day's work.   This rule was passed in response to discovering that billions of  taxpayer dollars went to companies that violated Federal workplace  laws. A contractor who cheats workers out of their pay, endangers their  safety at work, or engages in discriminatory practices should be  required at least to disclose this information when bidding for Federal  contracts. Taxpayer dollars should not support the exploitation of  workers. That is just common sense.   The resolution before us would also remove critical protections for  workers that allow them to access our judicial system. The Fair Pay and  Safe Workplaces rule bans forced arbitration in workplace  discrimination and sexual assault cases for contracts of $1 million or  greater, a policy already in place at the Department of Defense that  was enacted with broad bipartisan support in 2010. Workers deserve the  opportunity to have their day in court to seek justice for their sexual  assault and discrimination claims.   I oppose this resolution to disapprove of these protections because  it gives serial law violators a free pass at the cost of workers'  safety, and it disadvantages the law-abiding contractors in Oregon and  across the country who follow our Nation's laws.   H.J. Res. 37 before us today would reward unlawful and discriminatory  conduct. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
