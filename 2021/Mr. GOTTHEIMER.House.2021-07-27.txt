 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the en bloc  packages.   My first amendment adjusts Federal investments for the Federal  Highway Administration to defund an expensive, unsightly, and  unnecessary 60-foot-high artificial rock wall on I-80 in Warren County  in my district. I encourage, instead, a safer, smarter option.   The community which sits next to the beautiful Delaware Water Gap,  one of Jersey's greatest natural treasures, believes this rock wall  will be ineffective and that it will wreak havoc on the area's  ecotourism. I couldn't agree more.   This amendment makes clear that congressional intent is for no  Federal funds to be used for the construction of  [[Page H4067]]  an artificial wall between mileposts 1.04 and 1.45 along I-80 in  Knowlton and Hardwick Townships, New Jersey. There are safer, better  options.   My second amendment makes it clear that Federal investments for the  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must help  address the COVID-19-linked substance abuse and mental health issues  affecting far too many children and young adults in our country. The  pandemic has caused a historic rate of mental health issues, especially  with our students, and we must help them get the support they need. It  is just heart-wrenching.   My final amendment prioritizes clean drinking water because every  child should have access to water at school that is free of lead that  can cause great harm to them. This amendment adjusts the Federal CDC  environmental health investment, creating congressional intent to help  ensure that school drinking water is free of lead and dangerous  chemicals. We must protect children in north Jersey and nationwide from  dangerous chemicals and lead in their drinking water.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc set of  amendments.    Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 226.
