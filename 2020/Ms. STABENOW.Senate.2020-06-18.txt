 Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank my  wonderful colleagues for their leadership, Senator Merkley and Senator  Baldwin, for not just being on the floor today and speaking out but  speaking out every day for introducing the Equality Act, of which I am  very proud to be a cosponsor, and for continually standing up for the  rights of all Americans.   In 2013, a Michigan funeral director wrote a letter. It said:         What I must tell you is very difficult for me and is taking       all the courage I can muster. I felt imprisoned in a body       that does not match my mind, and this has caused me great       despair and loneliness.    She told her coworkers, from now on, she was choosing to live her  truth; from now on, she would be living and working as a woman.  Unfortunately, she paid dearly for her courage, and 2 weeks later she  was fired.   That woman was Aimee Stephens of Redford, MI   This week, Aimee's courage literally changed history--literally  changed history. In a 6-to-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that  what happened to Aimee was illegal. It was illegal. Period. Employers  cannot fire or otherwise discriminate against employees simply because  of who they are or whom they love. Period.   Sadly, Aimee didn't get to celebrate the landmark victory, and we all  wish she were here right now to be able to join and lead the  celebration. She died last month at age 59. She will go down in history  as someone who took a stand for equality, for basic fairness, and made  our Nation a better place. So many people have joined her in this  fight, getting to this victory.   It is now time to further honor her courage and the courage of so  many others by passing the Equality Act, and we can do it today. That  is the good news. Right now, on the floor today, we can do that  together. What a great way to end this week; this month of June, this  Pride Month. What a great way this would be.   The Equality Act is pretty simple. It protects people against  discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in all  aspects of their lives. Unfortunately, this legislation, as my  colleagues have said, which has already passed the House, has been  sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk gathering dust for nearly 400 days-- 400 days since the House of Representatives took action. It is time to  shake off that dust and get this thing done for Aimee and for everyone  who has fought alongside her and continues to fight today to make our  Nation a more equitable place.   Now, our Republican colleagues, however, are more interested in  pushing through extremist judges who have no interest in LGBTQ  equality.   Later today and next week, we will be voting on two judicial  nominations--Justin Walker and Cory Wilson. It is, frankly, insulting  that these two nominations are even coming to the floor--insulting to  the American people that they are coming to the floor.   Justin Walker's nomination is opposed by 275 outside groups,  including the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the  National Center for Transgender Equality.   As for Cory Wilson, he supports H.B. 1523, the so-called Protecting  Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act, and that  would give broad permission for people and businesses to deny services  to people based on sexual orientation and gender identity.   Both of these nominees--both of them would overturn the Affordable  Care Act, which has made lifesaving differences for so many members of  the LGBTQ community and Americans all across our country.   Justin Walker wants the courts to throw out the entire Affordable  Care  [[Page S3080]]  Act, including protections for people with preexisting conditions. He  called the Supreme Court decision upholding the ACA ``indefensible and  catastrophic.''   Millions of people get their healthcare through the Affordable Care  Act. Everyone who has an insurance policy is able to do that and get  covered, even if they have a preexisting condition, because of the  Affordable Care Act.   Cory Wilson used even more colorful language. He called the law  ``illegitimate and perverse.'' Providing people healthcare he thinks is  perverse, and this is somebody the Republicans are going to put on the  court.   He even opposed expanding Medicaid coverage in Mississippi, a change  that would literally save lives in the middle of a pandemic.   We know what we need to do because Aimee showed us. We need to pass  the Equality Act now--today. We can do that today. Wouldn't that be  wonderful, on a bipartisan basis, to pass this today?   We need to vote no on two judicial nominees who are far out of step  with the basic American ideals of equality and fairness.   Aimee Stevens was courageous. Four hundred days is way too long for  millions of Americans to wait for the U.S. Senate to step up and do its  job. It is time for all of us to truly stand up for equality for the  LGBTQ community and set the foundation that we believe in equality for  all Americans.   I yield the floor.
