 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  longtime editorial page editor of the Savannah Morning News, Mr. Tom  Barton, who officially retired on January 5, after 39 years of service.   He began his time in Savannah writing for the former Savannah Evening  Press covering crime and police stories. His first stories included a  murder trial of an elderly woman and a man who violated city code by  killing a chicken and leaving its remnants on city sidewalks.   These stories quickly taught Mr. Barton lessons in journalism while  his gripping, clear, and insightful writing helped him become an  influential and trusted writer and editor in Savannah.   Since those first stories, he has covered the most important topics  in Savannah over the past decades, including interviews with the  infamous Jim Williams, photos of running back Herschel Walker, and  stories about political elections.   Mr. Barton not only knows the unique character of Savannah better  than anyone in our area, but he has also contributed greatly to its  development over the last 39 years.   His regular contributions to the Savannah Morning News will be  missed. I thank him for his dedication to making Savannah a better  place to live.                            ____________________
