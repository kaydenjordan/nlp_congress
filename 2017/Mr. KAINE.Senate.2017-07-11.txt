 Mr. President, I also rise to talk about the healthcare  proposal on the floor, and I thank my colleague from Oregon and all my  colleagues who have taken the floor on this issue.   I will just state at the top a punch line: I will vote for any  healthcare bill that meets President Trump's promises. He said that in  his replacement, no one would lose coverage, no one would pay more, no  one would get kicked around because of a preexisting condition, and he  wouldn't cut Medicaid. And any bill that meets those criteria, I am  voting for, but I won't  [[Page S3901]]  vote for a bill that shatters all those promises, and that is what this  current proposal does.   There is a lot to talk about with the bill, and I just want to talk  about one thing--the proposed cuts to the Medicaid Program and  especially the effect of those cuts on children.   In the current Senate proposal, which is being sort of adjusted and  modified, there is a slashing of Medicaid by about $770 billion over 10  years. And if you add to that additional cuts to Medicaid proposed by  the President's budget, we are now north of $1 trillion of cuts to  Medicaid in the next 10 years.   Who receives Medicaid? In Virginia, between 50 and 60 percent of  those who receive Medicaid are children. In Virginia, 600,000 young  people are Medicaid recipients.   If you go to school and you are receiving an individualized education  plan because you have a designated disability, Medicaid is paying for  it.   About 50 percent of childbirths in Virginia are paid for by Medicaid.   If you are a kid who is doing everything right, but your family is  dysfunctional and a juvenile court judge has to decide whether to keep  you with your family or put you in a group home, if the judge decides  to send a social worker to your house 5 hours a week, Medicaid pays for  that.   If you are a child with autism and you are getting services for your  autism after school so you can succeed in school, Medicaid pays for  that.   In Virginia, 600,000 children receive Medicaid.   We recently had the administration's OMB--Office of Management and  Budget--Director, Mick Mulvaney, before us, and I asked him about these  Medicaid cuts. These cuts are catastrophic. How can you say these cuts  are a good thing? This is his quote:         We are no longer going to measure compassion by the number       of programs or the number of people on programs like       Medicaid. We are going to measure compassion . . . by the       number of people we get off those programs and back in charge       of their own lives.    So the philosophy that drives this is, we want to get people off  Medicaid and back in charge of their own lives--600,000 kids.   I had a roundtable yesterday in Springfield, VA, here in Northern  Virginia, and I had five families, parents and children, come to talk  about what Medicaid cuts would mean to them.   Angie and Anna are from Haymarket, VA. Anna is a little 5-year-old  and, her mom says, typical in so many ways. She loves to play with her  brothers, and she loves to play with dolls. But she has cerebral palsy  and tracheal bronchial malacia and subglottic stenosis and chronic lung  disease. In 2014, she developed a condition that caused her to have 30  bone breaks in 18 months.    Anna is in school. Anna is in school with a wheelchair that Medicaid  pays for. Anna is in school with some home health that Medicaid pays  for. Medicaid enables this child who has so many needs to actually go  to school so she can be all that she can be. Her family has TRICARE  through the military because the dad is in the military, but they  couldn't make it without Medicaid.   Jen and Cailyn are from Sterling, VA, also in Northern Virginia.  Cailyn is about 9\1/2\. Within a week after she was born, the family  knew there were some things wrong. She was finally diagnosed at age  3\1/2\ with a very rare, noninherited genetic anomaly. The family was  able to get her qualified for a Medicaid waiver when she was about a  year old. And this is secondary insurance. The family works and they  have private insurance, but it doesn't cover a wheelchair, a hospital  bed, and things that she needs to succeed. Again, this little girl who  is 9\1/2\--and her mother testified that she functions on about the  range of a 6-month old--she is able to go to school because Medicaid  can pay for some of the technology she needs.   Kim and Isaac are from Ashburn, VA, in Loudoun County. Isaac is a  youngster, a very active kid, but he has a tracheotomy. He is feeding- tube dependent. His family has private insurance, but they couldn't get  along without Medicaid. He is in the Loudoun County schools succeeding  because of Medicaid.   Dylan is another kid in Loudoun County schools. Corinne is his  mother. Dylan has a rare neuromuscular disease called spinal muscular  atrophy with respiratory distress. He has a tracheotomy tube. He relies  on a ventilator to breathe. Little Dylan was at this meeting. The  family has private insurance, but they couldn't succeed without  Medicaid. Dylan is able to go to school because of Medicaid.   Finally, there is a family from Richmond--Amy is the mom, and the son  is Declan. Declan is not in school because he is only 18 months old. He  has cerebral palsy, and his medical needs are intense. With Medicaid,  he is able to get some home nursing help, and he is able to get some  machinery at home that helps him succeed.   These are beautiful parents, one of whom had adopted her child--first  as a foster care and then adopted knowing the special needs of this  child. This was Angie and Anna. These parents are the saints of the  world, and these kids are fighting so hard. They are fighting so hard  just to try to develop every talent they have, every capacity they  have, but with Medicaid cuts, they would be in deep, deep jeopardy.   Why would we vote for a bill that slashes Medicaid to families like  these when President Trump said we are not going to cut Medicaid? Why  would we vote for a bill that shatters those promises, that takes  health insurance away from 20 million people, that increases premiums  for seniors, that subjects those with preexisting conditions to being  cast in the shadows yet again? That is what this bill would do.   I had a conclusion written, but I will tell you, one of my moms  yesterday gave me a better one. She gave me a better conclusion.   We had this roundtable with five families. We had some great folks  from the American Academy of Pediatricians who were there, too, saying  what a bad bill this would be for kids.   After the hearing was over, one of the moms looked at me and said:  You know, they kind of picked the wrong group of people to fight with-- talking about this bill.   I said: What you do mean by that, wrong group of people to fight  with?   She said: Parents of kids with disabilities.   I said: I don't get where you are going.   And this is what she said to me: From the moment our children are  born, all we do is fight. We fight so that our kids can survive. We  fight so that our kids can have as normal a life as possible. We have  to fight with hospitals. We have to fight with insurance companies. We  have to fight with school systems. We have to fight with cultural  stigmas about people with disabilities. If you are a parent of a child  with a disability, from the day they are born, all you do is fight. And  if they think that we are going to pass a bill to cut Medicaid to these  kids and their families and that we are not going to fight about it,  that we are not going to stand up and be heard, they have seriously  underestimated us.   I think we can do the right thing, as my colleagues have said, if we  will get together. I am on the HELP Committee, Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions, and the only topic that has been taboo on my  committee this year is health. We have had hearings about nominees. We  have had hearings about the FDA. We have not been allowed to have a  hearing about this health proposal--either the House bill or the Senate  bill.   Let's have a hearing, listen to patients, listen to parents, listen  to hospitals, listen to doctors, listen to people who are worried about  their premium costs, listen to insurance companies, and listen to  medical innovators. If we listen, we will get this right. But if we  shut down a process, if we don't allow the public in, don't listen,  don't have hearings, and rush it through, we will get it wrong.   This is the biggest sector of the American economy, and it is the  most important expenditure that anybody ever makes in their life. On  behalf of the 600,000 children in Virginia and the 30 million children  in this country who receive Medicaid, let's get this right.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.
