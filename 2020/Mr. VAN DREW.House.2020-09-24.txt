 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the outstanding  career, life, and accomplishments of Roberto Clemente.   Born in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Roberto was a talented athlete from a  young age and an Olympic hopeful in track and field. Roberto excelled  in baseball from a young age and worked his way into the Hall of Fame.  He had a wonderful professional career, including 12 Gold Glove Awards,  among his many other achievements.   His off-the-field accomplishments were also something to be in awe  of, spending much of his free time on charity work or serving with the  United States Marine Corps.   His number, 21, was retired by the Pittsburgh Pirates after his  untimely death. His accomplishments on the field and off the field  deserve to have his number retired by Major League Baseball.   Rest in peace, Mr. Clemente. May God bless you, and we all consider  you our hero.                            ____________________
