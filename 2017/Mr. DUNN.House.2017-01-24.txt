 Madam Speaker, when I ran for Congress, I made a promise to  hang my family's Revolutionary War musket in my office as a steadfast  reminder of the reason I am here in Washington: to support and defend  the Constitution and to honor those who have fought for the  Constitution and those who continue to fight for our freedom. We must  never forget how precious our constitutional rights are, and the right  to bear arms is one of the most important because that right ensures  our ability to defend all of our rights.   As a veteran of the United States Army and as a life member of the  NRA, I will fight in Congress to defend our right to bear arms. It is a  special honor to represent the great people of the Second District of  Florida and to fight for their conservative values in Congress.                            ____________________
