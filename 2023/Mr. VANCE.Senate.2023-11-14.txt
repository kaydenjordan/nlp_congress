 Mr. President, thanks to my colleague from Kansas here.  Look, this is pretty simple, and it is pretty obvious. The U.S. Senate  would pass aid--much-needed aid--to Israel today, at this very moment,  aid the House has already passed. It could go to the President's  signature this afternoon if my Democratic colleagues would stand down.  But they won't. Many of them here are gathered to push back against our  very commonsense proposal to offer support to one of our most important  allies as they face an existential threat. And it is important for us  to be honest about that fact, to acknowledge that Israel would be  getting support from this government tomorrow if our Democratic friends  didn't stop it today.   Now, why are they doing this? You will hear over the next hour or  so--we will hear--a lot of slogans but very little real discussion  about our policy in Ukraine or our policy in Israel. The Democrats have  decided that this must be combined into a massive hodgepodge package  for it to pass the U.S. Senate. They are doing this because they know  that America is united behind Israel, and they want to use our Israeli  allies as a political cover in their time of crisis. That is all this  is about. You will hear a whole lot, but that is, ultimately, what this  is about.   They know they cannot defend President Biden's disastrous, pointless,  and, ultimately, directionless Ukraine policy, so they would like to  use Israel as a cover.   Now, we have before us a hodgepodge of a supplemental from the  President of the United States. It combines a few billion dollars for  Ukraine with a few billion dollars to Gazan support--because that makes  a ton of sense, right? Let's give money to the Israelis to fight back  against Hamas, and then let's give some money to Hamas too. I am sure  they won't use it to kill Israelis. It will just be food and medicine,  we are assured, even though we know that because Hamas is the  functional government in Gaza, we know if we give them support, that  support will all the way flow into the war effort. At least, some of it  will. Let's be honest about it. Maybe some of it will flow to the  Palestinian people. Call me skeptical, but we know that, at least, some  of it will flow to the Hamas war effort. Let's be honest about that  fact.   It is not just that, though. It is not just a few billion for Hamas,  a few billion for Israel; it is a few billion to resettle migrants in  the United States of America--because, God knows, we haven't had enough  resettlement of migrants in the United States of America over the last  couple of years. The fentanyl deaths and the chaos and crime in our  country prove it.   And then on top of that, let's add $60 billion to Ukraine, because,  of course, we know that Israel and Ukraine are very closely connected.  They are so closely connected, in fact, that this Chamber can't have a  separate debate on one aid package or the other. And then let's add  some money to East Asia on top of that.   We will combine all of this into a $106 billion dollar supplemental  aid package that has very, very little--the gross majority of the money  has nothing to do with Israel--and we will do it so that we can cover  for the fact that the President of the United States has thrown the  world into chaos.   What I would like to do is have a separate debate. Divide these  questions into separate conversations and debate them separately. And,  oh, by the way, use the political will of this Chamber to support our  Israeli allies yesterday because they have needed it for much longer  than that.   Now, let me close with just a couple of final observations here, and  then I will kick it over to my friend, the Senator from Missouri.   I am getting sick, in this Ukraine policy debate, of hearing the same  exact slogans repeated. This country has been governed for 30 years on  bipartisan foreign policy slogans. Why don't we have a real debate? We  are told again and again and again that Vladimir Putin is just like  Hitler in the 1930s; if we don't stop him in Ukraine, he is going to  march all the way through Europe.   What happened to our education system that the only historical  analogy we can use in this Chamber is World War II? What about World  War I where competing major powers threw the entire world into conflict  because we didn't make smart decisions, we didn't deescalate conflict  when we had the opportunity.    Why is it that we think Vladimir Putin, who has struggled to fight  against the Ukrainians, is somehow going to be able to march all the  way to Berlin when he can't conquer a country immediately to his east?   Why do we think that everything that happens in the United States and  in the world in 2023 is Munich almost a century ago?   I am sick of us not having a real debate on this conversation.  Vladimir Putin is a bad guy. He should not have invaded Ukraine. But  our policy in 2023 has to be different than our policy in the 1940s  because the circumstances are different.   As Lincoln said:         As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.    You will also hear that China will be emboldened. China will be  terribly emboldened if we don't stop the Russians in Ukraine. Well,  call me crazy, but I think the Chinese would be emboldened if we use  limited American weapons and give it all to the Ukrainians instead of  giving it to the Taiwanese.   Now, maybe you disagree, but let's have the debate, and let's have  the real debate on the President's Ukraine policy instead of holding  Israel hostage.  [[Page S5486]]  There is nothing more shameful than taking an existential crisis-- thousands of dead Israeli civilians--and using them as a fig leaf for a  Ukraine policy.   If you want to defend the Ukraine policy, defend it. Let the Israel  aid flow through, and let's let it flow through today.   I yield to my good friend from Missouri.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.
