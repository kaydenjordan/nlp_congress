 Madam Speaker, as America approaches her birthday, I  want to wish the American people, in this most challenging time, a  happy birthday.   I want to be reminded of those whose status in this country is not a  status of equality, but I do want to acknowledge the importance of the  birthday and the freedom and democracy in this Nation.   I want to thank the men and women of the United States military, and  I want to acknowledge that any threat against those in the United  States military is a serious threat. Any Commander in Chief that  initially assesses a threat as a hoax should not be in that position.   The Russian threat of bounty on our soldiers in Afghanistan must be  fully investigated by every jurisdictional committee in the United  States Congress, but there must be a response to Russia, because those  soldiers are precious and they are precious in the fight for freedom  and to their families and to this Nation.   Again, as we wish a happy birthday, let us be reminded that those who  have fallen in battle have fallen to continue to build on the democracy  and the justice that we fought for and to make those who are yet equal,  equal in the eyes of the law. We continue to fight. We must continue to  defend our soldiers as they defend us.   Happy birthday, America.                            ____________________
