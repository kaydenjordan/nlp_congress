 Madam Speaker, today, I recognize Andrew Rock from  south New Jersey on his attainment of the Eagle Scout rank.   Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable from the Boy Scouts of  America. Only 4 percent of Boy Scouts ever achieve this prestigious  recognition.   Eagle Scouts are more likely to dedicate their life to service of all  kinds, becoming future leaders in military, business, or politics.   I was proud to attend Andrew's beautiful outdoor ceremony on the lake  this past November. The ceremony also highlighted the beautiful  traditions of the American Indian people.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Andrew. We look forward to big things  from him in the future. I am proud of him; south Jersey is proud of  him; and the United States of America is proud of him.                            ____________________
