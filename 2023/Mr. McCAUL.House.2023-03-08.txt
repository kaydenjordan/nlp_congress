 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the House of today,  I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 21) directing the  President, pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution, to  remove the United States Armed Forces from Syria and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is not at war with Syria. Rather, the  United States is conducting limited but important counterterrorism  operations in Syria against ISIS, formerly known as al-Qaida in Iraq,  pursuant to the 2001 counterterrorism AUMF.   Those operations are being reported regularly to Congress, consistent  with the War Powers Resolution. They are not new or unique to the Biden  administration.   In fact, let me quote President Trump about what we are doing here  when he said: ``A small presence of United States Armed Forces remains  in strategically significant locations in Syria to conduct operations .  . . to address continuing terrorist threats emanating from Syria.''   ``These ongoing operations, which the United States has carried out  with the assistance of numerous international partners, have been  successful in seriously degrading ISIS capabilities in Syria and  Iraq.''   When ISIS was at the peak of its power in 2015, it controlled vast  territory in Iraq and Syria, which it used to launch attacks in the  Middle East and beyond. Those terrorists ruled with medieval brutality.  We all remember the graphic videos of ISIS fighters beheading  journalists and innocent civilians.   These monsters drew thousands of volunteers to join their ranks in  Iraq and Syria and inspired terrorist attacks around the world.   Our U.S. military, working with a global coalition and local forces  on the ground, helped to dismantle and destroy this vicious caliphate.   I am proud that our men and women in uniform answered the call to  fight this menace, which threatened the United States and the world.   Even though ISIS no longer controls significant territory, there are  still tens of thousands of hardened terrorist fighters in Iraq and  Syria who are hell-bent on reestablishing their terror state.   In fact, in the last quarter of 2022, ISIS claimed 72 attacks in Iraq  and Syria, including several IED attacks.   Thankfully, our small deployment of U.S. servicemembers is remarkably  effective at working with local partner forces to achieve results and  ensure the enduring and complete defeat of ISIS. Otherwise, these  numbers would be much worse.   In 2022, we were involved in 108 partner and 14 unilateral  operations, killing 466 ISIS operatives and detaining 215 others.   None of us want our soldiers overseas and in harm's way any longer  than is absolutely necessary. I understand that the gentleman from  Florida has introduced this resolution in good faith and is well  intentioned, and he did it in response to a February 17 operation to  kill an ISIS leader, in which four U.S. servicemembers were wounded.   Any injured or killed servicemember is a tragedy. We are eternally  grateful for the sacrifice made by our men and women in uniform and  their families and never take them for granted.   It is our responsibility as Members of Congress to reassess, on an  ongoing basis, whether their deployments and the risk they involve are  necessary. In doing that, we must recall President Obama's disastrous  decision to prematurely withdraw our troops from Iraq in 2011.   A few short years later, American troops returned to fight the deadly  ISIS caliphate, which grew out of the al-Qaida presence that had not  been defeated.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, was in Syria just  days ago to see our troops and assess the state of our mission. He went  there to figure out what value this mission holds for our security. He  said: ``Unless you support and devote the correct amount of resources  to it, things will get worse,'' and, ``If you completely ignore and  turn your back, then you are setting the conditions for a resurgence.''   That is why I strongly oppose this resolution directing the removal  of United States Armed Forces from Syria, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.                                time  1415    If we withdraw our troops from Syria now, we could see a resurgence  of ISIS or another lethal successor in a short time. Withdrawal of this  legal, authorized U.S. troop deployment must be based on the total  defeat of ISIS.   Let me be clear: Congress' power to declare war is one of our most  solemn Article I responsibilities. I understand why some in this  Chamber are uncomfortable with using a 22-year-old force authorization  for current operations.   I believe that we should be working together, in a bipartisan manner,  to have an updated replacement to this AUMF to address the current  threat environment, while also keeping Congress engaged with our  constitutional responsibilities.   But this resolution does not work to that end. I believe it would  call for an artificial withdrawal and it would be a win for the ISIS  terrorists committed to our destruction.   The bottom line is: The premise upon this resolution--as the  Parliamentarian doesn't make fact-based determinations--the premise of  this whole thing is that there is no authorization for troops to be in  Syria today. It is just not accurate. In fact, it is wrong. In 2014,  the ISIS threat was addressed under the Presidential authority of the  2001 AUMF.   I remember being in the White House with President Trump addressing  this crisis, as well, about what to do about Syria, and whether we  believe our U.S. troops should remain, in a very small footprint of 900  soldiers, in Syria.   At that time, President Trump made the decision that, under the 2001  AUMF, to keep these troops in country, and I believe that was the  correct decision, and I stand by that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in this opposition, and  I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1174]]         Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), a member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my colleague, who serves with me on  the Foreign Affairs Committee, we are a lot in agreement. I think the  2001 AUMF is outdated, and it should have been sunsetted. Congress has  a constitutional responsibility to address this. Now, as chairman, that  is my intention, and I hope to work with the gentleman on this.   But the point is, this is a privileged resolution under the War  Powers Act 5(c), section (c), that basically says if U.S. forces are  engaged in hostilities without authorization, such forces shall be  removed by the President, if directed by a congressional concurrent  resolution.   We have authorization here, and it is the 2001 AUMF. We may not like  that. We can debate whether we need to update this thing, and I think  we do. The ranking member and I have had these discussions, as well.  But that is really the centerpiece of what we are talking about on this  privileged resolution.   So when this is all said and done, I hope we can perhaps work on  updating this outdated authorized use of military force to what is the  modern-day threat.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Lawler).                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me say, it has been a good debate. There is nothing  more important in this body than issues of war and peace and what we  have been talking about today.   I was a counterterrorism Federal prosecutor after 9/11 and the  chairman of the Homeland Security Committee when ISIS and the caliphate  were at their strength with external operations and, yes, the southern  border and the threat that that poses. We can talk about the merits  some more, and I appreciate this discussion.   But at the heart of this under the War Powers Resolution privilege  is, and I am quoting directly: `` . . . that United States Armed Forces  are engaged in hostilities . . . without a declaration of war or  specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the  President if the Congress so directs. . . . `'   The authority is there, and if you look under the AUMF of 2001 `` . .  . to prevent any future acts of international terrorism. . . . `'   I want to close with what President Trump said. I was a part of this  decision with him on June 9, 2020. He said:         Since October 7, 2001, United States Armed Forces have       conducted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida. Since       August of 2014, they have targeted the Islamic State of Iraq       and Syria, otherwise known as ISIS, formerly known as al-      Qaida in Iraq.        These ongoing operations have been successful in seriously       degrading ISIS capabilities in Syria and Iraq.    If we want to start having a debate without repealing and replacing  the 2001 AUMF, then I would just argue to my colleagues that that would  be the productive route to fix this issue of whether the United States  should be present in the Middle East at all.   And to close, our Afghanistan hearing, what a mess we have left  behind and what a threat that has become, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
