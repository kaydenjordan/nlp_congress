 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a high  school in our community that has demonstrated its commitment to safe- driving practices.   Conwell-Egan Catholic High School, my alma mater, recently won the  11th Annual Bucks County High School Seatbelt Safety Challenge. Of 19  participating schools, Conwell-Egan had the highest percentage of  students who  [[Page H5368]]  wore seatbelts, at 97 percent. Conwell-Egan also had the largest jump  from students not wearing seatbelts to those wearing them, rising 9  percent from the fall.   This impressive accomplishment would not be possible without the hard  work of several key students in promoting safe driving initiatives.  They are Robert Phinn, Todd Hartman, and Emma Kirby, who worked under  the guidance of a dedicated faculty member, in particular, faculty  member Josh Beauchamp.   I commend these individuals for their work in encouraging safety and  accountability throughout Bucks County, and for making alumni like  myself very proud.                                Opioid Crisis     Madam Speaker, as our Nation continues to grapple  with the opioid crisis, I am proud to be working in a bipartisan  fashion with my colleagues to advance necessary legislation to fight  drug abuse and addiction in our communities.   Just as impactful as treatment and sound policy in fighting this  public health crisis is a personal touch to provide comfort and  motivation to those struggling. And that is what Marti Hottenstein and  her Bucks County charity gives to homeless individuals in our area.   How to Save a Life Foundation, based in Warminster, was started by  Marti to honor the life of her son, Karl, who tragically passed away  from a drug overdose in 2006 after he was denied treatment.   Today, Marti and volunteers from How to Save a Life Foundation pass  out food, toiletries, and treatment resources to those struggling from  addiction in our community, who, in many instances, have nowhere else  to turn.   I applaud Marti and all of the volunteers of How to Save a Life  Foundation for their good deeds and dedication to ending addiction and  the stigma that often comes with it. Together, we can and must put an  end to the opioid crisis.           Congratulating Montgomery County Senior Softball League     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Montgomery County Senior Softball League, which celebrated its 20th  anniversary in Hatfield Township, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.   The league, founded by Vic Zoldy of Souderton, serves to provide  recreational opportunities to individuals over 60 years of age. To  date, it has grown to an organization with 16 teams and close to 200  players. It has become so popular over time that there is now a waiting  list to join the league.   In addition to Vic, there are several other players who have played  each year since its inaugural season including: Ray Forlano, 80 years  old, of Warwick; and Angelo Malizia, 90 years old, from Harleysville.   I am proud of the commitment that these people in this league have,  the Montgomery County Senior Softball League. I am proud of the  camaraderie that they add to our community, recognizing the importance  of staying active.   To Vic, Ray, and Angelo, I look forward to taking the field with you  in 2034.                            ____________________
