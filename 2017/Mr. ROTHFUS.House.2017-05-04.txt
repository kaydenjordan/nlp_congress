 Mr. Speaker, I am listening to this debate and I am  hearing a lot of demagoguery and no solutions, no solutions for people  who have seen skyrocketing premiums, no solutions for people who have  lost their healthcare plans, no solutions for people who have lost  their doctors, no solutions for people with preexisting conditions who  are subject to the same skyrocketing premiums as everybody else, no  solutions for people with preexisting conditions who don't even have an  insurer in their exchanges.   I, too, have a preexisting condition. I am a cancer survivor. I am in  the individual market. I am seeing the same skyrocketing premiums as  everybody else. We are moving legislation today that will not only  protect those with preexisting conditions, but will work to bring down  premiums.   Importantly, those defending the Affordable Care Act had a goal:  single-payer, socialized medicine, and this legislation will stop it.   Vote for this legislation, save our healthcare system, and have a  much better result for the American people.   Mr. McGOVERN. May I inquire of the gentleman how many more speakers  he has?
