 Mr. President, later this afternoon, the House of  Representatives will vote on a bipartisan agreement that will protect  the U.S. economy and eliminate the risk of a disastrous default. Once  this bill reaches the Senate, I will move to bring it to the floor as  soon as possible. Although the House still has more work to do,  Senators should be prepared to move on this bill quickly once it is the  Senate's turn to act.   I cannot stress enough that we have no margin--no margin--for error.  Either we proceed quickly and send this bipartisan agreement to the  President's desk or the Federal Government will default for the first  time ever.   It is imperative that we avoid a default. The consequences of  slipping past the deadline would reverberate across the world and take  years to recover from. Remember, a default would almost certainly  trigger another recession, send costs soaring, kill millions and  millions of jobs--hard-working people thrown out of work through no  fault of their own. That would be a catastrophic nightmare for our  economy and millions--millions--of American families.   So any needless delay, any last-minute brinksmanship at this point  would be an unacceptable risk. Moving quickly and working together to  avoid default is the responsible and necessary thing to do.   Nobody on either side thinks this agreement is perfect, that is for  sure. Nobody got everything they wanted. But this agreement still  accomplishes two major goals: It spares the American people from the  catastrophe of default, and it preserves the most important investments  we have passed over the past few years, many of them on a bipartisan  basis. So moving forward on this agreement is the sensible,  responsible, and very necessary thing to do.   We are getting close to finally putting the threat of default behind  us, but there is more work to do. I hope that the House does its job  when it takes up the bill later today. I urge my colleagues in this  Chamber to be prepared to move quickly when the time comes.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.  [[Page S1853]]     Mr. President, I move to adjourn until 10:11 p.m.  tonight.   The motion was agreed to.
