 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Mental  Health Awareness Month to talk about a growing group of individuals who  need our help: our veterans.   More than 16 percent of veterans have been diagnosed with a  depressive disorder. Up to 43 percent struggle with symptoms of mental  health issues, such as drinking excessively, smoking, or sleeplessness.  These struggles have resulted in an unacceptably high suicide rate for  our veterans. Every day, 20 veterans take their own lives, which is  almost double the rate of nonveterans.   Mr. Speaker, this is heartbreaking. It is unacceptable, and we must  act. That is why I was proud today to join with  [[Page H4296]]  Congressman Tim Ryan in introducing the Veterans Wellness Act of 2017.   This bill brings mental healthcare to our veterans by establishing a  2-year grant program to provide wellness care and additional therapies  at veteran service organizations like the American Legion, the VFW, and  AMVETS. Many offer skilled assistance with VA enrollment that could  help our veterans get the care that they so desperately need.   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to ensure  our veterans receive the best care possible.                            ____________________
