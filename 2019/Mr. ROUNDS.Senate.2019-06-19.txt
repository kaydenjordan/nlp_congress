 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Wendell  Hanson, as he celebrates his centennial birthday this year. Wendell was  born on August 4, 1919, in Sioux Falls, SD.   Wendell Hanson graduated from Washington High School in Sioux Falls.  He attended 1 year of college at Augustana College in Sioux Falls  before transferring to the University of Texas, where he was President  of Alpha Phi Omega.   Wendell enlisted in Active Duty in the Army Air Force on September 5,  1941, and served in World War II as a B-25 combat pilot in low-altitude  attack missions from bases in China and India. He was flight leader  under General C. L. Chennault's 14th Air Force Flying Tigers. Among the  medals he was awarded are the Distinguished Flying Cross for  distinguishing himself by heroism and extraordinary achievement while  participating in aerial flight, the  [[Page S3838]]  Air Medal with oakleaf cluster, three Bronze Stars, and China's  Liberation Medal. After his tour of duty in the war overseas, he taught  instructor pilots how to teach combat air tactics to pilots. He served  in the Air Force Reserve and retired in 1964 as a lieutenant colonel.   On August 11, 1945, Wendell married Helen A. Brumbaugh at First  United Methodist Church in Sioux Falls. Wendell met Helen when she was  a teacher at Vermillion High School. In January of 1945, he flew to  Sioux Falls from Texas and drove his father's car to Vermillion to  recruit potential Air Force pilots. Prior to speaking with students, he  spoke with Helen for a few minutes in a school hallway. A month later,  without further communication, Wendell sent a letter to Helen asking  her to marry him. Helen replied, ``I do not even know you well enough  to say no.'' After many months of letters, Helen said, ``Yes.'' They  lived near Waco, TX, while Wendell taught instructor pilots at Lackland  Air Force Base, then moved to Ann Arbor, MI, for 2 years before finally  returning to Sioux Falls.   Wendell and Helen had five children, Doug, Gail, Gary, Allen, and  Martha, as well as eight grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.   As a dedicated public servant, Wendell served in the South Dakota  Senate from 1977-78 and from 1981-1982. In his spare time, he enjoys  golf, international travel, pheasant hunting, fishing, and camping. He  was an active member of Hope Lutheran Church, where he served as  President of the congregation and Sunday school teacher. He was also a  member of Peace Lutheran Church and currently attends Abiding Savior  Lutheran.   I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Wendell Hanson for his  service to our country and wish him a very happy 100th birthday, good  health, and prosperity.                            ____________________
