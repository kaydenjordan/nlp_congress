 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a month ago yesterday, Senate Democrats  shoved another partisan spending bill through the Senate--this one, the  inaccurately named ``Inflation Reduction Act.'' I say ``inaccurately  named'' because the so-called Inflation Reduction Act will do nothing  to reduce inflation. That is right. The so-called Inflation Reduction  Act will not actually reduce inflation. You don't have to take my word  for it; the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model said this about the  bill's impact on inflation: ``The impact on inflation is statistically  indistinguishable from zero''--``statistically indistinguishable from  zero.''   Democrats also claim that the bill will lead to deficit reduction,  but that is not really true, either. In the first place, Democrats  arrive at their deficit reduction assumptions using some extremely  fuzzy math. A substantial part of their deficit reduction claims depend  on not extending a program that they have already called for extending  and on supposedly eliminating a rule that at this point was never going  to be implemented anyway.   But even using their rosiest assumptions, the deficit reduction they  would have achieved with the Inflation Reduction Act was wiped out  completely 8 days after the bill was signed by the President's costly,  reckless student loan giveaway.   Democrats have clearly been seeing the polling on Americans' opinion  of the economy and their lack of faith in President Biden and Democrats  to deal with the economic challenges we are facing. That is  unquestionably why Democrats named their bill the ``Inflation Reduction  Act'' and touted their commitment to deficit reduction in an attempt to  suggest fiscal responsibility. The problem, of course, is that their  commitment to deficit reduction, inflation reduction, and fiscal  responsibility was and continues to be nothing more than window  dressing.   At its core, the Inflation Reduction Act, like the so-called American  Rescue Plan before it, is just another big government, big spending  piece of legislation. It will do nothing to address the real economic  challenges facing our Nation. Instead, it will waste taxpayer dollars  on Democrats' big government fantasies. It will drive up energy costs  in the service of Democrats' Green New Deal agenda. It will push people  off private insurance and into government-run healthcare, driving up  the cost to taxpayers. The legislation imposes socialist-style price  controls that will discourage medical innovation and reduce the number  of new treatments and cures. It imposes new taxes on businesses that  will slow economic growth and result in lower wages and fewer jobs. And  the list goes on.   In case there was any doubt about their intentions with this bill,  Democrats made their priorities very, very clear when the Senate  considered amendments. Democrats' so-called Inflation Reduction Act  hikes taxes on domestic oil and gas production--something that will  unquestionably result in higher energy prices for American families,  who are already facing higher energy bills in the Biden economy.    During the amendment vote-arama on this legislation, Democrats made  it very clear that they are, indeed, just fine with restricting  American energy production and seeing Americans' energy bills soar.   Democrats rejected attempts to ease their tax hikes on domestic oil  and gas. They rejected amendments to make it easier for companies to  develop American oil and natural gas. They also rejected a  comprehensive amendment to reform the burdensome permitting process,  which is one of the biggest obstacles to new energy investment. They  even rejected an amendment to prevent Democrats' new electric vehicle  tax credit from going to wealthy Americans. So apparently it is just  fine to support measures that would drive up Americans' energy bills,  but electric vehicle tax breaks for wealthy Americans have to be  preserved, not to mention the irony of U.S. automakers recently hiking  prices on certain electric vehicles by $6,500 to $8,000, which roughly  matches the $7,500 tax credit in the Democrats' inflation reduction  bill.   Now, I have been a longtime supporter of clean energy, but the fact  of the matter is, clean energy technology has not advanced to a point  where we can solely rely on alternative energy. We need oil, we need  natural gas, and we will continue to need them for a while yet. Efforts  to discourage domestic production of conventional energy will simply  drive up energy costs for hard-working Americans and force our country  to rely on unstable foreign sources of oil and gas. Now, that may very  well be the Democrats' plan in hopes of hastening the arrival of their  Green New Deal future.   Democrats like to bill themselves as the party of the little guy, but  their track record gives the lie to that. Democrats couldn't bring  themselves to support measures to lower Americans' energy bills by  increasing domestic oil and gas production because it conflicts with  their Green New Deal ideology. They did all unite to protect a tax  deduction that mainly goes to wealthy Americans in high-tax States and  to make sure, as I mentioned, that wealthy Americans are able to access  tax credits for electric vehicles.   Of course, they opposed a measure to prevent more audits of Americans  making less than $400,000 a year. That is right. Democrats' legislation  includes tens of billions of dollars for new IRS agents and increased  audits. Democrats' hope is that more audits of Americans will help pay  for some of their spending measures like increased government  healthcare subsidies and their Green New Deal priorities.   The Biden administration put out a statement claiming that this  wouldn't mean increased audits of Americans making less than $400,000 a  year, but when Democrats had the opportunity to confirm that by  supporting an amendment that would have prevented the new enforcement  funds from being used to audit Americans making less than $400,000 a  year, they unanimously--unanimously--voted against it.   I could go on. I haven't even talked about the border security  amendments the Democrats opposed. Republicans thought that perhaps,  while Democrats were throwing money at environmental justice and  climate slush funds and identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage,  perhaps they could spare some money for the crisis at our southern  border--a crisis that Democrats have largely chosen to pretend doesn't  exist. But Democrats quashed any attempt to divert money to address the  border crisis. Apparently, identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage is  more important than securing our southern border.   Democrats went so far as to oppose--oppose--an amendment that would  have prohibited hiring additional IRS agents until additional Customs  and Border Protection agents are hired to help secure the border. You  heard that right. Now, I am pretty sure Americans are more worried  about our border crisis than what Democrats apparently think is an IRS  enforcement crisis. But  [[Page S4501]]  clearly Democrats don't want to let border security get in the way of  funding for the Green New Deal priorities or supersizing the IRS.   It may have an appealing name, but, as the substance of the bill  demonstrates, the so called Inflation Reduction Act is nothing more  than the latest installment of Democrats' big government and big  spending agenda. It will do nothing to address the real economic  challenges facing Americans, and it will do nothing to address  Americans' priorities. What it will do is spend hundreds of billions of  taxpayer dollars on Democrats' socialist and big government fantasies  and raise taxes to help pay for it. Meanwhile, our inflation crisis and  our border crisis and rising crime will continue.   I yield the floor.
