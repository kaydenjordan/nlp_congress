 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I include in  the Record, first a letter from the Commissioner of Revenue Services in  the State of Connecticut, who has detailed out the impact of this tax  on Connecticut residents.                                                   November 8, 2017.      Hon. John B. Larson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Larson: Thank you for opportunity to       comment on the federal tax changes being considered in H.R.       1. We appreciate your leadership in trying to set the record       straight as this partisan effort is rushed to judgment with       no real input and much fiscal uncertainty.        Unfortunately, what we see so far from a national and state       perspective is very troubling. Some of the proposals to       reduce taxes on corporate and pass-through business income       could provide needed economic stimulus nationally and for       states like Connecticut. Unfortunately, on balance, H.R. 1 is       fundamentally flawed:        Even the low estimate of a $1.5 trillion cost is not paid       for and is really massive federal tax deficit spending. The       nation has been down this road before and surely we should       have learned something from the worst economic recession in       modern times.        Otherwise unaffordable tax cuts have long been part of a       political strategy to ``starve the beast.'' Due to its long       term unfunded cost, this Republican tax plan will compel big       cuts in federal funding, such as Medicaid, that are important       to states like Connecticut.        Contrary to all the talk of a ``middle income tax cut,''       the plan actually represents a huge windfall to the very       wealthiest federal taxpayers and is truly regressive. For our       own state of Connecticut, over 75% of the tax cut goes to the       top 1% who would pay 8.5% less on average. Everyone else       would see a trivial 1.2% reduction in federal tax liability       and many will actually owe much more in federal income taxes.        As discussed more specifically below, the proposed plan       shifts most of the tax cost and the least of any tax benefit       to states in the Northeast, Great Lakes and West Coast       regions of the country. Thus, Connecticut and similar states       will even more disproportionately pay in federal taxes far       more than is received in federal benefits--further       subsidizing regions of the country where states make far less       of a state and local tax effort.        Drilling down a bit further, several aspects of this       partisan plan will hit especially hard:        Eliminating deductibility of state income tax paid is worth       an estimated $8.7 billion to mostly middle income Connecticut       taxpayers.        Capping deductibility of local property tax paid at $10,000       will increase federal income taxes for a significant       proportion of Connecticut taxpayers who claim $4.9 billion.        Any benefit to lower and lower moderate income taxpayers       from higher standard deductions and child care credits will       likely be more than offset by the shell game of imposing a       higher lowest rate bracket of 12% and replacing the current       $4,050 personal exemption with a $300 deduction that is       proposed to end in 5 years.        Eliminating deductibility of medical/dental expenses will       be $1.6 billion hardship for Connecticut taxpayers at all       levels who are out of work and have catastrophic medical       costs.        Eliminating deductibility of student loan interest only       adds a further financial burden for primarily younger       taxpayers and their families already struggling with       educational indebtedness.        Sadly, these and many other significant issues of fiscal       irresponsibility and tax unfairness seem to be of no concern       in the partisan rush to pass legislation before taxpayers see       through the slogans and realize the costs. Indeed, glimpses       of what may be in the Republican Senate version suggests that       it will only get worse. Thank you for your efforts to speak       out for our Connecticut taxpayers and set the record       straight.            Sincerely,                                                 Kevin B. Sullivan,                                                      Commissioner.     Second, Mr. Speaker, I include in the  Record a letter out of a cross section of constituents who are directly  and adversely impacted by this tax increase.                             MIDDLE CLASS CUTS               Ms. Diane Hebenstreit--West Hartford, CT 06107         I am a lifetime resident of Connecticut, and I ask that you       do not vote for the proposed Federal Tax plan. From what I       see, it's providing large tax breaks that benefit the rich       and the corporations.        The estate tax benefit we have now is more than generous,       only the very wealthy will benefit from repealing the estate       tax.        The proposed caps on state and property tax deductions       combined with the increased standard deduction, will cause       myself as well as others to use the standard deduction       instead of itemizing. This will eliminate the financial       benefit of owning my home, and I am concerned it will       negatively affect its value.        The personal exemption of $4,050 is going away. This is not       something that's been highlighted in the news. So as a single       payer, I'll receive a $12,000 standard deduction, but loose       the $4,050 personal exemption resulting in more of my income       being taxed than under the current plan.        And at a higher rate! I am currently in the 10% tax       bracket. Under this new plan it will increase to 12%.        This is not a tax plan that benefits me, or I expect any       other middle income resident. Vote No.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  [[Page H9385]]  transcript of an interview with our esteemed chairman, Kevin Brady, and  Heidi Przybyla that appeared on ``Morning Joe.''           Kevin Brady-Morning Joe Transcript--Friday, November 3         Heidi Przybyla, USA Today: This economic growth that you       all are promising, it cannot happen unless the cuts occur at       the same time. In fact the Joint Committee on Taxation's       economic model assumes that the type of tax cuts that you're       doing now that are not paid for could actually be a drag on       economic growth. Can you please speak to that?        Brady: The reason we moved back towards a balanced budget       is one, there is substantial growth, miss, but again, that       won't do it. You have to simplify the code, eliminate so much       of these special breaks on the business and the individual       side as well. It's the combination of both of those that gets       you back to a balanced budget over time. That's why people       complain `Look you're really simplifying the code       dramatically, there's a lot of things that go'. Not everyone       is happy about that but that is what, sort of the tough       choices you have to make, along with growth, to make sure       this moves us toward a balanced budget.        Przybyla: But that is not what's happening here. This is       still, regardless of these loopholes that you're closing,       it's still a big blowhole in the deficit and that is not what       the model was in '86 for instance when Reagan did it. This       model that I'm speaking of still assumes that this could be a       drag on economic growth because you're not doing the type of       spending cuts, not just simplification in the code, but       spending cuts.        Brady: Here, one, there are a number of models on growth       and I'm sure there will be a healthy debate, that's a good       thing. What we know is this dramatically grows the economy in       revenues not just here in Washington, but state and local       levels as well. But you make a great point: tax reform alone,       alone won't get us to a balanced budget, we have to have       spending constraints along with that. As I know, as House       Republicans, we are turning toward welfare reform and how we       tackle our entitlements in a way to save them. That's all       part of the steps it takes to get us back to a fiscally       responsible area. But I do know this, is you want to see       continued deficits and debts, just stay with a slow growth       economy like we saw the last ten years. We know what that       produced.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record  a letter from AARP, who is in opposition to this bill.                                                            AARP,                                                  November 15, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our members and all       Americans age 50 and older, AARP is writing to express our       views on H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. AARP, with its       nearly 38 million members in all 50 States and the District       of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, represents       individuals affected by H.R. 1 in myriad ways. As we did with       the last major effort at tax reform a generation ago, AARP is       prepared to support tax legislation that makes the tax code       more equitable and efficient, promotes growth, and produces       sufficient revenue to pay for critical national programs,       including Medicare and Medicaid. However, H.R. 1 in its       current form does not meet these criteria.        Efforts to restructure all or part of the federal tax       system should in particular recognize the importance of--and       therefore maintain--incentives for health and retirement       security. Such incentives are not only important to assist       individuals in attaining the security they deserve, but are       vital to our nation's future economic well-being AARP is       dedicated to enhancing retirement security, including       retention of the extra standard deduction for those ages 65       or older; improving access to, and targeted incentives for,       work-place retirement saving plans, and protection of earned       pensions for vulnerable retirees and their families. We       greatly appreciate that H.R. 1 rejects proposals to make       significant changes to the tax treatment of retirement       contributions, which would have affected the ability or       commitment of many tax filers to save for their retirement.       AARP also remains committed to advocating for affordable,       meaningful health care, including retention of the medical       expense itemized deduction at 7.5%, preservation of tax       exempt status of employer sponsored insurance coverage;       maintenance of tax subsidies for lower- and moderate-income       Americans to purchase health insurance coverage in health       care marketplaces; and the creation of a new, non-refundable       tax credit for working family caregivers.        As tax legislation advances, changes to the tax code should       not result in a disproportionate, adverse impact on older       Americans According to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT),       H.R. 1 will reduce taxes for millions of taxpayers beginning       in 2019. We are concerned, however, that in 2027, also       according to JCT, the 73 million taxpayers with incomes       between $10,000 and $50,000 would collectively pay $2.9       billion more in individual income taxes AARP has estimated       that H.R. 1 will increase taxes on 1.2 million taxpayers age       65 and older in 2018, and by 2027, 4.9 million older       taxpayers will experience higher taxes In addition, H.R. 1       will provide no tax relief for 5.1 million older taxpayers in       2018 and 5.3 million taxpayers by 2027.        The impact on older tax filers is the cumulative result of       many policy changes made in H.R. 1, but a number of specific       provisions disproportionately affect older Americans. Nearly       three-quarters of tax filers who claim the medical expense       deduction are age 50 or older and live with a chronic       condition or illness. Seventy percent of filers who claim       this deduction have income below $75,000. H.R. 1 also       eliminates the additional standard deduction for filers who       are 65 and older, while at the same time increasing the       lowest tax rate. These provisions, along with other proposals       that more broadly affect the tax liability of millions of       filers, such as the expiration of the new Family Flexibility       Credit in 2023, and the partial repeal of the state and local       tax deduction, result in little tax benefit to many older tax       filers, and for others, a tax increase.        Also troubling is the negative effect H.R. 1 will have on       the nation's ability to fund critical priorities. H.R. 1 will       increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next ten       years, and an unknown amount beyond 2027. The large increase       in the deficit will inevitably lead to calls for greater       spending cuts, which are likely to include dramatic cuts to       Medicare, Medicaid and other critical programs serving older       Americans. The Congressional Budget Office has now published       a letter stating that unless Congress takes action, H.R. 1       will result in automatic federal funding cuts of $136 billion       in fiscal year 2018, $25 billion of which must come from       Medicare.        We urge Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to enact       tax legislation that better meets the needs of older       Americans and the nation, and we stand ready to work with you       toward that end.            Sincerely,                                               Nancy A. LeaMond,                                        Executive Vice President and                             Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer.     Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I include in the  Record a letter from the Congressional Budget Office, which details out  the other shoe to fall in this legislation.                                        Congressional Budget Office,                                                   U.S. Congress,                                  Washington, DC, November 13, 2017.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Democratic Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman: This letter responds to your request for       information about the effects of legislation that would raise       deficits by an estimated $1.5 trillion over the 2018-2027       period, specifically with respect to a sequestration--or       cancellation of budgetary resources--in accordance with the       Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO; Public Law 111-      139).        The PAYGO law requires that new legislation enacted during       a term of Congress does not collectively increase estimated       deficits. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is       required to maintain two so-called PAYGO scorecards to report       the cumulative changes generated by new legislation in       estimated revenues and outlays over the next five years and       ten years. If either scorecard indicates a net increase in       the deficit, OMB is required to order a sequestration to       eliminate the overage. The authority to determine whether a       sequestration is required (and if so, exactly how to make the       necessary cuts in budget authority) rests solely with OMB.        CBO has analyzed the implications of enacting a bill that       would increase deficits by $1.5 trillion over a 10-year       window, without enacting any further legislation to offset       that increase. In accordance with the PAYGO law, OMB would       record the average annual deficit on its PAYGO scorecard,       showing deficit increases of, in the example provided, $150       billion per year. If the bill were enacted before the end of       the calendar year, that amount would be added to the current       balances on the PAYGO scorecard, which for 2018, show a       positive balance of $14 billion. (For years after 2018, the       balances range from a $14 billion credit to a $1 billion       debit.)        Without enacting subsequent legislation to either offset       that deficit increase, waive the recordation of the bill's       impact on the scorecard, or otherwise mitigate or eliminate       the requirements of the PAYGO law, OMB would be required to       issue a sequestration order within 15 days of the end of the       session of Congress to reduce spending in fiscal year 2018 by       the resultant total of $136 billion. However, the PAYGO law       limits reductions to Medicare to four percentage points (or       roughly $25 billion for that year), leaving about $111       billion to be sequestered from the remaining mandatory       accounts. Because the law entirely exempts many large       accounts including low-income programs and social security,       the annual resources available from which OMB must draw is,       in CBO's estimation, only between $85 billion to $90 billion,       significantly less than the amount that would be required to       be sequestered. (For a full list of accounts subject to       automatic reductions, see OMB Report to the Congress on the       Joint Committee Reductions for Fiscal Year 2018, https:// go.usa.gov/xnZ3U.)        Given that the required reduction in spending exceeds the       estimated amount of available resources in each year over the       next 10 years, in the absence of further legislation, OMB       would be unable to implement the full extent of outlay       reductions required by the PAYGO law.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.     Mr. Speaker, let me begin by preempting  [[Page H9386]]  our distinguished chairman and, for the Record, state that a middle  class family in the State of Connecticut, from West Hartford, with a  combined income of $125,000, with a mortgage and a kid in college,  according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and to the Department of  Revenue Services in the State of Connecticut, will see a tax increase  of $767 next year.   Then with the clever clawback provision--that Grover Norquist kind of  clawback provision that gives with one hand and takes away with the  other--in 2023, that hardworking family in the middle class will see a  $1,667 increase.   So why are we here?   It is pretty easy to figure out this. These are honorable people, but  sometimes they are called upon to do a political task, or as Mr.  Collins put it: My donors are basically saying, ``Get it done or don't  ever call me again.''   Speaking of New York, my colleagues in New York and New Jersey,  because we are donor States and because we make itemized deductions, we  find ourselves in the situation where we are paying double taxation.   Don't take our word for it. Just ask a member of your own caucus. Ask  Peter King, who describes this as the most massive redistribution of  wealth at the expense of teachers, machinists, and people who are of  the professional class whom you have found that you want to tax their  success.   But what adds insult to injury above all else, aside from being a  donor State and double taxation, is the cruelest cut. We take a Pledge  of Allegiance. We pledge allegiance to the Constitution. But some of  you pledge allegiance to Grover Norquist. In doing so, you want to make  sure that you can shrink Social Security and Medicare up so small you  can drown it in the bathtub.   That is what this does: $25 billion will come out of that.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to direct their remarks  to the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley), the chairman of the Democratic  Caucus and a great leader on the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  New York an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  New York an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the son of a preacher man,  who always speaks truth to power.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the lead Democrat on the Foreign  Affairs Committee who understands the impact of double taxation from a  donor State.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the voice of Houston.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is not the American Dream tax  plan. This is the American nightmare, a tax scam of the worst  proportion.   With over 8,000 of my constituents last evening on a teleconference  town hall meeting, overwhelmingly they disagreed with a tax plan that  cuts Medicare or Medicaid to finance tax cuts, eliminates the mortgage  tax deduction, so that those who are suffering from Hurricane Harvey,  trying to rebuild their lives, seeking a new home cannot, in fact,  deduct their mortgage.   The same thing with the 200,000 Texans who are going to pay more  because we are eliminating the deduction for State and local taxes, and  eliminating deductions for student loans, casualty losses; by next  year, $25 billion in Social Security cuts.   My seniors on the phone last night asked me about those cuts. They  asked me about the medical expenses cuts for seniors. All of that is  eliminated.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a sample of tele-townhall survey  questions and answers               Tax Tele-Townhall Survey Questions and Answers         (1) Do you agree that a tax bill should cut tax at the       expense of Medicaid and Medicare? 95 percent said no.        (2) The current tax reform bill will eliminate the tax       deduction for student loan interest and the lifetime learning       credit. Do you support the elimination of these tax credits?       91 percent said no.        (3) The current tax code allows homeowners to deduct       interest on mortgages. Would you support a tax plan that       includes a reduction in credit for first-time home buyers? 95       percent said no.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this plan will show no growth. The  neutral tax policy entity said you will get no growth, no growth in  wages, and you will send jobs overseas in waves.   It is a tax scam and it is an American nightmare. Vote against this  tax scam   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong  and unyielding opposition to H.R. 1, the so-called ``Tax Cut and Jobs  Act,'' which more accurately should be called the ``Republican Tax Scam  Act.''   I oppose this cruel and immoral $1.7 trillion tax giveaway to wealthy  corporations and the top one percent because it raises taxes on poor,  working, and middle class families; explodes the deficit by adding an  additional $2.2 trillion over ten years; and will require an estimated  $5.4 trillion cut in funding for the programs ordinary Americans depend  on for health security, educational opportunity, and economic progress.   Mr. Speaker, Americans are not fooled; they know trickle-down  economics has never worked, and they see right through this phony tax  plan and recognize it for the scam that it is.   That is why Americans reject this Republican tax giveaway by an  overwhelming 2:1 margin according to a poll released yesterday by  Quinnipiac.   Specifically, 61 percent think the Republican tax scam will benefit  the wealthy the most; only 16 percent say the plan will reduce their  taxes.   59 percent think it is a very bad idea to eliminate the deduction for  state and local income taxes.   Nearly half of respondents (40 percent) think it a bad idea to lower  the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.   This Republican tax plan is even more toxic to my constituents in the  Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, as you may know, my constituents and others in Texas are  still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane  Harvey, the worst storm ever to make landfall in the continental United  States.   Yet last evening, nearly 8,000 of them took time out of their busy  schedules to join me in a tele-townhall to discuss the tax scheme that  has been rushed to the floor for a vote by the Republican leadership in  the hope of passing it before the American people learn its insidious  details.   But I have got news for them: too late.   My constituents understand and let me know that they believe it is  important that the United States has a tax system that is fair,  balanced, smart, and provides the resources and opportunities to allow  all Americans to reach their potential.   And by margins exceeding 90 percent, they reject:   1. Any cuts to Medicare or Medicaid to finance tax cuts for wealthy  corporations and the top 1 percent;   2. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction;   3. Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes;   4. Eliminating existing deductions for student loan interest or  making taxable college endowment funds or college fellowships expenses.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents, and Americans across the country,  oppose this unfair Republican tax giveaway because nearly half of the  $1.7 trillion tax cut goes to just the top one percent.   In fact, the average annual tax cut for the top one-tenth of one  percent is $320,000; for the top one percent it is $62,000, and for  those earning $1 million a year it is $68,000.   Nearly 25 percent of the tax cut goes to households in just the top  one-tenth of one percent, who make at least $5 million a year (2027).   While super-wealthy corporations and individuals are reaping  windfalls, millions of middle-class and working families will see their  taxes go up:   1. 13 million households face a tax increase next year.   2. 45 million households face a tax increase in 2027.   3. 29 million households (21 percent) earning less than $100,000 a  year see a tax increase.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794  increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families  struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   It is shocking, but not surprising, that under this Republican tax  scam, the total value of tax cuts for just the top one percent is more  than the entire tax cut for the lower 95 percent of earners.   Put another way, those earning more than $912,000 a year will get  more in tax cuts than 180 million households combined.   The core of this Republican tax scheme is a massive tax cut from 35  percent to 20 percent for corporations, but that is not the only way  that the wealthy are rewarded.   The massive tax cuts for corporations are permanent but temporary for  working and middle-class families.   Another immoral aspect of this terrible tax scam is that it abandons  families that face natural disasters or high medical costs by repealing  deductions for casualty losses and medical expenses.   Mr. Speaker, in what universe does it make any sense to eliminate, as  this bill would, a deduction for:  [[Page H9404]]    1. Teachers who purchase supplies for their classroom;   2. Moving expenses to take a new job and taxes employer-provided  moving expenses; or   3. Dependent care assistance, making it harder for families to afford  day care, nursery school, or care for aging parents?   This Republican tax scam jeopardizes American innovation and  competitiveness by eliminating the deduction for student loan interest,  which affects 12 million borrowers, and cuts total education assistance  by more than $64 billion.   Under the extraordinary leadership of President Obama and the  determined efforts of ordinary Americans, we pulled our way out from  under the worst of the foreclosure crisis when the housing bubble burst  in 2007.   Inexplicably, Republicans are now championing a tax scheme that will  make the homes of average Americans less valuable because deductions  for mortgage interest and property taxes are much less valuable than  under current law.   A tax plan that reduces home values, as this one does, puts pressure  on states and towns to collect revenues they depend on to fund schools,  roads, and vital public resources.   Mr. Speaker, an estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state  and local taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   But this is not the end of the bad news that will be delivered were  this tax scam to become law, not by a long shot.   The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions  of Texans by taking away the $4,050 deduction for each taxpayer and  claimed dependent; in 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions  were claimed in the Lone Star State.   Equally terrible is that this Republican tax scam drastically reduces  the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7 million  low-income individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet with an  average credit of $2,689.   The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans,  including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year.   So to achieve their goal of giving more and more to the haves and the  ``have mores,'' our Republican friends are willing to betray seniors,  children, the most vulnerable and needy, and working and middle-class  families.   The $5.4 trillion cuts in program investments that will be required  to pay for this tax giveaway to wealthy corporations and individuals  will fall most heavily on low-income families, students struggling to  afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   America will not be made great by financing a $1.7 trillion tax cut  for the rich by stealing $1.8 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid,  abandoning seniors and families in need, depriving students of  realizing a dream to attend college without drowning in debt, or  disinvesting in the working families.   America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global,  interconnected, and digital economy by slashing funding for scientific  research, the arts and humanities, job retraining, and clean energy  just to pay for a tax cut to corporations and individuals who do not  even need it.   Mr. Speaker, the tax scheme presented here by Republicans is not a  plan but a scam that represents a betrayal of our values as a nation.   This tax scam is not a revenue policy adapted for the real world that  real Americans live in but a fantasy resting on the monstrous belief  that the wealthy have too little money and that poor, working, and  middle-class families have too much.   Our Republican friends continue to cling to the fantasy belief that  their tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves despite all  precedent to the contrary and evidence that their tax scheme is  projected by experts to lose between $3 trillion and $7 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, in evaluating the merits of a taxing system, it is not  enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the plan must also pass  a ``moral test.''   The Republican tax bill fails both of these standards.   I strongly oppose H.R. 1, the ``Republican Tax Scam Act,'' and urge  all Members to join me in voting against this reckless, cruel, and  heartless proposal that will do nothing to improve the lives or well- being of middle and working class families, and the poor and vulnerable  `caught in the tentacles of circumstance.'    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record The Washington  Post op-ed, ``The Republican tax plan's five worst dangers,'' by  Secretary Rubin, dated November 15, 2017                 [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15, 2017]                The Republican Tax Plan's Five Worst Dangers                             (By Robert Rubin)         The deficit-funded tax cuts advancing through Congress are       a fiscal tragedy for which our country will pay a huge price       over time. While the details of the tax plan remain in flux,       its fundamental contours will not change. Nor will its $1.5       trillion of deficit funding, the amount stipulated in the       recently passed budget resolution.        Perhaps it's hopeless to expect those in Congress who have       long bemoaned deficits and the debt to oppose the plan. If,       however, as a matter of conscience or renewed reflection they       decide to take heed, here are the fiscal dangers posed by the       plan.        To start, the tax cuts will not increase growth and, given       their fiscal effects, would likely have a significant and       increasingly negative impact. The nonpartisan Tax Policy       Center's latest report estimated that, over 10 years, the       average increase in our growth rate would be roughly zero,       counting the crowding out of private investment by increasing       deficits but not counting other adverse effects of worsening       our fiscal outlook. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, using the       same approach, estimates virtually no increase in long-term       growth. Goldman Sachs projects an increase of 0.1 percent to       0.2 percent in the first couple of years and an average       increase over 10 years of just 0.05 percent per year, not       counting any of the adverse fiscal effects.        These estimates reflect three underlying views held by       mainstream economists. First, individual tax cuts will not       materially induce people to work more. Second, corporate tax       cuts will likely have limited effect on investment or       decisions about where to locate  [[Page H9405]]       business activity, given the many other variables at play.       Third, deficit-funded tax cuts will have little short-term       effect on growth, except perhaps for some temporary       overheating, because we are at roughly full employment.        With no additional revenue from increased growth to offset       the tax cuts' cost, the publicly held debt of the federal       government would increase by $1.5 trillion. An additional       danger is that the actual deficit impact would be increased       by abandoning the Congressional Budget Office's nonpartisan       evaluation that has been used for decades by both parties in       favor of partisan calculations by those pushing the tax cuts.        Adding $1.5 trillion or more to the federal debt would make       an already bad situation worse. A useful measure of our       fiscal position is the ratio of publicly held government debt       to economic output or gross domestic product, called the       debt/GDP ratio. In 2000, the debt/GDP ratio was 32 percent.       The ratio is now 77 percent. Looking forward, the CBO       projects the debt/GDP ratio to be 91 percent in 2027 and 150       percent in 2047. After $1.5 trillion of deficit-funded tax       cuts, those future ratios have been estimated to increase to       roughly 97 percent in 2027 and 160 percent in 2047. These       estimates likely substantially understate the worsening of       our fiscal trajectory. That's because they do not account for       the increasingly adverse effect on growth of the difficult-      to-quantify effects of fiscal deterioration.        Exacerbating our already unsustainable fiscal trajectory       with these tax cuts would threaten growth in five respects.       These are highly likely to be substantial and to increase       over time.        First, business confidence would likely be negatively       affected by creating uncertainty about future policy and       heightening concern about our political system's ability to       meet our economic policy challenges.        Second, our country's resilience to deal with inevitable       future economic and geopolitical emergencies, including the       effects of climate change, would continue to decline.        Third, funds available for public investment, national       security and defense spending--a professed concern of many       tax-cut proponents--would continue to decline as debt rises,       because of rising interest costs and the increased risk of       borrowing to fund government activities.        Fourth, Treasury bond interest rates would be highly likely       to increase over time because of increased demand for the       supply of savings and increased concern about future       imbalances. That, in turn, would raise private-sector       interest rates, which could also increase due to widening       spreads vs. Treasuries, further reflecting increased concern       about future conditions. And even a limited increase in the       debt/GDP ratio could focus attention on our fiscal       trajectory's long-ignored risks and trigger outsize increases       in Treasury and private-sector interest rates. The ability to       borrow in our own currency, and to print it through the       Federal Reserve, may diminish these risks for a while, as       might capital inflows from abroad. But these mitigating       factors have their limits; at some point, unsound fiscal       conditions almost surely would undermine our currency and       debt markets.        Finally, at some unpredictable point, fiscal conditions--      and these market dynamics--would likely be seen as       sufficiently serious to cause severe market and economic       destabilization.        We have an imperative need to address our unsustainable       longer-term fiscal trajectory with sound economic policies.       Few elected officials want to face this fact, but, at the       very least, they should not make matters worse. We can only       hope that responsible elected officials will prevent this       irresponsible tax plan from being adopted.    The SPEAKER pro tempore.
