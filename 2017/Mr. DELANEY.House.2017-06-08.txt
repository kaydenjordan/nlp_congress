 Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding  me time.   Mr. Chairman, during the financial crisis, 19 of the 20 largest  financial institutions in the United States either required a bailout  or a significant investment by the taxpayers. Clearly, reform was  needed, and Dodd-Frank was that reform.   Since Dodd-Frank was put in place, consumer protections have improved  materially, the banking system is safer and more sound, and our banks  and our markets have far outpaced their international competitors.  Dodd-Frank is working.   Is it a perfect piece of legislation? Of course not. Anytime Congress  does something large and transforms an entire industry, we should sign  up as a body for 10 years of fixes, which is what we have not done, and  we have let the American people down.   Are we fixing Dodd-Frank today? No. We are pursuing a misguided and  time-consuming and wasteful repeal effort.   I urge my colleagues to reject the CHOICE Act, and I urge my  Republican colleagues to work with Democrats on bipartisan reforms to  Dodd-Frank that build on its strength and solve and improve weaknesses  in the legislation.
