 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the coronavirus has been the great revealer  in our country. This crisis, of course, isn't happening in a vacuum. It  is layered atop a system that already was not working for a whole lot  of people and that had centuries of racism built into it.   Few places is that more true than in our housing system. When it  comes to housing, like so many problems in this country, we have a  President who makes things worse, not better. For 4 years now,  President Trump and his administration have systematically undermined  fair housing.   I would add, since the Senator from Utah is in the Presiding  Officer's chair, that I would do a shout-out for his father and what he  did as Secretary of HUD in the late sixties, early seventies in trying  to move this country forward.   That was obviously not in my prepared remarks. I didn't know that you  would be presiding, but thank you.   The Trump agenda--very different from the agenda in the Romney HUD  administration--turned back the clock on civil rights protections that  leave communities of color, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ people  behind.   This week I released a comprehensive report from the Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, detailing the ways that President  Trump has made inequality and segregation in housing worse and the work  we have to do to undo the damage.   More than 50 years after Congress passed the Fair Housing Act, access  to housing remains not just unequal but separate and unequal.   The contours of our country are too often still defined by Black,  Latino, Asian or White neighborhoods, all with very different levels of  access to resources--schools, grocery stores, healthcare, clean air and  water, public safety.   This is not an accident; it has been done by design. For decades, the  Federal Government not only condoned housing segregation and  discrimination--perhaps unbelievably, perhaps not--it actively promoted  it.   We all know about Black codes. We know about Jim Crow, even if too  many want to deny we are still living with this Jim Crow legacy today.  It wasn't just the most blatant racist laws; discrimination was woven  into the creation of our modern housing system from the beginning.   After the Great Depression, President Roosevelt created the  government-sponsored Home Owners' Loan Corporation, the HOLC, and the  Federal Housing Administration, the FHA.   These could have been tools for expanding opportunity for everyone.  They did that for White Americans, but for Black Americans they did the  opposite. HOLC partnered with local real estate agents and appraisers  to make what they called residential security maps. These maps used  color coding to differentiate between supposedly high-  [[Page S5808]]  risk and low-risk neighborhoods, with green signifying the best  neighborhoods and red indicating a so-called hazardous area.   Neighborhoods that were home to people of color--even a small  percentage--were marked ``declining'' or ``hazardous.'' That is what we  know as redlining.   It was despicable racism, woven into the fabric of our housing  system. We still live with the results. Capital, in the form of low- cost, stable mortgages, flowed to White neighborhoods--like the  neighborhood in which I grew up in Mansfield, OH--and dried up in Black  neighborhoods or neighborhoods that were home to immigrants.   White borrowers were able to build wealth through home ownership that  could be passed down through families. Our government systematically  denied Black families the same wealth-building opportunity.   From 1934 through 1962, 98 percent--98 percent--of all FHA mortgages  went to White homeowners--98 percent.   It wasn't until Dr. King's assassination in 1968 that Congress  finally passed the Fair Housing Act to outlaw discrimination and  promote integrated communities. The Fair Housing Act was followed by  the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act and  the Community Reinvestment Act. These laws all provided powerful tools  to root out discrimination and to invest in underserved communities.   But for too long, those laws simply weren't implemented.   Administrations of both parties ignored the Fair Housing Act's  requirement that the Federal Government--this is a legal term-- affirmatively further fair housing. Minority communities, though,  remained underinvested. It took decades for all courts to say that if a  housing policy has a discriminatory effect, it is, in fact,  discriminatory. That is pretty simple. If a housing policy has a  discriminatory effect, it is, in fact, discriminatory.   The government also didn't collect enough housing data to root out  discriminatory housing that fed the subprime mortgage crisis. We know  the 2008 crisis stripped away much of the housing wealth that families  of color had fought for.   Today, access to housing and all the opportunity and stability that  comes with it remains unequal. The African-American home ownership rate  is nearly 30 percentage points below the White home ownership rate--30  percent below. Analysts have tried to explain the diversity with income  and education as factors, but it never tells the whole story. With all  else equal, similarly situated African Americans are markedly less  likely to own a home than their White counterparts.   Black and Latino renters are also more likely to pay a larger share  of their income toward housing than White renters, making it even  harder to get by, even harder to save to buy a home.   We know--and many of us have repeated many times--that one-quarter of  renters in this country pay at least half their income in rent and  utilities, meaning if one thing happens in their life--their car breaks  down, their child gets sick, or they have a minor workplace injury that  keeps them out of work 4 or 5 days--everything in their lives can turn  upside down. They can be evicted and all that happens with that. That  is the legacy of redlining and racial exclusion at work.   During the last administration, President Obama made significant  strides in enforcing civil rights laws that have been on the book for  decades. But instead of continuing that progress, President Trump has  simply choked that progress. He has turned back the clock. He has  undone the progress that so many of us fought for.   Over the past 4 years, the Trump administration has done several  affirmative--if you will--affirmative things to discriminate--not just  that it didn't get around to enforcing, but it has done things that, by  themselves, have caused damage to the progress we have made.   He appointed an OCC Director who undermined the Community  Reinvestment Act by making it less likely that banks will provide the  loans, investments, and services that these communities need.   The Trump administration cut back on housing data collection,  allowing lending discrimination to go unchecked.   The administration tried to make mortgages more expensive and harder  to get, particularly for people of color.   The administration denied opportunities for home ownership to  hundreds of thousands of young adults.   The Trump administration forced families to choose between access to  affordable housing and food and healthcare and a path to citizenship.   The administration gutted the so-called disparate impact standard  that helps root out policies that have hidden discriminatory effects.   The Trump administration dismantled the affirmatively furthering fair  housing rule, essentially telling communities around the country: Don't  even bother trying to create a better, more equal housing system, and  we will not help you if you want to   On and on and on it goes.   I invite everyone to read our report and join us to take action. We  have our work cut out for us to undo the damage President Trump has  done and to get to work to actually erase the legacy of redlining and  the legacy of Jim Crow and build a housing system that works for  everyone.   Housing is the foundation of so much in life, and when people start  behind because they can't get access to clean, accessible, fair--fair  and safe housing, they, in many cases, simply can't catch up.   We have to restore the Fair Housing Act to its full strength. This  means providing the tools to help communities create more inclusive  housing markets, to end home lending discrimination, to strengthen fair  housing oversight.   We must break down barriers to home ownership and redesign our  housing finance system so that it better serves Black and Brown  communities.   We have to protect the basic premise that LGBTQ people seeking  shelter should be treated with the same dignity and respect as every  other person. I think some of these are just so obvious, so important  in a society like ours. I will say that one again--the basic premise  that LGBTQ people seeking shelter should be treated with the same  dignity and respect as every other American.   We must provide long-overdue investments in housing and community  development in communities of color. Black families and other  communities of color have endured too many decades of our country's  housing policies failing them.   The same year we passed the Fair Housing Act, Dr. King gave a speech  we call ``The Other America.'' In that speech, here is what he said:         Our nation has constantly taken a positive step forward on       the question of racial justice and racial equality. But over       and over again at the same time, it made certain backward       steps.    The Trump administration is that backward step. Fundamentally, we all  pretty much want the same thing--a home that is safe in a community we  care about, where we can get to work and our kids have a good school,  with room for our family, whether that is three kids or an aging parent  or simply a beloved pet.   You should get to define what home looks like for you. You should be  able to find it. You should be able to afford it. You should be able to  do it without the crippling stress of ``Can I meet my rent payment or  my mortgage every month?''   For too many Black and Brown families, that has been out of reach--to  find it, to afford it, to live in it without crippling stress.   Congress cannot ignore these challenges. We can't keep allowing the  Trump administration to gut the tools we have to make people's lives  better.   If we want to make the economy work better for everyone--including  communities of color that have been systematically excluded from  opportunity--we cannot shrink from these challenges. That is the  purpose of the report we are issuing today. When work has dignity,  everyone can find and afford a place to call home.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
