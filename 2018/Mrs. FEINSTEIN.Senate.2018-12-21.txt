 Madam President, I rise today regarding  President Trump's reversal of his commitment to support a short-term  government funding bill and defer further spending negotiations until  February.   The Senate voted late Wednesday night on bipartisan legislation to  avoid a government shutdown right before Christmas. I supported that  legislation, and my position has not changed. I do not support  President Trump's wall proposal, and I do not believe the President  should shut down the government over it.   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scheduled a vote on a  straightforward, 7-week continuing resolution because the White House  committed to him that President Trump would sign it into law. The  Senate voted on that legislation with the understanding that the  President would sign it and defer any further debate over his wall  until February.   President Trump's reversal of his commitment to sign the continuing  resolution has now placed the Federal Government on the brink of a  shutdown.   Everyone knows that Trump's border wall proposal cannot get the 60  votes it needs in order to pass the Senate. That is an inescapable fact  that the President needs to finally accept.   I cannot support the version of the short-term continuing resolution  that the House passed last night. The $5.7 billion in wall funding  added by House Republicans is accompanied by no meaningful  justification from the White House. Earlier this year, President Trump  requested $1.6 billion in wall funding. That was the amount requested  in the President's official budget submitted to Congress. That was the  amount that would be provided under the spending bill approved by the  Senate Appropriations Committee. Now, however, the President says he  needs $5 billion.   The House version of the short-term continuing resolution also  contains almost $8 billion in disaster funding that would help victims  of this year's devastating wildfires, which I would support. However,  this disaster funding is not necessary now as when Federal disaster  assistance accounts retain sufficient balances for the purposes of  immediate recovery needs.   Unfortunately, due to the timing of the vote and difficulties  incurred in returning to Washington, DC, I was unable to cast my vote  in person. This statement in the Congressional Record is intended to  make clear that, if present, I would have voted no.   Thank you.                            ____________________
