 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Lieutenant  Colonel Asa Herring, an American patriot and hero who served with the  famed Tuskegee Airmen before going on to complete a 22-year military  career in the U.S. Air Force.   Lieutenant Colonel Herring was born on October 3, 1926, in Dunn, NC.  Despite being born during a time in American history when rights and  opportunities for African-Americans were few, he persevered. At a time  when high school graduation rates amongst African-Americans were in the  single digits, Lieutenant Colonel Herring graduated at age 16 and then  had to wait nearly 2 years before he could enter the military. After  passing the Army Air Corps written examination, he entered Active Duty  as an aviation cadet on December 27, 1944.   However, World War II ended before he finished his training. On April  26, 1945, the Tuskegee Airmen flew their last combat mission, and less  than 2 weeks later, on May 8, 1945, Germany surrendered. Lieutenant  Colonel Herring did not wish to serve in a segregated military, so he  decided to request an honorable discharge in 1946.   On July 26, 1948, President Truman issued Executive Order No. 9981,  ending the policy of racial segregation in the military. Less than a  year later, Lieutenant Colonel Herring volunteered for service in the  newly established U.S. Air Force and served until 1970. Throughout his  service, Lieutenant Colonel Herring fought in both the Korean and  Vietnam war, flew more than 350 combat missions, and was awarded the  Distinguished Flying Cross, a Bronze Star, and an Air Medal with 13  oakleaf clusters. He was also the first African-American squadron  commander at Luke Air Force Base, where he trained pilots from several  European countries in the F-104G Jet Fighter Gunnery Program.   After retiring from military service, Lieutenant Colonel Herring  joined Western Electric in Phoenix, AZ, where he served in several  management positions until 1989. Personifying the Air Force core  values, he also dedicated much of his time and talent to community  service organizations across Phoenix and to educating others on the  history and incredible legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen.   I join Arizonans in mourning Lieutenant Colonel Herring's passing on  May 22, 2022, at the age of 95. He was preceded in death by his wife of  61 years, Honor Herring, and is survived by his two sons, Asa D.  Herring, III, and Mark Alan Herring; his seven grandchildren; and his  15 great-grandchildren--to whom we extend our gratitude for Lieutenant  Colonel Herring's honorable service to his community and to his  Nation.                            ____________________
