 Mr. Chair, ever since the minutemen  gathered in Lexington, America's Armed Forces have been guardians of  freedom.  [[Page H3522]]    Generations of heroes have signed up for a singular cause: preserving  liberty for all. Regardless of party or politics, the House has come  together every year to put our national security and our military  families first--until now.   This year, the MAGA majority is using our national defense bill to  get one step closer to the only thing they really care about, a  nationwide abortion ban.   Mr. Chair, Americans are already paying the price for Republicans'  extremism; Americans like Amanda Zarowski who rushed to the hospital  last year after suffering a miscarriage.   Amanda needed an abortion procedure to prevent a deadly infection,  but her doctor sent her home, banned under Texas law from providing the  care she needed.   So she waited, mourning her daughter that she had lost, until she  went into septic shock, ended up in the ICU for 3 days, and almost lost  her life.   Now MAGA Republicans are aiming the same dangerous extremism at our  troops. They want the same control over the health, body, and lives of  America's servicemembers and their families.   That is not freedom. That is not patriotism. That is not national  security. That is tyranny.
