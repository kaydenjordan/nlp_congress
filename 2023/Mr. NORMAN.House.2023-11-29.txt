 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  work of the Norman Hege family in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and their  72 years of outstanding service to generations of Rock Hill residents.   April 15, 2023, marks 72 years since Norman Hege Jewelers opened its  doors in Rock Hill. Norman Hege Jewelers is the definition of a  successful family-run business built on a commitment to quality service  and a dedication to their community.   The watch repair business started with Norman Hege. As it grew, his  wife, Kathleen, began taking a more active role. Soon after, their  children, Steve, Mike, and Linda, were old enough to work at the store.  Linda and Mike now co-own the very store that their father started and  successfully run it with values that were held so closely by their  parents--to offer quality products, treat customers with respect, and  earn trust by being open and honest. Now, Norman Hege Jewelers has  employed four generations of the Hege family.   I also recognize the impact of the Hege family well beyond the  customers who walk through their doors. The Heges have supported Rock  Hill and York County throughout their 72 years in business. Norman Hege  Jewelers donates homecoming crowns for local high schools, donates to a  wide variety of causes in the Rock Hill area, and has built meaningful  relationships with the entire community.   Businesses like Norman Hege exemplify what makes the United States  the greatest nation in the world. The Hege family continues to be  devoted to their business and is looking forward to passing it down the  family line.   On behalf of the Fifth District of South Carolina, it is my most  sincere pleasure to recognize Norman Hege Jewelers and the Hege family  for this great service to our State. Please join me in recognizing this  great family for its outstanding service in the jewelry industry and  the legacy that they have built.   They exemplify the words of the late great Winston Churchill when he  said: There will be a time when doing your best isn't good enough; you  have to do what is required. The Norman Hege family has done what is  required to earn the respect and admiration of people throughout the  State of South Carolina.                            ____________________
