 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding Missourian, Dr. Thomas Davis. Dr. Davis is an internal  medicine physician with the Veterans' Affairs Community-Based  Outpatient Clinic in Marshfield, MO.   Recently, Dr. Davis announced he would be retiring at the end of the  year, closing out a distinguished medical career that spans 46 years.  The last 20 of those years have been spent caring for our Nation's  heroes at the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For the last 10 years,  Dr. Davis has been at the Marshfield clinic, which is one of eight  outpatient veterans clinics connected to the Harry S. Truman Memorial  Veterans Hospital in Columbia, MO. Dr. Davis serves approximately 800  veterans in Marshfield and the surrounding area.   Dr. Davis graduated from the St. Louis University School of Medicine  in 1977 and completed his residency in internal medicine at Mercy  Hospital in St. Louis in 1980. He has been a board-certified physician  in the State of Missouri for 46 years. In his retirement, Dr. Davis  looks forward to spending time with his wife, two daughters, and three  grandchildren.   I applaud Dr. Davis for his 46 years of commitment, dedication, and  selfless service to medicine and caring for his patients, especially  American heroes he has cared for over the years. I ask my Senate  colleagues to join me in honoring his impressive career and wish him  the best in his well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
