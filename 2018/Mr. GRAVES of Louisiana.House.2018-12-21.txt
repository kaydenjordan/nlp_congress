 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had  I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 488.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I just want to quickly say that  I also regret that we are in a situation where we have to once again do  a temporary extension, but it is important that we do not let this  program lapse.   Whether it is Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane  Harvey, Irma, Maria, or many other disasters we have had, Mr. Speaker,  we have flood victims that are trying to rebuild their homes, that are  trying to get their lives back in order, and to not have a flood  insurance program that gives them the confidence and security that they  can reinvest back in their homes and businesses is a dangerous thing  for us to do, especially right now during this Christmas season.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to say, at a 50,000-foot level, we have been  myopically focused on flood insurance and only flood insurance policy.   Thinking about the fiscal irresponsibility of continuing to allow  this program to run the debt that it has, while completely ignoring the  fact, Mr. Speaker, that we have spent $1.5 trillion on 220 disasters  since 1980, ignoring the fact that thousands and thousands of lives  have been lost as a result of our lack of bringing an offense to the  table and actually bringing resilient projects to the table, and just  focusing solely on flood insurance, which is a reactive policy, it is  fiscally irresponsible.   We need to bring an offense and a defense to the table. This program  needs fundamental reform, but we cannot do it just by cutting checks to  people every time there is a disaster. We have got to bring the  resiliency measures to the table as part of a package deal here.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption.
