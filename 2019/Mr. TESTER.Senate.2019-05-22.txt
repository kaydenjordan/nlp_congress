 Mr. President, today I wish to honor an American hero who  served bravely in the European Campaign of the Second World War.   Lawrence E. Henning of Great Falls, MT, served in the Third Army  under the command of General George S. Patton. He marched with  thousands of Allied troops across the Continent, through France,  Luxembourg, Belgium, and finally into Germany, deploying his expertise  of the tank destroyer in the final, decisive year of the war.   Lawrence's courage and ingenuity were critical to the effort. His  resourcefulness allowed the battalion to maintain a maximum number of  tank destroyers on the front line. His skills and bravery on the  battlefield earned him commendations decades ago; it is my honor to  finally deliver them today.   I am proud to present you, Lawrence, with the Bronze Star Medal for  your Meritorious Service in connection with military operations against  an enemy of the United States in France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and  Germany during the period 15 September 1944 to 30 March 1945.   I am also presenting you with: the American Defense Service Medal,  the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with 3 Bronze  Service Stars; the World War II Victory Medal; and the Honorable  Service Lapel Button--World War II.   These medals are a small token of our nation's appreciation for your  service and your sacrifice.
