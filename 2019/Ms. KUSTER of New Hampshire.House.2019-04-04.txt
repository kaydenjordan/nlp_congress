 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate  and thank my chief of staff, Abby Curran Horrell.   Abby is an original member of Team Kuster, dating back to the 2012  campaign in the 113th Congress when I was first elected. She has been  my tireless coach and confidant throughout my 6-plus years in Congress.  Through it all, she has become a very dear friend.   I rise to thank Abby for her dedicated service to our team and for  her service to everyone in New Hampshire's Second Congressional  District.   Abby embodies our Team Kuster motto, ``Radical Hospitality,''  cultivating a culture of respect and inclusion. Because of her  leadership, our staff feel empowered to succeed and grow as they take  on new challenges. Through her respect for each member of our staff,  Abby has created a collaborative culture, connecting our Washington and  New Hampshire offices into a cohesive Team Kuster family.   As Abby grew the Team Kuster family, we all enjoyed watching her grow  her own, juggling two maternity leaves as she and Chad welcomed Daniel  and Eliza, and all of this while balancing the fast-paced environment  of Congress.   Abby, we are all amazed by you. We are proud to know you, and we know  you will do amazing things for America. You will be missed.                            ____________________
