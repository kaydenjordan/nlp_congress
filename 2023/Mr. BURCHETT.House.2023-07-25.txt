 Mr. Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart to honor the  life of former Knox County Commission Chair Thomas ``Tank'' Strickland  who passed away on July 18 at 70 years old.   Tank grew up in east Tennessee and attended Austin-East High School.  He graduated from the University of Tennessee before becoming the first  Black chair of the Knox County Commission. He dedicated his life to  making Knoxville a much better place.   When he announced his retirement, he said he hoped he left every  single situation, organization, and person in a better condition than  when he started.   Mr. Speaker, that was a great understatement.   Even after retiring in 2016, Tank continued to serve the east  Knoxville community and the entire community as a whole. Just a week  before he passed away, he asked me to honor some other east  Tennesseans, Leo and Judy Whiteside, here on the House floor for their  service to the community. He handwrote his notes about them and sent  them to our office. This is truly a testament to how much he loved our  community and the folks around him.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful not just for his service to Knoxville but  also that I could call him a dear friend. When my daddy had his stroke,  Tank would check on my mama every day in the hospital. My mama would  always say: ``That handsome young man came by.''   I guess he had a way with the ladies, and my mama loved him.   Tank was a dear friend to my parents and my girls. He left behind a  great legacy and made our community a better place. He leaves his  lovely wife, Terry, and a bunch of Omega Psi Phi brothers.   I know he is in Heaven with Jesus, Mr. Speaker, but in a selfish way  I will miss him for the rest of my life.                            ____________________
