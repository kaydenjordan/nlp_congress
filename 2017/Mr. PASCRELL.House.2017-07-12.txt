 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the bipartisan  amendment I introduced with Congressman Tom Rooney from Florida. The  amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress  within 180 days on the implementation of recommendations from a recent  Government Accountability Office (GAO) report entitled ``Actions Needed  to Ensure Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury Are  Considered in Misconduct Separations,'' which was released in May 2017.  GAO found that some of the service branch policies related to the  consideration of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD) in ``other than honorable'' discharges were  inconsistent with Department of Defense policy. To remedy these  inconsistencies, DOD issued five recommendations.   As the co-chair and co-founder of the Congressional Brain Injury Task  Force, I have worked to address the effects brain injuries have on both  the military and civilian populations. TBI and PTSD have been  recognized as the signature injuries of the Wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan. Estimates from the RAND Corporation in 2008 estimated that  nearly 20 percent--or 320,000--of the 1.6 million men and women  deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan sustained a brain injury while in the  line of duty. Additionally, between 11-20 percent of Operations Iraqi  Freedom and Enduring Freedom have PTSD in a given year, according to  the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA).   Given the impact that TBI and PTSD have on an individual's behavior  and decision-making skills, it is imperative that these conditions are  accurately diagnosed in a timely manner. It is also important that  these conditions receive appropriate consideration when a servicemember  is discharged for misconduct. According to the GAO's report, in the  case of 16 percent of the separations for misconduct that the GAO  examined, the servicemembers suffered from PTSD or TBI. Additionally,  the GAO found that two of the four branches of the military have  policies inconsistent with DOD's policy on the impact of TBI and PTSD  on separations for misconduct. It is troubling that the Army and Marine  Corps may not have adhered to their own screening, training, and  counseling policies related to PTSD and TBI. That is why it is  imperative that DOD's policies are implemented consistently across all  of the military services and that there is adequate oversight of  adherence.   When an individual receives an ``other than honorable'' discharge, he  or she may not be eligible for health benefits through the VA. A lack  of health coverage is problematic for anyone, but especially so for  individuals suffering from TBI or PTSD. DOD policy requires that  servicemembers requesting separation in lieu of trial by court-martial  be counseled on the negative consequences of this type of separation.  However, of the 48 separation packets the GAO examined, 11 had unclear  or undocumented evidence that counseling took place. If servicemembers  are agreeing to less than honorable discharges, they need to understand  the consequences of that decision.   After the release of this report, I sent a letter to DOD Secretary  James Mattis urging him to give due consideration to the  recommendations made by the GAO. We must ensure the department provides  accurate and timely diagnosis of PTSD and TBI in determining separation  for misconduct, consistent policies across all branches of the military  with accountability, and adequate counseling for servicemembers about  the consequences of separation for misconduct, including the loss of  health benefits.   This amendment is supported by the Brain Injury Association of  America, the National Association of State Head Injury Administrators,  and the U.S. Brain Injury Alliance   The Acting CHAIR.
