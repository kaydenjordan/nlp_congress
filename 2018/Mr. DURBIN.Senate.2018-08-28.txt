 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this is a sad time for the Senate and  our Nation. With the passing of John McCain, our country lost a legend,  and this Senate has lost a towering figure. I have lost a friend.  America owes John McCain and his family our gratitude and respect for  his courage and sacrifice and for the trials he endured to serve the  Nation he loved.   John McCain entered this world with big shoes to fill. His father and  grandfather were four-star admirals in the U.S. Navy. John McCain met  and exceeded his family legacy.   I first met him 35 years ago, in 1982. We were brand-new freshmen  Congressmen elected to the U.S. House. I spotted him on the other side  of the floor in the Senate and, of course, I knew instantly who he was  and worked up the courage to go over and introduce myself. Then, I  asked him a favor.    I said: John, would you consider doing a cable TV show that I could  send back to my Central Illinois district?   He said: Sure, I would be glad to.   I thought: That is amazing--a Democratic Congressman asking a new  Republican Congressman to help him back in his district, and John  McCain said yes.   It was the beginning of a friendship. That cable show wasn't shown  beyond Central Illinois, but I still remember it and still thank John  for his act of kindness. It was my first exposure to a unique style of  communication that America would come to know as the ``Straight Talk  Express.'' Sitting for that interview is a typically generous John  McCain act, for which I am still grateful.   There is an old joke about an Irishman who walked past a brawl and  said: Is this a private fight or can anyone get into it?   I think that man's name may have been McCain. Everyone who knew or  served with John for any period of time got crosswise with him. I can  remember there, in the well of the Senate, John McCain walking up to  me, getting within an inch of my face and chewing me out about some  article that he had read in the Chicago Tribune. He was so mad he was  about to explode, and he wheeled around and walked away.   I thought: What did I say? I can't even remember the article.   I raced back to look up the Chicago Tribune article he referred to  and still couldn't understand his anger, and I thought: How am I going  to make amends with John. He has been my friend for so long.   The next day he came up to me, and I got ready for the second round.  He put his arm around me and said: It wasn't that bad after all. We are  still friends.   That was typical John McCain--a volcanic temper but an embracing,  loving approach when it came to friendship. That was John. He was  passionate in his beliefs, but he was not a man to hold grudges. He  understood that two people can disagree on issues today, and still both  love this country and work together tomorrow.   Occasionally, he would invite you on a trip. Be careful. I said yes  several times. A John McCain trip over a weekend was something you  don't soon forget. If there is anybody out there who thinks that  Senators with John McCain were sitting poolside drinking these mixed  drinks with paper umbrellas, they have it all wrong. John McCain's  trips on the weekend were more like Bataan death marches. From the  minute you got on that plane until you got back to Washington, it was a  nonstop schedule. Everything had to be done. We had to see three  countries, not two, and we had to get it done and get back to  Washington. You learned so much.   I went to Ukraine with John. I remember walking the streets of Kiev  in Ukraine. People were coming up to John--people who remembered that  he showed up in the Maidan Square when the revolution was underway and  spoke for those who were defying Moscow--and they still remembered John  McCain and couldn't wait to come up and say hello and thank him. It was  that way in so many places of the world. I was lucky to be there. I was  lucky to be a part of it, lucky to see history unfold, and lucky to  count John as a friend.   John and I had our disagreements. In fact, there was one solid year  when we barely spoke. At the end of that year, I found an excuse to  walk over to his office to see him on some issue. I remember that he  stood up and greeted me. He shook my hand. He looked me in the eye and  said: I am glad this is over between us.   So was I. It was one of the happier days I served in the Senate.   His ability to see beyond party labels was one of the qualities that  so many of us loved and admired about him. It was a lesson he learned  from his family. It is a truth, I imagine, that he came to see even  more clearly during the 5\1/2\ torturous years--two of them in solitary  confinement--that he spent as a prisoner of war in that hellish place  known as the Hanoi Hilton.   We are stronger together than we are divided. John McCain knew that.  His entire life was a testimony to that powerful truth. It is why, as a  prisoner of war, John McCain refused offers of release. He knew what  the rules were. The rules were ``first in, first out.'' He was not the  first in. He just happened  [[Page S5963]]  to be the son of an admiral, and the North Vietnamese were going to  make him a symbol and release him. He wouldn't do it. He wouldn't  accept it. His body was broken by the torture and the plane crash, but  he stayed in that cell and waited his turn, until the moment came when  he could leave with his head up.   John didn't want to be defined as a professional prisoner of war. I  love the story about a party that was given for John and his fellow  captives after they got home. One young man was telling the story of  his confinement in some detail when he happened to look over and see  John McCain. He suddenly felt conspicuous and said to John: I shouldn't  be going on about my time as a prisoner of war. I was there for 6  weeks, and you were there for 5\1/2\ years.   With typical John McCain humor and wit, John replied: Oh, no, go  right ahead. The first 6 weeks were the toughest.   Like Abraham Lincoln, John McCain knew that laughter helped to make  the unbearable bearable, and like President Lincoln, he was secure  enough in his own reputation and in his own achievements to be modest.   John endured the hell of the Hanoi Hilton more than many. He served  in the Senate longer than many. He leaves his mark on this body and our  Nation.   When the issue of torture and detention was front and center before  the American people, when we were trying to decide what were the  boundaries for this democracy, faced with the threat of terrorism,  there was one voice in the Senate who was credible. It was John McCain.   I made speech after speech on the subject, but when John McCain got  up and spoke about the issue of torture, there was silence on the floor  of the Senate as we listened carefully. He proposed a resolution  establishing humane standards of treatment, realizing the humanity we  showed toward our prisoners is the same humanity we expected if  Americans were taken prisoner. His effort was enacted by the Senate  with over 90 votes, a strong bipartisan rollcall.   John McCain, more than anything, was a champion of the U.S.  military--the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. They never  had a better friend. Our Nation's veterans and their families never had  a stronger ally. He was a leader in the fight to curb the influence of  special interests in politics and to make our government truly a  government of, by, and for the people.   Russ Feingold and John McCain moved us toward what America is longing  for--putting the special interests behind us, putting the people first,  ending soft money.   He treasured our heritage as a nation of immigrants. I have such  profound respect for John McCain's efforts to reach across the aisle  and try to find solutions for America's broken immigration system. Even  as his own party railed against him, we spent almost a year together-- eight Senators, four Democrats and four Republicans, led by John  McCain--to write a comprehensive immigration reform bill. It was one of  my proudest moments in the Senate. It was why I ran for the Senate. It  was what John McCain told us over and over was to be our mission in  life as Senators: To solve the problems facing America and not to be  worried about taking some heat.   He took a lot of heat as a Republican who stepped up and offered a  real solution to our comprehensive immigration challenge. We put  together a bill over the course of a year. I think it was an  extraordinary effort. We all had to compromise. John compromised and I  compromised, but we ended up with a bipartisan bill that passed  overwhelmingly on the floor of the Senate.   There hasn't been another moment like that in the time I have been  here, and John led the way. He took a lot of grief for it. His poll  numbers were not that good, particularly among the most conservative  Republicans, but John knew we had a problem to solve, and he stepped  out and did it. I was honored to be a part of the small group that  worked night after night, week after week to put that effort together.   Of course, what I remember now more than anything is that middle-of- the-night vote a little over a year ago. He walked through that door,  just having spoken on the telephone with President Trump, and he came  to the well of the Senate and stood right next to that table. Because  he had limited motion in his arm because of that plane crash and  torture in Vietnam, he barely lifted his right arm and pushed his thumb  down and said no. With that ``no'' vote, he preserved health insurance  for millions of Americans, and he invoked the ire of conservative  Republicans, who will never forgive him for that moment. It was one of  the proudest, most courageous votes and moments in the history of the  Senate. I was honored to be here and had a chance to thank him  personally that night.   I also remember when he came to the floor and spoke at that desk,  which is now bearing the vase of roses, a tribute to John McCain, and  reminded all of us why we run for this office. Sure, it is a great  title and a lot of Americans never get close to a title like U.S.  Senator, but to John McCain and to many of us, it is much more. It is  not only a great honor. It is a great challenge for us to do something  with this title to solve the problems that face this country.   I didn't always agree with John, but I always respected the fact that  he wanted the Senate to be an institution that was serving the people  in this country and solving the problems we face.   John was principled and courageous time and again. There were times  when we had our differences. I can recall when he came to Illinois to  campaign against me. He was campaigning on behalf of a State  Representative in Illinois named Jim Durkin--not Durbin, but Durkin-- who had been John's supporter for President in the State of Illinois.  John returned the favor by campaigning for Jim Durkin against me. You  might wonder, in this world of politics, how you react to a person who  is trying to take your job away, which John was doing. I understood it.  I expected it. Jim Durkin was loyal to John McCain, and John McCain was  loyal to him and came in and campaigned for him.   After the election was over, the people of Illinois decided I should  be the Senator. It didn't deter John McCain one bit from working with  me from that point forward.   There is an empty space in this Chamber without John McCain. There is  an empty space in America without his spirit. He will be missed, but he  certainly will never be forgotten. I endorse the proposal to rename the  Russell Senate Office Building in honor of Lieutenant Commander and  Senator John McCain. Like Senator Schumer, I hope that decades from  now, children who are visitors to the Capitol grounds will ask: Who was  this McCain they named the building after? They will discover he was a  man worthy of our respect, a man who in his heart was a public servant,  a man who was an American hero.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) is  necessarily absent.
