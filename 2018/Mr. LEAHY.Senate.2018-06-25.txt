 Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator  from Tennessee and the Senator from Hawaii. I have enjoyed working with  both of them because look where we are. This is somewhere we have not  been for a number of years. It is where we used to be--certainly for  the first few decades I was here. It is where we were when Senator  Alexander or my hero, Senator Baker, were here.   What we are doing is voting on final passage of the first package of  Senate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019. The minibus before us  contains a string of appropriations bills: the Energy and Water  appropriations bill, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  appropriations bill, and the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. We  will have these votes in a matter of half an hour, and they will only  take a few minutes, but there are hours and hours and days and weeks  that went into this by both Republicans and Democrats.   Chairman Shelby and I worked very closely with Senator McConnell and  Senator Schumer. Both Senator Shelby as chairman and I as vice chairman  committed to getting the appropriations process back on track. We both  have been here when the Senate has been in a better place because the  appropriations process worked. Our strategy has been to advance  appropriations bills that have bipartisan support, comply with the  budget deal and are free of poison pill riders or controversial  authorizing legislation. What we have before us is the first test of  that strategy. I think both Republicans and Democrats should be pretty  pleased with the result.   We had a good debate on this package of bills, including the last  eight rollcall votes. We adopted a managers' package that contained 32  amendments on which we have reached agreement. This minibus is the  result of hard work and compromise on the part of the chair and ranking  member of each subcommittee, and I urge Senators to vote aye on final  passage.   Importantly, during the debate on this package of bills, as just  mentioned, the Senate voted to table a controversial amendment offered  by Senator Lee to overturn the 2015 clean water rule related to waters  of the United States. This rule was designed to prevent pollutants from  spreading through tributaries into our Nation's drinking water supply.  I felt that the amendment not only would have driven a stake through  the heart of the clean water rule, it would have done so without having  to abide by the Administrative Procedure Act, it would have effectively  eliminated the American public from any participation in the process,  and it would have sidestepped and allowed arbitrary and capricious  standards, which we cannot have, if we had repealed the rule.   I opposed this amendment not only because I believe that repealing  the clean water rule would be shortsighted, and that doing it in this  manner would set a terrible precedent for the next bedrock  environmental regulation, but also because this is precisely the type  of poison pill policy rider both Republicans and Democrats have worked  so hard to avoid.   The adoption of the Lee amendment would have endangered our ability  to complete our work on the minibus. We tabled the amendment, and we  had votes from both sides of the aisle, including from Senators who  agreed with the substance of the Lee amendment, but they recognized  this reality as well--that adopting it would stop the whole bill. That  is how the process should work. By focusing on funding matters, by  avoiding controversial policy riders, we have ended the Senate debate  with a bipartisan product that both Democrats and Republicans can  support.   I went on at some length on this because I am concerned that the  House is pursuing a different path. They are taking up partisan bills  and filling them with poison pill riders that cannot and will not pass  the U.S. Senate, and they know that, including a rider similar to the  defeated Lee amendment. Democrats proceeded to this package of bills in  good faith, and we will go into conference negotiations with that same  approach, but if our progress is to continue, we cannot sign conference  reports on bills that can't pass the Senate. They must be bills that  can pass the Senate, bills that both Republicans and Democrats can vote  for, and that means they have to be free of poison pills from the right  or the left.   This minibus provides significant resources for the support and care  of our Nation's veterans and their family  [[Page S4362]]  members, and it makes critical investments in our country's water  infrastructure and energy programs. It should not be used as a vehicle  to advance a partisan political agenda.   Before concluding my remarks, there is one issue we were not able to  address in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill that  must be addressed in conference. The bill still does not provide enough  money to cover the costs associated with the VA Choice Program, which  was transferred to the discretionary side of the budget under the  MISSION Act. The MISSION Act only provided funding for this program  through May of 2019, leaving the balance unaddressed. To cover the  shortfall, we are going to need an estimated $1.6 billion more in  fiscal year 2019 and an additional $8.6 billion in fiscal year 2020 and  $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2021 to cover the Veterans Affairs Choice  Program. These costs were not accounted for when we negotiated the  budget caps in the bipartisan budget deal, so the chairman and the  ranking member of the subcommittee were unable to address the shortfall  within their allocation without cutting funding for other important  programs.    Senator Shelby and I filed an amendment--the Complete the MISSION  amendment--which would have provided the flexibility needed to make  sure we fulfill this commitment to our veterans without triggering  sequestration or without having to cut other valuable veterans  programs.   I would note that on June 19, we received a letter from 33 veterans  service organizations representing millions of veterans,  servicemembers, and their families in support of the amendment Chairman  Shelby and I filed. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed  in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   Unfortunately, we were not able to reach agreement to get a vote on  our amendment or have it included in the managers' package, but  Chairman Shelby and I remain committed to solving this problem in  conference. If we don't do so, we will jeopardize the healthcare and  well-being of the men and women who have faithfully served our country,  who relied on the promises made by our country when they served our  country, and I am not willing to accept going back on our country's  promise.   I thank Chairman Shelby, and I thank the Republican chairs and the  Democratic ranking members of each subcommittee for their hard work. As  the longest serving Member of this body, I think we provided a roadmap  to consider the rest of the appropriations bills, going back to doing  it the way we have done it under both Republican and Democratic  leadership and where the country is better off.   I also want to thank Shannon H. Hines, Jonathan Graffeo, David  Adkins, Tyler Owens, Jen Armstrong, Adam DeMella, Meyer Seligman,  Rachel Littleton, Molly Marsh, Sarah Boliek, Lucas Agnew, Patrick  Magnuson, Jennifer Bastin, Joanne Hoff, and Carlos Elias of the  majority staff and Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Doug Clapp, Chris  Hanson, Samantha Nelson, Melissa Zimmerman, Jean Kwon, Chad Schulken,  Jason McMahon, Jessica Berry, and Jordan Stone on the minority staff  for their work on these bills.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      June 19, 2018.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Johnny Isakson,      Chairman, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Ranking Member, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Chairman Isakson and       Ranking Member Tester: On behalf of the millions of veterans,       service members and family members we represent and advocate       for, we want to first thank you for passage of the VA MISSION       Act (P.L. 115-182), historic legislation that will       consolidate and reform VA's community care programs;       strengthen VA's ability to recruit, hire and retain medical       personnel; review, realign and modernize VA's health care       infrastructure; and extend eligibility to VA's comprehensive       caregiver assistance program to veterans severely injured       before September 11, 2001. With the law set to begin taking       effect next year, it is imperative that Congress now ensure       that VA has the resources necessary to fully and faithfully       implement the many critical provisions of this legislation.        For that reason, we urge you and all Senators to support       and vote for Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy's new       ``Complete the Mission'' amendment, which would allow       Congress to provide VA with sufficient resources required to       implement the provisions of the VA MISSION Act, without       triggering sequestration or requiring cuts to other VA       programs.        As you know, the VA MISSION Act would effectively move       funding responsibility for care currently provided through       the Veterans Choice Program from mandatory appropriations to       a new discretionary program that must fit within overall       domestic discretionary caps. However, the current domestic       discretionary budget cap for FY 2019, and the anticipated       caps for FY 2020 and FY 2021, did not contemplate the new and       increased costs associated with the VA MISSION Act. As such,       Congress may not have the ability to fully fund all of the       programs, benefits and services that our veterans, their       families and survivors have earned.        It is imperative that VA not be forced to choose between       fully funding its hospitals and clinics for veterans seeking       care inside the VA health care system, or fully funding       community care for veterans who would otherwise be forced to       wait too long or travel too far to access VA care. We do not       want to return to a time when veterans were forced onto       waiting lists to get the care they have earned through their       service and sacrifice.        The new Shelby-Leahy ``Complete the Mission'' amendment       would allow Congress to appropriate additional discretionary       funding to meet the new requirements of the VA MISSION Act       without triggering sequestration. However, unlike a prior       amendment that had been discussed, this amendment would limit       the amount of such funding to just $1.6 billion for FY 2018,       $8.67 billion for FY 2019 and $9.5 billion for FY 2020.        We are very concerned that without assurance of sufficient       funding, reform and modernization of the VA health care       system--which millions of ill and injured veterans rely on--      could be delayed or endangered. Further, tens of thousands of       caregivers for severely injured veterans might have to       continue waiting before they can receive the benefits they       deserve. For these reasons, it is absolutely critical that       the Shelby-Leahy ``Complete the Mission'' amendment to the       MilCon-VA Appropriations bill be adopted by the Senate,       approved by the House, and enacted into law.        As leaders of the nation's veterans and military service       organizations, we again want to thank you for approving the       VA MISSION Act in order to fulfill the promises our nation       owes to the men and women who served. We now call on you to       ensure that VA has sufficient funding to implement this       legislation by supporting and voting for the Shelby-Leahy       ``Complete the Mission'' amendment to the MilCon-VA       Appropriations bill. Millions of injured and ill veterans and       their family caregivers are counting on your support.            Respectfully,        Garry J.

I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time equally divided.    Mr. President, it is with a mixture of pride and sadness  that I recognize the life of a friend, Francis ``Fran'' Voigt, the  cofounder of the New England Culinary Institute of Montpelier, VT. Fran  passed away in May, leaving a strong legacy and many family and  friends.   Fran Voigt was an innovator, who originally came to Vermont to teach  at Goddard College. In 1969, he came to Vermont with his wife, poet  Ellen Bryant Voigt, who would later serve as Vermont's poet laureate.  He was part of a faculty and staff at Goddard that changed the culture  of central Vermont. While at Goddard, Fran developed programs in many  fields, including social ecology and art therapy. Fran believed in  hands-on education, both at Goddard and later at the New England  Culinary Institute, known locally as NECI, which he cofounded in 1980.   The New England Culinary Institute, which began in the basement of  Montpelier's Capitol Plaza Hotel and Conference Center, grew quickly  and garnered national attention. Fran and NECI were soon at the  forefront of our  [[Page S4365]]  country's progressive culinary education movement and were recognized  by President Bill Clinton as first runner-up for the Nation's small  business of the year in 1994. In 2000, Fran was named Vermont Citizen  of the Year by the Vermont Chamber of Commerce.   Vermont's culinary landscape was forever changed by the New England  Culinary Institute, as its students opened and worked at restaurants  throughout the State.   In memory of Fran Voigt, I ask unanimous consent that the article by  Stephen Mills in the May 22 edition of the Barre Montpelier Times  Argus, ``NECI founder revered for student model,'' be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           [From the Barre Montpelier Times Argus, May 22, 2018]                   NECI Founder Revered for Student Model                             (By Stephen Mills)         Montpelier.--The Capital City reacted to news of the death       of Fran Voigt, co-founder of the New England Culinary       Institute, who died at his Cabot home Monday. He was 78.        Voigt and co-founder John Dranow, and their wives, Ellen       Bryant Voigt and Louise Gluck, respectively met at Goddard       College and started the legendary cooking school with seven       students in the basement of the Capitol Plaza Hotel &       Conference Center on State Street in 1980.        At the height of its success, the business was honored in       1994 by former President Bill Clinton as first runner-up for       the nation's small business of the year. It boasted a high of       800 students, and a number of academic offerings and outlets       that still include the flagship NECI on Main restaurant and       La Brioche bakery and cafe, and food service at National Life       and the cafeteria at Vermont College of Fine Arts, all in       Montpelier. Other operations, included a second campus in       Essex and NECI Commons, a restaurant on Church Street in       Burlington, which were discontinued. More recent contracts       included a $200,000 contract to train cooks for the U.S.       Coast Guard and a three-year contract to design and deliver a       training program for culinary staff at Sandals resorts in the       Caribbean. But NECI also was at the center of a protracted       legal dispute in 1999 that landed in the Vermont Supreme       Court after Voigt and the wives had a falling out with Dranow       who was ousted, and sued but finally settled. NECI is now run       by Milan Milasinovic, who is also president of Virginia Marti       College of Art and Design in Ohio and merged the two schools       last June after Voigt stepped down as president in January       2017. It has about 200 students. Voigt's daughter, Dudley,       said there would be no public service, but the family hoped       to hold a memorial service later.        ``We would just say that he died at home after a long       illness,'' she said.        ``We feel that we're very proud of NECI,'' Dudley Voigt       said. ``We watched him build it, and it was a unique       coalescing of all of his talents and gifts and curiosities.''        According to an obituary provided by the family to be       published in The Times Argus, Francis George Wilheim Voigt       was born in in Oskaloosa, Iowa, March 27, 1940, after his       parents emigrated from Germany. He graduated from Wesleyan       University in 1962 and earned a graduate degree in political       theory from the University of Iowa where he met his wife,       Ellen Bryant Voigt. The couple came to central Vermont as       educational idealists in 1969. Fran Voigt accepted a teaching       position at Goddard College and developed some of the skills       he used to build the hands-on education that became the model       for NECI where students started in the kitchen in the       classroom and the student-teacher ratio was 7-1. The NECI       motto was: ``Learning by doing.''        In addition to his lifelong work at NECI, Voigt was also an       active member of the Vermont Business Roundtable, Rotary       International, the Cabot School and the Vermont Chamber of       Commerce, which named him Vermont Citizen of the Year in       2000. He was also recognized in the community for his       signature bow ties and antique Citroens.        Milan Milasinovic credited Voigt with visionary leadership       and commitment to the NECI model of culinary arts and being a       mentor to all at the school.        ``He became a dear friend of mine in the last couple of       years of his life,'' he said. ``It's a huge loss. He was our       founding father and he made NECI very innovative and a force       as a culinary school in the United States. It's all because       of his entrepreneurial spirit. I'm sure the people at NECI       will miss him greatly. We loved this man a lot.''        U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy credited Voigt with being ``at the       forefront of the progressive culinary education movement       nationally,'' and said the Vermont food scene would not be       what it is today without Voigt's contribution and leadership.        ``His vision, hard work and dedication in founding and       continually reinventing NECI leaves a lasting legacy that       extends well beyond Vermont,'' Leahy said. ``He helped give       expression to Vermont's tradition of quality, taste and       excellence. Vermont's culinary landscape owes a significant       debt to his vision, and so do the communities that were       nourished, enriched and enlivened by those trained under his       leadership.''        Montpelier Mayor Anne Watson added: ``Fran Voigt made       substantial cultural contributions to Montpelier, and I'm       certainly saddened to have lost him. We send our condolences       to his family.''        The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations       be made in Voigt's name to the NECI scholarship fund or to       the Vermont Foodbank.                            ____________________
