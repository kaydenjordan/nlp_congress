 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to speak about Sleep Awareness  Week, a week to remind us all of the importance of something we all  need--a good night's sleep.   Sleep Awareness Week and World Sleep Day are internationally  recognized and bring awareness to sleep and its important impact on our  health.   The pandemic has taken a toll on all of us, including our sleep  schedules. Increased anxiety and worries have made it harder than ever  to get consistent and peaceful sleep.   Despite this fact, it is important we consider the instrumental role  sleep plays in keeping our bodies and minds healthy.   A proper comprehensive view of good health must include the  importance of rest. We all could use it.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure all American  families, including 165,000 people in our country impacted by  narcolepsy, have access to the healthcare they need.   Sleep, wellness, and health must go hand in hand.                            ____________________
