 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, I had the chance  to visit the southern border for the very first time. It was truly  educational.   I thank the people of southeast Texas who showed me the true impact  of what it means to have an open border.   President Biden and his administration officials continue to tell the  American people that the border is secure.   Tell that to the families of two Americans who were killed this week  by a Mexican cartel.   Tell that to the record number of parents who have lost kids to  fentanyl that was brought over the border.   Tell that to the countless public officials we met on that trip who  were pleading with us to say that they are just overloaded. Their  facilities are overcapacity, and they need help.   Mr. Speaker, I have been to the border, and tonight I am here to tell  you that it is not secure.   Mr. Speaker, you know that it is not just a Texas problem; it is  America's problem. We need to secure the border. Our national security  depends on it.                            ____________________
