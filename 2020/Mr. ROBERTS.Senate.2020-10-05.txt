 Mr. President, on Wednesday, October 14, 2020, we  celebrate the 130th birthday of America's 34th President and Supreme  Commander of the Allied Expeditionary  [[Page S6036]]  Force in Europe during World War II, Dwight David Eisenhower.   Without Ike, it is not a stretch to imagine that the trajectory of  American history might have been significantly altered. It was General  Eisenhower who commanded a successful D-Day invasion, which became a  pivotal turning point in the Second World War. It was President  Eisenhower who waged peace, regulated atomic power, and protected the  world against the growing spread of communism. Through it all, it was  not selfish ambition or prestige that guided him, but rather his  character and sense of duty.   He was born in Denison, TX, on October 14, 1890, as the third of  seven sons. At the age of 2, Ike's family moved to Abilene, KS, a  lively community with a famous frontier past where he developed his  interest in exploring the outdoors. Throughout his lifetime of  leadership, Ike never lost touch with his western origins. As Kansas'  favorite son, Ike nurtured the values he learned as a young boy, some  of which guided his decision-making as a leader. He placed the job and  the mission--not himself--at the center. With this heartfelt ethic, he  set the example for those around him.   From Abilene to West Point and from Normandy to Washington,  Eisenhower embodied the humility, honesty, sincerity, optimism, and  fortitude that he would call upon the country to emulate in his first  inaugural address on January 20, 1953: ``The productivity of our heads,  our hands, and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can  command, for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of  peace,'' he declared. ``Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the  world must first come to pass in the heart of America.''   As Americans, we owe a great deal to the man who led the U.S. and  Allied Forces in the liberation of Europe and expelled the evil of  Hitler's Nazism. On the domestic front, we are transformed by the fruit  of his legacy as President, including: the Interstate Highway System,  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of  Health, Education, and Welfare--now known as the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Education--and the  Federal Aviation Administration. Ike also brought Alaska and Hawaii  into the Union; eradicated segregation in our Armed Forces; and  deployed the Army's 101st Airborne to Central High School in Little  Rock, AR, ensuring that the law of educational integration was followed  by all States.   As chairman of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, I am  proud to report that construction on the national memorial of President  and General Eisenhower, located on Independence Avenue, SW, between 4th  and 6th Streets, is complete, and the memorial is open to the public.   The commission hosted a dedication ceremony at the site the evening  of September 17, 2020. Participants in the ceremony included my fellow  commissioners, including vice chairman Representative Mike Thompson of  California, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Senator Gary Peters  of Michigan, Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Representative Sanford D.  Bishop, Jr., of Georgia, Representative Michael K. Simpson of Idaho,  Representative William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry of Texas, former Senator  Robert J. ``Bob'' Dole of Kansas, Alfred Geduldig, Susan Banes Harris,  and Catherine Ann Stevens.   Again, with General Eisenhower as they were on the eve of the D-Day  invasion, soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division presented the colors.  Speakers included me, Bret Bair, Senate Chaplain Barry Black,  Representative Mike Thompson, Architect Frank Gehry, Ms. Rachel Mast of  Kansas who recited the Pledge of Allegiance, Astronaut Chris Cassidy  from the International Space Station, Secretary Condoleezza Rice, Greta  Van Susteren who introduced Senator Bob Dole, David Eisenhower, Susan  Eisenhower, and Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt. Other  Eisenhower family members present at the ceremony included Julie Nixon  Eisenhower, their son Alex and his children, Mary Jean Eisenhower's son  Merrill Eisenhower Atwater, and several members of the Gill family,  relatives of Mamie Doud Eisenhower.   Enjoyed by all were musical performances by the ``The President's  Own'' U.S. Marine Band, and Voices of Service performers Master Sgt.  Caleb Green, Staff Sgt. Ron Henry (Ret.), Sgt. Maj. Christal Rheams,  and Sgt. 1st Class Jason Hanna. Guests at the ceremony and others  joining via livestream and CSPAN were thrilled to experience a flyover  of F-16s piloted by soldiers of the 177th Fighter Wing of the New  Jersey Air National Guard. The flyover occurred precisely at the end of  the National Anthem performed by Voices of Service. Additionally, 26  members of the West Point Alumni Glee Club delighted guests with superb  renditions of several songs, including ``Grand Old Flag,'' ``World War  II Medley,'' and ``God Bless the USA.''   September's dedication ceremony was a fitting tribute to one of our  country's finest leaders. The memorial is now one of the 420 National  Memorials and Parks under the stewardship of the National Park Service.  I invite all to visit the new Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial.   I ask my fellow Senators and all citizens to join me in celebrating  America's 34th President and Supreme Commander during World War II by  wishing Ike a happy 130th birthday.                            ____________________     Mr. President; I was first elected to the House of  Representatives in 1980 and then the Senate in 1996. I have enjoyed the  privilege of becoming the longest serving member of Congress in the  history of the Sunflower State and representing Kansans in Washington,  DC, for 40 years.   It has been an amazing ride, a great partnership in government and  many people have been a tremendous help to Franki and me. We want to  say a heartfelt thank you to all the friends we have made along the  way.   My first boss in public service was a true gentleman from Concordia  named Frank Carlson. Senator Carlson was the first person to hit the  political trifecta and serve our State as Senator, Congressman, and  Governor. The always modest Senator Carlson routinely said, ``There are  no self-made men or women in public service; it is your friends, family  and staff who make you what you are.''   Through the years I have repeated Senator Carlson's words on many  occasions, and I truly believe that Members of Congress are only as  good as their staff. Well, I have been blessed because, for four  decades, I believe that I have had the best staff both in Kansas and on  Capitol Hill.   While I could offer a long list of current and former aides who have  truly made a difference for Kansas and America, there are three unique,  humble, and accomplished individuals who deserve special recognition.  Mel Thompson, Gilda Lintz, and Kay Sharp have all served quietly and  effectively behind the scenes on my Kansas staff for nearly a quarter  century.   First, there is Mel Thompson who serves as my State agriculture  representative. Actually, Mel and I first worked together on the  Washington staff of First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in the  late 1960s and early 1970s. Mel has taught me a lot about agriculture  and even more about people. Nobody is better at listening to frustrated  farmers and ranchers and few know more about the complex and often  burdensome regulations offered by USDA and EPA. This incredible  knowledge and Mel's neighborly presence led to well-deserved  recognition by the Kansas Farm Bureau who honored Mel with a  Distinguished Service to Agriculture award. Mel has been a strong  advocate for me and, in fact, a brother.   Next, there is Gilda Lintz who serves as the district director in my  Topeka office. Gilda is what we call a casework specialist, serving as  the court of last resort when communication has broken down between a  Kansan and a government agency. Gilda has invested her heart and soul  into assisting veterans to obtain service awards or unrealized  benefits. Additionally, Gilda has led my service academy nomination  board that meets each October to identify the best and brightest  Kansans capable of graduating from our Nation's military academies and  defending our Nation. I call her ``golden.'' Thank you, Gilda, for  nurturing America's heroes. You are a true ``Kansas treasure.   I also want to recognize Kay Sharp who serves as my State casework  and outreach director. Kay joined my staff after a stint with Senator  Nancy Kassebaum and has been a steady and dependable rock in the  Overland Park office since 1997. Like Mel and Gilda, Kay is the  foundation of Team Roberts. Kay leads my state casework effort and has  helped countless Kansans obtain last minute passports, crucial IRS  refund checks, and meaningful social security disability payments. More  recently, like she did after 9-11, Kay worked after hours and late into  the morning on weekends to ensure Americans were able to re-enter the  country during COVID-related travel interruptions. Most of all, Kay is  someone who I could count on for frank advice and counsel. She always  gives you the unvarnished truth, and for that, I am grateful.   Finally, I want to say a word about my longtime State director and  now chief of staff, Chad Tenpenny. Chad has been out there riding  shotgun, covering all 105 counties, with me since my early days in the  Senate. We have covered almost every inch of the State, from the  Cimarron National Grasslands in Morton County to the eastern border in  Wyandotte County. The people of Kansas know and respect Chad and depend  on him as a direct link to the Federal Government. His steady  dependable leadership in the State has been a gift to me and to all  Kansans over the years.   As a proud U.S. Marine, where I learned that I could achieve more  than I ever thought I really could, I am constantly urging my staff to  ``sprint to the finish line'' and ``take the Hill.'' Mel, Gilda, and  Kay have done a lot of sprinting and climbing through the years.  Together, we have made Kansas a better place, and for that, I am proud.   Semper Fi.                            ____________________
