 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  celebrate the career of retired lieutenant general and current  Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs commissioner Larry Shellito.  Commissioner Shellito will be retiring from the Minnesota Department of  Veterans Affairs on January 7, 2019, after leading the department for  the past 7 years. His leadership has ensured the Minnesota Department  of Veterans Affairs will continue to provide excellent care and  services for years to come.   Commissioner Shellito began his career in 1968 when he enlisted in  the U.S. Army, during which time he served in Vietnam as a mobile  advisory team leader. In 1973, he joined the Minnesota National Guard  where he served for the next 37 years. Starting as a rifle platoon  leader, Commissioner Shellito went on to serve in nearly every command  position within the Minnesota National Guard, and in 2003, he was  appointed adjutant general by Governor Tim Pawlenty. In this final  position, Commissioner Shellito diligently led the Minnesota National  Guard in responding to domestic incidents, transforming the force from  a ready reserve to an operational force through multiple deployments to  the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He made sure the needs of his  soldiers and their families were met when they returned home through  the creation and implementation of the Nation's first Yellow Ribbon  Program. Commissioner Shellito's leadership transformed the Minnesota  National Guard into one of our Nation's most respected and well-known  organizations.   While most people would retire after such an extensive career,  Commissioner Shellito stepped up to the plate when Governor Mark Dayton  asked him to serve as commissioner of the Minnesota Department of  Veterans Affairs in 2011. At the Minnesota Department of Veterans  Affairs, Commissioner Shellito has assisted Minnesota's 337,000  veterans and their dependents get the benefits and services they have  earned. His stewardship has ensured veterans can find a place to call  home, can find jobs in the public and private sectors, and have access  to the services they need to help them heal from physical and  psychological wounds.   In the past year alone, Commissioner Shellito has led the department  in obtaining funding for three new veterans homes, improving  residential satisfaction at Minneapolis veterans homes, opening a new  state-of-the-art 100-bed skilled nursing care facility in Minneapolis,  and establishing the Nation's first veterans home fixed dental care  facility. The work Commissioner Shellito has done these past 7 years  has set the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs up for success for  years to come and is a testament to Commissioner Shellito's character  and commitment to service.   On behalf of myself and all Minnesotans, I want to congratulate  Commissioner Shellito on an amazing career. Your more than 45 years of  excellent public service, on Active and civilian duty, represents the  finest Minnesota has to offer. We recognize your service, we are  grateful for it, and we thank you.                            ____________________
