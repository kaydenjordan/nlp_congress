 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to  H.R. 803.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen the renewed importance of  having safe and accessible public lands for our families and  communities. As a proud Virginian, I know that Virginia's public lands  not only provide opportunities for recreation and reflection but they  are key to our tourism industry and our overall economy.   My amendment would strengthen protections for two beautiful areas of  the George Washington National Forest, the Rough Mountain and Rich Hole  wilderness areas, following recommendations from the U.S. Forest  Service in 2014. These areas offer outstanding scenic views, rare and  endangered plants, age-old hardwood forests, and a dense population of  black bears.   This legislation, the Virginia Wilderness Additions Act, would allow  these irreplaceable areas to remain open to recreation while also  protecting their wildlife, natural resources, and trails for  generations to come.   I would like to thank Senators Kaine and Warner for their leadership  on this issue in the Senate, as well as Representatives Luria and  McEachin for working with me on this important amendment.
