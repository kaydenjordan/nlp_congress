 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 1249 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, this is an amendment that should be a  simple and bipartisan, commonsense amendment.   Under a treaty in 1944, Mexico is obliged to provide 350,000 acre- feet of water per year to the Rio Grande Valley. Farmers in the Rio  Grande Valley are facing drought right now, and Mexico has been slow in  meeting its treaty commitments. This amendment simply instructs the  water negotiators to press Mexico to meet its treaty agreements and  provide the water that is owed.   I would note that the language of this amendment was worked out in a  bipartisan manner and was cleared by both Democrats and Republicans on  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This language was also worked  out directly with the negotiators of the International Boundary and  Water Commission. It is designed not to negatively impact any other  State but to instruct States to urge Mexico to meet its treaty  commitments so that farmers who need water can get the water they need.   I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support the amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
