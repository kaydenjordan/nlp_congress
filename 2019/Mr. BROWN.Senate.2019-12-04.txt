 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Cleveland native, a  Buffalo soldier, and an Olympic legend--Harrison Dillard. Mr. Dillard  died last month at the age of 96. His life included service to our  country in World War II, four Olympic gold medals, and world records.   He grew up racing up and down the streets of our shared hometown of  Cleveland with friends. When Mr. Dillard was 13, he saw his hometown  hero, a gentleman named Jesse Owens, in a parade. He ran home and told  his mother: ``I just saw Jesse Owens, [Mom], and I'm going to be just  like him.''   She humored her son. Think about how many people say that to mothers  in Cleveland and other places. She humored her son like all mothers do,  but Harrison Dillard was serious. He and his friends would take old  cars seats and put them in the street and jump over them for practice.   When he enrolled at Jesse Owens' alma mater, Cleveland's East  Technical High School on the east side of our city, Owens himself gave  Harrison a new pair of running shoes. Jesse Owens was one of the most  famous athletes in the country. He won world records, one gold medal,  and stood up to Adolph Hitler. Jessie Owens gave Harrison Dillard a new  pair of running shoes.   Mr. Dillard joined the Army after high school. He served in a  segregated unit. Just for younger people who don't know this history,  we segregated our Armed Forces in this country, even in World War II.  Just to add a little more to that history with those soldiers who came  back from serving their country, they came back to a segregated  country. They had fought for human rights. They came back, and they  didn't have those human rights. Think about that.   After the war, General Patton saw Harrison Dillard in an Army track  meet, and Patton said--pardon my language on the Senate floor: ``[That  man] is the best Goddamn athlete I've ever seen.''   Harrison Dillard proved him right. He represented our country at the  Olympics in London. He brought home two gold medals in the 100-meter  race. He achieved his childhood dream. He matched Jesse Owens' Olympic  record time of 10.3 seconds. That was in 1948. He would later write in  his autobiography: ``I could finally say that I was just like [Jesse  Owens].''   Plenty of people tried to hold Harrison Dillard back because of the  color of his skin. He recalled how, after his military discharge, he  was refused food at a restaurant. Again, he served his country, he came  back to his country, and he was refused food in a restaurant because of  the color of his skin. It is shameful how we treated veterans and  fellow citizens in this country. It is a testament to Mr. Dillard's  tenacity and talent that he achieved so much in the face of a society  that was so often set up to hold him back. He ended his career by  serving the city that raised him. He worked for the Cleveland public  school system.   Now, I met Harrison Dillard once. Actually, I met him later as an  adult. I saw him not that many years ago. I met him when I was in Boy  Scouts at Camp Avery Hand in Mansfield, OH. Harrison Dillard came out  and spoke to our Scout troop and other troops who were sitting there  congregated to listen to this world class famous athlete talk to us  about service. I remember I didn't know a lot about him because I was  not even born when he won the Olympics, but I knew he was an Olympian.  He was introduced as that. We got to listen to him, and he inspired us.   His legacy lives on in Northeast Ohio. He lives on around the country  not only in our record books but also through the young people he  inspired. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Harrison  Dillard--Olympic gold medal winner, U.S. Army veteran, and citizen of  the great city of Cleveland.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
