 Madam Speaker, we are here tonight, as the House Energy  Action Team, to discuss the numerous economic, national security, and  environmental benefits of the American energy renaissance.   The HEAT team will never be supportive of policies that increase  electricity prices for consumers, favor foreign-based production over  domestic, and deter the development and construction of energy  infrastructure.   Due to policies that incentivize private investment and production,  the United States has become the global leader in natural gas and oil  producing, as well as refining. This has given us the ability to export  energy to our friends, allies, and countries that want to import U.S.  energy.   Energy Secretary Rick Perry recently said, ``The United States is not  just exporting energy. We are exporting freedom.'' I couldn't agree  more.   There is no national security without energy security. We understand  that in the House Energy Action Team.   Looking at this graph, in 2018, U.S. crude oil production exceeded 11  million barrels per day, surpassing Russia as the world's largest crude  oil producer. The U.S. produced 12.16 million barrels per day of crude  in April 2019.   I was just out in North Dakota, in the Bakken. I am amazed at the  production going on in that little corner of the world. I say  ``little,'' but the Bakken is huge. It is a tremendous resource for the  Nation.   In fact, we are producing more oil and natural gas in the Bakken in  North Dakota and Montana than they are in the country of Venezuela,  which is known for its natural resources, known for its oil production.  They are producing more in the Bakken.   Robust domestic energy production is essential to global leadership  in the United States. According to the U.S. Energy Information  Institute, natural gas and oil supplied about two-thirds of American  energy used in 2016.   Oil and gas will continue to be a prominent source of energy. The  Energy Information Institute estimates that fossil fuels will account  for nearly 70 percent of the country's energy used by 2050.   The goal should be to produce, develop, or make fossil fuels  available cleaner through private sector innovation, not regulation.  That should be the goal, private sector innovation, not the heavy boot  of government telling the innovators what they should or should not do.  The innovators are actually making things cleaner. We are producing a  lot, and we are exporting a lot.   One thing I applaud President Trump for doing is challenging  Chancellor Merkel and Germany to lessen their dependence on a foreign  source of energy, in this case, not the Arab states, Saudi Arabia, or  others, but lessen their dependence on Russia. A lot of Europe, Eastern  Europe and Western Europe, get their energy from Russia, Gazprom and  Rosneft, which support Vladimir Putin.   By lessening Europe's dependence on Russia for their energy, Russia  is no longer an influencer. It can't turn the spigot on and off to  influence political policy in Europe.   Europe still has to meet its energy needs. It can do that looking  west to the United States through our export of LNG, liquefied natural  gas put on ships, sent to Europe, and off-loaded to provide the natural  gas and energy security for our friends and allies overseas to lessen  their dependence on Russia.    Exports of U.S. LNG are set to rise 72 percent this year, as compared  to 2018. Russia is just a gas station masquerading as a country, but  they are providing that natural gas to Europe. They use their levers of  influence, turning that spigot on and off to affect policy not only in  Eastern Europe but in Western Europe. Those policies and those  pipelines continue to be built to provide that natural gas.   We need to provide that from this country. We have an abundance. We  have an abundance of oil, too. We are now an exporter of oil.   If we look at what the U.S. energy sector has been able to do during  this American energy renaissance, it will show that we are a leader in  energy production and energy technology. We can help other countries  around the globe to meet their energy needs with our technology as  well.   Madam Speaker, we have a great group of House Energy Action Team  members who want to talk about what is going on, maybe in their States,  maybe things they know about in this Nation. I know Rick Allen wants to  talk about nuclear power and what is going on in Georgia. I know Bruce  Westerman wants to talk about what is going on in Arkansas. We have so  many others.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman)  to talk about what is going on in his part of the world.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman). He was out in North Dakota with me. One thing we saw with  natural gas and oil being produced out there, and the understanding of  a need for infrastructure in this country, gas utilities the United  States added over 730,000 miles of pipeline to serve almost 220 million  more customers.   At the same time, methane emissions have fallen 70 percent, 75  percent, and CO2 emissions from U.S. power systems are at  their lowest level since 1985. Pipelines are the safest way to  transport natural gas, but some parts of the country refuse to accept  this reality.   For example, New England has moratoriums on natural gas extraction,  and the inability to construct a pipeline caused an increase in  electricity prices. These policies are just asinine and need to change.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin  Hern), a freshman Member of Congress and a leader on the House Energy  Action Team. We will hear about what is going on in his great State of  Oklahoma.                                time  2030     Madam Speaker, I tell you, in Oklahoma, they know energy.  I think one of the first wells ever drilled in the United States of  America was over in Oklahoma. And another place they know a lot about  energy is down on the Gulf Coast in my adopted State of Louisiana.   The gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) knows energy, and they have  got a lot going on in The Pelican State. I yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Natural gas is being produced in this country in a tremendous amount,  so much so, that we can export it anywhere in the world. But those on  the other side are refusing to accept the reality of the benefits of  natural gas. In fact, Berkeley, California, is the first American city  to ban natural gas from being used in new homes and businesses, being  banned from being used in new homes and businesses to heat and cook in  their homes, probably banning transportation fuels, as well.   Natural gas is affordable for so many Americans, and I can tell you  what. When Americans go to the pump, they are conscientious about the  price because the money they put in that tank could be the difference  in discretionary income they could use for other things.   When you help keep energy prices down, not only transportation fuels,  but energy prices through the electricity generation in this country-- folks over in Georgia understand electrical generation. In fact, they  are building the Nation's only nuclear power plant over in Augusta,  Georgia.   I yield to the gentleman from Savannah, Georgia, to talk a little bit  about that.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Georgia, and he was one of the first members of the House Energy Action  Team. He comes from the Energy and Commerce Committee, working with me  alongside some others on the HEAT team.   I want to applaud Whip Scalise for allowing the House Energy Action  Team to be reformulated, give us a chance to talk, communicate directly  with the American people about American energy renaissance, American  energy issues.                                time  2045    I would like to recognize the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).  Before I do, I will say that one of the biggest honors I have had in my  life came this year when Governor Abbott made me an honorary Texan. So  I am proud to stand alongside my fellow Texan, Pete Olson from Texas,  to talk about what is going on in the great State there.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Olson) for being here tonight.   We hear a lot about the Green New Deal. That proposal is based solely  on solar, wind, and hydropower in an effort to drastically cut carbon  emissions across the country. In my State of South Carolina, we have  seven reactors that produce 95 percent of the State's emission-free  electricity, 53 percent of our total electricity costs.   I want to show a graph really quickly before I introduce the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).   This graphic shows the magnitude of one nuclear reactor and compares  the capacity factors of one reactor, rated at 1,154 megawatts, to wind  turbines. To match one reactor, it takes 2,077 windmills. Yes, there  are 2,077 windmills on this graph, and 2,077 would be needed.    Think about the amount of acreage that it would take just to put the  windmills up to meet the electricity generated from one nuclear  reactor.   I mentioned earlier the State of Georgia is building the only nuclear  reactor being built in this country right now, and that is down at  Vogtle in Augusta, Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen),  from Augusta, and I am sure he is going to talk about nuclear energy.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments, and  I thank him for leading the group down to look at that nuclear reactor.   Madam Speaker, it was cold this winter up in Michigan. Had it not  been for fossil fuels, a lot of folks would have had a hard time.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg)  to talk about his role on the Energy and Commerce Committee and here on  the House Energy Action Team.    Madam Speaker, America watching tonight will see that we  have got a lot of great leaders in Congress that understand energy, and  they come from a lot of different States.   The State of Arkansas produces oil, produces coal, produces a lot of  biomass, and produces hydroelectric. They also produce a lot of ducks.  I enjoy going to Arkansas and hunting.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) to  talk about what is going on in his great State.    Madam Speaker, I thank all of the members of the House  Energy Action Team for coming to the floor tonight and communicating  with the American people about the American energy renaissance.   When our constituents think about cost of energy, a lot of times  their first thoughts are transportation fuel. How much is it going to  cost them to fill up the tank? Is there going to be enough money left  over after their transportation fuel costs to feed the family, buy  groceries, maybe do improvements, and other things that American  families spend money on.   But one of the factors in energy cost is what you pay for that  electricity and what do our manufacturers pay for that electricity?  Where does that electricity get generated? And, most importantly, will  it be a 24-7, 365-day baseload power supply always on, available when  they want to manufacture that next BMW in Greer, South Carolina, or  that next Boeing aircraft in Charleston, or the next component that  goes in one of those manufactured all over the country.   We take for granted in this Nation that we do have a 24-7, 365-day  baseload power supply always on, and it is transmitted over tremendous  infrastructure, but that infrastructure needs to be improved. We need  pipelines to transfer and transmit the natural gas that is being  produced and the oil that is being produced in places like Texas,  Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. But also the wind power that is  generated wherever wind is generated and solar power wherever solar  power is generated, there has to be transmission lines to get that  power to the grid so that it can be used.   So as we have the conversation in America about all of the above--and  one thing the House Energy Action Team is about is all of the above; we  like wind, solar, and hydro, it is all groovy--but we know what works,  and that is nuclear power and that is hydro and fossil fuels,  supplemented by the alternative fuels that are coming online.   We have got the GrayMatter innovators and entrepreneurs in this  country to meet some of the things that Mr. Hill talked about: the  battery capacity. And that is there to store that power to be used when  needed, when it is generated by wind and solar. It is intermittent to  store that power, it's generated when the Sun is shining and generated  when the wind is blowing, and it is stored to be used at night or when  the wind isn't blowing. Nuclear power always runs, and natural gas  always runs. These are components of this debate that we need to talk  about.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate Members of the House Energy Action Team  coming to the floor and talking with America with so much passion about  American energy to meet the needs of our constituents, but at an  affordable price that helps our constituents meet their budgets.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity for this  Special Order, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
