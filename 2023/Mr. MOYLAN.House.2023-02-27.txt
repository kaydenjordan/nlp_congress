 Mr. Speaker, I take this time to honor the late and great  Jose ``Pedo'' Terlaje who left this world recently.   A proud son of Guam, Pedo was a husband, a father, and a grandfather.  He was also an uncle, a nino, and a primo to many.   Pedo proudly served his Nation in uniform, protected his island as a  police officer, and represented his community as the mayor of Yona.   I was honored to serve with him in the 35th and 36th Guam legislature  where as a Senator he tirelessly advocated for the perpetuation of  Guam's culture, for veterans, for law enforcement officers, and most  importantly, for the people of Guam.   I stand here today in the Halls of this historic building to not only  recognize and commend Senator Jose ``Pedo'' Terlaje for his many  contributions to the country and to our beautiful island of Guam, but  also to express the Nation's deepest condolences to his wife, Flo, and  to his family.   Rest in peace, Primo, until we meet again.                            ____________________
