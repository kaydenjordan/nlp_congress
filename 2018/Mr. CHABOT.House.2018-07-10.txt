Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today, this evening, in support of H.R. 1700, the  SCORE for Small Business Act of 2018, which was introduced by the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), and I want to commend her  for her leadership on this legislation. This legislation will allow the  SCORE program to continue to offer business mentoring and training to  thousands of entrepreneurs and small business owners each year.   The SCORE program currently includes over 11,000 volunteer mentors,  with expertise across 62 industries, who collectively provide more than  a million hours of business counseling each year.   When an entrepreneur seeks a SCORE mentor, they are purposely paired  with a business professional with knowledge in a specific field or  experience facing specific challenges. This process ensures that the  concerns of the entrepreneur are met by the volunteer mentor.   In addition to SCORE's mentorship services, the program also offers  in-person business training classes at its 350 chapter locations  nationwide. Entrepreneurs can also utilize the extensive online  training opportunities and free business tools available on SCORE's  national website.   Last fiscal year, SCORE trained over a half million clients,  empowering them to start, run, and scale their business. This  legislation will allow SCORE to continue to provide these important  services.   H.R. 1700 reauthorizes the SCORE program at $10.5 million for fiscal  years 2019 and 2020, providing for enhanced services to SCORE clients.  This legislation also formally changes the program's name from the  Service Core of Retired Executives to the more commonly used name of  SCORE.   Additionally, H.R. 1700 requires the SCORE Association to further  utilize webinars and electronic mentoring as a way of increasing  SCORE's presence nationwide.   H.R. 1700 will require the SCORE Association to develop a strategic  plan for how the program will adapt to meet the needs of America's  entrepreneurs over the coming years. This requirement will not only  allow for better congressional oversight of the SCORE program, but will  also guarantee that taxpayer dollars contributing to the program are  effectively used to serve the needs of the small business community.   Considering the important role that small businesses play throughout  our Nation and our communities, it is our responsibility to ensure that  our entrepreneurs and small businesses have the resources that they  need to be successful. H.R. 1700 is the way of doing just that, and I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1700, the SCORE for Small Business  Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentlewoman from North  Carolina if she has any further speakers this evening, and, if not, I  believe I have the right to close. So if she has any concluding  remarks, I would be happy to yield if the gentlewoman has any other  speakers to speak on this issue because I would be closing then.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the commonsense improvements in this bill will allow the  SCORE program to continue its mission: helping entrepreneurs to start  and grow their businesses.   With over 99 percent of all businesses in the United States being  classified as small, it is vital that these business owners have access  to effective entrepreneurial resources.   H.R. 1700 would ensure that, regardless of location, a small-business  owner can access SCORE mentoring and training.   Mr. Speaker, I would, again, like to commend the gentlewoman from  North Carolina for her leadership on this important matter. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2655) to amend the Small Business Act to expand intellectual  property education and training for small businesses, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2655         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Innovation       Protection Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act--        (1) the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of       the SBA;        (2) the term ``Director'' means the Under Secretary of       Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO;        (3) the term ``SBA'' means the Small Business       Administration;        (4) the term ``small business concern'' has the meaning       given the term in section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 632(a));        (5) the term ``small business development center'' means a       center described in section 21 of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 648); and        (6) the term ``USPTO'' means the United States Patent and       Trademark Office.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) the USPTO and the SBA are positioned to--        (A) build upon several successful intellectual property and       training programs aimed at small business concerns; and        (B) increase the availability of and the participation in       those programs across the United States; and        (2) any education and training program administered by the       USPTO and the SBA should be scalable so that the program is       able to reach more small business concerns.       SEC. 4. SBA AND USPTO PARTNERSHIPS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator and the Director       shall enter into a partnership agreement under which the       Administrator and Director shall--        (1) develop high-quality training, including in-person or       modular training sessions, for small business concerns       relating to--        (A) domestic and international protection of intellectual       property; and        (B) how such protections should be considered in the       business plans and growth strategies of the small business       concerns; and        (2) leverage existing training materials already developed       to educate inventors and small business concerns.        (b) Training.--The training developed under subsection (a)       may be provided by the Administrator, the Director, or small       business development centers established under section 21 of       the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648)--  [[Page H6031]]         (1) through electronic resources, including Internet-based       webinars; and        (2) at physical locations, including at--        (A) a small business development center; or        (B) the headquarters or a regional office of the USPTO.       SEC. 5. SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS.         Section 21(c)(3) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       648(c)(3)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (S), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in subparagraph (T), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(U) training developed by the Administrator and the       Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office,       which may be delivered in person or through a website to       small business concerns relating to--        ``(i) domestic and international intellectual property       protections; and        ``(ii) how such protections should be considered in the       business plans and growth strategies of the small business       concerns.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I  rise this evening in support of another bill, H.R. 2655, the Small  Business Innovation Protection Act of 2017, and I want to commend the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans) for his leadership on this  bill.   As small entrepreneurs continue to expand their businesses both here  and abroad, they must have the tools they need to protect their  intellectual property. Entrepreneurs and small-business owners have  generated more than 63 percent of new jobs over the last two decades,  and small businesses represent about 96 percent of employer firms in  high-patenting manufacturing industries.   However, the process for obtaining copyright, trademark, and patent  protections both in the United States and abroad can be daunting, even  for the most experienced small-business owners. We need to ensure that  small-business owners have the tools they need to protect their  innovative ideas and products, as intellectual property protections are  essential to promoting entrepreneurship and innovation.   Small-business owners often do not have the knowledge or resources to  protect their ideas and products, especially when they are competing in  the international marketplace. Most simply cannot afford to retain  attorneys to guide them through the difficult process of obtaining  intellectual property protections, which leaves them vulnerable to  their innovative ideas and products being stolen both here in the  United States and internationally.   This bipartisan legislation, introduced by my friend and colleague  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans) addresses this issue by forming a  partnership between the SBA, the Small Business Administration, and the  United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, giving  entrepreneurs the full breadth of knowledge of the Small Business  Development Center system and the USPTO. The partnership will provide  training for small-business owners, which can be provided by the USPTO,  the SBA, or a Small Business Development Center either electronically  or at a physical location.   This legislation utilizes existing resources at both agencies to  better assist small-business owners and expand their outreach efforts  to provide small businesses with the resources they need to address  intellectual property issues.   Considering the important role that small entrepreneurs play in our  global marketplace, it is our responsibility to ensure that they have  the resources they need to better protect their intellectual property.  H.R. 2655 addresses this important small business issue and, therefore,  I would urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Mr. Evans for his leadership on  this, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation strengthens the partnership between two  important Federal agencies that help small businesses protect what they  have created: the SBA and the USPTO.   It is important that small firms across the Nation have access to all  the tools that they need to protect their creations from intellectual  property theft.   Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
