 Madam Speaker, it has been an interesting day, perhaps  more than most.   We have heard over and over again about Republicans supposedly  causing the shutdown, but in my days as a trial lawyer, judge, chief  justice, it is always good to look at the evidence. And the evidence is  very clear.   You had Republicans in the House and Senate and the President  actually pass a spending bill in the House before the end of December,  and the only thing that was keeping it from getting through the Senate  was that Democrats there, led by Senator Schumer, would not negotiate.  They arrived at no agreement to get 60 votes so that it could go  forward with debate. That wasn't the Republicans.   In the position of the White House, President Trump made clear: This  is negotiable, but we do need wall, we need barrier. Call it whatever  you want.   He moved from talking about concrete to talking about the steel  barrier. And having spent time with some other Members of Congress,  invited by Congressman Biggs and Congressman Gosar down to the Arizona  border, we saw a lot of it. And then it would just end. And then you  saw a clear path right around the end of it as people kept coming,  invading this country illegally.   From the border patrolmen, it was clear some were carrying big loads  of drugs. Sometimes they are able to catch them, sometimes they are  not. And it sounds like, from the times I spent on the border south of  McAllen, southeast of McAllen, the Texas quadrant, more often than not,  they don't catch the drugs coming in. It is an invasion. It is a huge  problem.   And I was hearing people, friends across the other side of the aisle,  some Senators who are Democrats, acknowledging: Yes, we need to do  something. But when it came to negotiating, there was no negotiation.   So we had this bill today decrying how horrible shutdowns are. But if  you look at the tactics, when the tactics of the leaders--and I say at  least some of the leaders--of one party are ``we are not going to  negotiate; we are not going to compromise; we are not going to do what  is best for the country,'' in effect, as they have stated on prior  occasions, as they have voted on prior occasions, some of them, that is  what causes a shutdown.   You know, we did not need this shutdown. We shouldn't have had to  have this shutdown. It should have been agreed back in December by at  least some of the Senators so that we could have gotten a spending  bill.   Of course, we had spending passed on three-fourths of the government.  It was about one-fourth of the government that was not funded. So we  talk about a shutdown. It wasn't a full shutdown. But, still, it did  harm to those who were not getting paid.   But as I would go through airports--and TSA agents would know who I  was--numerous times I was told: We are hurting not getting paid, but we  are all right. We are going to be a whole lot worse off if we don't get  a wall or a barrier or something built and start securing the border.   We heard from teachers who were saying: We love our kids, we want to  teach them, but it is so unfair to the students who are already there  to have people brought in and say you have got to educate these, and  they don't speak English. And the teachers would say it really did  damage, it does damage to those students that we are supposed to also  teach. And now, all of a sudden, we have people we have to teach who  don't speak English.   There are some school districts that have done a great job of trying  to work around that and teach English in an immersion-type setting so  that we can help people not be relegated to manual labor the rest of  their lives, but help them speak good English so that they can get good  jobs.   But we need a barrier in some places on the border where we don't  have it, and that is clear. You can't just have a 20-, 30-foot barrier  just proceeding along that is stopping the drugs, stopping the sex  trafficking, stopping the human trafficking, and then just stop it.  Because, as we saw down the Arizona border, the path goes for miles and  miles, and it comes right up to the point where the barrier ends, and  it goes right around.   In one place, there is a little barbed wire gate that is held to the  barrier. This massive barrier is held with a little, probably a  quarter-inch, nylon rope. And they leave it in a slip knot so you can  open the gate and the drugs can come pouring in that will kill  Americans.   Something had to be done. And yet what happened was the President was  willing to negotiate, Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans were willing  to negotiate, Senator McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate were  willing to negotiate, and yet the word from our Speaker was: We are not  negotiating at all on a barrier, a wall.   So we continued to have people in the interim, while the government  was shut down, continue to die as a result of us not securing our  border.   We were told by Border Patrol, every day, there are women who are  pulled into sex trafficking. Every day, there are women--often young  girls. We are told about one-third of the girls who are brought up to  bring them into the United States illegally are raped at least once  and, normally, multiple times.   As long as we keep our border so unsecured, that is going to  continue. I mean, how much lack of compassion do you have to have to  say: ``We are fine with the rape trees; we are fine with one-third of  the girls coming into the United States illegally having been raped. We  are fine. We just leave things like they are. That is fine, but we are  not going to negotiate because.   Apparently, from what we are hearing, even though many of the people  who refuse to negotiate have talked about the need for barriers and  talked  [[Page H1322]]  about the need for securing the border, they were very concerned that  the President would get a political win by getting even part of a wall  or barrier. So people are just going to have to keep suffering, getting  raped and dying.   So we didn't secure the border, there is no additional wall, so they  can claim the President didn't keep his promise on the wall. That was  more important than saving lives, saving rapes from happening. It is  all about politics.   And that is not across the aisle. I have talked to too many friends  across the aisle that, if we had been left to our own resources, we  could have worked something out.                                time  1500    But apparently, at the top, it was more important to keep a political  win from the President than it was to do what was right for the  country.   I don't know anybody on our side of the aisle who loves shutdowns,  but there were some claims made in the bill that went too far, so most  of us voted ``no.''   We don't want a shutdown, the same way we don't want anybody in our  military dying. But, if we never had any military willing to risk their  lives, we wouldn't have the freedoms we have today.   If we didn't have a President willing to put a stake in the sand and  say: We have got to do something to secure our border. We need some  barrier, wall, whatever you want to call it in some places. And I will  negotiate. The amount is negotiable--he came down to about a fifth of  what he had been saying and what we are told really needs to be spent,  $25 billion or so. Yet there was no negotiation on the other side.   I know there was one dollar mentioned, apparently in jest: Oh, I  would give a dollar for a wall.   But it just seems so hypocritical to have a leader, or leaders, that  would not negotiate in good faith, which caused a shutdown, with one  side willing to negotiate on everything except we have got to have some  barriers someplace and no negotiation on the other side.   Then we come in here with a bill today to condemn shutdowns that were  caused by a refusal of one side to negotiate. Like I said, I know that  is not the case.   There is an article here from the Washington Examiner, Anna  Giaritelli. It says: ``House Republicans say at least 60 Democratic  lawmakers have indicated in the past few weeks that they support some  type of barrier, wall, or fence at the U.S.-Mexico border, even as  Democratic leaders say they won't agree to President Trump's border  wall.''   It is just amazing that that ends up being the climactic bill today,  condemning shutdowns, after the leadership on one side says: We are not  compromising; we are not moving an inch. It causes a shutdown; we will  blame that on you. We will even pass a bill. We have got a majority. We  can pass a bill, you know, that condemns shutdowns.   They took out the language, thankfully, that blames the Republicans.   But I would like to recognize my very dear friend from Pennsylvania  for his comments and observations.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry).    The gentleman mentioned the 51,000. That is just, as I  understand, those who were apprehended.    In 1 month. That is not everybody that was coming in.   My friend, being a general in the United States Army, served our  country so meritoriously. We had a situation under President Woodrow  Wilson where a small part of Pancho Villa's gang came across the border  into the United States, killed some families, and then went back into  Mexico.   Devout Democrat that Woodrow Wilson was, he apparently saw that small  incursion as an invasion. He sent--and I have asked the Congressional  Research Service for their best numbers, and the estimate, taken from  articles and information they had gotten, was probably around 75,000 of  a new group called the National Guard--new back in the early 1900s.   He sent them down to stand guard on the border--75,000--and sent  General John Pershing down into Mexico pursuing Pancho Villa's troops.  They  [[Page H1323]]  didn't ever get him; they got a lot of his lieutenants. But,  apparently, when 75,000 people were put on the border, there was no  more invasion.   If you look at the U.S. Constitution, Article IV, Section 4--this is  our Constitution--says: ``The United States shall guarantee to every  State in this Union a Republican form of government, and shall protect  each of them against invasion.''   Now, 51,000 in a month is many, many times more than the folks that  Pancho Villa had come in and kill Americans. Would the gentleman  consider that an invasion, what we have going on on our southern  border?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry).    Madam Speaker, I do want to hit one point that the  gentleman made about the drones. They can help. The television cameras,  all of the sophistication, the technology, can help.   The gentleman from Pennsylvania was not here when $8 billion, as I  recall, was passed in the House and Senate, signed by the President,  and given to protect our southern border for, the terminology I recall,  a virtual wall. And that was not a wall but cameras, airplanes, drones,  whatever they could get, whatever they needed, whether it was  microphones, listening--it was whatever the Secretary of Homeland  Security thought appropriate.   There was a provision that was added in the Senate that became part  of the law that said, if the Secretary of Homeland Security decides  that money is not going to accomplish the purpose of securing the  border, then she can wave that off and spend the money elsewhere.   That is what Secretary Napolitano did, as I recall. She waved it off.   I have been trying to find out for a number of years now: Where did  that $8 billion go that was supposed to be for this technology that we  are hearing from some across the aisle: That is all we need is that?   Well, not one single Democrat did I ever hear say: Do you know what?  Napolitano shouldn't have waved off a virtual wall.                                time  1515    They agreed that just wasn't going to do it. Secretary Napolitano  said that is not going to do it. That is not going to help secure the  border.   That is all we hear in response to President Trump saying wall,  barrier. Whatever you want to call it, it is what we need there.   I yield to my friend, Mr. Perry.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Pennsylvania  so much for sharing his thoughts. It continues to be a problem every  day.   An article here from The Hill, by Madison Gesiotto, says: ``The  Mexican Government is doing more to combat illegal immigration into the  United States than the entire Democratic Party put together. While the  Democrats continue to pretend the crisis on our southern border is  imaginary, Mexico is heavily investing in border security in  anticipation of yet another massive caravan of migrants heading for the  United States.''   It goes on: ``Hundreds of Honduran migrants began their journey in  hopes of seeking asylum at our southern border, a goal that proved  elusive to the previous caravan. Instead of dismissing the new caravan  as a `manufactured crisis' as the Democrats did after President Trump  made his appeal . . . Mexican authorities sprang into action,  announcing a list of strengthened requirements to address the problem.   ``According to the latest reports, the Mexican Government is  reinforcing all the entry points along its own southern border with  additional immigration enforcement agents and is stepping up  surveillance of known illegal crossing points. It also plans to enforce  strict immigration protocols, such as requiring the migrants to undergo  biometric scans and acquire immigration documents before they can enter  the country.''   So that is Mexico. We have worked on a bill in the past that said, if  you think the Mexican law is so much better than ours, why don't we  just adopt the policies and the laws of Mexico, with regard to  immigration? The bottom line is, if we were to do that, we wouldn't  have millions of illegal immigrants in this country.   I have to give the President some credit here. When we see this  article from Reuters, an unlikely source, it points out: ``The United  States sent the first Central American asylum seeker back to Mexico  through a crossing at the border city of Tijuana on Tuesday as part of  a hardened immigration policy, an official at Mexico's National  Migration Institute said.''   Somebody has been doing some amazing negotiating in order to make  that happen, where Mexico would agree to take back some folks who are  claiming asylum. As I understand it, we may have more people going back  to Mexico, pending their hearing.   As we heard from Secretary Nielsen back in December before our  committee, where there are walls and barriers in place, it cuts illegal  immigration by 90 to 95 percent. That is something that works. Nothing  is going to work 100 percent, but that is amazing at how well it works.   I now yield to my good friend, Congressman Gaetz.    I am very grateful to my friend, Congressman Gaetz, for  that insightful comment. The gentleman is right. When you are right,  you are right.   I would like to comment on something else that has been in the news,  and that is the longest war in which the United States has ever been  engaged.   For a little history, it took a few weeks for the United States to  find out where the training and preparation for 9/11 came from, and  that the Taliban and Osama bin Laden were behind it. They had control  of Afghanistan, the Taliban did.   It was an amazing bit of negotiation by President Bush, with  incredible help from intelligence and special operations. The special  ops people from our military were able to negotiate an agreement with  tribal leaders that ended up being called the Northern Alliance. It  contained some people who have become friends, people who love their  country.   By October, we were putting in about 300 special ops military. There  is a great book called ``Horse Soldiers'' that delves into this issue,  and a movie, ``12 Strong,'' although the ending wasn't quite accurate.  Our American forces were never to lead an operation. They were to  support Dostum in his operations, which is what they did, heroically.   By the end of February 2002, apparently, there was no organized  Taliban left in Afghanistan. It had done an amazing job. The heroic  fighting of those in the Northern Alliance, the Afghans led by General  Dostum, did an amazing job.   We provided some weapons. We gave them aerial--well, there were B-52s  flying, but only our special ops guys could call down bombs.   The leaders could tell the Americans: Look, there is a bunker. There  is a problem.   They would get the coordinates, call down the bomb, take care of it.  Dostum and his folks would go in and clean up. That is how, by the end  of October, we had not lost a single American, and the Taliban had been  defeated.   Unfortunately, at that point, we became occupiers. We sent in lots of  American military, and in the 7-plus years of Commander in Chief George  W. Bush, we lost just over 600 precious American military lives in  Afghanistan.   During the 8 years of Commander in Chief Obama--I believe,  personally, it was because of the tough rules of engagement, and our  people not being able to defend themselves until it was sometimes too  late--we lost about three times as many people under Commander in Chief  Obama as we did under Commander in Chief Bush. Whatever the problem,  the buck stops with the Commander in Chief, and we lost three times as  many when the war was supposed to be virtually over.   What happened, once we became occupiers, was then more Afghans were  joining the Taliban. I have talked with an individual who was part of  the inner circle that was being made at the State Department about what  kind of government we would give the Afghans.   That shouldn't have been our job. We defeated the Taliban, or the  Northern Alliance did with our help. They should have been the ones  deciding what kind of government.   The people I have talked to in Afghanistan, friends I have made  there,  [[Page H1325]]  they said: Look, there is not a much better place on Earth fitted for a  federalist form of government where the power is in the states or  provinces and in the localities. We don't need a big powerful dictator.  We need strong states or provinces.   Yet, the constitution we hoisted onto the Afghan people, led by a man  who is now in the State Department once again leading efforts--as I  understand it, he is the guy who said let's give them a centrist  government.   That is what the constitution gave Afghanistan. The President of  Afghanistan appoints the governors. He appoints the mayors. He appoints  the police chief.   The people in Afghanistan have said: Look, this is horrendous. This  is a formula for corruption. For heaven's sake, at least let us elect  our governors, elect our mayors. Let us choose our own police chiefs.                                time  1530    But that is not the constitution that we gave them. But there has  been an amendment movement for some time. The Obama administration  would not support it because they had some of the same State Department  people that said: No, let's keep this corrupt centrist--they didn't say  corrupt, but that is exactly what it gave them. And the Afghan people  don't like what America forced on them.   The solution is, encourage them. And since we spend billions of  dollars there, look, you want another dime? Amend the constitution;  allow an election of governors and mayors, local selection of police  chiefs. Let's return the power to the provinces.   As my friend, former Minister Massoud, there has said: Look, if you  will help us get that amendment done, then whenever America leaves, we  have got power back in our local areas. So if the Taliban takes over  one province, or tries to take over the national government, all the  other provinces can rise up and come after them and kick them out like  we did last time.   But as long as we have got this coerced, very centralized government,  all they have got to do is knock off a few people at the top; which is  why we have people that shouldn't still be in the State Department who  are negotiating with the Taliban, not even our friends. Our friends are  going to be dead when we pull out because we are leaving all this power  for easy reach of the Taliban.   We ought to be negotiating with our former allies, the ones that  defeated the Taliban within six months, and get them that amendment,  push them to get that, help them have those first elections under the  amended constitution, and then get the heck out of Afghanistan.   In that regard, we have a man who is not here on the floor this week,  hasn't been in January, named Walter Jones. He wanted us out of  Afghanistan, and he has for a very long time. He is not going to be  around to see that happen is the indication.   But, Madam Speaker, I know there are many of us that love that guy,  and I was sad to see him in hospice last Friday. Prayers are with his  family, because Walter is going to go home and be better off. But we  miss him.   I was heartened to see our friend, Alcee Hastings here on the floor a  while ago. He has been going through a difficult bout of pancreatic  cancer; been going through chemo, and I know my friends on both sides  of the aisle will continue to pray for and encourage him.   We can have strong disagreements. We don't wish anybody to go through  what Walter and Alcee have been going through.   One other friend that I spoke to in the last week, she has been in my  prayers, Anne Graham Lotz. What an incredible gift to America Billy  Graham's children have been. And our prayers will continue to be for  Anne, Alcee, and my friend, Walter, and his family.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 36 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, January 31, 2019, at noon.                            ____________________
