 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today is a good day for representative  government, it is a good day for the taxpayers, and it is a good day  for safe streets and strong families. It is also a good day to  emphasize that many times Congress acts in a bipartisan way, and  probably not enough so we get credit for it. But last night, one of  these bipartisan pieces of legislation passed by a vote of 87 to 12.  That happened when the Senate adopted the FIRST STEP Act.   Today, the House is expected to send it to the President, who is  waiting with a pen in hand to enact once-in-a-generation criminal  justice reform. I am confident that the President is ready to do that  because I attended the news conference about 5 weeks ago when he  endorsed this legislation.   The FIRST STEP Act will help keep our streets safe, and it offers a  fresh start to those who put in the work when they were in prison to  get right with the law while paying their debt to society. It also  addresses unfairness in prison sentencing and revises policies that  have led to overcrowded prisons and, of course, ballooning taxpayer  expenses.   Several decades ago, Congress passed well-intentioned laws imposing  harsh mandatory sentences to stop the flow of drugs into our  communities, and it happened that I voted for those laws, but they have  also had some unintended consequences. Our prison population has  exploded, and the taxpayers' burden to house inmates has followed suit.  Today, taxpayers pay more than $7 billion a year on our Federal prison  population; however, despite that high cost, nearly half the inmates  released today are rearrested.   As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for the last 38 years,  I consider myself--then and now--a law-and-order Republican. I am also  a taxpayer watchdog, and I believe in the redemptive power of  rehabilitation. So in 2015, I began to take a closer look at our prison  and sentencing laws. We needed to make the system work better for the  taxpayers, help law enforcement fight crime, and put a stopper in the  revolving prison door. I was led to that effort by the efforts of  Senator Lee and Senator Durbin, who had been working on similar  legislation for probably 3 to 4 years before my entry into this debate.   Several States across the country have developed these education,  treatment, and training programs. The result has been a significant  decline in recidivism. This means fewer crimes, fewer victims, and  fewer tax dollars spent housing inmates.   The FIRST STEP Act is carefully crafted to provide opportunities at  redemption for low-risk inmates, while ensuring that dangerous and  career criminals stay behind bars. It does this through a multilayer  system that filters out dangerous criminals and those likely to commit  new crimes.   The bill rewards those who take personal responsibility for their  mistakes and want to put in the time and will put in the time and  effort to turn their lives around.   It improves fairness in sentencing while preserving important law  enforcement tools.   It reduces some mandatory minimum sentences, but it also expands  their application to include violent felons.   It grants judges additional discretion to sentence low-level,  nonviolent offenders to less lengthy sentences as long as they fully  cooperate with law enforcement. Finally, it eliminates the disparity in  sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses, which  disproportionately impacts communities of color.    Passing these reforms has been a team effort years in the making. It  couldn't have been done without the stalwart commitment by a somewhat  unlikely cadre of colleagues and advocates. We have had to compromise  to make this possible, to seek to understand the other's points of  view. In so doing, I think we made the bill better, and we accomplished  something of historic significance that will reduce crime, make our  system more just, and improve lives for generations to come.   Senators Durbin and Lee, as I previously stated, were instrumental in  this effort. Their interest in criminal justice reform dates back  beyond my getting involved in it in 2014. The exact date, I don't know,  but probably after Senators Lee and Durbin joined hands, probably soon  after Senator Lee came to the Senate. Their efforts inspired the Senate  to take a fresh look at our sentencing and prison laws.   Senator Graham, the incoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  Senator Cornyn, and Senator Whitehouse have also been with us since the  very beginning of this effort.   Senators Booker and Scott both share a passion for criminal justice  reform and have been vocal advocates, shining a light on the  shortcomings and societal impact of our current system.   Credit is also due to our House colleagues--Chairman Goodlatte,  Ranking Member Nadler, and Congressmen Collins and Jeffries, who  introduced the FIRST STEP Act in the House. And thanks to Speaker Ryan  for his support and pledge to bring this to the House floor so quickly.   At every step along the way, we have stuck together. We pitched this  bill to our colleagues and made changes based on their suggestions. We  also relied on input and expertise from a variety of groups from across  the political spectrum. In the end, this campaign earned the support of  several top law enforcement and tough-on-crime champions, such as  President Trump.   I think it is important to acknowledge the President's leadership on  this issue. When he got involved, he closed the deal, and we got this  done. He was helped in that effort by Jared Kushner. Early in President  Trump's administration, I happened to be in the Oval Office of the new  President. Jared Kushner was there, and we discussed taking up criminal  justice reform. I just asked him if he was interested in it. I wanted  to give him a phone call, so we had that phone call. He took the issue  and ran with it and helped find a way forward to accomplish something  previous administrations had tried and failed to do. Brooke Rollins and  Ja'Ron Smith at the White House were also instrumental in this effort,  working with Jared Kushner.   I would also like to thank the majority leader for staying true to  his word and bringing this bill to the floor when we demonstrated the  support for our effort that he demanded. In the end, I appreciated his  vote for this bill.   Thanks also is due to the Senate floor staff on both sides of the  aisle  [[Page S7839]]  who helped us successfully navigate the bill to final passage.   I want to thank my Senate staff, who helped make this possible.  Bipartisan compromise is not for the faint of heart, and they have  stayed true to the commitment that Senator Durbin and I made to each  other to move forward step-by-step in complete agreement about the path  we should take and the path we had to take.   I would like to thank my Judiciary Committee staff director, Kolan  Davis. Kolan's steady hand and sound judgment improves everything he is  involved in. I value his counsel today, just as I have for the last 33  years.   By my side today is Aaron Cummings, my chief Constitution counsel and  crime counsel. He led the effort to negotiate this bipartisan deal in  my office and worked hard to see it through and to organize a vast  coalition of support. Of course, he also worked closely with other  committee staff members in that direction.   I would also like to thank Brian Simonsen for his diligent work on  this important bill.   Our Department of Justice detailees to the Judiciary Committee, Tom  Sullivan and Erin Creegan, provided very good technical advice.   My sincere thanks also goes to my talented communications team-- Taylor Foy, Judiciary Committee communications director, and George  Hartmann, Judiciary Committee press secretary, as well as Michael  Zona--for their dedication to this effort and their successful campaign  to educate and persuade so many to support this bill.   I am also thankful for my personal office staff, led by my chief of  staff, Jill Kozeny. Jill has been my trusted adviser for over 30 years.  She is leaving my staff, and I will be sad to see her go. She has been  an exceptional leader, solving problems that I didn't even know I had,  and she has done it all with matchless grace and what I like to call  Iowa nice.   I am also grateful to Jennifer Heins, who keeps me on track and  provides sound strategic advice.   Their contributions and those of every staffer who was part of this  effort have been invaluable.   I would like to thank Senator Durbin's staff, particularly his chief  counsel, Joe Zogby, and his counsel, Rachel Rossi. Working with my  staff, the White House, and others, they must have helped us close the  deal more than a dozen times. That is an example--maybe it is 10 times;  maybe it is 20 times. But closing deals many times is what it takes to  get to the bipartisanship that it took to get 87 votes on this bill. Of  course, in the end, their dedication--and that includes creativity and  every effort they could put forth--got the job done.   I want to give particular thanks to the law enforcement groups whose  support and input were key to the bill's success, including the  Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of  Police, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives,  the National District Attorneys Association, the Association of  Prosecuting Attorneys, and Law Enforcement Leaders.   I am getting to the end. I would also like to thank the groups that  made this effort possible. A diverse group and broad coalition of other  groups, from the ACLU to the American Conservative Union, supported  this bill. I can't list all the groups that offered their key support,  but they include FreedomWorks, Justice Action Network, Americans for  Tax Reform, Heritage Action, the Due Process Institute, Faith & Freedom  Coalition, R Street, Right on Crime, Texas Public Policy Foundation,  Prison Fellowship, and members of the Interfaith Criminal Justice  Coalition.   To treat everybody fairly, I ask unanimous consent that a complete  list of support be printed for the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         The Heritage Foundation; American Enterprise Institute;       Right on Crime; Americans for Tax Reform; FreedomWorks;       Independent Women's Forum; ALEC Action; Bridges to Life;       Calvert Institute for Policy Research; American Conservative       Union; Commonwealth Foundation; Faith and Freedom Coalition;       The James Madison Institute; Florida Tax Watch; Pelican       Institute; R Street Institute; Rio Grande Foundation; Texas       Public Policy Foundation; Fraternal Order of Police.

This was a combined effort, one on a scale not often  seen in Washington these days. I am grateful for everyone's work to  bring about these historic reforms. Together, we have taken steps to  reduce crime and recidivism, to strengthen faith and fairness in the  criminal justice system, and to signal to those willing to make amends  that redemption is within their reach. Together, we have taken an  important step to live up to the commitment we make every time we  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States: to provide liberty  and justice for all.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I thank Senator Durbin for his kind  remarks--more importantly, for 3 years of working together on this  legislation, and it is great that it paid off.                            ____________________     Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about the  work of the Senate on victims' rights and child protection measures and  also to highlight the work of Evelyn Fortier, staff member, who has  carried such a big burden in these areas of victims' rights and child  protection.   During my tenure as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I  have made it a top priority to champion bipartisan initiatives to  enhance victims' rights and to protect our Nation's at-risk children.  In the 115th Congress, as an example, I introduced and led the Senate  in approving multiple bills to prevent crime, identify missing  children, enhance services to crime victims, and reform our juvenile  justice system.   I am proud of what we have achieved on the Judiciary Committee during  this period of time, as we sent a half dozen of the measures I just  described to the President's desk after both Chambers passed them,  surprisingly, on a unanimous basis. For example, last October, we  passed, and the President signed, the Elder Abuse Prevention and  Prosecution Act. This measure, which I sponsored with Senator  Blumenthal, increases penalties for the fraudsters who target our  senior citizens. It requires Federal agencies to collect more data on  financial exploitation of the elderly, which is, of course, a terribly  underreported crime. It also calls for specialized training of Federal  investigators and prosecutors who handle these cases.   The second measure, which I introduced and the President signed last  January, is Kevin and Avonte's Law. This new law is named in honor of  two boys with autism who tragically died after wandering away from  their caregiver. It calls for the Justice Department to award grants to  equip school personnel, caregivers, and first responders with training  to help identify missing persons with autism or Alzheimer's disease. It  also permits grant funds to be used for technologies that advance the  search for missing children with developmental disabilities.   This legislation is important because research suggests that at least  one-third of the children with autism repeatedly wander away from  safety. Since 2015, we have seen a doubling in the number of wandering- related deaths, according to SafeMinds, a nonprofit organization that  advocates for these children.   I thank Senators Schumer, Tillis, and Klobuchar for joining as  cosponsors of Kevin and Avonte's Law.   Third, I introduced, and both Chambers this week cleared, legislation  to extend the important victim services programs that the Trafficking  Victim Protection Act established.   I led our Judiciary Committee in clearing this measure and a  complementary bill introduced by Senator Cornyn. Our bills, which were  cosponsored by Senators Feinstein and Klobuchar, soon will go to the  President's desk for signatures.   Both measures will help us to combat modern human slavery which,  unfortunately, is alive and well today in this country. It exists in  the form of sex  [[Page S7842]]  and labor trafficking. Through deception, threats, or violence, the  perpetrators of these crimes will do whatever it takes to turn a profit  and are doing it at the victim's expense.   Fourth, I this year championed legislation to renew and extend the  Missing Children's Assistance Act. This measure, which the President  signed this fall, makes funds available over the next 5 years for the  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to continue to do  its important work. The National Center partners with law enforcement  and communities across the United States in the effort to identify and  rescue missing and abused children.   The fifth measure I introduced in this Chamber with Senator  Whitehouse would renew and update the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention Act. That law has not been updated since 2002.   I introduced a measure on this subject for the first time in the  114th Congress. This year we concluded our negotiations with the House  on a final version of this legislation, known as the Juvenile Justice  Reform Act.   The measure we adopted last week, which is on its way to the  President's desk for signature, reflects the oversight work that I  carried out several years ago. This oversight, which was the subject of  a 2015 Judiciary Committee hearing, revealed a flawed grant program but  also one worth saving because of its potential benefits for our  Nation's at-risk youth.   The reforms that we have adopted also help to ensure the fairer  treatment of minors in detention through greater screening and  treatment of mental illness and substance abuse. This new law also  promotes an end to the shackling of girls who give birth in detention.  It encourages greater separation of juveniles and adult offenders in  detention, and ensures that detained youth can continue their  education. It will give these young people who come into contact with  the juvenile justice system a better chance of turning their lives  around.   I should add that we included accountability provisions in virtually  every grant funding measure reported by the Judiciary Committee during  my 4 years as chairman. The inclusion of this language, which I  authored several years ago in statutes authorizing Federal grant  programs, will help to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are used wisely  and, quite frankly, according to law.   I want, again, to thank my colleagues from the Judiciary Committee  who joined me as cosponsors of these and other new laws in this area.   I also want to thank the nonprofit groups, such as the National  Autism Association, the Elder Justice Coalition, and the Coalition for  Juvenile Justice, as well as individual advocates, who include Bob  Blancato, Stuart Spielman, Lisa Wiederlight, Marion Mattingly, and  others who contributed in a meaningful way to these laws, their  developments, and passage.   Once again, I want to thank Evelyn Fortier of my staff for her hard  work in these areas.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these  letters be printed in the Record for S. 3649, a bill to provide for  programs to help reduce the risk that prisoners will recidivate upon  release from prison, and for other purposes.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             National Fraternal Order of Police,                                   Washington, DC, November 9, 2018.        FOP Partners With President Trump on Criminal Justice Reform        Revised and amended First Step Act to be introduced next week         Chuck Canterbury, National President of the Fraternal Order       of Police, announced his support today for legislation       developed by the Administration to make important reforms to       our nation's criminal justice system.        ``The President and his team have been working hard on this       issue since Inauguration Day,'' Canterbury said. ``From the       outset, they let us know they wanted our input because this       effort could not succeed without our support. We are proud to       announce that by working together with the Administration and       leaders on Capitol Hill we have a bill that will make our       streets and neighborhoods safer, our police will be better       protected and improve the ability of our criminal justice       system to effectively rehabilitate offenders.''        The legislation, entitled the ``First Step Act,'' would       establish a comprehensive risk and needs assessment tool to       provide an individual profile of all Federal inmates. Those       offenders deemed to be at low risk to recidivate would be       given incentives and access to evidence-based recidivist       reduction programs to better prepare them to return to their       neighborhoods and become productive members of the community.        ``By individually targeting those offenders with the lowest       risk to re-offend, law enforcement and correctional officers       can better focus their resources,'' Canterbury explained.       ``The FOP played a key role in making sure that truly       dangerous offenders, like those who commit crimes while armed       and those who traffic in deadly narcotics like fentanyl, are       ineligible to participate in the First Step program.''        The legislation also contains certain sentencing reforms.       The FOP engaged with our allies on Capitol Hill to make sure       these changes are prospective and would not, except in the       case of the existing Fair Sentencing Act, be applied       retroactively. The bill also contains an FOP-backed provision       that would improve the safety of our Federal correctional       officers carrying firearms under the auspices of the Law       Enforcement Officers' Safety Act.        ``We have been proud to be a partner in this effort with       President Trump and are grateful for his leadership and for       his constant and unwavering support for law enforcement,''       Canterbury said. ``We look forward to working with him and       with Congress to get this bill to his desk.''        The Fraternal Order of Police is the largest law       enforcement labor organization in the United States with more       than 345,000 members.                                   ____                                        International Association of                                                Chiefs of Police,                                  Alexandria, VA, November 11, 2018.      President Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Trump: On behalf of the International       Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the world's largest       organization of law enforcement executives, I am writing in       support of the updated version of the First Step Act. We       applaud you and your Administration for your commitment to       law enforcement and to making lasting reforms to our criminal       justice system.        As you are aware, the IACP was supportive of the originally       introduced First Step Act, but did have some feedback on       changes that would further enhance the legislation. Your       Administration worked with the IACP throughout this process       to solicit our feedback and we applaud both you and your       Administration for ensuring that this legislation achieves a       proper balance of maintaining public safety while providing       rehabilitation services and early release incentives to       qualified federal prisoners.        The First Step Act contains several measures intended to       more effectively rehabilitate prisoners so that they are less       likely to reoffend after release and, thereby, are less       likely to cause additional harm to society. These measures       include education, job training, and other personal       development programs, along with incentives, such as good       time credits, to participate in these opportunities. The       proposed legislation includes an expanded list of 49       convictions that would ensure that truly dangerous offenders       are ineligible to receive time credits. In addition, the IACP       is also pleased that the revised legislation contains       provisions that ensure that certain sentencing reform       provisions, unrelated to the Fair Sentencing Act, can only be       applied prospectively thereby achieving the proper balance       between reform and maintaining public safety.        Once introduced in the Senate, the IACP looks forward to       working with Congress to continue to fine tune the       legislation. A key item that we would like to see addressed       is a notification system that will alert state and local law       enforcement agencies and their communities when a       rehabilitated offender is released into their jurisdiction.       Ensuring proper notification will enable law enforcement and       our communities to be aware when a rehabilitated offender       returns. Additionally, while the IACP agrees that a portion       of the savings associated with the reduction in recidivism       resulting from this legislation be invested back into the       Bureau of Prisons to continue evidence-based recidivism       reduction programs, it is also essential that a portion of       the savings be invested back into federal, state, and local       law enforcement.        In addition, further enhancements could be made to the       safety valve language. Before being eligible for any safety       valve provision, it is imperative that all pertinent       information and most importantly, information from local       authorities be reviewed. The facts and circumstances of the       original sentencing, including a review of any prior criminal       conduct or any other relevant information from federal, state       and local authorities should be considered before a       determination is made regarding a reduction in sentence.        Finally, and most importantly, the IACP is pleased with the       acknowledgement and commitment from the Administration that       there is a true need to establish a National Commission on       Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice       (Commission) to examine criminal justice issues in a broader       and more strategic fashion. While the First Step Act aims to       provide a solution to one of the many issues we are currently       facing, it is not the ultimate fix to the multitude of issues       confronting the criminal justice system. To move forward in a       systematic way that provides cross-cutting solutions for       multiple disciplines and issues, we need the Commission to       serve as the catalyst for a long overdue strategic blueprint.       Again, we appreciate the commitment from the White House to       work towards the Commission's establishment, which has been       one of the IACP's top priorities for more than two decades.        On behalf of our more than 30,000 members, thank you again       for working with the IACP on this important issue. We look       forward to continuing to work together as this legislation       moves through the process.            Sincerely,                                                      Paul M. Cell,      IACP President.                                   ____           National Organization of Black Law Enforcement             Executives,                                 Alexandria, VA, November 11, 2018.      The President,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the National Organization       of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), our Executive       Board, local chapters, and members, I am writing to express       support for the FIRST STEP Act (S. 2795/H.R. 5682). We       applaud the White House and Congress for soliciting feedback       from NOBLE and the law enforcement community in finalizing       the content of this very important legislation. We feel the       FIRST STEP Act strikes a balance between maintaining public       safety while improving re-entry, rehabilitation, workforce       training programs, and sentencing.        It is NOBLE's hope that this legislation strengthens bi-      partisan efforts in reforming this nation's criminal justice       system to ensure equity in the administration of justice. Our       organization joins many law enforcement leaders in the belief       that America can reduce incarceration levels while also       reducing crime.        Lastly, we encourage the White House and Congress to       continue to explore the establishment of a National Criminal       Justice Commission. The purpose of this commission would be       to undertake a comprehensive review of the criminal justice       system.        We thank all parties who helped in the development of the       FIRST STEP Act (S. 2795/H.R. 5682) and look forward to       working collaboratively in ensuring equal protection under       the law for all Americans.            Sincerely,                                                      Vera Bumpers,      National President, NOBLE.                                   ____                                                  November 13, 2018.       Re Police Perspective: FIRST STEP Act (S. 2795) & Sentencing           Reform.       Hon. Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Trump: I write to you today as Executive       Director of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime &       Incarceration, a bipartisan group of more than 200 current       and former law enforcement officials.        Today, our nation faces new criminal justice challenges,       including a rise in opioid overdoses, an uptick in homicides       in some cities, and strained police-community relations.       While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, we as leaders       in law enforcement feel compelled to share our views on how       passing  [[Page S7917]]       prison and sentencing reform together is vital to keeping our       nation safe.        First, I wanted to share our briefing memo explaining how       the FIRST STEP Act and sentencing reform will improve public       safety. Americans trust us, as law enforcement officers, to       both secure the safety of their communities and advise       policymakers on how to advance that goal. We hope this       information helps ease any concerns surrounding the bill Our       position is also in line with that of the Fraternal Order of       Police, which recently endorsed bipartisan efforts toward       justice reform.        Second, I wanted to share our previous letter supporting       the FIRST STEP Act and sentencing reform sent to leaders in       Congress, explaining the necessity of passing sentencing and       prison reform together to reduce recidivism and increase       fairness. Over 60 of our members signed onto this letter,       writing everywhere from Virginia to New Orleans to Iowa, to       share their views. I have expressed similar views in the The       Hill, with Washington Police Chief Peter Newsham.        We are grateful for your unwavering leadership in       prioritizing public safety and the critical issues facing law       enforcement. I hope we can work together toward bipartisan       reforms.            Respectfully yours,        Ronal Serpas,        Executive Director, Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime       & Incarceration.        Former Police Superintendent, New Orleans, Louisiana.        Former Police Chief, Nashville, Tennessee.                                   ____                                                   National District                                           Attorneys Association,                                                  November 13, 2018.      President Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Trump: On behalf of the National District       Attorneys Association (NDAA), the largest prosecutor       organization in the country representing 2,500 elected and       appointed District Attorneys as well as 40,000 Assistant       District Attorneys, who collectively prosecute around 95       percent of the crime in the United States, I write to support       the revised First Step Act. This legislation is a bipartisan       effort to address front-end sentencing reform and back-end       prison reform, and our association is appreciative of your       efforts to partner with the Nation's prosecutors on this       important matter.        NDAA previously supported the Sentencing Reform &       Corrections Act (SRCA) during the last Congress as a       carefully crafted bipartisan compromise. After weeks of       discussions with White House and Senate Judiciary Committee       staff, our organization is confident that the revised First       Step Act strikes an appropriate balance between addressing       the needs of the current Federal prison population while       ensuring criminals are penalized appropriately.        Tasked with the constitutional duty of protecting the       communities we serve from bad actors while seeking justice       for victims of crime and protecting the innocent, our members       are acutely aware of the need for reforms to our criminal       justice system. As currently written, the revised First Step       Act includes much needed prison reform provisions that will       provide the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) with the guidance and       resources to assist in lowering recidivism rates for low-risk       prisoners. Further, the addition of four sentencing reform       provisions takes a precision-like approach to sentencing       guidelines associated with certain crimes. Absent meaningful       sentencing reform, where the truly dangerous are locked up       for an appropriate period of time and those with addiction or       mental health issues have the chance for treatment and       rehabilitation, rising recidivism rates will continue to       persist.        While the legislation makes its way to the Senate, NDAA       plans to continue engaging with your staff and law       enforcement stakeholders to improve the language in the       revised First Step Act. Specifically, our organization is       working to ensure any reinvestment of savings generated       because of front-end sentencing reform provisions is invested       back into state and local law enforcement and prosecutor       agencies to prevent crime, target drug trafficking       operations, train law enforcement and prosecutors in the       field and respond to other emerging issues within the       criminal justice system.        Our members continue to call for a new commission to       explore issues across the criminal justice system to ensure       law enforcement and prosecutors can protect the communities       they serve and respond to emerging issues in the field. In       partnership with your administration, we hope to make that       call a reality. As part of that commission, it is imperative       that the local prosecutor perspective is represented as the       legal end of the criminal justice system continuum. Without       it, a comprehensive review of the broader stakeholder system       is incomplete. NDAA looks forward to having one of our       members bring the state and local prosecutor's valuable       perspective to the table once the commission is established.        We appreciate your efforts, as well as the efforts of a       bipartisan group of Members of Congress and staff, to ensure       the American criminal justice system is continually improved       upon and seen as a model for innovative and cutting-edge       programming that we see in our own members' offices every       day. Thank you for working with the Nation's prosecutors and       NDAA on this historic effort.            Sincerely,                                                 Jonathan Blodgett,                                                         President.
