 I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Ms.  Heitkamp), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson), and the Senator from  Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I will oppose the pending nomination of  Jeffrey Clark to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the  Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division. This  is the division that leads the Department of Justice's enforcement of  environmental laws and regulations. Mr. Clark is not the right person  for that job.   In 2014, he said the science of climate change is ``contestable.'' He  represented British Petroleum in litigation over the Deepwater Horizon  explosion and oil spill. He has represented the Chamber of Commerce and  other industry groups in challenging EPA greenhouse gas regulations.   He is a favorite of the Federalist Society, having chaired that  group's environmental law and practice group. But his nomination is  strongly opposed by groups that care about protecting the environment.   The Sierra Club called him an ``outspoken opponent of environmental  and public health protection.'' The Natural Resources Defense Council  described him as an ``enemy of the environment.'' He is exactly the  wrong person to be in this job of enforcing regulations to protect our  environment.   Just during these last few days, the United Nations put out an alert  to all of the members around the world. We are going to pay dearly for  this current administration's decision to remove ourselves from the  Paris Agreement, where literally every country on Earth agreed to try  to do something to clean up the mess of our environment and leave our  children a better place to live. We decided, under President Trump, to  be the only Nation to step away from it. Why? What in the world were we  thinking? Can you believe that things that are happening that are  easily documented can be ignored? Do you see the flooding that is going  on now in Florida on a regular basis? That is just 1 of 1,000 different  examples.   If we don't accept responsibility in our generation to make this a  better world, shame on us. We want to leave our kids a better world,  but for goodness' sake, do we have the political courage to do it? Will  we be able to say to the President: You are just wrong.   We have to work together with nations around the world. The United  States should be a leader, not an apologist. The President said he  wants to make America first. How about America first when it comes to  cleaning up the environment? There is nothing wrong with that  leadership. It is something we should be proud of.   This man, Jeffrey Clark, who is aspiring to be the Assistant Attorney  General, just doesn't buy into what I just said, and I can't support  him as a result.                                   S. 3021    Mr. President, the 2018 WRDA bill--the Water Resources Development  Act--that we are considering on the floor this week is an important  step in modernizing our Nation's water infrastructure and ensuring  access to clean drinking water. It goes back to my earlier comment. If  we are talking about the environment, one of the first things people  say is, I want safe drinking water for myself and my family. Next to  that, I want to be able to breathe in air that is not going to make me  sick or hurt any member of my family.   Our Nation's infrastructure is aging and in need of significant  investment. Last year, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave our  Nation's levees, inland waterways, and drinking water infrastructure a  D rating in terms of its infrastructure report card. They estimate that  $80 billion is needed over the next decade to improve our Nation's  levees--$80 billion. They also estimate that $4.9 billion is needed  over the next 2 years to maintain our inland waterways--$4.9 billion-- and $1 trillion is needed over the next 25 years to expand our drinking  water infrastructure. These are massive numbers, and they are going to  require sustained and significant Federal investment if we are ever  going to reach these goals.   This bill--the WRDA bill--is a step in the right direction. It  authorizes $6.1 billion in funding for the Army Corps flood control,  navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects around the country.  These are critical projects in every State.   I just went down a few weeks ago with Senator McConnell to the Ohio  River. The Olmsted Locks and Dam that has been under construction for  decades is finally completed. It is an amazing investment. It is the  most expensive civil infrastructure project in our Nation's history,  and it is an indication of the kind of investment that is necessary if  we are going to try to tame rivers like the Ohio River.   There are critical projects like that in every State. They improve  our inland waterways to help deliver $600 million in goods and 60  percent of our grain imports each year.   If we want the United States to literally lead the world--if we want  America first--for goodness' sake, we need to be first in investing in  our infrastructure. These projects maintain levees and build reservoirs  that protect millions of people and an estimated $1.3 trillion in  property, and they protect the environment, they restore wetlands, and  they prevent the spread of invasive species.   I am especially proud that this bill includes an important cost share  change for the future operations and maintenance costs at the Brandon  Road Lock and Dam in my State of Illinois. I worked with Senator Tammy  Duckworth on this project.   The Brandon Road project is integral to ensuring that invasive Asian  carp never spread to the Great Lakes. Knock on wood. We have held up  that carp from going into the Great Lakes and, in doing so, we have  preserved an important part of the fisheries and the lake itself. I  want to continue those efforts, if not redouble them.   While I am proud to support passage of this authorizing bill, I also  implore my colleagues to remember that unless we are willing to work  together--Republicans and Democrats--to provide these authorized  projects with consistent and increased appropriations each year, then  we are sending out press releases and not even getting the job half  done.   Let me say it another way: It is not enough to go home and take  credit for passing the WRDA bill, which is an authorization bill, if  you aren't also willing to pass an appropriations bill that actually  provides the money to break ground on these projects. An authorization  bill is just that: It gives you permission to do a project, but then  you need to go to the spending bill--the appropriations bill--to come  up with the money to actually achieve it.   Listen to this number. I want to make this part of the record as we  debate water resources and infrastructure. An analysis by the Roll Call  newspaper from earlier this year found that while Congress has  authorized more than $25 billion toward Army Corps projects in the last  decade--$25 billion in the last decade--Congress has  [[Page S6752]]  only appropriated $689 million. So $25 billion authorized, $689 million  appropriated. What percentage of money have we actually come up with to  finish these projects? We have come up with only $689 million out of  $25 billion--2.7 percent.   We send out all of these press releases congratulating ourselves  about projects that are never going to happen. We send out the releases  and say: This is going to be great for future generations. We are not  doing it. We are not investing in America.   Slow and inconsistent Federal funding for these projects results in  years of added delay and millions in added costs. Instead of funding  new projects, we have to spend more on ongoing projects because  Congress just doesn't get its act together--Democrats and Republicans.   I am proud of the work of the Appropriations Committee on which I  have been honored to serve. Both sides of the aisle do work to get  their job done in record time and ensure the Corps has stable funding  for the next fiscal year, but this year's appropriations process should  not be unusual.   Unless we as a Congress commit every year to getting our budget work  done and appropriating these Federal dollars, we will never get ahead  on investing in our infrastructure. Our competitors like China and  others around the world are making massive investments in  infrastructure not just in their own country but in other countries  that are teaming up with them, with an economic vision for the future.   What is our goal? What are we trying to achieve right here in the  United States, and how are we working to build our economy and create  good-paying jobs for the future?   Our Nation's water infrastructure is in need of significant  investment. The good bill we are considering today is just a step in  the right direction, but an authorization bill without appropriation is  just an empty press release.   I hope we can work together to ensure funding gets appropriated each  year to actually complete these important projects.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
