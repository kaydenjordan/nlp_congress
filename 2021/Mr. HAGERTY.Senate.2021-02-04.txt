 Mr. President, I am pleased to join the senior Senator  from Oklahoma as the lead cosponsor of this amendment in support of our  shared objective, maintaining the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, the  eternal and the indivisible capital of the Jewish State of Israel.   This Embassy is paving the way for peace throughout the region and  should be preserved. Now our allies there know we will stand with them.
