 Mr. Speaker, 11 years ago, I set off on a long-shot  campaign run by a talented and passionate but also overworked and  inexperienced staff, many of whom were learning on the job. Yet  everything went pretty smoothly--smoothly enough, obviously.   A big reason for this was an unpaid volunteer who just seemed to know  how to do everything. She would show up with a warm, ever-present  smile, eager to tackle the smallest task or take on the most  challenging responsibility. Whatever was needed, Carolyn Whitaker-Tandy  made everything easier. When it was time to hire a district director,  Carolyn made that decision easy, too.   I am fortunate to have had my friend Carolyn running my Louisville  office since day one. Though I will miss her leadership, I am proud  that she is moving on to new opportunities. I know the people of  Louisville are better off because of her service. I saw it firsthand  every day for more than a decade.   For all she accomplished, her commitment, and her continued  friendship, I am forever grateful. I expect great things from Carolyn  and her amazing family, and I wish them nothing but the best going  forward.                            ____________________
