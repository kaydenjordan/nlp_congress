 Mr. President, I rise to talk about a subject matter that  this bill deals with that we are not hearing a lot about. I wanted to  start, though, with the basics in terms of the overall debate.   I have said many times in the last number of days and weeks when we  have reviewed the House proposal and when we reviewed the Senate  proposal that was voted on in the Senate Finance Committee before  Thanksgiving--I described the Senate bill as a giveaway to the  superrich and big, multinational corporations. I still believe that.   I hope that when we see the new version of the bill, I won't have to  say that again, but I am afraid I will. I am afraid that when we look  at some of the data on what the tax impact would be on certain income  brackets in the United States, even starting in the first year where  the analysis starts, 2019--I am looking at page 3 of a report by the  Tax Policy Center dated November 20 and based upon the Senate bill. In  that year, tax year 2019, table No. 1 focuses on three income  categories: folks making between $50,000 and $87,000; folks making  between about $310,000 and $750,000; and others making above $750,000,  so basically the top 1 percent. Here is what they find. The Tax Policy  Center tells us that the first group, the family making $50,000 to  $87,000, would receive an average tax cut of about $900, or 1.4 percent  of after-tax income. The next group, the $310,000 to $750,000 income,  gets a tax benefit that amounts to about $12,000, or 3.5 percent. The  top 1 percent--$750,000 and up--they get a tax break of $34,000, or 2.2  percent.   Probably the most significant numbers in there by way of comparison  aren't necessarily the dollar amounts, although I would ask why the top  1 percent needs $34,000 in 2019. I don't think that should be part of  our legislation. I would like to see all of the tax benefits to the top  1 percent go to the middle and those trying to get to the middle. But  let's do the comparison.   In the first year, in terms of these families making $50,000 to  $87,000, they get 1.4 percent. The folks making between $310,000 and  $750,000 get 3.5 percent--more than two full percentage points higher.  Why is that? Why do people making $310,000 to $750,000 get a much  bigger percentage tax cut than people making $50,000 to $87,000? The  third category is the top 1 percent, and they get 2.2 percent. So I  have problems with this legislation just based upon that. Why does the  top 1 percent need one more penny? Why do very wealthy people--maybe  not quite the top 1 percent but the 95th to 99th percentile, the  $310,000 to $750,000 category--why do they need a tax break?   Guess what. It doesn't get any better down the road. And I am not  talking about 2027, where it is cataclysmic for families in the middle;  let's talk about 2 years before that. It is still bad. It is still 3  percent, by comparison, for the very wealthy, people making up to  $750,000. The top 1 percent are still getting 2.1 percent. But the  income category between $50,000 and $87,000 gets 1.2 percent of the tax  cut, so they will be getting worse in 2025. Why is that? As my  colleague, the senior Senator from Colorado, shows in that chart, why  do people making more than $1 million need $34 billion in 1 year? I  don't understand it.   Let me focus in particular on part of the debate about which we  really haven't had much discussion. The impact of this tax bill may be  the only substantial effort that will be made on tax reform for years,  if not decades. We know that the last time any kind of major tax reform  was done was 1986, so three decades have passed since the last tax  reform effort. So this is a critically important moment not just for  taxpayers, not just for the economy, not just for families generally,  but especially for children.   In a bill of this significance, a bill of this impact, one major  question should be asked, among many: What will be the impact on  children? What is the child impact statement, if we were to draft one,  if we had to articulate that? What is the impact on children of this  legislation?   Well, there are a lot of organizations around the country that pay  attention to public policy as it relates to children. I am looking at a  letter dated November 28 and signed by a long list of organizations  that advocate on behalf of children, and I will just read some of the  headlines from this letter.   The first headline says: ``The Senate tax plan threatens child care  programs and funding for the future.''   The second major headline says: ``The Senate tax bill's proposal to  cut the Affordable Care Act would harm children's health and well- being.''  [[Page S7671]]    The next headline says: ``The Child Tax Credit proposal in the Senate  tax bill would not help families who struggle to pay for child care.''   The next headline says: ``The Senate tax bill also takes away other  tax benefits that ordinary families rely on.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Dear Senator: As members of the Child Care/Early Learning       Coalition, we urge you to vote against the ``Tax Cuts and       Jobs Act.'' This bill would eliminate existing benefits in       the tax code for children and families, as well as undermine       critical supports, including those related to child care and       early education, in the future.        The Senate tax plan threatens child care programs and       funding in the future. The Senate tax bill, which consists       largely of massive tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy,       is estimated to increase the deficit by about $1.4 trillion       over ten years. The budget agreed upon by the House and       Senate provides a roadmap of how Congress will seek to offset       this increase in the deficit: by cutting federal spending       and, in particular, by slashing programs and services that       provide working families with a basic standard of living.       That means this tax bill will ultimately lead to cuts in       programs that are integral to the wellbeing of children and       their families, including Medicaid, SNAP, public education,       and the Child Care and Development Block Grant.        The Senate tax bill's proposal to cut the Affordable Care       Act would harm children's health and well-being. The Senate       bill would repeal the ACA's individual responsibility       provision, a requirement that most people enroll in coverage       or pay a penalty. Estimates from the Congressional Budget       Office (CBO) show that repealing the ACA's individual       responsibility provision would increase the number of       uninsured by 13 million over 10 years and raise insurance       premiums in the individual markets by 10 percent. Children's       health and well-being suffers when their families lack the       health insurance they need to see a doctor when they are sick       or for preventive care. The Senate has already rejected an       attempt to repealing the ACA, and now the bill would sneak       this in in order to fund even larger tax cuts for high-income       households and corporations.        The Child Tax Credit proposal in the Senate tax bill would       not help families who struggle to pay for child care. The       Senate tax bill would increase the Child Tax Credit (CTC),       but does not make this increase fully refundable. As a       result, lower-income families will not receive the full       benefit: for example, a single mother working full time at       the federal minimum wage and earning $14,500 would only       receive an additional $75 in CTC benefits. In addition, the       tax plan bills adds a new requirement--providing a Social       Security Number for each child claimed for the refundable       portion of the CTC--which could exclude a significant number       of children in immigrant families. This is not an approach       targeted to help families striving to make ends meet, and       does nothing to address the high cost of child care with       which so many working families struggle every day.        The Senate tax bill also takes away other tax benefits that       ordinary families rely on. Even though the Senate tax bill       proposes increasing the CTC (and doubling the standard       deduction), the bill also proposes eliminating personal and       dependency exemptions, eliminating the deduction for state       and local taxes, and eliminating deductions for some       employment-related expenses. This would leave many families       worse off. And the Senate bill makes all of the tax benefits       for families temporary, expiring at the end of 2025, even       though the proposed corporate tax cuts are all permanent.        There is a better way to help families and children and to       build a strong economy now and in the future. Instead of       these ill-conceived tax cuts, Congress can help families       through the tax code by enacting the Child and Dependent Care       Tax Credit Enhancement Act of 2017, and ensure that all       children and families who need it get high quality child care       and early education by enacting the Child Care for Working       Families Act.

That is just one brief assessment of the impact of this  legislation on children, but I think that should be a question we ask  of every major piece of legislation.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr. President, I want to say to the senior Senator from  Oregon, as the ranking member of the committee, he will remember, as I  do, that in the course of that so-called markup, which is a fancy  Washington word for having some debates and offering amendments, there  was no hearing--no hearing for days, and there has still been no  hearing on the Senate bill passed out of the Finance Committee and the  new version of the bill that we will see right now. So, in the course  of that discussion, there were no hearings.   It would have been helpful to us and to the American people if we had  the major organizations come in before the Finance Committee and give  us testimony about the impact on children--organizations that have  spent decades advocating on behalf of children, doing public policy  research as it relates to children, but we never heard that because  there were no hearings, not a single hearing on the bill. There was  discussion, and there were questions for some tax policy experts, but  nothing in the way of hearings that could probe very deeply on what  happens to kids.   I think the American people would like to know more about what will  happen with the child tax credit, for example. There has been a lot of  talk on the Republican side about the child tax credit; they are  allegedly making it better. Well, the Senate Republican plan does  increase the maximum tax credit for children from $1,000 to $2,000 per  child. That sounds pretty good so far, right--$1,000 to $2,000. But  because the bill limits refundability, a mom working full-time at  minimum wage will see only an additional $75 in the child tax credit,  while a married couple earning $500,000 would become newly eligible for  the maximum $2,000-per-child credit.   According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 10 million  children--10 million--live in families who would get $6.25 or less per  month in the additional child tax credit in this bill. So there is not  much improvement in the child tax credit on maybe the only tax reform  bill that this body will consider for the next 30 years. Let's say it  is only 10 years. Wouldn't it be nice to have some testimony from  experts across this country who live and breathe the work of being  advocates for children, who study every bill to determine whether it  impacts on children. Wouldn't it be nice to have their testimony maybe  on the child tax credit, maybe just on the child and dependent care tax  credit, which is the only tax provision in law right now that helps  people pay for childcare.   Ask any family: What is your No. 1 concern, other than making ends  meet and maybe paying for higher education? Other than a few priorities  like that, their No. 1 concern is how to pay for childcare, but there  is no testimony on that issue that relates to the bill. There is no  testimony at all because there were no hearings on the bill. How can  you have a child impact statement, how can you even generalize about it  without a hearing?   Of course, we need more than generalizations. We need specifics. So I  think we have to ask those questions and be focused on children in a  very specific way.   Here is the last thing I will say. This opportunity to come together  in a bipartisan fashion, which has not happened in this case--but we  have the opportunity, and the majority could have taken a different  path. They could have said to us months ago: Let's have a bipartisan  process. Let's not move to a pathway that requires only 51 votes. Let's  have a real bipartisan process on tax reform as they did in the mid- 1980s, resulting in the 1986 bill. They could have said: Do you know  what? We have a bipartisan concern about children. We like the child  tax credit. We like the child independent care tax credit.  [[Page S7672]]  We like the earned-income tax credit. All of those are good policies.  We want to make them better. We want to have a bipartisan effort to  infuse all of those policies with even more funding, more help to make  them more robust for our children, but that never happened.   Once again, because of what the majority did, the pathway they  selected to passing their bill with only Republican votes--and that was  their choice--we will have a tax bill that will not have a child impact  statement, will not have hearings about the impact on children and  families, will not have any of that. Once again, we will prove that  Washington, DC, never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity,  especially as it relates to children and families. That is particularly  insulting to the American people and regrettable because we have a  moment here where we are trying to do tax reform and because it is not  bipartisan, because there were no hearings on the bill, the impact on  children will never ever be fully assessed. That is not just a tragedy,  but that is a real insult to our families and to our children.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for  focusing on the issue of wages because that was the promise--right?-- that if you give corporations a tax cut of more than $1.3 trillion-- with a ``t''--all of a sudden, you are going to see wages go up, and  workers are going to do a lot better. We know that hasn't happened in  recent history. We will see if the Republican argument is correct.   I want to put a few facts on the record in light of the debate this  afternoon. Many people in both parties have been referring to the  documents of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the JCT. I am looking at  one of the documents right now to go through some data. This is dated  November 27. It is D-17-54 for the Joint Committee on Taxation. Here is  some basic data.   The Joint Committee on Taxation, which is, of course, Congress's  official scorekeeper, finds that in 2019--right away, early in the  implementation of the bill, if this bill is to pass and if the version  we just received is to pass--the Senate plan increases taxes on nearly  13 million families earning under $200,000 a year. That is what the  document tells us.   That is the under-$200,000 category and 13 million families just in  2019. If you break it down further in terms of folks making between,  say, $50,000 and $75,000 and then $75,000 and $100,000, almost 20  percent of Americans earning between $50,000 and $75,000 a year will  see a tax increase or a tax cut of less than $100. That works out to be  about $9 a month. Those individuals will have that tax consequence in  2019. So between $50,000 and $75,000 will see either a tax increase or  a tax cut of $100 or less.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.    Then you take the category of $75,000 to $100,000, and  almost 17 percent of Americans in that income category will see a tax  cut of less than $9 a month.   In the grand total between $50,000 and $100,000, 7.7 million  Americans will either see a tax increase or a tax cut of $100 or less.  I don't call that tax cuts for the middle class.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rachel  McKinnon of my staff be granted floor privileges for the duration of  the 115th Congress.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
