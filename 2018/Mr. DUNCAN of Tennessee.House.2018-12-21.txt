 Mr. Speaker, too many of our leaders today  seem to want to be modern-day Winston Churchills and think of  themselves as great war leaders. They are far too eager to go to war  and far too willing to stay in a war after it has started. But the  American people do not want permanent, forever wars, and especially do  not need such wars.   I salute President Trump's decision to bring our troops home from  Syria. With a $21 trillion national debt, we simply cannot afford to be  the policeman of the world.   Our very unnecessary wars in the Middle East have now cost us several  trillion dollars that we have had to borrow and have resulted in the  deaths or horrible injuries to thousands of young Americans and many  more thousands of innocent women and children. They have created more  enemies for our country around the world.   The Bible tells us in both the Old Testament and New to ``seek peace  and pursue it.''                            ____________________
