 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Energy  and Commerce Committee for his dynamic leadership.    Let me indicate that I stand here today in the midst of a  catastrophic pandemic of COVID-19 in the State of Texas and in my  congressional district in Houston and Harris County. Over the last  couple of days, we have had upwards of 900 cases.   There are 2.5 million cases over the Nation and growing, with 126,000  who have died. In the last 3 days of last week, there were 45,000 new  cases. Most of them were in Texas, California, and Arizona.   That is why I am absolutely baffled and saddened by the fact that  this administration would go to the Supreme Court to cut off, deny,  extinguish, put  [[Page H2621]]  in harm's way Americans who need health insurance and who have  preexisting conditions.   This is legislation that is a lifeline. We are saving lives.   A family of four earning $40,000 would save nearly $1,600. They may  have a COVID patient in their family. A 60-year-old earning $57,000  would save $8,000.   It takes into account people who are unemployed by replacing  insurance that they have lost.   It takes into account the great need for drug price negotiation under  the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, something that we have  all been fighting for, for a very long time. Why can't we negotiate  drug prices just like they do in Medicare?   I am pleased that this legislation protects vulnerable populations  from losing health coverage by ensuring that Medicaid and CHIP  beneficiaries receive a full 12 months of coverage once enrolled,  protecting them from interruption due to fluctuations in their income  throughout the year. That has happened to a lot of hardworking parents.   In addition, it improves Medicaid beneficiaries' access to primary  care. And, yes, for those States that did not do the right thing, it  encourages Medicaid expansion. It gets rid of junk policies.   Madam Speaker, let us vote for this bill because it stops the  devastation.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of this body and an original  cosponsor of the legislation, I rise in strong and enthusiastic support  of H.R. 1425, the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement  Act,'' which expands tax credits to lower Americans' Marketplace health  insurance premiums and allow more middle-class individuals and families  to qualify for subsidies and know the peace of mind that comes with  access to affordable, high quality health care.   This legislation is especially needed in these dark and troubling  times when the COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed the lives of more  than 128,000 Americans and over 40 million have lost their jobs because  of the Administration's catastrophic response to the crisis.   Specifically, Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 1425 because under this  legislation:   1. A family of four earning $40,000 would save nearly $1,600 in  premiums each year.   2. A 64-year-old earning $57,420 would save more than $8,700 in  premiums each year.   3. A single adult with income of $31,900 would see premiums cut in  half.   4. An adult earning $19,140 would see premiums cut to zero, saving  $800 dollars a year.   Additionally, the legislation ensures that families who do not have  an offer of affordable family coverage from an employer can qualify for  subsidies in the Marketplaces and it provides funding for reinsurance  initiatives to further lower premiums, deductibles, and other out-of- pocket costs.   Importantly, included in the legislation is the drug price  negotiation mechanism from H.R. 3, the transformational Elijah E.  Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, (H.R. 3), which delivers immense  savings to taxpayers, employers, workers and patients by preventing  Americans from having to pay so much more for our medicines than  pharmaceutical companies charge for the same drugs overseas.   Madam Speaker, this legislation strongly encourages Medicaid  expansion to hold-out states like my home state of Texas to reconsider  by renewing the ACA's original expanded federal matching for states  that adopt the Medicaid expansion and progressively reducing  administrative FMAP for those who continue to refuse.   Currently, nearly 5 million Americans have been cruelly excluded from  coverage because states have refused to expand Medicaid.   Madam Speaker, this legislation provides necessary funding for  critical federal and state efforts to increase health coverage  enrollment, educate consumers of their health care rights, and help  individuals navigate the health insurance system.   And it delivers funding for states who want to establish their own  statebased Marketplaces.   Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the racial and  ethnic inequalities and disparities in our health care delivery system.   That is why I am pleased that the legislation before us protects  vulnerable populations from losing health coverage by ensuring that  Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries receive a full 12 months of coverage  once enrolled, protecting them from interruptions due to fluctuations  in their income throughout the year.   And it improves Medicaid beneficiaries' access to primary care  physicians, by reauthorizing the ACA's increased payments to primary  care physicians who treat Medicaid recipients.   Also, very important is that the legislation addresses the maternal  mortality epidemic by requiring states to extend Medicaid or CHIP  coverage to new mothers for 1-year post-partum.   Finally, Madam Speaker, H.R. 1425 cracks down on junk plans &  strengthens protections for people with pre-existing conditions and  reverses the Trump Administration's expansion of junk health insurance  plans that do not provide coverage for essential medical treatments and  drugs, and that are allowed to discriminate against people with  preexisting medical conditions.   And it curtails the Trump Administration's pernicious practice of  giving states waivers to undermine protections for people with pre- existing conditions and weaken standards for essential health benefits.   Madam Speaker, to stroll down memory lane for those of us who  remember how things were before the enactment of the Affordable Care  Act, dozens of our committees, including the Judiciary Committee, heard  the pain of people whose family members had died because they had no  access to healthcare and/ or they had junk policies.   Access to affordable, high quality health insurance because of the  ACA was a game changer or persons with preexisting conditions like  Sickle Cell anemia, triple negative breast cancer, and diabetes which  plague communities like the ones I represent.   As a member of Congress who voted against each of the dozens of  Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I know first-hand  how important and critical access to affordable, high quality,  accessible health care available to everyone, including those with pre- existing conditions, to the well-being of American families.   Because of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the national  uninsured rate has been slashed from 14.8 in 2012 to 8.8 percent in  2018.   Texas has long led the nation in rate of uninsured so the comparable  rates are 24.6 and 15 percent, respectively.   Madam Speaker, I distinctly recall a candidate for the highest public  office in the land saying ``Obamacare is a disaster'' and appealing for  voters to support him with this question: ``What have you got to  lose?''   The question deserves a response so I hope that person, who occupies  the Oval Office, is listening to my answer.   The Affordable Care Act, or ``Obamacare,'' has been an unmitigated  success to the more than 20 million Americans who for the first time  now have the security and peace of mind that comes with affordable,  accessible, high quality health care.   Madam Speaker, Tip O'Neill used to say that ``all politics is local''  so let me share with you how Obamacare has dramatically changed lives  for the better for the people in my home state of Texas.   1.874 million Texans gained coverage since the ACA was implemented  but could lose their coverage if the ACA is entirely or partially  repealed or invalidated.   508,000 kids in Texas who have gained coverage since the ACA was  implemented are also at risk of having their coverage rolled back.   205,000 young adult Texans who were able to stay on a parent's health  insurance plan thanks to the ACA now stand to lose coverage if the ACA  is struck down, eliminating the requirement that insurers allow  children to stay on their parents' plans until age 26.   646,415 Texans who received cost-sharing reductions to lower out-of- pocket costs such as deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance but are now  at risk of having healthcare become unaffordable if the Trump  Administration has its way in the Supreme Court.   10.28 million Texans who now have private health insurance that  covers preventive services without any co-pays, coinsurance, or  deductibles stand to lose this access if the provisions in the ACA  requiring health insurers to cover important preventive services  without cost-sharing is stricken.   913,177 individuals Texans who received financial assistance to  purchase Marketplace coverage in 2016, averaging $271 per individual,  are at risk of having coverage become unaffordable if the ACA is not  protected.   Madam Speaker, millions more Texans could have insurance if all  states adopted the ACA's Medicaid expansion.   Women in Texas who can now purchase insurance for the same price as  men are at risk of being charged more for insurance if the ACA's ban on  gender rating in the individual and small group markets is invalidated.   Before the ACA, women paid up to 56 percent more than men for their  health insurance.   Roughly 4.5 million Texans who have pre-existing health conditions  are at risk of having their coverage rescinded, being denied coverage,  or being charged significantly more for coverage if the ACA's ban on  preexisting conditions is struck down.  [[Page H2622]]    346,750 Texas seniors who have saved an average of $1,057 each as a  result of closing the Medicare prescription drug ``donut hole'' gap in  coverage stand to lose this critical help going forward.   1.75 million Texas seniors who have received free preventive care  services thanks to ACA provisions requiring coverage of annual wellness  visits and eliminating cost-sharing for many recommended preventive  services covered by Medicare Part B, such as cancer screenings, are at  risk of losing access to these services if the ACA is not protected.   The Affordable Care Act works and has made a life-affirming  difference in the lives of millions of Americans, in Texas and across  the country.   This is what happens when a visionary president cares enough to work  with a committed and empathetic Congress to address the real issues  facing the American people. The Republicans have NO vision whether it  is for Obamacare (ACA) or Medicare for all--they are denying health  coverage to the most vulnerable American families and Americans with  pre-existing conditions. Vote for this bill.   You want to know why the American people have Obamacare?   It is because Obama cared.   The same cannot be said about this Republican president and  congressional Republicans who have made careers of attacking and  undermining the Affordable Care Act's protections and benefits for the  American people.   I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 1425 and send a powerful message  to the President and the American people that this House will not stand  idly by as this Administration tries to take away health care from more  than 130 million persons.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Homeland Security, and Budget Committees, I rise in strong and  enthusiastic support of H.R. 7301, the ``Emergency Housing Protections  and Relief Act of 2020,'' which addresses the needs of renters and  homeowners who have been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic  through targeted relief measures.   In the month of June alone, 32 percent of renters were unable to  fully pay their rent while 20 percent of renters were unable to make  any rent payment at all.   According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the number of  homeowners in forbearance reached 4.2 million as of June 14, 2020.  [[Page H2661]]    The coronavirus pandemic has created a dire housing crisis that must  be addressed immediately.   As more and more states across the country face a second wave of the  coronavirus outbreak, it is imperative that we extend the eviction  moratorium and other housing protections in an effort to prevent an  increase in homelessness.   Texas is one of those states.   In the state alone, there are nearly 150,000 cases of coronavirus  with over 2,300 deaths.   As the number of cases continue to rise dramatically, we must  encourage tighter restrictions to slow the spread of the disease.   Yet, many people fear that abiding by tighter restrictions means a  continued loss of income, which could then result in an inability to  make a housing payment and consequently cause an eviction.   In fact, in Houston, Texas, eviction proceedings resumed as early as  May 19, 2020.   Without an intervention from the Federal Government, we will soon see  a dramatic spike in evictions and rates of homelessness.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here in support of H.R. 7301 because it not only  protects renters, but it also provides targeted solutions that help  landlords, homeowners, and people experiencing homelessness during this  pandemic.   For example, it extends the eviction moratorium to March 27, 2021,  and expands it to protect all renters.   It also provides low cost loans for landlords through the Federal  Reserve and expands forbearance protections for all landlords.   Under H.R. 7301, $75 billion is invested in a Homeowner Assistance  Fund that provides direct assistance to those who are struggling to pay  their mortgage, property taxes, property insurance, and other housing- related costs.   The bill also allocates $11.5 billion for homeless assistance grants  that ensure people who experiencing homelessness are able to follow  social distancing guidance and have access to necessary services.   Mr. Speaker, the coronavirus epidemic has irrevocably changed the  world.   It has affected every aspect of our lives, and, right now, it is  affecting millions of Americans who are without an income and are  terrified that they might not have a roof over their heads tomorrow.   And so, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in  favor of H.R. 7301 and provide much-needed housing protections to those  who have been severely impacted by the pandemic.    Mr. Speaker, I stand here on the floor of the House  wearing my mask in order to indicate not only to my own hometown,  Houston, Texas, Harris County, and the State of Texas, but also to the  Nation, that we are in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic that is killing  Americans, upwards of numbers that we have never seen.   We now are at 500,000 dead worldwide and 10 million cases. In the  United States, we have 2.5 million cases and now upwards of 125,000 to  126,000 dead.   It is imperative that we take this seriously and that this becomes  not partisan, not bipartisan, but with no partisanship whatsoever.   It is important to wear your mask, to clean your hands, to have  social distance, no matter who you are. And it is imperative that we  test, test, test.   I opened the first testing site on March 19. I have opened 13 since.  I will be leaving here to go home to open more testing sites.   Houstonians and Harris Countians are clamoring for tests. Let the  government not stop testing. Test, test, test. We have to save lives.   Wear your mask to save lives.                            ____________________
