 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.   I am a little bit confused, though, because it wasn't before 2002  when our previous Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Governor  Ralph Northam, said on a radio show that if a baby was born alive that  the baby would be made comfortable, that then a conversation would  ensue between the doctor and the mother about whether or not and how to  treat that baby; essentially saying, if you want to go ahead and kill  your baby after it is born, go right ahead.   That type of attitude persists, continues. If there are laws that  exist to prevent it--the Governor was not aware of them, I am not aware  of them--that would apply in that situation.   That is why this legislation is so important, because contrary to  House Democrats and the Biden administration, the American people  overwhelmingly believe that babies who are born alive should be  protected, that a baby born alive, even after an attempted abortion,  should be afforded the same constitutional protections as every other  American.   I am proud to support the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act, which would require appropriate medical care for children who  survive abortion procedures. It imposes strong criminal penalties for  the failure to provide such care.   If a doctor like our former Governor, Dr. Northam, was engaging in  the activities that he spoke about on that radio show, he would be  subject to those same criminal penalties.   Protecting living and breathing babies outside the womb should not be  a partisan issue, it should be one around which we all should unite.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.
