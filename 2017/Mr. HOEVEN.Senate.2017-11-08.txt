 Mr. President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity  to speak today on the floor of the Senate after my esteemed colleague  from the State of Georgia. My colleague is the chairman of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I just want to express my appreciation  for his commitment and his work on behalf of all of our great veterans.   Like him, I rise today to speak in tribute to our veterans and men  and women in uniform and all that they do for us.   This weekend at events across the country, we will pay tribute to the  fine men and women who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces. Every  day--but especially on Veterans Day--we honor these soldiers who have  left the comforts of home and family to defend our freedoms and fight  for our way of life.   Our freedoms have been secured by the sweat and sacrifice of  courageous men and women who, throughout our history, have bravely done  what was needed to protect our great Nation. We also recognize that  those who serve do not serve alone. We appreciate, too, the sacrifices  of the families and the loved ones who have supported our veterans in  their service.   This Veterans Day, we will honor military members from our ``greatest  generation'' to those men and women fighting in the War on Terror  today. These Americans understand best the words of President Ronald  Reagan when he said:         Freedom is never more than one generation away from       extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the       bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on       for them to do the same.    These men and women who have fought for and protected our country  have given so much, and we cannot do enough to thank them, whether they  returned from Active military duty 7 days ago or seven decades ago.   Although we can never repay our debt of gratitude, one of the most  tangible ways we recognize our veterans' service is by providing these  men and women with quality healthcare and support services, including  education and work opportunities. With that debt in mind, let me  briefly outline some initiatives that we have been working on to  provide for our veterans. Congress has passed significant veterans  bills this year, including legislation that holds the VA accountable  and ensures that VA employees are putting our veterans first and  legislation that updates and modernizes the VA's benefit claims and  appeals process, reducing wait times for our veterans.   Additionally, one of my top priorities is ensuring that our veterans  have access to healthcare options closer to their homes and their  families.   This includes improving veterans' access to services under the  Veterans Choice Program and building on the success of the Veterans  Care Coordination Initiative at the Fargo VA Medical Center in my home  State. This effort has decreased the wait time for scheduling an  appointment under Veterans Choice from 24 days a year ago to 5 or 6  days at present. This initiative can serve as a model to help address  delays in scheduling appointments through the Veterans Choice Program  across the Nation.   We invited Secretary Shulkin, from North Dakota, to see this  firsthand, and our Veterans Care Coordination Initiative has since been  expanded to  [[Page S7088]]  the VA facility in Helena, MT, as well. We believe it will be expanded  to other locations across the country.   We also passed an extension of the Veterans Choice Program earlier  this year and secured $2.1 billion in additional funding for the  program. This gives us time to work with the VA on the next phase of  the program. In addition to Veterans Choice, we are working to improve  local access to long-term care for our veterans.   We secured a commitment from Secretary Shulkin to work with us on the  Veterans Access to Long Term Care and Health Services Act. We have now  introduced this legislation in the Senate, and a companion bill has  been introduced in the House of Representatives. The legislation would  remove burdensome redtape that prevents nursing homes and other  healthcare providers from accepting veteran patients. Our bill allows  the VA to enter into provider agreements with qualified healthcare and  extended care facilities, bypassing complex Federal contracting  requirements. This will give veterans more options to access long-term  care services closer to their homes, their families, and to their loved  ones.   In addition, earlier this year, Congress passed--and the President  signed into law--the forever GI bill, which improved and extended  veterans' access to education and workforce opportunities. This is part  of our efforts to ensure that we are supporting our veterans as they  transition back to civilian life and work here at home. These are just  a few examples of our efforts to ensure our veterans have the resources  and the support they have so richly earned. While we cannot say thank  you enough, in this way, we can honor their courage and their  sacrifice.   We honor Veterans Day because we have the greatest veterans in the  world who have committed themselves to protect our Nation, and in so  doing, they have transformed this country into the greatest the world  has ever known. May God continue to bless our veterans and this great  Nation that they have been protecting and make sure we honor the  selfless service of all our men and women in uniform, of all our  veterans, not only on Veterans Day but every day.   I yield the floor.
