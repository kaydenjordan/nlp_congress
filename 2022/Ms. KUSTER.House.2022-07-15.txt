 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Women's  Health Protection Act and to speak for the generation of women who have  lost their freedom to make healthcare decisions for themselves. The  government has no place inserting itself into people's personal  healthcare decisions.   I never expected to be on the floor of the House talking about  miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or fertility treatments, but here we  are.   For many, pregnancy is not an easy path. One in eight pregnancies end  in miscarriage, and 1 in 50 women experience ectopic pregnancies--an  outcome that always leads to pregnancy loss and poses serious risk of  life to the mother.                                time  1015    For countless others, getting pregnant requires costly, exhausting,  and complex procedures such as IVF.   Regardless of the circumstances, reproductive health is private.   Pregnancy can be unpredictable. The government has no place in  deciding what care patients can receive and doctors can administer.  Like all healthcare, decisions surrounding reproductive health should  be between a patient and their doctor.   As an adoption attorney, I worked with hundreds of birth mothers  making the most personal, consequential decisions of their lives, and  not one of those women looked to the government to make that decision  for them.   I support the Women's Health Protection Act, and I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes.''
