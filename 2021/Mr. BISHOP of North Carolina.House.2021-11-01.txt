 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding, and I thank Representative Butterfield for those fine  comments. I agree with him 100 percent.   That bill that Congress passed back in 1956 said this, even as it  recognized the Lumbee: ``Nothing in this act shall make such Indians  eligible for any services performed by the United States for Indians  because of their status as Indians, and none of the statutes of the  United States which affect Indians because of their status as Indians  shall be applicable to the Lumbee Indians.''   My goodness. What an error, what a mistake, and what an injustice.  But that is what the Congress of that time  [[Page H6043]]  said, and it is high time for us to correct that injustice. Therefore,  I am proud to be a cosponsor with Representative Butterfield and  Representative Hudson of this legislation.   The Lumbee have for three centuries been a cohesive and distinct  community of aboriginal origins and durable institutions, especially  schools, living near the Lumber River in Robeson County.   The Lumbee have been called by several names, but it cannot be  disputed that they are the continuously present and vital people shown  on a map drawn in 1725 whose common modern surnames appear on a  document written in 1771: Locklear, Chavis, Dees, Sweat, and Groom.  They are the Lumbee who were living in Long Swamp in the 1730s, the  community now known as Prospect.   I said these words last year when it appeared very favorable that we  were going to pass Lumbee recognition then, and I am going to say it  continuously until we get this done, that this is going to be the year.   I know the Lumbee. I know the Warriors Ball and Lumbee Homecoming,  UNC-Pembroke and Old Main, the Lumbee Cultural Center and the Cozy  Corner. The Lumbee are supremely patriotic Americans, God-fearing and  washed in the blood, devoted to the liberating cause of education and  to civic involvement, proud of their community, and loving and  welcoming to strangers. They are the best of America, and the only  honorable course for the United States Congress is to accord them their  due recognition at long last.   So my thank-you to Representative Butterfield for sponsoring this  legislation. I thank Representative Hudson and Representatives Grijalva  and Westerman for permitting it to come forward--staunch supporters of  the Lumbees' pursuit of justice. I thank Senators Burr and Tillis.  Lumbee recognition took on new life when both North Carolina Senators  began to champion it.   Thanks also to former Representative Mike McIntyre of Robeson County,  who worked for Lumbee recognition for more than a decade. We almost  accomplished passage last year. This is going to be the year.   Madam Speaker, I urge overwhelming support for the Lumbee Recognition  Act.                                time  1630
