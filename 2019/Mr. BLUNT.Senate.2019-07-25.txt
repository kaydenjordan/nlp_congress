 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, those of us who have had a chance over some  time now to work with the former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich,  know that he is a man of ideas and is often thinking well beyond the  moment. I had a chance the other day to read a paper that he prepared  on President Trump's Moon-Mars Development Project, and I want to  borrow heavily from his thinking as I talk about this project today.   It is an important time. We just spent significant time remembering,  appreciating, and looking back at the 50th anniversary of American  astronauts landing on the Moon and returning safely. Fifty years goes  more quickly than you might think.   But for the first time in that 50 years, we are really at a point  where there is a chance that we could cease to be the leading power in  space. We decided we were going to become the leading power in space;  we became the leading power in space; we have been the leading power in  space. But that is  [[Page S5077]]  not necessarily a given, and you can last only so long living on your  past accomplishments.   President Trump, on the Fourth of July, made this comment: ``I want  you to know that we are going to be back on the moon very soon, and  someday soon we will plant an American flag on Mars.''   My guess is that was received with sort of the same amount of  skepticism as President Kennedy's challenge was more than 50 years ago.  There is no question that the Artemis Project that President Trump is  talking about is not the Apollo Project 50 years later. This is no  longer an effort just to go somewhere and get back. We know we can do  that. It is an effort to look at where we might go next and why we  might benefit from that.   In May of 1961, President Kennedy challenged the Congress by saying  we ``should commit [ourselves] to achieving the goal''--talking about  the goal of getting to the Moon--we ``should commit [ourselves] to  achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the  Moon and returning him safely to Earth.''   There was pretty heavy skepticism. I think 58 percent of the American  people polled said they were opposed to doing that. Why would we send  somebody to the Moon and worry about whether we could get them there?  Of course, if we got them there, we would want to get them back. There  was great skepticism.   So a little over a year later at Rice University, President Kennedy  tried again. He said: ``We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and  do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are  hard.''   That is one of his famous quotes. If you look back at President  Kennedy's challenge to the country, you hear it: We are going not  because it is easy, but because it is hard.   He went on to say ``because that goal will serve to organize and  measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is  one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone,  and one we intend to win.''   There is nothing wrong with an America that wants to win. There is  nothing wrong with an America that doesn't want to take second place.  There is nothing wrong with an America that wants to set a standard  that everybody else can hope to achieve.   We had been caught a little flat-footed in the midfifties when the  Russians put a satellite in space--Sputnik. Americans would go out and  see if they could measure when it was passing over because they had put  something up there that appeared to be there perpetually.   Then there was a cosmonaut in space. President Kennedy said that we  don't want to accept anything more than the opportunity to meet big  challenges and show what we can do to test ourselves.   The Vice President of the United States, Vice President Pence, said  at the National Space Council in Huntsville, AL, on March 26 of this  year that ``50 years ago, `one small step for man' became `one giant  leap for mankind.' ''   You really had to be trying to avoid it not to hear that quote last  week as it was being repeated over and over again. The Vice President  said that now it's come time for us to ``make the next `giant leap' and  return American astronauts to the Moon, establish a permanent base  there, and develop the technologies to take American astronauts to Mars  and beyond.''   That's the next ``giant leap.''   You will note here that the direct connection between Moon  development and going to Mars, as the President put it, is there. It is  the reason to go back to the Moon. It is the reason to do what we can  to understand the Moon. Our goal is not just getting to the Moon. Of  course, we have already done that. Our goal is to be there and to do  that in a way that works for us.   John Marburger, President George W. Bush's science adviser, said in  2006: ``The Moon is the closest source of material that lies far up  Earth's gravity well.''   This is the closest place we can go and get material that can be used  with 3D printing and all sorts of things that are possible to construct  on the Moon that weren't possible to construct anywhere in that same  way just a few years ago.    The first phase of science on the Moon would be a lot like exploring  Antarctica. I haven't been to Antarctica. I would like to go sometime.  We don't have people on Antarctica because Antarctica is an easy place  to live; we have people staying all the time on Antarctica to see what  we could learn by being on the continent of Antarctica all the time.  The next phase of the Moon would be like that, with people going to the  Moon, staying on the Moon, and looking at opportunities on the parts of  the Moon where we believe there is ice. I know the formula for this. If  you have ice, you probably have some form of water. If you have water,  lots of things can happen that might not happen otherwise.   This is a project that will inspire others to want to be part of it,  whether it is Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk or Richard Branson or Paul  Allen--who has passed on, but was intrigued by the Moon. They are all  people who have great private resources.   America was founded on a public-private model. Jamestown, Plimouth  Plantation, and the East India Company all had private individuals with  government sponsorship trying to make something happen that wouldn't  happen otherwise. That, I suggest, can happen on the Moon.   In Newt Gingrich's telling of the challenge on the Moon, he repeated  that great story of what happened at Wollman Rink and how it might  relate to what could happen on the Moon if you are not bound by the  normal things that bind a lot of people. Every person thinking about  the Moon-Mars project, according to former Speaker Gingrich, should  look at what Donald Trump did at the Wollman Rink. The Wollman Rink was  a very popular site for ice skating in New York City in 1980 when it  broke down. It totally broke down. The city of New York spent 6 years  and $13 million trying to fix the ice rink. Fortunately, I guess, for  the city of New York and ice skaters who go there, the abandoned ice  rink happened to be within sight of President Trump's apartment. He  kept complaining about the ice rink and the failure of the city to do  anything about the ice rink. Finally, Mayor Koch said to Donald Trump:  Why don't you fix it if you think this is so easily done? And he did.  He fixed the ice rink in 4 months for $2.25 million. I remember the  city had already spent $13 million and failed to fix the ice rink.   The first year after the ice rink was fixed, 225,000 people skated on  the ice rink. One reason the President was able to do that as a private  citizen was that he wasn't bound by the things that bind most people.  He wasn't bound by the things that bind the government. The historic  project to fix the Wollman Rink achieved the goal at 1/5 the cost and  1/18 the time that the city had used and did not get it done, and ice  skaters flourished.   The same kinds of things could happen if we looked beyond the normal  boundaries of what could happen in this project that the President has  talked about.   Remember, on the effort to get to the Moon, President Kennedy turned  that project over to Vice President Johnson and said: You are going to  be in charge of NASA, and you are going to be the point person on the  Moon project. So there is a little history there that may be repeating  itself when, in March this year in Huntsville, AL, the Vice President  outlined the principles we could use to meet the goals that the  President had established for our efforts in space.   Principle No. 1 was to establish a big goal and then stick to it.  Remember, we went to the Moon to start with, not because it was easy,  but because it was hard. Establish a big goal, then stick to it.  ``Failure to achieve our goal to return an American astronaut to the  Moon in the next 5 years is not an option,'' according to the Vice  President.   Principle No. 2, Be prepared to reach outside the traditional  bureaucracy to new, entrepreneurial, private companies if it is  necessary to get the job done. He went on to say:         [W]e're not committed to any one contractor. If our current       contractors can't meet this objective, then we'll find ones       that will. If American industry can provide critical       commercial services without government development, then       we'll buy them.    We will buy into that project and share it with them. If commercial  rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the Moon in the  next 5 years, then commercial rockets will be the way we return to the  Moon.  [[Page S5078]]    Principle No. 3, Be willing to change the bureaucracy rather than  abandon the goal.         [W]e will call on NASA not just to adopt new policies but       to embrace a new mindset. That begins with setting bold goals       and staying on schedule.    A new mindset matters. Failure is not an option. The willingness to  postpone our goal, as President Kennedy said almost 60 years ago, is  not an option.   Principle No. 4, Be determined to change the bureaucracy in  fundamental ways.         NASA must transform itself into a leaner, more accountable,       and more agile organization. If NASA is not currently capable       of landing American astronauts [men and women] on the Moon in       five years, we need to change the organization, not the       mission.    By the way, as for principle No. 5, I know, in the Presiding  Officer's case, it is coming from private business and might be his  most important principle.   Principle No. 5, Urgency must replace complacency.   The hardest thing to achieve in government is just to drive to a  result. The fifth principle that the Vice President set out is exactly  that. It is not just competition against our adversaries; it is,  frankly, competition against our worst enemy--complacency. It is  competition against our own willingness to believe that things aren't  going to happen that clearly can happen.   This is a great goal. It is a step to the Moon and beyond. It is a  step outside our solar system to other solar systems. In our lifetimes,  we may not see much of that, but this is not about our lifetimes; this  is about a step into the future.   I applaud the President and the Vice President for their leadership  here. I look forward to applying those five principles. By the way, I  think almost all of those principles are five principles we could apply  to government every day, and we would have a more effective government  if we would.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today, I stand to recognize the  grand opening of the State Historical Society of Missouri's Center for  Missouri Studies on August 10. The Center for Missouri Studies was  established in 2014, and this new facility will move the State  Historical Society from its home of 100 years to a new, visionary  center meant to connect scholars of varied disciplines, showcase  artwork by renowned Missourians, and provide state-of-the-art space for  educational programming.   The State Historical Society of Missouri was founded in 1898 by the  Missouri Press Association and has been an integral part of the  preservation of Missouri's history ever since. Not only does it support  research at centers in Cape Girardeau, Columbia, Kansas City, Rolla,  St. Louis, and Springfield, it also houses an extensive collection of  manuscripts, newspapers, books, maps, photographs, and art. Thanks to  the efforts of dedicated staff over decades, the public can explore the  records, myths, and culture that comprise the rich history of our  State,   The new Center for Missouri Studies will build upon the State  Historical Society's mission to ``collect, preserve, publish, exhibit,  and make available'' to the public myriad resources and opportunities  to learn. The center will feature a large art gallery, multipurpose and  classroom space, an expanded research center, and modern conservation  lab space. Not only will the public have greater access to historical  archives and artwork, expert scholars will be able to study and examine  the society's extensive collections in a space designed to facilitate  collaboration.   The commitment of the State Historical Society of Missouri to  preserve our history as we look forward to the beginning of a third  century in our State is to be commended. The potential for the public  to enjoy our State's unique past with greater ease cannot be  undervalued. The dedication of the State Historical Society to drive  this project to completion serves as an example to others. I extend my  sincere thanks for all they do. Congratulations to Executive Director  Gary Kremer and all State Historical Society of Missouri staff on this  important occasion.                            ____________________
