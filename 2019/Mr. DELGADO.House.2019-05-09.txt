 Madam Speaker, I rise today because I have heard from  too many parents and siblings in upstate New York who have lost a loved  one to overdose from opioids.   I rise because overdose fatalities are the leading cause of death for  Americans under 50.   I rise because addressing the opioid crisis means understanding and  treating addiction. We must see addiction for what it is: not a  weakness, but a disease that requires treatment.   I am proud to have introduced legislation to address this crisis,  H.R. 2482, the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act. This bipartisan  bill would end a redundancy in Federal law that restricts health  providers from prescribing buprenorphine, a proven treatment for  addiction.   To tackle this crisis, we must go beyond taking the needed steps of  holding Big Pharma accountable and creating more drug courts. We must  treat the addiction.   Madam Speaker, we cannot let the wrongheaded stigmatization of  addiction undermine our capacity or our commitment to treating it.   Let's pass H.R. 2482.                            ____________________
