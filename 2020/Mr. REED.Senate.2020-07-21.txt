 Madam President, I rise today in support of the Schatz  amendment. The Schatz amendment would make changes to one of the  Defense Department's surplus property programs, known as the 1033  Program, which allows the Defense Department to disperse excess  military equipment to Federal, State, and local law enforcement  agencies.   The 1033 Program has provided the Defense Department a way to reuse  taxpayer-funded equipment it no longer needs by providing it to law  enforcement agencies. This, in turn, saves State and local governments  from having to buy new equipment. This program is almost 25 years old,  and it has been the subject of continued scrutiny and modifications.   I would first like to review what is in place. DOD requires that all  requests for equipment from law enforcement agencies include a  justification of how the property will be used. This justification is a  key factor in determining if a requisition is to be approved.   Next, according to the Defense Department, 92 percent of the  equipment transferred during fiscal year 2019 was in the category of  uncontrolled property--things like office equipment, first aid kits,  hand tools, computers, and digital cameras. After 1 year from transfer,  items in this category become the property of the law enforcement  agency and are no longer subject to annual inventory requirements. The  rest of the property transferred under the 1033 Program is considered  controlled property and is given to law enforcement agencies on a  conditional or ``loan'' basis. This includes things like small arms,  demilitarized vehicles, and night vision equipment.   Typically, small arms weapons only make up about 5 percent of the  property transferred in the 1033 Program. When a law enforcement agency  no longer wants or needs this controlled property, it must be returned  to the Department of Defense.   To ensure that this program is run responsibly and effectively, the  Government Accountability Office has provided several reviews of this  program that have been helpful in past years to tighten the  requirements on participants in the 1033 Program. The committee report  accompanying the bill before us requires another GAO review of DOD's  disposal of military vehicles, which could inform additional reforms  when we receive the results of the review.   I also know that the Defense Logistics Agency requires annual audits  of participating agencies to ensure they are accountable for the  equipment they have received. If an agency is delinquent or doesn't  meet the requirements, then they can be suspended or terminated from  the 1033 Program.   While this Program is an effective way of reusing equipment that  taxpayers have already paid for, we continually need to ensure that our  civilian law enforcement agencies do not end up looking like or acting  like our military when they patrol the streets. Given some of the  incidents that have occurred in recent months, I believe that  additional modifications are necessary.   The Schatz amendment adds some reasonable requirements and  limitations to the 1033 Program. For one thing, it would codify the  prohibition of certain items from being transferred under the 1033  Program, things like certain kinds of ammunition, grenades, and drones.  This amendment would also prohibit the use of transferred equipment  against First Amendment-protected activities, such as the right to  peaceably assemble and to petition the government for redress of  grievances.   I know that the Defense Department has some concerns about how this  amendment would be implemented, but I believe these concerns can be  addressed during conference with the House. I believe it is important  and timely to make such changes to the 1033 Program today.   I support the Schatz amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of it.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to express my support for the  Cornyn amendment, which would, among other things, authorize a Federal  grant program to enable the leading global chip companies to  manufacture in the United States.   I want to commend a bipartisan group of Senators who have worked so  hard on this issue: Senators Cotton, Cornyn, Schumer, and Warner. The  semiconductor manufacturing story is similar to many other industries  in America. The United States invented the technology and still leads  in research and development, but the manufacture of the product itself  has steadily migrated to Asia.   Over time, not just the manufacturing expertise and capacity are lost  but also the science and engineering necessary to invent the next  generation of products. While this has happened to too many industries,  the impact is particularly acute in electronics because electronics  power the modern economy, fueling all the critical technologies on  which our future prosperity depend.   Asian nations--and, in particular, China, Taiwan, and South Korea-- have for decades pursued aggressive industrial policies to gain control  of the electronics industry. These policies directed large subsidies  and protections for fledgling companies that have now become global  giants.   While South Korea is an ally, and Taiwan is a partner, the plants in  those countries that make the world's most advanced logic and memory  semiconductors are highly vulnerable to disruption or destruction by  China and/or North Korea. In a confrontation in this region, China  could threaten to bring the western economy to its knees by halting the  flow of semiconductors.   China itself is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new  semiconductor fabrication plants in a relentless bid to dominate this  industry. In 10 years, Chinese companies may dominate the production of  the chips that power 5G wireless networks, artificial intelligence,  cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and autonomous vehicles.   In America, there is one remaining company that is globally  competitive in logic chips--Intel Corporation--but Intel is at least a  generation behind its main competitors and historically has designed  and produced chips only for its own product line. Its major global  competitors--the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or  TSMC, and Samsung--provide manufacturing services for chips designed by  other companies. These are typically so-called fabless chips companies,  and they include the names of some of our most famous tech companies:  Qualcomm, Xilinx, Nvidia, and Microsoft. TSMC and Samsung, together,  have close to a monopoly on the manufacturing of leading-edge  semiconductors for fabless chip companies.   Recently, there was the good news that Intel announced in a letter to  the Defense Department its intent to compete with its Asian rivals in  manufacturing chips designed by fabless companies. Again, these are  companies that would design the chips and the electronic processor but  would not produce the chips. That would be left to these other major  companies.   In addition, TSMC and the administration announced an agreement to  bring TSMC to America to produce leading edge chips. It is suspected  that Samsung can be persuaded to set up a major manufacturing facility  in the United States, as well.   The Defense Department has two major studies nearing completion, one  by the Defense Science Board and one conducted in partnership with  industry by the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Ellen Lord. They are  both expected to plead for urgent and large-scale action to revive U.S.  semiconductor manufacturing, but none of this is going to happen  without funding and without a plan.   We did not lose chip manufacturing to Asia simply due to cheap labor,  especially in the chip industry, which is not manpower intensive. We  lost this market sector because the investments required are massive  and constant and because foreign governments heavily subsidize them.   We all prefer to let markets govern where competition is fair and  mutually beneficial, but relentless actions by foreign governments to  dominate specific industries regardless of economics and where they  succeed, like in the semiconductor industry, must be countered by U.S.  government action because of the threat to our national security and  prosperity.   While this amendment does not include funding authorizations, it is  an important first step. This amendment will serve notice that the U.S.  Senate recognizes this very serious issue and intends to take  corrective action.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to commit to  finding funding solutions. Our economic well-being and our national  security depend upon it.   Madam President, I would now also like to speak about Senator  Shaheen's amendment, which will be considered this afternoon, with your  permission.   I rise in support of Senator Shaheen's amendment to increase fiscal  year 2021 funding by $5 million for the ongoing CDC human health study  on the effects of PFAS substances in drinking water sources.   As most of you are aware, PFOS and PFOA are chemicals that are very  effective for extinguishing fires and have been used in firefighting  foam in the Defense Department since the 1970s. Unfortunately, the  fluorine bonds never break, and environmental problems are presented,  which are very dangerous to people.   The lifetime health advisory for PFAS is the equivalent of one grain  of sand in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. The WHO found that these  chemicals are likely carcinogenic, especially in children and pregnant  women, and that they can decrease the effectiveness of vaccines, and  they are known to cause cancer in animals.   PFAS has been found in the drinking water at over 650 military  installations in almost every State in the United States and overseas.  Thousands of Americans in many States across the United States have  already found elevated levels of PFAS in their blood.   Beginning with the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization  Act, the Department of Defense has been authorized to transfer funds to  the CDC for a human health study on the effects of all PFAS substances  in drinking water sources for people. Specifically, it seeks to  determine the exact types of cancers and other toxic effects drinking  water with PFAS has on human beings.   For example, years ago, the CDC determined precisely how much lead  can be ingested before cognitive impacts can occur in children. They  can and should do the same thing with respect to PFAS.   The study should take 7 years to complete. So this fiscal year 2021  NDAA will fund year 4.   The CDC study received $7 million in fiscal year 2018, $10 million in  fiscal year 2019, $10 million in fiscal year 2020, and there is $10  million currently in the fiscal year 2021 NDAA amendment. Senator  Shaheen's amendment would increase it to $15 million. It would  accelerate our ability to find these critical answers that affect the  health and safety of the American people and are particularly  associated with military bases all across the country, which means in  every one of our States.   We all recognize the urgent need for the CDC to better understand the  toxic effects of PFAS chemicals on the human body, and supporting this  amendment will accomplish just that.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Once again, I commend Senator Shaheen for her work in developing this  amendment with respect to PFAS, and I commend Senator Cornyn and his  colleagues for working very, very diligently and perceptively about  building up our industrial base in order to produce microchips so we  will be the leader in the world and not the follower.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S4325]]     Mr. President, today, along with Senator Murkowski, we are  introducing legislation to provide relief to all Federal student loan  borrowers during this public health and economic crisis. The bipartisan  Student Loan Fairness Act, which is also cosponsored by Senators  Murkowski, Jones, and Tillis, will correct an inequity in the CARES Act  that left out millions of Federal student loan borrowers from benefits  to ease the burden of repayment as we continue to fight COVID-19.   The CARES Act benefits are restricted to borrowers of student loans  that are held by the Federal government. This leaves out the borrowers  whose Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) are still held by  commercial and State agency lenders, and those with Perkins Loans that  are administered by institutions of higher education. In fact, nearly 6  million borrowers were left out under the FFEL Program and another 1.9  million under the Perkins Loan Program. This disparate treatment by  loan type is as confusing as it is unfair.   In April, a broad group of more than two dozen organizations  representing educators, borrower advocates, veterans, lenders, guaranty  agencies, and student loan servicers implored Congress to remedy this  inequity. They wrote, ``A Federal loan borrower--regardless of the  origination of that loan, be it Part B, D, E, commercial, or  government-held--should receive equal, immediate, and critical support  in this unprecedented time . . . Already, borrowers are confused as to  why their Federal loans are treated differently than others.''   The Student Loan Fairness Act will extend the CARES Act relief to  these borrowers by covering the cost of interest and suspending monthly  payments for the period of March 13 through September 30, 2020, and  suspending all involuntary collection, such as administrative wage  garnishment or offsets from tax refunds, for this period.   This legislation is one component of what should be a comprehensive  package of student loan debt relief. As the crisis continues, we should  extend the repayment relief until health and economic conditions  improve sufficiently for borrowers to be able to begin repayment.  Additionally, we should forgive at least $10,000 of debt for each  student loan borrower to help speed the recovery and reduce the drag of  the roughly $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt on economic  prospects for over 40 million Americans. Going forward, we must reduce  the need for student loan borrowing by expanding need-based grants,  such as the Pell Grant, and ensuring that states and institutions do  their part to lower the cost to students and families.   We should work together to build on the important steps Congress took  to provide relief to student loan borrowers in the CARES Act. However,  we need to ensure that all Federal student loan borrowers have access  to this relief. I hope that my colleagues will join us in cosponsoring  the Student Loan Fairness Act and pushing for its inclusion in the next  COVID-19 relief package.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. LOEFFLER (for herself, Mrs. Blackburn, and Mr. Cotton):   S. 4238.
