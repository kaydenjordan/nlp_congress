 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which would require private student lenders to discharge private  student loan debt for people who become totally or permanently  disabled.   This amendment was inspired by a constituent who came to our office  in need. Like many young Americans, my constituent pursued an education  and chose to use private loans to help fund her college costs. She was  also fully prepared to repay her loans, but tragically she became  permanently and totally disabled.   Because of her permanent disability, her mother must now take care of  her for life, and not only is the mother her caretaker, she is also the  cosigner obligated to carry and pay for this debilitating debt.                                time  2215    Though the student's particular lender allowed her debt to be  discharged, her mother, who cosigned the loan, was not dismissed from  that responsibility. Though this reality may be foreign to many of us,  for those it does affect, it will change their lives forever.   That is why this amendment would right a wrong and bring parity  between protections for private student loan borrowers and Federal  student loan borrowers.   Currently, private student lenders are not required to discharge the  obligation of a borrower who becomes permanently disabled, only in the  case of death. However, for Federal student loans in the case of  permanent disability or death, loans are discharged.   In addition, Federal student loans do not require cosigners.   Specifically, my amendment amends the Truth in Lending Act to require  discharge of private student loans in the case of permanent or total  disability of the borrower; require the discharge of cosigners in the  case of the borrower's permanent or total disability; require private  lenders to discharge a borrower's obligation when they are notified  that the Federal Government has discharged the Federal student loans of  the borrower.   As we debate the National Defense Authorization Act, it is important  to highlight that our servicemembers are disproportionately using  private student loans. And these veterans who use private student loans  disproportionately use them to attend for-profit universities or  institutions. In some instances, veterans leave with nearly double the  amount of debt compared to  [[Page H4811]]  their counterparts who use Federal veterans' education benefits.   Our veterans, our servicemembers, along with all of our constituents,  deserve to be protected in the case of unexpected hardship.   I am pleased that in August, the Biden administration announced it  would automatically cancel Federal student loan debt through the Total  and Permanent Disability Discharge program. The TPD Discharge program  provides loan discharge for the borrower and the cosigner should the  borrower become totally and permanently disabled.   This is a first step in providing 323,000 Federal student loan  borrowers with disabilities the relief they are entitled to under the  law.   It is our responsibility to codify and extend this same needed  support to our private student loan borrowers and their families  affected with these tragedies.   I pray no one go through what my constituents have gone through.   We must move this commonsense and important amendment forward, and I  urge all members to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for wanting to work  with me on this. Certainly this is a serious problem, and it is a  serious problem for my constituent, and I am sure constituents in any  other district in our country.   But there is a misstatement in the gentleman's words. It is voluntary  right now on the part of the private lenders, and this bill would  codify the requirement to ensure that disability discharge for private  student loans is not a choice.   Certainly, when you sign up for a loan, you don't think about  planning for becoming totally disabled and unable to afford your own  student loans.   Unfortunately, as my constituent case shows, some private lenders do  not voluntarily discharge for the borrower and the cosponsor in the  case of permanent and total disability. I believe we have a duty to  stand up for the most vulnerable among us. This bill would help  accomplish that goal.   I commend the lenders who do step up voluntarily, but we need to  codify this discharge of liability in the case of total or permanent  disability.   I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, of course there is a clear nexus to our  veterans and our servicemembers, and it would be marvelous if all  private student loan lenders would voluntarily discharge in the case of  permanent or total disability. It just simply isn't the case.   We are trying to ensure parity, regardless of who the borrower owes.  We don't believe this would be a difficulty for all of these lenders  who you say are willing to do this.   If the lenders honestly want to fight this so that they can take  every last dollar of the individuals and their families despite their  suffering, they can go to court, and they can ask the court for a  remedy.   I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
