 Madam President, I want to thank the gentleman from  Georgia for allowing me to participate in this colloquy and pay tribute  to his remarkable career of public service.   I think you could ask anyone in this Chamber, Republican or Democrat,  what they think of Johnny Isakson, and you probably get the same answer  every time: He is a gentleman and a statesman, somebody who knows how  to find common ground and understands why that is still important.  Sometimes, it was the little things--a bipartisan barbeque to just get  Senators in the same room for a few minutes. As a chairman he brought  folks together on one of the few remaining pieces of bipartisan  territory: caring for our veterans.   Even on issues that often divide us, Johnny has spent his career  looking for ways to get to yes, and he has a track record to prove it,  particularly on the issue of healthcare. This is an issue that Johnny  approaches from a place of deep knowledge but also deep empathy.  [[Page S6807]]    One of my proudest moments in the Senate was working with Senator  Isakson, along with Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, and others, on  improving care for the millions of Americans with multiple chronic  illnesses. As many of you know, this is pretty personal for me. My mom  had Alzheimer's for 10 years before she passed away; 9 of those she  couldn't speak.   Working with Johnny on that Chronic Care Working Group--you knew he  wasn't just transacting business or playing politics; he was personally  invested in making life better for folks with these conditions.   I can't think of a better testament to the Johnny Isakson way than  the fact that just a couple months after one of the toughest fights to  ever take place over healthcare, we passed the Chronic Care Act on an  overwhelmingly bipartisan basis.   A lot of people in politics can tell you what they are against, but  not many people can show you what they have accomplished. And as Johnny  Isakson heads home to Georgia, he leaves behind a legacy of bipartisan  accomplishment that will live on for many years to come.   Johnny, I want to wish you, Dianne, and your family health and  happiness.   In closing, I just want to say thank you for your years of service to  our country and for your years of friendship.    Madam President, Senator Kay Hagan was a great friend and  a devoted public servant. Her loss has been deeply felt by her many  friends in this Chamber.   Kay and I first got to know each other when we were running for the  Senate in 2008. Throughout that campaign, we would talk periodically,  and her courage in the face of the attacks she dealt with said so much  about her character and her strong faith. We were sworn in together as  freshmen Senators in 2009, and I had the pleasure of serving alongside  her for 6 years.   Throughout her time in the Senate, Kay served the people of North  Carolina with integrity. I knew her to be someone who approached every  challenge not as a member of a particular political party but as  someone who wanted to do right by the people of North Carolina, who  were always her top priority.   She brought a valuable perspective on financial matters and  significant experience in that arena to the Senate, having worked in  the banking sector in North Carolina. During her time on Capitol Hill,  she was known as a legislator who was always willing to listen to good  ideas--no matter which side of the aisle they came from. I saw this  firsthand whenever we collaborated on legislation.   Through her work Senator Hagan sought to leave behind a better nation  for our future generations. In our first year in the Senate, we worked  closely together on the value and innovation amendment package--an  ambitious set of amendments to encourage innovation and drive down  costs in healthcare. I was also proud to have worked with her on  legislation to do things like strengthen America's housing finance  system and bring jobs back to the United States.   Born in Shelby, NC, Kay got involved in public service early on,  working as a Senate intern in the 1970s and eventually going on to work  on Governor Jim Hunt's campaigns in her home of Guilford County. Before  being elected to the Senate, she served in the North Carolina State  Senate for 10 years, where she cochaired the budget committee.   Senator Hagan blazed the trail as North Carolina's first female  democratic Senator and as the second woman to ever serve as Senator of  her State. Championing a number of bills to fund expanded screening for  newborns, provide medical assistance to families exposed to toxic  drinking water, and safeguard tuition funding for servicemembers,  Senator Hagan spent her career fighting for the well-being of North  Carolina families.   Senator Hagan will be remembered as a leader within her community and  as someone who was not afraid to stand for what was right. My heart  goes out to her husband, Chip; her three children, Jeannette, Tilden  and Carrie; her beloved grandchildren; and her whole family.
