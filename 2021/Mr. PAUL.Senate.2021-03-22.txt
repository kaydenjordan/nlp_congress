 Mr. President, on March 18, I voted against the  confirmation of Xavier Becerra to be Secretary of Health and Human  Services. Mr. Becerra has no substantive experience in public health  policy, and he has proven himself to be an extremist on the few  occasions he has engaged on health care issues. In October 2017, he  told FOX News, ``I've been a supporter of Medicare for All for the 24  years that I was in Congress.'' As attorney general of California, he  filed over 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration, including  leading a group of attorneys general in opposing Texas's legal  challenge to Obamacare in Texas v. Azar. He also won lawsuits to  reclassify gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft as employers. In  response, California's Prop 22 was drafted, with a description saying  it ``changes employment classification rules for app-based  transportation and delivery workers.'' Becerra's office, which has  authority to summarize ballot measures, seemingly tried to sabotage  Prop 22 by changing its summary to say it ``exempts app-based  transportation and delivery companies from providing employee benefits  to certain drivers and delivery workers.'' Californians passed Prop 22  anyway, with over 58 percent support.   Mr. Becerra's history suggests he will use this Cabinet post for  political activism, not for advancing our Nation's public health. For  that reason, I opposed his confirmation.                            ____________________
