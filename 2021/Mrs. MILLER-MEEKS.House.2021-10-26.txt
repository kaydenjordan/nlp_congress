 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, small business owner, and a  dear friend to many in my hometown of Ottumwa.   On October 20, Doris Wilz passed away at the age of 93. Born and  raised in Ottumwa, Doris was known by many as being the one who always  went above and beyond for the betterment of the community. As a young  widow, Doris met Karl Wilz, a small business owner and also recently  widowed with four small children, the youngest of which was around  three. They got married, and Doris went forward to help him conduct two  small businesses in two towns 30 miles apart.   Whether it was through serving customers at one of the family's small  businesses or volunteering at Ottumwa Regional Health Center,  comforting patients and making cookies for the families at McCreery  Cancer Center, Doris always loved to put a smile on the face of others.   But when asked what her greatest passion in life was, Doris would say  her four children, 12 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.   Doris' gentle smile, melodious laugh, and encouragement meant so much  to so many and drew people to her, including myself, and I am honored  she considered me a friend.   Madam Speaker, I thank Doris for contributing to our community, and I  will keep her, her family, and her loved ones in my prayers.                            ____________________
