 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Dr. Joyce, from  the great State of Pennsylvania and the HEAT Team for providing this  opportunity for a Special Order because the American people need to  know.   They need to know that for months the Biden administration has been  using the excuse that global markets are complex and there are dynamics  out of our control that have led to the highest average gas prices  since 2008 and spiking oil prices around the world.   This, I want you to know, is disingenuous at best, and the reality is  simply not true.   As my colleagues in the Congressional Western Caucus and the House  Energy Action Team have been saying, we have the ability to achieve our  own secure energy future. In fact, we achieved just that, that energy  independence, just a few short years ago. But with this President and  his administration at the helm, we have thrown that energy security out  the window.  [[Page H1361]]    Don't believe the President's revisionist history of blaming Vladimir  Putin for high gas prices.   You can be sure the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, the  moratorium on oil and gas leasing on Federal lands, the lack of action  on the offshore leasing program, and the commitment by this President  and his administration to make American energy producers obsolete in  just a few short years, yes, all of those are reasons to hold this  President responsible for the burden now placed on the American people.   These rising prices started long before this conflict, and we will  continue to hold this administration accountable for the burden they  have placed on the American people.   Again, Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Joyce; the American people need to  hear this.
