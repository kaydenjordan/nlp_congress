 Mr. Chair, today I rise in support of the Whole Milk for  Healthy Kids Act which will allow schools to offer both unflavored and  flavored whole milk for students.   Whole milk provides children with 13 essential nutrients for growth,  development, immunity, and brain function. Whole milk also serves as  the top source of protein, calcium, potassium, and vitamin D for  children.   I am a proud cosponsor of this vital legislation, and I thank my good  friend, Chairman Thompson, for introducing this commonsense bill.   For too long, poor Federal policy has kept whole milk out of our  school cafeterias. This commonsense legislation puts the health and  well-being of our children first. As the father of two young sons  myself, I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to  join me in doing so.   Also as a father, I would note that I see every day the illustration  of how my children react to whole milk versus skim milk. I would just  give that firsthand impression.   I also would say the science supports it.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record these scientific studies, as  well.  [[Page H6900]]        Comparison of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet        and a Higher-Fat DASH Diet on Blood Pressure and Lipids and                Lipoproteins: A Randomized Controlled Trial                                 INTRODUCTION         The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary       eating pattern, which emphasizes fruit and vegetables, low-      fat dairy foods, and whole grains, is one of the most widely       prescribed dietary modifications for reducing blood pressure       (BP) and cardiovascular disease risk. Notably, in the Nurses'       Health Study, self-reported greater adherence to a DASH-style       diet was associated with a lower risk of coronary artery       disease and stroke. Because LDL cholesterol is lower with the       consumption of the DASH diet than with a typical Western diet       due in part to its limitation of saturated fatty acids, it is       believed that its lower saturated fat content may contribute       to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.        The degree of dietary adherence strongly determines the       efficacy of dietary interventions. A recent review of 9       trials of the DASH diet with objective measures of compliance       reported poorer adherence when dietary advice rather than       foods was provided. A common reason for low adherence or high       attrition is the difficulty of following prescribed diets. In       the original DASH trial, lack of menu variety was a primary       reason for lapses in dietary adherence. This suggests the       potential value of providing options for the DASH diet that       permit variation in macronutrient composition while       preserving benefits on BP and lipid risk factors.        One such variation is the substitution of fat for       carbohydrate. Appel et al. reported that the replacement of       10% of energy from carbohydrate with unsaturated fat       (primarily monounsaturated) in a DASH-like diet resulted in a       reduction in triglycerides and an increase in HDL       cholesterol, with no change in LDL cholesterol, and a further       reduction in the Framingham risk score. There is evidence       that long-term compliance to diets with reduced saturated fat       is poor, even with intensive counseling, and that moderate-      fat diets may yield better dietary adherence than low-fat       diets. Furthermore, the mean intake of individuals who       consumed the DASH diet in the ENCORE (Exercise and Nutrition       Interventions for Cardiovascular Health) study failed to meet       the low total fat and saturated fat targets.        The effects on lipids and BP of replacing carbohydrates       with saturated fats within a DASH-like diet have not been       reported, to our knowledge. In the present study we tested       the effects of substituting full-fat dairy products for       nonfat and low-fat dairy foods (thereby increasing saturated       fat from 8% to 14% of energy) in conjunction with a reduction       of 12% of energy in carbohydrate, primarily from sugars.                                   METHODS       Study design and diets        A 3-period randomized crossover study in free-living       participants was conducted between August 2011 and December       2013 at our clinical research center in Berkeley, California.       The participants consumed a 1-wk run-in diet, consisting of a       mixture of 2 or 3 d of each experimental diet, and then       consumed in random order a control diet, a standard DASH       diet, and a higher-fat, lower-carbohydrate modification of       the DASH diet (HF-DASH diet) for 3 wk each. Each experimental       diet was separated by a 2-wk washout period, during which       participants ate their own foods but continued to abstain       from alcohol. Participants were assigned their diet sequence       in randomly determined blocks of 3, 6, 9, or 12 individuals       by using a uniform random-number generator. Diet sequences       were kept in sealed envelopes and assigned to the participant       by the study nutritionist 1-2 d before starting the first       experimental diet. Participants were blinded to diet order,       but because of the nature of the diets they were likely able       to identify each diet. Clinic personnel were not blinded to       diet order. Laboratory personnel and investigators were       blinded to diet order, and unblinding was performed after       data collection before analysis. Participants met with study       staff weekly for counseling, to receive study foods, and to       be weighed. At the end of each experimental diet,       participants visited the clinic on 2 consecutive days for       clinical and laboratory measurements. In addition, a fasting       blood sample was taken after each washout period to document       a return to baseline for standard lipid and BP measurements.      Study population        Participants included generally healthy men and women >21 y       of age with an average diastolic BP between 80 and 95 mm Hg       and systolic BP <160 mm Hg for 2 screening visits. Exclusion       criteria included the following: use of nicotine products or       recreational drugs, history of coronary artery disease,       diabetes, or other chronic disease, use of hormones or       medications known to affect lipid metabolism or BP; use of       dietary supplements within the past 3 mo; unwillingness to       refrain from alcoholic beverages during the study; BMI (in       kg/m\2\) 35; total and LDL cholesterol >95th percentile for       sex and age; fasting triglycerides >500 mg/dL; fasting       glucose 126 mg/dL; and abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone       concentration. Participants were recruited primarily through       our database of previous study participants, Internet       advertisements, and community health events. The protocol was       reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of       Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland. All       participants provided written informed consent.      Dietary provision        The Bionutrition Core of the University of California, San       Francisco, Clinical and Translational Science Institute       developed and prepared diets for a 3-d cycle menu at 5 levels       of energy intake (1800, 2100, 2600, 3100, and 3600 kcal).       Participants whose energy needs were between main-menu       calorie levels received unit foods (100 kcal) that matched       the macronutrient and mineral content of the experimental       diets. The control and DASH diets were designed to match the       characteristics of the diets used in the original DASH trial.       The higher-fat and lower-carbohydrate content of the HF-DASH       diet was achieved by replacing nonfat and low-fat dairy with       full-fat dairy products, mostly in the form of whole milk,       cheese, and yogurt, and by reducing sugars, mostly from fruit       juices, which constituted 59% of total fruit intake in the       DASH diet. The DASH and HF-DASH patterns were otherwise       developed by using similar recipes and foods, provided in       different amounts to meet each diet specification. As in the       original trial design, emphasis was placed on an abundance of       fruit and vegetables, increased whole grains and dairy       products; limited servings of meat, poultry, and fish, and       inclusion of nuts, seeds, and legumes several times weekly.       The nutrient composition of the diets was initially assessed       by using Nutrition Data System for Research Software (NDSR       2010; Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota)       and validated by compositional analysis of g the 3-d cycle       menus (Covance Laboratories). The sodium, potassium,       magnesium, calcium, and fiber contents of the DASH and HF-      DASH patterns were similar; the diets differed only in the       amount of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and       carbohydrate they provided.        Dietary control was achieved by providing participants with       2 standardized entrees and accompanying side dishes daily       (lunch, dinner, and some snacks), representing 50% of total       energy. Detailed menus, shopping lists, and food preparation       instructions were provided for the remaining food items       (mostly dairy, produce, and cereal products) to be purchased       and prepared at home. Participants were required to come to       the clinic weekly to pick up study foods, submit receipts       documenting study food purchases, and to meet with the       nutritionist to assess compliance with the dietary       protocol and adjust energy intake to maintain a stable       weight (within 3% of baseline, at 10 pounds       maximum). They were also required to maintain their usual       physical activity levels during the study and to monitor       daily steps by pedometer. Compliance was assessed by       measuring 24-h urinary potassium at the end of the second       week of each experimental diet. Twenty-four-hour urinary       sodium was measured as an indicator of sodium intake.      Experimental measurements        After each 3-wk dietary period, body weight and waist and       hip circumference were measured and the percentage of body       fat was assessed by bioimpedance (TBF 551 body-weight scale;       Tanita). BP was measured at the clinic by using a Dinamap       monitor (GE Pro 100 or Critikon Pro 300) after the second       week of each diet and on 2 consecutive days at the end of       each experimental diet, and the 3 values were averaged. At       each instance, BP was measured in a sitting position after 5       min rest 3 times, and the last 2 measurements were averaged.       Participants were also provided with a portable BP cuff       (Model BP791IT, Omron Healthcare, Inc) and were instructed to       self-measure BP twice in the morning and twice in the evening       for the last 7 d of each experimental dietary period. Data       were automatically recorded on the BP instrument and       downloaded for analyses. Urinary potassium and sodium were       measured in 24-h urine collections by an outside clinical       laboratory (Quest Diagnostics).        Fasting plasma samples collected on 2 consecutive days at       the end of each experimental dietary period were analyzed for       plasma lipids and lipoproteins, glucose, and insulin. Total       cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose were       measured by enzymatic end-point measurements with the use of       enzyme reagent kits (Ciba-Corning Diagnostics Corporation) on       an AMS Liasys 330 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. LDL       cholesterol was calculated by using the Friedewald equation.       Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride       concentrations were monitored throughout by the CDC-National       Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lipid Standardization       Program. Apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo       A-I) were measured by immunoturbidimetric assays (Batton       Assay Systems; AMS Liasys 330 analyzer).        Lipoprotein particle concentrations and LDL peak diameter       were measured by gas-phase electrophoresis (ion mobility), as       previously described, with a modified procedure for initially       separating the lipoproteins from other plasma proteins.       Lipoprotein intervals were defined as previously described.      Statistical analysis        The primary objective was to compare the DASH and HF-DASH       diets for lipid and lipoprotein measurements. At 80% power,       an n of 36 would yield a minimum detectable difference       between diets of 0 14 mmol/L for LDL cholesterol (SD of       response = 0.30 mmol/L), 0.04 g/L for apoB (SD of response =       0.09 g/L), 0.03 mmol/L for HDL cholesterol (SD of response =       0.07 mmol/L), 4.1 mm Hg for systolic BP (SD of response = 8.6       mm Hg), and 2.2 mm Hg for diastolic BP (SD of response =  [[Page H6901]]       5.3 mm Hg). The detectable changes in BP were sufficient to       confirm the differences observed in the original DASH trial.       Treatment differences were determined by ANOVA for a 3-      treatment crossover design. Pairwise comparisons between       diets were adjusted by the Bonferroni method for 3 group       comparisons (HF-DASH diet compared with control diet, HF-DASH       diet compared with DASH diet, and DASH diet compared with       control diet), and P < 0.017 corresponding to an overall 2-      tailed P < 0.05 was considered significant. ANOVA and paired       t tests were used to compare triglycerides and total, LDL,       and HDL cholesterol after each of the 2 washout periods with       baseline to test for the effectiveness of the washout period       for normalizing plasma lipids. The analyses were restricted       to those subjects who completed all 3 diets.                                   RESULTS       Study participants        Thirty-six participants completed all 3 experimental diets       and are included in analyses. Fasting plasma triglycerides       and total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol measured after each of       the 2 washout periods showed no significant differences       between screening values and their values after the first or       second washout period (analyses not shown), indicative of       their return to baseline concentrations.        As expected, 24-h urinary potassium excretion was       significantly higher with the DASH and HF-DASH diets than       with the control diet (P < 0.0001 for both, adjusted for       period) and did not differ between the DASH and HF-DASH diets       (mean  SE: HF-DASH diet, 81.5  3.5;       DASH diet, 83.5  3.5; and control diet, 50.5        3.5 mmol), consistent with good dietary       compliance. Urinary sodium excretion did not differ between       diets (mean  SE: HF-DASH diets, 116.6        7.8; DASH diet, 119.3  7.8; and       control diet, 129.0  7.8 mmol; P = 0.49, adjusted       for period). Body weight remained stable throughout the study       and there were no differences by diet (mean  SE:       HF-DASH diet, 79.7  0.1; DASH diet, 79.6        0,1; and control diet, 79.8  0.1 kg;       P-treatment = 0.62).      Effects of diets on BP        Table 3 presents the statistical evaluation of the       crossover design's treatment, period, and sequence effects       along with the adjusted treatment means and their SEs.       Significant treatment effects were observed for systolic and       diastolic BP, such that the DASH and HF-DASH diets produced       significant and comparable reductions relative to the control       diet, with no differences between the DASH and HF-DASH diets.        There were no significant sequence effects, but there were       significant carry-forward effects for both systolic and       diastolic BP and a significant period effect for systolic BP.       The carry-forward effect appeared to be due to lower systolic       and diastolic BP after the HF-DASH diet compared with the       DASH, control, or no previous diet. Mean BPs were, in fact,       lower at the end of the washout period after the HF-DASH diet       than after the other diets for systolic (mean        SE: -4.1  1.7 mm Hg; P = 0.02) and diastolic       (-0.9  1.1 mm Hg; P = 0.40) BPs. The carry-      forward effect did not appear to be the result of any       individual participant.        Both morning and evening systolic and diastolic BPs       measured by the participants at home were similarly reduced       with the DASH and HF-DASH diets compared with the control       diet, confirming the treatment effect of the DASH and HF-DASH       diets on BP. There were no significant sequence, period, or       carry-forward effects for home BP measurements.      Effects of diets on plasma lipids and lipoproteins        Significant treatment effects were observed for plasma       concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL       cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol, apo A-I, LDL peak diameter,       large and medium VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein       (IDL), and large LDL concentrations.        For the primary comparison of the DASH and HF-DASH diets,       the latter resulted in significantly lower plasma       triglycerides, large and medium VLDL concentrations, and       significantly higher LDL peak particle diameter. There were       no significant differences between the DASH and HF-DASH diets       for any other lipid or lipoprotein measurement after       Bonferroni correction.        Both the DASH and the HF-DASH diets significantly reduced       total cholesterol compared with the control diet. The DASH       diet also significantly decreased LDL cholesterol, HDL       cholesterol, apo A-I, IDL concentrations, large LDL       concentrations, and LDL peak diameter compared with the       control diet. Except for lower total cholesterol, none of the       lipid and lipoprotein measurements differed significantly       between the HF-DASH and control diets after Bonferroni       correction.        There were no significant sequence effects for any of the       lipid and lipoprotein variables examined. None of the       variables that showed a significant treatment effect       exhibited significant carry-forward or period effects.                                  DISCUSSION         The DASH diet, which was developed and validated as a means       for lowering BP, was formulated to include low-fat and nonfat       dairy foods. In this study, we tested whether the BP benefit,       as well as a favorable lipid and lipoprotein profile, could       be maintained by the HF-DASH diet that includes full-fat       dairy foods, with a corresponding increase in total and       saturated fat, and a reduction in carbohydrate achieved       primarily by reducing fruit juices and sugars, because sugar       intake is associated with detrimental effects on       cardiovascular disease risk factors. The HF-DASH diet lowered       both systolic and diastolic BP to an extent similar to the       DASH diet, indicating that the diet components responsible       for the BP reduction were retained in the HF-DASH diet.       Although the sodium content of the control diet was slightly       higher than that of the 2 experimental diets, this difference       was similar to that observed in the original DASH trial.       Furthermore, 24-h urine sodium measurements were similar on       all 3 diets, indicating that the BP reductions with the DASH       and HF-DASH diets were not attributable to lower sodium       intake.        When substituted for carbohydrates or unsaturated fats,       saturated fats have been consistently shown to increase LDL       cholesterol. We previously showed that with limitation of       carbohydrate intake, the increase in LDL cholesterol induced       by saturated fat is due primarily to large, cholesterol-rich       LDL particles and not small, dense LDL particles. Indeed, in       the present study, we found that the reduction in LDL       cholesterol with the DASH diet compared with the control diet       occurred in conjunction with lower concentrations of large       LDL particles as well as of IDL particles, which both       contribute cholesterol content to the standard LDL-      cholesterol measurement. However, despite a 6% of energy       higher saturated fat content to the HF-DASH diet compared       with the DASH diet, there were no significant differences in       LDL cholesterol or any of the LDL subclasses between these       diets. There may be features of the DASH diet that mitigate       the increase in LDL cholesterol that is typically observed       with higher saturated fat intake.        It is of interest that there was a significantly higher LDL       peak particle diameter with the HF-DASH diet compared with       the DASH diet. Although this difference was of relatively       small magnitude, it corresponded to a trend, albeit       nonsignificant, for relatively higher concentrations of       larger LDL particles and lower concentrations of smaller LDL       particles with the HF-DASH diet with no net difference in       total LDL particle concentrations. This change in the       distribution of LDL particles may be more easily detected by       the peak diameter than the individual subtractions. The shift       toward larger LDL particles with the HF-DASH diet may be       attributed at least in part to the lower carbohydrate content       of this diet compared with the DASH diet, because a shift       from smaller to larger LDL particles was previously shown to       correlate with reductions in plasma triglyceride and VLDL       concentrations resulting from reduced carbohydrate or sugar       intake. The reductions in triglycerides and VLDL particle       concentrations with the HF-DASH diet compared with the DASH       diet observed in the present study were relatively modest as       might be expected from the moderate difference in       carbohydrate content between the diets (43% compared with 55%       of energy). It is possible that these differences were not of       sufficient magnitude to elicit the significant reductions in       small, dense LDL particles as well as in apoB (an index of       LDL particle number) that have been observed previously with       more substantial reductions in carbohydrate intake.        The present study confirmed previous observations that the       DASH diet lowers HDL cholesterol, which is consistent with a       significant reduction in apo A-I compared with the control       diet. These changes were not observed with the HF-DASH diet,       although the differences between the effects of the HF-DASH       and DASH diets did not reach significance. The basis for the       reduction in HDL cholesterol with the DASH diet is not known,       although it is noteworthy that this effect was not associated       with a change in HDL particle concentrations, suggesting that       it may represent a change in HDL composition.        Other investigators have also tested modifications of the       DASH diet on BP or lipid risk factors. The OmniHeart trial       tested the replacement of 10% of energy from carbohydrate in       a DASH diet with 10% of energy from unsaturated, primarily       monounsaturated, fat or 10% of energy from protein. The       protein and monounsaturated fat diets yielded similar or       greater reductions in BP compared with the standard, high-      carbohydrate DASH diet. Replacing carbohydrate with       monounsaturated fat reduced total cholesterol and       triglycerides and increased HDL cholesterol with affecting       LDL cholesterol. Replacing carbohydrate with protein reduced       total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The Beef       in an Optimal Lean Diet Study found that the inclusion of       lean beef in a low-saturated-fat DASH-like diet resulted in       comparable effects on lipid and lipoprotein measures compared       with a standard DASH diet. Sayer et al. recently showed that       a DASH-style diet containing either lean pork or chicken and       fish similarly reduced BP. Together with results from the       present study, the above findings provide evidence that       aspects of the DASH diet can be modified without compromising       its benefits on BP or LDL-cholesterol lowering, offering       flexibility in food choices for individuals following the       DASH diet.        The crossover design of this trial was largely successful       in that lipids and lipoprotein returned to baseline       concentrations and there were no significant sequence effects       and no carry-forward effects for most of the variables. The       exceptions were the clinic measurements of systolic and       diastolic BPs, whose reductions showed significant carry-      forward on the HF-DASH diet, an unexpected and unexplained       effect because there was no such carry-forward effect for the       home BP measurements.  [[Page H6902]]         Strengths of our study include high dietary compliance as       measured by urinary biomarkers and lack of weight change as a       potential confounder. Limitations include a relatively small       sample size and a short intervention duration.        In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that       modification of the DASH diet to allow for more liberal total       and saturated fat intake in conjunction with moderate       limitation of carbohydrate intake, primarily from fruit       juices and sugars, results in lower concentrations of       triglycerides and VLDL particles, with no increases in total       or LDL cholesterol and no attenuation of the favorable BP       response to the standard DASH diet. Therefore the modified       HF-DASH diet studied here presents an effective alternative       to this widely recommended dietary pattern, with less-      stringent dietary fat constraints, which may promote even       broader implementation.
