 Mr. President, let's face reality. The immigration law  system in America is broken. If we are going to get behind slogans and  bumper stickers and do something about the problems we face in America,  we have to talk about comprehensive immigration reform.   The amendment being offered by the Senator from Arkansas brings back  another one of the old arguments about sanctuary cities.   Let me tell you what the police chief, Art Acevedo of Houston, had to  say before the Senate Judiciary Committee.         If we are to be tough on crime, we must not forget that it       begins with trust and cooperation in our communities.    He went on to say:         [I]f we want to be effective and work to disrupt the drug       cartels, we cannot afford to alienate broad spectrums of our       community. Asking local law enforcement officers to become       involved in immigration enforcement is counterproductive.    Vote no on the Cotton amendment.    Mr. President, this amendment will cause harm to the  families of incarcerated individuals, joint filers who would receive  only half of the payment that the families are owed while the spouse is  incarcerated. Given the stark racial disparities in our criminal  justice system, this would cause the most harm to Black and Brown  families and communities already harmed by mass incarceration. Children  should not be forced to go hungry because a parent is incarcerated.  Relief payments would allow families to replace lost income and pay  rent and put food on the table.   The Cassidy amendment sweeps broadly, denying recovery of rebates not  only to incarcerated individuals but also to anyone violating a  condition of probation on parole, but the Social Security statute that  Senator Cassidy's amendment copies from has a safety valve giving  discretion to allow payments to persons because of mitigating  circumstances. His amendment does not.   I would urge my colleagues to understand what we are facing with our  criminal justice system today. We need to bring more justice to it and  caring for the families of those who are incarcerated.    Mr. President, the statement of the Senator from Texas is  just plain false--false. Let me be clear. Undocumented immigrants do  not have Social Security numbers, and they do not qualify for stimulus  relief checks, period.   And just in case you didn't notice, they didn't qualify in December  when 92 of us voted for that measure, and they don't qualify under the  American Rescue Plan. Nothing has changed.   And for you to stand up there and say the opposite is just to rile  people up over something that is not true.    No. It is not true, and we know what is going on right  now. They want to be able to give speeches and say the checks go to  undocumented people. In the circumstance where there is a parent  receiving----   --a check for the child, that is it; but no money going to  undocumented people under the American Rescue Plan.
