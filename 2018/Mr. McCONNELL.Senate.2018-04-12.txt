 Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate confirmed John  Ring to the National Labor Relations Board. Now the NLRB is, once  again, fully staffed and ready to call balls and strikes fairly for  America's workers.   This morning, we confirmed Patrick Pizzella, the President's highly  qualified nominee, to fill the No. 2 job at the Department of Labor.  Mr. Pizzella brings a sterling reputation and an impressive resume. It  includes time at the GSA, the Small Business Administration, the  Department of Education, the Federal Housing Finance Board, and OPM.   Even with 8 years as the Assistant Secretary of Labor for  Administration and Management and 4 years as a Senate-confirmed member  of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, this dedicated public servant  saw his confirmation process play out in a manner that has become all  too familiar--months of waiting on the Senate calendar, months of  obstruction by our Democratic colleagues, months of needless vacancy in  this critical agency position. After this morning's vote, Mr. Pizzella  can finally get to work, but the same story of obstruction applies to  the next nomination on the slate as well.    Andrew Wheeler is ready and waiting--and waiting and waiting--to  clock in as Deputy Administrator of the EPA. His qualifications are  beyond question. He has won the support of the American Farm Bureau  Federation and has won praise from both sides of the aisle. Mr.  Wheeler's former boss, our colleague Senator Inhofe, said, ``There is  no one more qualified.'' Our former colleague, Senator Lieberman,  called Mr. Wheeler ``fair and professional'' and said, ``I hope his  nomination will receive . . . fair consideration by the Senate.''   Delaying key executive nominees does not come cost-free to the  country. The Deputy Administrator is the EPA's chief operating officer.  He plays a major role in protecting America's air and water, while  minimizing unnecessary obstacles for workers and job creators. The  American people deserve to have him and other key officials in place.   I mentioned yesterday that our Democratic colleagues are literally  setting records. Just 15 months in, they have chosen to force--listen  to this--84 cloture votes on President Trump's executive and judicial  nominees. Eighty-four. That is more than three times as many nominee  cloture votes as happened in the first 2 years of Presidents Obama,  President Bush, and President Clinton combined. Combined, 84 cloture  votes is more than 3 times as many cloture votes as happened in the  first 2 years of President Obama, Bush, and Clinton altogether. Many of  the nominees were then confirmed nearly unanimously.   I hope these stalling tactics will end soon because the personnel  business isn't going anywhere. Today, in fact, CIA Director Mike Pompeo  is appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the  first time as the President's nominee for Secretary of State. He is yet  another qualified nominee who deserves fair and swift consideration for  our country's sake.   For now, I meant what I said on Monday. We will remain in session as  long as it takes to process this week's slate of nominees. After Mr.  Wheeler, we still have two judicial nominees: Rebecca Grady Jennings  for the Western District of Kentucky and John Broomes for the District  of Kansas. One way or another, the easy way or the hard way, this  Senate will get the people's business done this week.    Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oregon. I think  this is a great project we can work on together.   During the recent break, I met with a lot of farmers in Kentucky.  Since farmers demographically tend to be older in most of our States, I  thought it was particularly noteworthy that there were a lot of young,  enthusiastic farmers, including research people from the University of  Kentucky College of Agriculture, with genuine enthusiasm about what  this could mean to help reinvigorate a rural economy in Kentucky that  is not what it used to be when we had tobacco as our No. 1 cash crop.  That has faded, and it should have, given the health implications of  it.   This is an opportunity for us to do something together, to do  something important for rural America, and I look forward to working  with my friend and colleague to achieve success.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  nomination.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  further rollcall votes in this series be 10 minutes in length.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  nomination.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  nomination.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action for the  nominations confirmed during today's session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany S. 140.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 140) entitled       ``An Act to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water       Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of       amounts in the WMAT Settlement Fund.'', do pass with an       amendment.                               Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to S. 140.                                Cloture Motion     I send a cloture motion to the desk on the motion to  concur.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    I move to concur in the House amendment to S. 140,  with a further amendment.  [[Page S2112]]     I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to concur  with amendment.    Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I move to refer the House message on S.  140 to the Committee on Indian Affairs with instructions to report back  forthwith.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.    I have an amendment to the instructions.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    Mr. President, today the Senate completed its work on  the personnel business for this week the way we started--by confirming  a talented nominee to be a Federal district judge in Kentucky.   President Trump nominated Rebecca Jennings to be the first woman to  serve as a district judge for the Western District of Kentucky. Widely  recognized for her outstanding legal talents and judgment, Ms. Jennings  has earned the support of Kentucky's legal community. In fact, dozens  of her peers wrote that ``she has a first-rate analytical mind and  superb judgment. She is principled, thoughtful, and hard-working.''  These qualities are exactly what I believe we need on the Federal  district courts. Our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee agreed,  advancing Ms. Jennings' nomination to the Senate floor on a voice vote.  Just moments ago, the Senate fulfilled its responsibility, confirming  another well-qualified nominee for Kentucky and for the Nation, both of  which will be well-served by Rebecca Jennings on the bench.   I hope the Senate can build on this momentum and continue confirming  more of the President's abundantly qualified nominees without undue  delay.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2667         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
