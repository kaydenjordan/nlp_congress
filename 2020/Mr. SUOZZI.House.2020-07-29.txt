 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Sami's Law.  Congressman Smith and I introduced this legislation to address  passenger safety issues with the transportation network companies,  TNCs, such as Uber and Lyft.   I thank Congressman Smith again for his tireless advocacy on this  issue, and I also thank Chairman DeFazio. There is no way this would  have made it to the floor unless he had worked together with House  leadership to get this bipartisan and commonsense legislation on the  floor.   It is a tremendous challenge to determine what policies are necessary  to ensure that the new industry of transportation network companies,  TNCs, provide safe, efficient, and cost-effective solutions to  consumers and employees.   Earlier this year, when news reports surfaced about the tragic,  horrific death of Sami Josephson, a friend of mine, who is also a  friend and neighbor of the Josephson family, contacted me to work on  legislation to ensure that no other parent would experience the  devastating loss of a child in the way that the Josephsons did.   I later discovered that Congressman Smith, who represents the  Josephsons, was also working on the issue.   Sami Josephson called for an Uber, entered the wrong car, and was  murdered.   The Smith/Suozzi legislation provides consumers with a level of  safety before entering a vehicle. Our bill's safety provisions are  commonsense and easy to implement, including the following  requirements:   One, requiring companies like Uber and Lyft to connect with  passengers and drivers to positively establish their identities before  the trip starts.   Two, prohibiting the unauthorized sale of ride-hailing signs and  spells out the civil penalties of violating the law.   Three, establishing an advisory council comprised of representatives  from Federal agencies, TNCs, law enforcement, disability and advocacy  groups to recommend standards for positive identification systems.   As we began researching this issue, I was surprised to learn that  TNCs, a relatively new business model, are regulated differently across  States and local borders.   While some States and cities, such as New York City, have implemented  new rules, such as creating a new license category for high-volume for- hire services, TNCs have been mostly left to create their own policies  for preventing and tracking violence or abuse to their passengers.   We have all heard about the horrific reports of assault and abuse  incidents involving both TNC passengers and drivers. That is why our  bill also requires a Government Accountability Office study on the  prevalence of assault and abuse perpetrated on riders by TNC drivers of  ride-hailing vehicles and on TNC drivers by passengers.   This data will be instrumental in determining any other safety  procedures that may be necessary to ensure the safety of everyone who  uses a ridesharing app.   There is no way to describe the sadness, the horror, the pain that  Sami's death caused for her family and to her community. She lived a  vibrant and loving life. She had her whole life ahead of her. She  planned to study law. She had hopes. She had dreams. We must do  everything we can to prevent what happened to Sami and so many others  from happening to anyone else.   I encourage my colleagues to support this critical, commonsense  legislation.                                time  1400     Madam Speaker, it was such a great gift and honor when  John Lewis would call me like he called many of us, ``my brother,'' to  serve on his committee, to ask him to give the closing prayer at this  year's National Prayer Breakfast, to travel to Selma with him, and like  all he came in contact with, to learn from him.   When the Christian church was in its infancy, there was tremendous  infighting, different tribes and sects, different personalities  battling over the direction of this new organization that will go on to  transform the world.   Paul the Apostle, one of the earliest and most prolific leaders, was  imprisoned by the Romans and ultimately beheaded for his belief in  Jesus.   While in prison in 62 AD, Paul wrote a series of letters to the  followers of Jesus instructing them how to conduct themselves.   In his letter to the Ephesians, Paul gave this instruction in chapter  4, versus 1 to 3: ``I, then, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to live  in a manner worthy of the call you have received,  [[Page H3974]]  with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one  another through love, striving to preserve the unity of the spirit  through the bond of peace.''   John Lewis also a prisoner for the Lord many times, lived that model  life worthy of his calling with humility and gentleness, with patience,  bearing with everyone through love, striving to preserve unity through  the bond of peace.    John Lewis showed us that strength comes from humility and gentleness  and patience and love, striving for unity through peace.   I know I need to be better. Thank you, John Lewis. Rest in peace,  good and faithful servant.
