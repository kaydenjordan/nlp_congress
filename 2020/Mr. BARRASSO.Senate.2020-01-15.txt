 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor after Speaker Pelosi  has ended her delay of the Senate impeachment trial today.   For the past month, the American people have watched the Speaker, I  believe, make a spectacle of herself. They talked about the need to  pass this in a way that was rushed, that was partisan, that was sloppy,  but they had to get it done. Their key word from the Speaker and from  so many in the House was ``urgency.'' We have to get this done, they  said--urgency, urgency, urgency. So they took the vote in the House  before Christmas. Then the Speaker decided to sit on this for 4 long  weeks. She blocked the moving of the articles from the House to the  Senate by refusing to send over the necessary papers.   In the end, the American people, including key Members of the  Democrats in the Senate, realized that this was just a political stunt.  Even the Senate Democrats lost patience with her cynical scheming. The  American people saw what this was. A Harvard-Harris poll cites that 56  percent of Americans say that what she was doing was just a political  stunt. We are talking about the impeachment of the President of the  United States, but it was just a political stunt. She should have done  her job. She should have delivered the articles in a timely manner.   Nevertheless, the Senate Republicans are ready to move forward today.  We have the majority's support to adopt the rules that were used in the  impeachment trial of President Clinton. President Trump deserves the  same treatment. In 1999, all 100 Senators--all 100--including the  Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, voted for these rules, and 77  percent of the American public says: Hey, if it is good enough for  Clinton, we ought to do the same thing today. So, after making his own,  unreasonable demands for weeks, Senator Schumer now says he is ready to  begin the trial.   The truth is that the Democrats have already made a mockery of  impeachment. What they really want is a show trial, not a fair trial,  and that is what happened in the House of Representatives. It was all  for show. What do I mean by that? Let's take a look at what happened in  the House.   First of all, their hearings were in secret, behind closed doors, in  the basement of the Capitol. Then they selectively released misleading  information. They denied the President due process, and they denied the  President the opportunity to face his accusers and to face the  whistleblower. Even though there was immediate interest and, at first,  they said ``Oh, the whistleblower will testify,'' they then said ``No,  no, no. We don't want you to even know who the whistleblower is or what  reason or personal issues related to the whistleblower may have brought  forth the reason for that person to come forward. We don't want you to  know where the whistleblower's alliances may lie.''   The Democrats have always known they cannot remove this President.  [[Page S223]]  Their real agenda is the 2020 Presidential election and the Senate  elections. Thankfully, the Democrats' 3-year-long partisan impeachment  effort--their goal being to impeach from day No. 1--is finally nearing  an end. It was from day No. 1. We saw Elizabeth Warren, candidate for  President, on the debate stage last night. Yet, in December of 2016,  after Donald Trump had been elected but before he had even been sworn  in, she had held a press conference and had talked about impeaching  him.   On the day the President took the oath of office, there was a  headline in the Washington Post that read: ``The campaign to impeach  President Trump has begun.''   Here we are now, over 3 years since election day of 2016, and we are  getting ready to have votes in Iowa in less than 3 weeks. So this isn't  really about trying to remove President Trump from office; it is about  trying to influence the vote of 2020. With voting in Iowa being 3 weeks  away and the general election's not being far away--November 3--voters,  not Congress, are going to decide whether to keep President Trump in  office.   The President has a terrific record to stand on. There have been 7  million new jobs created since he has been elected. The President has  cut taxes and gutted regulations that have been punishing to the  economy. There have been trade deals. He is signing one with China  today, and there are additional trade deals. We are going to pass the  USMCA tomorrow. There is a new trade deal with Japan. Unemployment is  at an all-time low. There is a 50-year low in unemployment in this  country, and wages are going up.   It is time for the Democrats to stop wasting the time of the American  people. There are jobs that need to be done. Congress needs to get its  job done, which is to focus on the issues that the American public care  about--roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, infrastructure. There is key  legislation we need to be advancing, like lowering the costs of  prescription drugs--helping people get insulin that is cheaper for  them. We need to help those families. We need to secure the border.  That is what is going on.   To think that we are going to spend the amount of time that we are  going to spend on impeachment as a result of what the House has been  doing and the Democrats have been doing since day No. 1 is a misuse of  taxpayer money and is a misuse of Congress's time to do the job that we  were elected to do--to help the American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the outstanding  career of Dr. James J. Naramore. For over 40 years, Jim Naramore  dedicated his life to caring for the people of Campbell County.   Born and raised in Gillette, he is a graduate of Campbell County High  School. He earned an undergraduate degree from John Brown University  and earned his medical degree from the University of Utah. He completed  his training in family medicine at the University of Nebraska.   Gillette was fortunate when Dr. Naramore came home in 1978 for a  temporary position in the emergency department at Campbell County  Memorial Hospital. He returned permanently in 1980 and spent the rest  of his career practicing at Family Health in Gillette, while also  serving on the medical staff of the hospital.   In addition, Dr. Naramore understood the importance of helping others  enter the medical profession. Throughout his career, he taught and  mentored the next generation of Wyoming physicians. He served as an  instructor for the Department of Human Medicine at  [[Page S242]]  the University of Wyoming Family Practice residency, a preceptor for  the Creighton University School of Medicine, and a preceptor for the  physician assistant training program for both Creighton University and  the University of Washington. He has also been active in teaching  emergency medical technician classes. Finally, Dr. Naramore also has  served as president of the Campbell County Medical Society, as well as  serving on the Physician Advisory Council to the Wyoming Board of  Medicine.   For Dr. Naramore, practicing family medicine in Gillette was more  than a profession. As a Gillette native, he understood the importance  of giving back to his community. Throughout his career, he dedicated  countless hours to making a real difference in his hometown. Dr.  Naramore participated in the Gillette Area Leadership Institute, served  on the board of directors of the Campbell County Chamber of Commerce,  and was president of the Razor City Toast Masters.   Finally, Dr. Naramore has served as president of Campbell County  Medical Society, as well as serving on the Physician Advisory Council  to the Wyoming Board of Medicine. In addition, he held numinous  positions at Campbell County Memorial Hospital, including chairman of  the Bylaws Committee, chief of the Family Practice Department, chief of  the Department of Medicine, a member of the Credentials Committee, the  Critical Care Committee. Most importantly he served as the hospital's  chief of staff.   In 2019, Campbell County Healthcare Foundation recognized Jim's  contributions with their Outstanding Healthcare Award. Certainly, Jim's  years of service to the health of Gillette and Campbell County made him  an outstanding choice for this honor.   With that being said, Jim Naramore is most proud of his outstanding  family. His wife Karen has been at his side for over 47 years. Together  they raised four children: Lindsay, Marissa, Jessica, and Marcus. Now  they are enjoying their six grandchildren.   Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize the outstanding career of  Dr. James Naramore. Wyoming is fortunate to have physicians like Jim  who go above and beyond to improve the health of their community.                            ____________________
