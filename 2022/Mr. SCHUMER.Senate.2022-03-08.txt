 Madam President, in 1922, the first robust antilynching  bill was successfully passed by the House of Representatives. Once it  came to the Senate, a block of Southern segregationists mounted a  filibuster to kill it in its tracks.   Over the decades, similar bills met similar fates. Throughout the  20th century, scores of antilynching bills were introduced, only to be  promptly buried into obscurity. In 2018, Congress came closer than ever  to finally passing antilynching legislation before it was thwarted at  the eleventh hour.   But last night, finally--finally--after more than 200 failed attempts  to declare lynching a Federal crime, the Senate succeeded in taking  long, overdue action by passing the Emmett Till Antilynching Act.   Hallelujah. Congress has finally declared lynching a Federal crime,  as it should have done more than a century ago. That it took so long is  a permanent, bitter stain on American history; but, finally, a  century's worth of efforts has now paid off.   To say this is a historic accomplishment is impossibly inadequate.  Generations of civil rights leaders and advocates dedicated their lives  to getting Congress to recognize the humane, obvious truth: that  lynching was an intolerable injustice inflicted primarily on  disenfranchised Black Americans.   Thousands upon thousands of Black Americans have been victims of  lynch mobs across the country, and indifferent States have rarely  responded, if ever. Many of the sworn officers of these States and  localities not only ignored but often participated when these  atrocities occurred.   Despicable. Horrible. America should be so ashamed of this chapter in  her history. And while no single congressional action can fully erase  the injustices committed against victims of lynching, last night was an  important step in the never-ending work of perfecting our Union. Only  by confronting the darkest elements of our history can we make straight  the path toward a brighter and more just future.    I want to really applaud Senator Booker. He has been diligent and  hard-working and valiant in getting this to happen. He had a great  partner in Senator Scott--bipartisan. And on the  [[Page S1024]]  House side, the person who lit this candle and kept it glowing even in  the most disappointing of times was   Bobby Rush. He never gave up.   Congress has finally taken action, and this bill now heads to  President Biden's desk, finally--finally--for signature.                      Government Funding and Coronavirus    Madam President, now on COVID, Republicans and Democrats continue  making good progress toward reaching a deal to fund the government. We  are almost there. We are very, very close, and, hopefully, it will be  done in the next few hours.   This bill, the spending bill, comes at a consequential moment. War in  Europe has focused the energies of Congress into getting something done  and getting it done fast, quickly. But one crucial element of the  funding bill is getting less attention, and it is as important as just  about anything in this bill. That is approving a new round of COVID  preparedness funding.   For all the important priorities we must address in this spending  bill, I believe the COVID funding will go down as one of the most  important--one of the most important--elements of the omnibus, and I  have been pushing really hard to get it done, working across the aisle  to convince our Republican colleagues that we need it.   Now that all the Federal COVID aid under the American Rescue Plan has  run out, approving new COVID funding is about insurance--far better to  prepare for new variants today than to play a frantic game of catchup  tomorrow, when it would be too late. We cannot let it be said that  America, after the third or fourth variant hits our shores, is  unprepared; does not have adequate testing, therapeutics, vaccines. We  cannot let that be said again.   The first time it happened, of course, we were unprepared. We didn't  know what had happened. But, unfortunately, even in the second and  third, President Trump's administration was not very eager to move  forward, trying to ignore it, saying it didn't really present a danger,  which, of course, it has.   So now Democrats and Republicans, thankfully, have come together, and  both sides of the aisle have come to realize that new COVID funding  today is about insurance--far better to prepare today than play a  frantic game of catchup tomorrow, when it is too late. The funding will  support more vaccines, testing, therapeutics, and healthcare workers,  and that is why I have been pushing so hard to get it done.   Across the country, life is returning to normal, thankfully. Cases  are falling. More people are going about without masks. Restaurants,  churches, and stores are filling up. I see that in my hometown of New  York. Most importantly, classrooms are full; schools are staying open.   Now that we are turning the corner, now that we are getting back to  normal, the last thing we can afford to do is let our guard down, lest  a new variant comes back with a vengeance and catapults us all back to  square one, a place where we all do not want to be.   Sadly, we know from experience that another variant is a very real  possibility. No one can say for certain how the virus will mutate, but  today we have the tools and know-how to fight this virus the minute it  hits our shores, while preserving as much of normal life as possible.   All that is needed is the Federal funding, and $15 billion of that  funding will be in the omnibus bill. So that is why I pushed so hard to  get COVID funding into the spending bill. I am encouraged to see that  Members have come around to recognize its importance, and I hope we can  get it done very, very soon.   Furthermore, I am pleased that we are likewise close--very close--to  passing a strong and ample aid package that will help the people of  Ukraine fight against Putin's immoral war. They desperately need  humanitarian aid, as millions of people are without food, without heat,  without shelter, without medicine. They desperately need the arms to  defend themselves against brutal Russian aggression, often viciously  aimed at civilians who are escaping. We pledged to get something big  done, and in the coming hours I expect we will be able to announce that  we have followed through.                                  H.R. 3076    Madam President, on another matter--a lot is going on in the Senate  this week--I am pleased to report that as soon as today the Senate is  set to deliver for the post office. The post office usually delivers  for us, but today we are going to deliver for them.   Every single day, tens of millions of Americans rely on the post  office for life's daily essentials. Seniors and veterans rely on it for  their medication. Small business owners rely on it to keep their  operations going. Small towns and rural Americans use it to stay  connected, and every time we receive a wedding invitation, birthday  message, or postcard from a relative, it is almost always the post  office at work, making us happy, receiving those nice letters and  birthday cards from brothers and sisters and relatives and friends from  far-flung places.   But we all know the frustrations of waiting on packages that fail to  arrive on time. We all know that when the post office is forced to cut  hours of operation or delivery routes or lay off workers, the rest of  us are worse off.   Thankfully, for the past few months, Democrats and Republicans have  been working together in good faith to reform some of the most troubled  parts of the Postal Service. Now, we are only one rollcall vote away  from sending this bill to the President's desk, and that vote is likely  to come today.   After the Senate votes on this bill, we will happily be able to say  that, finally, postal reform is signed, sealed, and delivered for the  American people. I look forward to getting this done and thank my  colleagues, especially Senators Peters and Portman, for their  bipartisan work.                                    Costs    Madam President, on costs--the costs that the American people face  when they buy things weekly through their daily lives--yesterday, we  saw another instance of Republicans going out of the way to show the  American people where their priorities lie.   A few months ago, the junior Senator from Florida callously called  inflation a ``gold mine'' for the Republican Party. People are  suffering and paying more, and the Senator from Florida says it is a  ``gold mine'' for the Republicans?   A few weeks ago, we saw what he meant. That same Senator released a  party platform that openly called for raising taxes on millions of  American families, potentially by more than $1,000 a year.   People can't afford that.   And, yesterday, the junior Senator from Wisconsin called for the GOP  to revive their failed efforts to rip away affordable healthcare for  tens of millions of Americans--a fresh reminder of an old desire that  Republicans have harbored for over a decade.   Cheerleading inflation, raising taxes on working Americans, repealing  affordable healthcare: Is that the platform of today's Republican  Party? At this point, perhaps the Senator from Wisconsin should join  the Senator from Florida in creating a new ``Hurting Working Families  Caucus'' so we can more easily track their truly repressive vision for  the American people.   Meanwhile, Democrats believe we should be lowering costs for  Americans, not raising them. We should be working on a bipartisan basis  to fight inflation, not root for it to go up. So, tomorrow, Democrats  will hold our annual DPCC retreat to discuss our plan to lower costs,  building on historic job growth, and expand opportunity for the middle  class.   Over the next few months, my colleagues will be holding hearings and  markups on many of our cost-cutting proposals. Among the ideas we are  working on are included bills to cap insulin costs at $35 a month,  lowering the cost of meat at the grocery store, reforming unfair  shipping practices that raise the costs of American goods for  everybody, and fixing domestic supply chains.   These are issues that the American people need help with. It is what  Democrats will maintain a focus on. And I thank my Republican  colleagues for helping us remind the American people which party truly  stands in their corner.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that, at 4:50  p.m. today, all postcloture time be considered expired on H.R. 3076;  that amendment No. 4955 be withdrawn; that the bill be considered read  a third time; that if a budget point of order is raised and a motion to  waive made, the Senate vote on the motion to waive; that if waived, the  Senate vote on the passage of the bill; further, that upon disposition  of H.R. 3076 that, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to  executive session and vote on the motions to invoke cloture on Calendar  Nos. 547 and 719; that if cloture is invoked on any of these  nominations, the Senate vote on confirmation of the nominations at a  time to be determined by the majority leader or his designee following  consultation with the Republican leader; finally, that there be 2  minutes for debate, equally divided in the usual form, prior to each  vote, all without further intervening action or debate.   Also, in an effort to speed up the votes, I ask unanimous consent  that all votes after the first vote be 10-minute votes. Members should  be notified to get here and to stay around so we can get this done.    I yield the floor to the Senator from Iowa.    Mr. President, every day, the U.S. Postal Service  faithfully delivers for the American people. Today, the Senate is  finally delivering for the post office.   Today, we can happily say that the postal reform is now signed,  sealed, and delivered for the American people. Because of today's bill,  the Postal Service will be stronger, more efficient, and better able to  serve more people, and we did it on a bipartisan basis.   For over a decade, the USPS--one of the most important institutions  in American life--has been on an ominous trajectory: shrinking  revenues, fewer delivery routes, and finances in desperate need of a  revamp. These problems led to late deliveries, reduced hours, and  increased costs. And when the Postal Service suffers, America suffers.   Today, after much hard work, the Senate is providing the Postal  Service a much needed reset. The legislation we are about to pass is  the most significant step that Congress has taken in a long time to  strengthen USPS. It will guarantee delivery services 6 days a week, put  the Postal Service on a path to solvency, and will ensure that we care  for our dedicated postal workers, all while saving dollars.   This postal reform bill is a win-win-win: a win for bipartisanship, a  win for our postal workers, and most importantly, a win for the tens of  millions of Americans who rely on the Postal Service every single day,  from seniors to veterans, to small businesses, to rural Americans, to  everyone in between.   I want to really give a special shout-out to my colleagues who made  this possible for us to pass this bill. Senators Peters and Portman led  the charge, Senator Carper worked long in the vineyards on this bill,  and so many others as well.   Of course, I want to thank the half a million postal workers who kept  our country going every single day, especially during the pandemic.  While so many other services were shut down  [[Page S1048]]  during COVID, the post office kept delivering goods and supplies and  medicines across the economy. They are public servants of the highest  order.   So it is a great day for our postal workers, and it is a great day  for the American people.   The bill has been in the works for over a decade, and today, after so  much work, we are all thrilled to have finally gotten it done.                              Vote on H.R. 3076     I ask for the yeas and nays.    We yield back all time, Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back.                            ____________________
