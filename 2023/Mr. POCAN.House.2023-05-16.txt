 Mr. Speaker, Republicans aren't being honest when they  tell you they are trying to negotiate in good faith on the Nation's  debt ceiling.   First, this shouldn't be a negotiation; it is paying our bills we  have already spent. We have lifted the debt ceiling over 80 times  before, including three times during President Trump's tenure because  you have to pay your bills.   Second, the legislation they passed, as an alleged negotiation, shows  how drastic they would like to cut spending but can't because they  can't even put specifics on paper, like the President and the Democrats  have. They would love to cut programs drastically, but the cuts would  hurt so many Americans they can't actually do it. That is why they  haven't released a budget.   I serve on the Appropriations Committee--let me explain what the  Republicans want to do. They passed a bill to cut spending to fiscal  year 2022 levels. That sounds innocuous enough, but here is what it  actually means. Deep cuts.   We have discretionary and nondiscretionary spending. We can't cut  nondiscretionary spending like Social Security and Medicare because,  well, it is your money that we hold on to as a public trust. By law, we  can't cut nondiscretionary spending. That only leaves discretionary  funds that can be changed.   Discretionary funds are eligible for cuts or increases, but the GOP  majority further limits that by saying they won't cut Pentagon  spending, amounting to over half of the discretionary funds.   That leaves a much smaller portion of the total budget to absorb all  the cuts they propose, adding up to a 22 percent cut of all remaining  funds. That is 22 percent of the funds that help veterans, 22 percent  of the funds to protect the border, funds for Meals on Wheels programs,  funds for railroad safety inspections, education, housing, and  healthcare, all cut.   Think about those levels of cuts and what that effect would have on  you and your family. They talk a tough game on the border, but they  would cut 22 percent of the funding going to protect the border.  Cutting Border Patrol and Customs officers could increase the flow of  people coming into the country and cut back on searches for fentanyl  and other drugs at our points of entry.  [[Page H2355]]    They say they want to back the blue and support our police, but 22  percent cuts to Federal law enforcement and grants to local police  departments are hardly the support they need.                                time  1015    They say they support our veterans--but cut veterans' food assistance  programs and housing choice vouchers, hurting tens of thousands of  veterans who have bravely served. Even the PACT Act that finally made  it through Congress to help veterans exposed to toxic chemicals  wouldn't get the funding needed to help those who served our Nation.   It keeps going. 180,000 fewer children would have access to  childcare; 10,800 fewer OSHA inspections of plants would expose workers  to unsafe conditions. Drug treatment courts would lose funding, and  29,000 fewer people would be able to get treatment for opioid  addiction.   There is a reason why they can't put out a full budget. It is because  these types of cuts aren't workable.   It is worse. If they do fund some areas, then other areas will see  even deeper cuts--30 percent or more cuts in some of the areas I just  mentioned. If they don't get these cuts, then they won't pay our  Nation's current bills and will force our Nation into default.   When you sign a mortgage, you can't decide whether or not you are  going to send your monthly check. If you default, then you lose your  house, and your credit is shot. The same is true for the Federal  Government.   You would also be directly affected by Republican default. Millions  of people would lose their jobs. Interest rates for home buyers and  small businesses would go up overnight. Stocks would tank, sinking your  retirement investments.   Congress has to pay its bills like you do, responsibly, and you do  that by lifting the debt ceiling now. If not, then, Mr. President,  invoke parts of the 14th Amendment to pay our bills and not damage the  economy.   Enough messing around. Get the job done, House Republicans. Your  constituents deserve it.
