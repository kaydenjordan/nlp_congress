 Mr. Speaker, regarding the Biden border crisis, the  Department of Homeland Security came back with a report proving without  a doubt that the Border Patrol agents on horseback did not whip Haitian  illegal immigrants crossing the border in 2021.   There is no evidence whatsoever that agents involved in this incident  struck intentionally or otherwise any illegal border crossers with the  reins of their horses.   After photographers took pictures of members of the Border Patrol  Horse Patrol chasing Haitian illegal immigrants and swirling the reins  of their horses in an allegedly intimidating manner, some news  organizations falsely reported the agents seemed to be whipping the  migrants.   After all this whip controversy was found to be completely without  merit, officials at Customs and Border Patrol announced that they are  still going to punish the agents. Wow, that will be great for morale.  These agents who dutifully serve to keep our border safe and enforce  our laws are going to pay the price for something they did not do.   President Biden, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, and even  Leader Schumer have all added fuel to this false fire. Liberal media  keep pushing out false stories even though the photographer who took  the images swiftly clarified they never witnessed an agent whipping any  migrants.   Negative media attention, brought about by liberal media and far-left  politicians, is vilifying these agents, needlessly hurting morale,  hurting recruitment and are just flat false.                            ____________________
