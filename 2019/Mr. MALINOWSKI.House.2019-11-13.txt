 Mr. Speaker, on June 13, a gunman from another State  sat in the parking lot of Tamaques Elementary School in my district,  armed with a loaded .45-caliber handgun, hollow-point bullets, and 130  rounds of ammunition.   Because of the quick work of the Westfield Police Department of New  Jersey, the gunman was disarmed and taken into custody. Officers  Jeffrey Johnson, Michael Pollock, Joseph Habeiche, Elizabeth Savnik,  and Tiffany Kenny, along with Detectives Nicholas Bruno and Jason  Merritt, prevented what could have been a devastating tragedy.   I am eternally grateful for their brave and swift actions, and I am  proud to recognize them this month as they are honored with the New  Jersey PBA's Unit Citation Award for their heroism.   Mr. Speaker, police officers are the good guys with a gun in America.  They are the good guys with a gun.   How many times do we have to experience these tragedies and close  calls before Congress finally acts to protect them and us by keeping  dangerous weapons from falling into the wrong hands?   The House has passed sensible gun safety legislation that will save  lives. It is time for the Senate to act.                            ____________________
