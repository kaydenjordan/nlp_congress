 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the incredible  volunteer work of my constituent, Ed Hannon, of Charles Town, West  Virginia.   Ed began volunteering for fire and rescue services in 1978 at the age  of 16. Ed took a job as a paid first responder in Arlington, Virginia,  in 1983 but continued to give his time volunteering.   When he moved to Jefferson County in 1993, he joined the Citizens  Fire Company. Jefferson County has no paid fire and EMS personnel, so  they rely on dedicated volunteers like Ed to provide these critical  services.   Ed ran his final calls on December 31, completing 44 years of  dedicated volunteer service. I wish Ed well in retirement and thank him  for his service to the citizens of Jefferson County.                            ____________________
