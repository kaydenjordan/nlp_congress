 Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues--I  think they are all going to do this--to support S. 3614. That is the  United States-Russian Federation Seafood Reciprocity Act of 2022, a  pretty simple bill that will require reciprocity between Russia and the  United States of America as it relates to our seafood industry and  seafood trade.  [[Page S769]]    Now, let me give you a little bit of background on this because it  actually relates to what is going on in the world today. All eyes are  currently on the Russian aggression toward Ukraine right now and for  good reason. We have seen the stories that the authoritarian dictator  Vladimir Putin is going to invade Ukraine. We hope, and I think every  one of us hopes, that doesn't happen, but it is looking like it may.   But what is less talked about is the last time there was an invasion  by Russia of Ukraine, what ended up happening in terms of sanctions  and, in particular, American seafood sanctions, and the ramifications  of the last Russian invasion of Ukraine.   Here is what actually happened. In 2014, when Putin invaded the  Crimean Peninsula and eastern Ukraine, President Obama put sanctions on  Russia. Now, I wasn't here as a Senator then, but I supported them.  Russia then retaliated in terms of sanctions in 2014, and here is one  of the things they did. They banned all seafood exports from America-- whether it is Alaska, Massachusetts--into Russia. So that was about 9  years ago. That ban still exists today.   Let me repeat this. If you are a big fisherman in Massachusetts or  the great State of Alaska, as the Senator from Massachusetts knows, we  both have thousands of great fishermen, you cannot export one fish to  Russia. Nine years of a ban, and guess what. The United States lets  Russia's seafood into America almost duty-free.   Let me repeat that. A ban on American exports to Russia, a 9-year  blockade, not one Massachusetts fisherman or Alaskan fisherman can  export his great American seafood product to Russia. Russia gets to  import Russian seafood into America duty-free. That is called unfair by  any measure--by any measure. And it certainly is unfair to the great  fishermen of my State as well as the fishermen of Massachusetts.   Now, I have talked about Alaskan fishermen for--well, as long as I  have been a Senator. About 66 percent of all seafood harvested in the  United States comes from the great State of Alaska. So we are big  exporters.   What has happened, though, in this regard, is that as we export--we  Alaskans, fishermen from Massachusetts--as we export seafood around the  world, we have not been able to export anything in that market, the  Russian market, for 9 years, and at the same time the value of Russian  seafood imported into the United States--surprise--has skyrocketed  because there is no tariff on it. It skyrocketed 173 percent since  2013. That was the year before the embargo was imposed--again, directly  competing against American seafood producers, American fishermen.   As a matter of fact, the Russians are actually starting to steal  market share from American fishermen, whether Massachusetts or Alaska,  and we are talking hundreds of millions of dollars. This is unfair by  anybody's definition.   So my bill is very simple. It says, like we need in all trade around  the world, we need just straight-up reciprocity. Right now, we can't  export a thing to Russia, and they export their fish to America duty- free.   So the bill is simple. It just says, until we can export into the  Russian market, they shouldn't be able to export into our market.   I can't imagine any U.S. Senator objecting to this. It is called  reciprocity. It is called fairness. And it is righting a wrong that has  been in the works for 9 years now, whether you are a fisherman in  Massachusetts or a fisherman in Alaska.   I have raised this issue with the Obama administration, the Trump  administration, now the Biden administration. We are still waiting on  reciprocity. So it is time to act. The U.S. Senate can act, and I am  hopeful that we are going to act on this today. As a matter of fact, I  checked with all my Republican colleagues, and every single one of them  is supportive of basic reciprocity for fishermen.   So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee  be discharged from further consideration of S. 3614 and the Senate  proceed to its immediate consideration; further, I ask unanimous  consent that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Madam President, I appreciate my friend Senator Markey,  his offer to work through this.   He and I have worked together on a number of issues, actually a  number of issues particularly related to America's fishermen. As he  mentioned, Massachusetts has a lot of fishermen, and I have tens of  thousands of my fellow Alaskans involved in the industry. And, again, I  think he and I certainly agree with this concept. I think every U.S.  Senator agrees with the concept of basic fairness in trade, basic  fairness, in terms of reciprocity, in trade--all trade but especially  the seafood trade. We have had 9 years of no reciprocity from Russia-- Putin, the thug. We shouldn't have to take it anymore, and it is  hurting my constituents.    Now, my understanding of the issue raised by Senator Markey is that  it is primarily Russian pollock that is imported into Massachusetts. As  Senator Markey knows, in Alaska, we have a huge number of fishermen  engaged in that fishery. So maybe what we should look at is making sure  Massachusetts' workers are actually processing American--Alaskan-- pollock, not the authoritarian pollock in Russia. That would be a fair  way to resolve this.   I appreciate the offer to work together on this, but I will tell the  Senator we need to work quickly because it has been 9 years of  nonreciprocal seafood trade. I am almost certain that Massachusetts  fishermen who once exported to Russia have been hurt by this seafood  blockade as well as my fishermen. I take Senator Markey's offer and  suggestion in good faith. Hopefully, we can work over the work period  in the next couple of weeks and get to a result on this.   Alaskans will supply Massachusetts' workers pollock or cod or  whatever you are processing, and then we will bring reciprocity in  terms of trade, which currently does not exist, between Russia and the  United States. It is wrong. It is unfair. It needs to be fixed by us,  and it needs to be fixed by the Biden administration as well.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague and  friend from Kansas. He said very, very eloquently that the  administration's policies right now, which are anti-energy--they are  driving up energy prices on working families. And it is national  security suicide to unilaterally disarm energy when Putin uses energy  as a weapon. We all know that.   Some of the window dressing here on these bills lately from my Senate  Democratic colleagues is just that--political window dressing. We all  need to go to the White House and say: Get your act together, Mr.  President, your team. Produce more American energy.   That is what we all need. It will help with inflation and will help  with national security.   So to my colleague from Kansas, thank you very much. We all come from  States that produce energy. And these are great American workers, too,  by the way, who sometimes get maligned because they produce energy.  Imagine that.                             Tribute to Doug Keil    Mr. President, I want to move on to my favorite time of the week. It  is Thursday, so I usually come down on the Senate floor and talk about  the Alaskan of the Week.   Now, we all believe our States are the best. Each State loves to brag  a little bit about their own State. That is great. It is what makes our  country competitive, a little bit of competition here in the Senate.  But I happen to speak the truth when I talk about how Alaska is the  best State, and it is because of the people.   I am going to talk a little bit about Doug Keil, who is today's  Alaskan of the Week. I always like to start--you know, the pages enjoy  this speech a lot because we get to talk a little bit about Alaska and  the adventures and what is happening in the great State of Alaska. So I  will give a little update on that.   On January 22, that was the polar night in Utqiagvik, AK, the  northernmost town in all of North America. What happened on January 22  is that polar night--as they call it there--finally ended. That is 65  days of darkness finally ended. That is 65 days of darkness.   On January 22, the Sun crept a little over the horizon briefly. Like  a long lost friend, the community gathered to say hello to the Sun. It  has been cold up North. It has been a cold winter. It is about 20 below  in Utqiagvik today. It has been relatively balmy in Anchorage where our  Alaskan of the Week lives--warm enough to be sleeting right now.   But in all weather, all around the State, people are getting out,  gathering, enjoying the Sun that stays in our skies a little bit longer  each day. They are dogsledding--training for the Iditarod. They are  snow-machining, playing hockey, skiing, snowboarding--so many winter  sports.   We, in our State, are chockful of excellent winter athletes--great  winter athletes. We punch way above our weight in terms of Winter  Olympics. Many Alaskans are competing now in Beijing, as we speak, and  we are rooting for all of them. Of course, we are rooting for all of  America's athletes.   We are also preparing to root for the amazing athletes who will be  competing in the Paralympics, also in Beijing, starting March 4. Again,  many Alaskans will be there competing: cross-country skier, Grace  Miller; snowboarder, Katy Maddry, a former Alaskan of the Week alum;  and former gold medal Paralympian, Andrew Kurka. He will be competing  in Beijing in the sit-ski events.   Now, I am mentioning all of this because our Alaskan of the Week,  Doug Keil, says every one of these athletes--both in the Olympics and  in Paralympics and all of our amateur athletes across the State--are  there because of athletes who have gone before them. I think that is  true.   Paving that path, of course, has been all the more challenging for  America's Paralympian athletes. But it is a path that Doug, our Alaskan  of the Week, has really paved for Alaska--for America--a deep one. And  he has done it through grit and pain and determination.   In 1980, Doug Keil brought home two gold medals from the 1980  Paralympic Games in Norway. That was the second-ever Paralympic Games.  He was the first American male to bring home gold in those games, and  he spent the next 30-plus years building not only the structures and  the organizations but, importantly, the culture in Alaska and in  America to make sure other athletes with disabilities could come after  him.   Let me tell you a little bit about our Alaskan of the Week, Doug  Keil. Doug was born in Beirut, Lebanon. His parents Don and Margaret,  who went by ``Midge,'' were adventuresome. From New York, they were on  a 4-year overseas trip. Don, the father, was teaching high school  physics and Midge was working at the United Nations in the Palestinian  refugee camps when they had Doug, the oldest of what would be five  children, four girls and Doug. I know one of the girls really well,  Carrie, Doug's sister, who works as part of my team in Anchorage doing  constituent casework. She recently hit the milestone of successfully  helping 2,000 different Alaskans. Carrie, great job. You are amazing-- just as amazing as your brother Doug. Her success rate is off the  charts. I see it every day.   When Doug and Carrie's family came back to America, they moved to  Alaska. Don's brother--that is the dad, Don--built houses, and Don  helped him for a while. Eventually, Don the father--Doug's father--got  a senior job with the Federal Aviation Administration.   Doug, our Alaskan of the Week, was an active kid. He loved sports,  mostly baseball and skiing. His plan was to follow in his father's  footsteps and go to Springfield College in Massachusetts. He wanted to  be a physical education teacher and to play baseball, but he had some  tragedy. When Doug was 15, he took a trip to Juneau to visit a school  friend. And on August 28, 1968, he and his friend were exploring an old  gold mine in Juneau. Doug got struck by 24,000 volts of electricity-- 24,000 volts of electricity. In the process, he lost an arm and lost a  leg. As we can all expect, the next few years were very difficult ones  for Doug and his family. As he said, ``When you get hit by 24,000 volts  of electricity, it messes you up physically. Mentally, my whole world  was gone.''   Talk about grit and determination. He spent about 2 years in the  hospital and his dreams, he thought, had died. To make it all the more  difficult, his father had to move the family to the DC area for a job  with the FAA when Doug was just a sophomore in high school, still  learning how to use an artificial arm and artificial leg. But the  family stuck together. They had faith, and they pulled through.   Back in Alaska, though, something remarkable happened. At this point,  Doug hadn't tried to ski again because he thought those days were over  without an arm, without a leg. But someone in their church told his  parents about a program in Colorado--in Winter Park, CO--where they  were training athletes to ski with disabilities. The first day he was  there, Doug went to Winter Park. It coincided with the first day of  what was then called the National Handicapped Championships.   Doug said:         I saw amazing athletes. I saw men and women who had come       back [many disabled veterans from Vietnam]. . . . I saw them       skiing and it opened up my eyes to a completely different       world.    Doug was inspired in many ways by our disabled Vietnam veterans who  helped train him, helped inspire him. He came back to Alaska to train  in this area and went back to Winter Park in 1977 to race in the  Nationals in the slalom event and did so again in 1979, both of which  qualified him for the 1980 Paralympics.   Along with two gold medals from those Olympics, he brought a mission  back to Alaska: starting a skiing program for people with physical  disabilities. He said at the time that skiing was amazing. It would  give him a ``feeling of motion. It's like running again. It can be  fluid. When it feels good up through your body, your body smiles and  when your body smiles, you smile.'' And he wanted others to have that  experience.    In the 1980s, of course, Alaska had mountains and snow and landscape  begging to be played in but did not have a culture that encouraged  people with disabilities to be part of those winter activities. Doug  explained to a reporter in 1980 that as a one-legged skier, he was an  anomaly in Alaska.   He said:         I've been skiing [there] for 5 years by myself. Up . . .       [in Alaska]--   [[Page S773]]     Someone with disabilities--       [T]hey see me coming down the slopes and they say ``What the       [heck] is that?'' People just [weren't] used to [seeing] it       [in 1980].    And this is where the story moves from one individual, Doug, to  thousands. Doug and a handful of others got busy. They formed a  nonprofit called Challenge Alaska, and they hit the road. Doug, who had  a full-time job in cable, still made the time for starting this great  organization, Challenge Alaska. They got people out on the slopes. They  trained them. They gathered all the adaptive equipment they could get  their hands on, and they dug in.   Forty years later, with an expanded mission now including all outdoor  activities, including summer activities--kayaking, cycling, wheelchair  Frisbee, fishing, camping, and so much more--Challenge Alaska, started  by Doug Keil, has helped over a thousand people in Alaska get out into  Alaska's great outdoors in winter and summer. Some of the most  incredible athletes you have ever met started their careers in  athletics with Challenge Alaska.   Just two weekends ago, my wife Julie and I had the opportunity to  attend Challenge Alaska's 40th anniversary gala dinner. Now, I know a  lot of my colleagues here--we go out to a lot of events when we are  back home. This was one of the most inspiring events I have attended in  a long, long time. Julie and I got to sit with the current executive  director of Challenge Alaska, Nate Boltz; his wife, Leah; daughter,  Anna; his parents, Jim and Laurie; his grandmother, Adeline. There were  amazing speeches. One young man named Ryan Johnson, a recent high  school graduate with cerebral palsy, spoke. Incredible. There wasn't a  dry eye in the house.   And, of course, Doug was there. Doug was there, the founder of  Challenge Alaska--40 years of work--and he was honored for this great  life achievement.   In that 1980 article I mentioned earlier, I talked about when he was  talking about skiing on the slopes alone as someone with one leg, he  said that if he could have a plaque that said he was instrumental in  starting a program to help other people with disabilities in Alaska to  learn to enjoy the outdoors--skiing, winter, summer--he would be a  happy man. That was 40 years ago when he said that. Well, he should be  happy. He has done that and so much more. Thousands of people have been  positively impacted by what he has done.   Here is another remarkable thing. His inspiration went far beyond  Alaska. It has literally touched the globe. He tells the story about  how in the nineties, 13 people with disabilities from Japan came to ski  with and learn from the people in Challenge Alaska. Doug was working at  Challenge Alaska. He, unfortunately, wasn't able to ski with our  Japanese visitors. But when they were leaving town, he met them at the  airport to say goodbye. One of them, who was also missing an arm and a  leg from a construction accident, stepped forward and, through an  interpreter, told Doug that after his accident, he thought about taking  his own life. Then this young Japanese man said to Doug that he saw a  documentary about Doug. And he said to Doug:         I vowed that I would learn to ski, [I would] come to Alaska       and ski with [Challenge Alaska]. Thank you [Doug] for saving       my life.    That is pretty powerful stuff right there--one person in Japan whose  life was saved by Doug Keil and all the great people at Challenge  Alaska.   So, Doug, thank you for saving lives. Thank you for your inspiration  to so many. Thank you for what you have done for Alaska, for Challenge  Alaska, for the State, for the Paralympian athletes we are going to  watch and cheer on here in a couple of weeks. And congratulations on  being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.
