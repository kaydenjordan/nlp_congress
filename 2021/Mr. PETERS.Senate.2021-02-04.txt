 Madam President, we need to have a secure border with a  strategic mix of personnel, technology, and barriers, and the Biden  administration has initiated a comprehensive review of southern border  security. But this amendment would force the last administration's  misguided, simplistic border wall decisions on President Biden.    We are in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic and  recession. The legislation before us must focus on families trying to  put food on the table and struggling small businesses, not ensuring  well-connected government contractors get rich.   The President's decision about our borders will be guided by what is  best  [[Page S447]]  for our national security and for taxpayers. Right now, we need to  focus on the struggling Americans who need our help and not big  government contractors.   (Chorus of Hear! Hear!)                          Vote on Amendment No. 542
