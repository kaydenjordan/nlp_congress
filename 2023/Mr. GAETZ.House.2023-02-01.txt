 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership and  for yielding.   The ATF's new rule criminalizing pistol braces is a brazen and  unlawful attempt to usurp congressional authority. This pistol brace  rule will fail for the same reason the bump stock rule failed: The ATF  does not have the authority to create Federal law. Nobody voted for the  ATF, though I know a lot of people who would vote against them if they  could.   This new rule will ban pistol braces on certain firearms, forcing  users to jump through numerous hoops to comply with this new decree or  risk becoming a felon.   Disabled veterans and others have used these braces for years to help  them fire pistols, and the ATF has unilaterally decided that this is no  longer acceptable. Now, otherwise law-abiding Americans will either  have to destroy their newly illegal firearms, or figure out how to  comply with an arbitrary and confusing regulatory scheme outlined in  the National Firearms Act.   The ATF cannot be trusted to protect our rights to keep and bear  arms. There is no timeline in which the ATF, under any administration,  would become an ally. It needs to go. We need to abolish the ATF before  they abolish our Second Amendment rights.   Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms should be the name of a chain of  convenience stores in Florida, not a Federal agency.   I urge every red-blooded American and every conservative in this  Congress to stand with Representative Clyde on his legislation, and to  stand with me and cosponsor my bill, the Abolish the ATF Act of 2023.  Let's get rid of this unlawful agency once and for all, and let this  Special Order be considered a shot across the bow.
