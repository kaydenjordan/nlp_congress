 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and not able to be  present on the floor at the time of the vote.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 46 and  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 47.                            ____________________     ``But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken  by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum  for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds  of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a  Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person  having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice  President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes,  the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.   ``The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and  the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the  same throughout the United States.   ``No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United  States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be  eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be  eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of  thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United  States.   ``In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his  Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of  the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice  [[Page H1165]]  President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal,  Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice  President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such  Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a  President shall be elected.''
