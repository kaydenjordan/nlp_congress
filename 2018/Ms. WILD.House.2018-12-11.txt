 Mr. Speaker, with only 4 days until open enrollment closes  for next year, I want to call on people in my community, across  Pennsylvania, and in every part of our country to sign up for coverage  on healthcare.gov.   Because Pennsylvania chose to expand Medicaid under the Affordable  Care Act, low-income individuals and  [[Page H10038]]  families in every corner of our district and State can obtain coverage,  and nearly 700,000 Pennsylvanians are now covered.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Americans of every background can  choose from a range of plans to find one that works for them and their  family free from discrimination over gender, sexual orientation, race,  or preexisting conditions. However, there is still work to be done.   Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. While the Affordable Care Act  has brought us closer to universal coverage, we must build on this  progress. In the coming months I look forward to working with my  colleagues in the House to make clear that we need to move away from  our profit-driven healthcare system toward a society where affordable,  high quality care is the birthright of every single child, woman, and  man in this country.                            ____________________
