 Mr. Speaker, as a 30-year law enforcement veteran, the  rhetoric and hatred I have seen toward law enforcement the past 12  months are, quite honestly, infuriating.   Liberal cities across our country have defunded hundreds of millions  from their police. Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, Austin, they all cut  police budgets, and every single one of them is now experiencing  skyrocketing crime.   No surprise. Less police equal more crime, common sense that doesn't  seem all too common in today's Democratic Party.   Whatever happened to the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton? In 1994,  Clinton added 100,000 law enforcement officers to the streets with the  COPS grants. Today's Democratic Party is unrecognizable to that party.   The socialist squad is the de facto leaders of the Democrats, and  they are the driving force behind the defund the police movement. They  would rather see 100,000 less police than 100,000 more.   The Republican Party has never wavered in our steadfast support for  our Nation's law enforcement. I hope to see the Democrats will one day  embrace common sense and join us.                            ____________________
