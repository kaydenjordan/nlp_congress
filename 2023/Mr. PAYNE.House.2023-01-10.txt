 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the Republican  decision to cut funding from the Internal Revenue Service.   This funding was part of President Biden's critical Inflation  Reduction Act. The $80 billion for the IRS enforcement would have  forced tax-cheating corporations and wealthy Americans to finally pay  their fair share. Instead, Republicans chose to rescind $72 billion of  that money and forced a 2 percent cut to the agency funding in the last  spending package.   The IRS support would have collected billions in taxes, boosted our  economy, and lowered the Nation's debt ceiling, issues that the  Republicans claim are important.   Instead, this vote shows Republicans prefer to protect the tax- evading secrets of the wealthiest 1 percent and not give tax breaks to  hardworking American families that need it the most. It makes them  shameless corporate stewards and embarrassing public officials.                            ____________________
