 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Mr.  Huizenga's amendment. I think it is logical what he is saying.   I rise, again, in strong support of my amendment to this bill, as  well, No. 31, to seek to identify ways in which Puerto Rico can further  increase air cargo operations in our three international airports, and  thus, better serve domestic and international stakeholders and  consumers.   Specifically, this amendment authorizes a GAO report that will look  at recommendations for security measures that may be necessary to  support increased air cargo operations in Puerto Rico, airport  infrastructure improvements that may be needed, alternatives to  increase private stakeholder engagement, and the potential need for  additional staff.   Airports are drivers of economic activity across our country. My  amendment will support Puerto Rico and the Nation as we continue to  find ways to generate greater opportunities for financial and  infrastructure investments.   This section requires an assessment from the FAA on the resiliency of  coastal airports, including those on our island.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues for  supporting en bloc No. 2, and I urge support for the underlying bill.
