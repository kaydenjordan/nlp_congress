 Madam President, the January 26, 2023, issue of ``Roll  Call'' included an interview with David Carle, who is retiring from the  Senate after 45 years as a congressional press secretary, the last 26  years as Senator Leahy's communications director. I want to pay tribute  to David, who long remained out of the limelight but who played an  indispensable role, day in and day out, translating the often arcane  business of the Congress into concise, coherent prose for Vermonters  and countless others in this country and around the world.   As the interview notes, David arrived at Senator Leahy's office after  serving for 12 years in a similar capacity for Senator Paul Simon of  Illinois, whom David admired greatly. In fact, when Senator Leahy  retired on January 3, David was the longest serving press secretary in  U.S. Senate history. That is an extraordinary accomplishment and a  testament to his devotion to his work, to the Congress, and to the  country.   An outstanding writer and editor, David was always attuned to the  interests of Vermonters and the political sensitivities of  controversial issues and votes. He not only brought an inherent talent  for communicating in plain-spoken and compelling language, but  underlying everything he wrote was a deep commitment to defending the  principles this country stands for, particularly the First Amendment.   David was also a mentor to aspiring communications staff, who under  his tutelage learned the nuts and bolts of interfacing with traditional  and social media outlets. Several of them have gone on to become  communications directors for other Members of Congress.   The people of Vermont owe David their thanks, as do all of us in the  Congress who have benefited from his unflinching example of  professionalism, dedication, and integrity.   I ask unanimous consent that the Roll Call interview with David Carle  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From Roll Call, Jan. 26, 2023]          After 45 Years on the Hill, David Carle Has Seen It All                               (By Jim Saksa)         When David Carle started out as a press secretary on the       Hill, the mimeo machine was still in the attic of Longworth       and Democrats still dominated in places like Utah.        When the longtime aide retired this month, only three       lawmakers could beat his 45 years of service: his (also       retiring) boss Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., plus Sens. Chuck       Grassley, R-Iowa, and Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.        In between, fax machines came and went, along with       thousands of his fellow staffers, but Carle stuck with       Congress.        Carle spent the last 26 years at Leahy's side as his       communications director, where he witnessed firsthand how       both the Senate and the media that covers it have changed,       for good and ill.        Carle took a few moments to reflect on his lifetime in the       Capitol with CQ Roll Call late last year. He shared what       first drew him to Congress and what kept him there for so       long.        Q: What drew you to Congress?        A: I've been on the Hill since 1977. I was born in Utah,       but moved away to Ohio when I was 5. My dad initially was the       press secretary for Akron Public Schools, and so journalism       was always in my blood.        I took advantage of a lot of internships in college and       graduate school. I was a governor's intern in Utah, and I won       an internship with the Deseret News. Later I worked at the       big powerhouse Clear Channel station in Salt Lake City.        So I've always had an interest in both politics and       journalism. Back then it was less common to cross over       between the two, and I was concerned about that.        Q: How did you end up making the leap?        A: Over the summer of '77, I had a fellowship at the       Interior Department. I thought I would only be in Washington       for a little while, so I literally went to every single       Smithsonian museum and took in as much as I could.        The fellowship was running out, and I was due to go back to       graduate school that fall. I thought, well, let me just sound       out somebody I've admired in the Utah delegation, Gunn McKay.        Back then, if you can believe it, Utah had a three-to-one       Democratic majority in Congress, and now it's become one of       the most Republican states. I was hired as a press assistant.       I still belong to Sigma Delta Chi, the journalism fraternity,       but I've stayed in politics ever since.        Q: What made you stay? You could have cashed out.        A: That's a common pattern with communications directors:       work here for a while and then move downtown to a public       affairs firm. But I've always been more interested in working       in government. For those firms, you have several bosses,       several clients. I liked finding somebody I really respected.        Q: You've been here longer than most actual senators.       What's it been like seeing this institution evolve and       change?        A: When I first started with [Illinois Democratic Rep.]       Paul Simon, he had a weekly column. He was a publisher of a       small newspaper in Illinois. And my job as press secretary       was to take the column up in the dark, hot attic of the       Longworth Building where we had a mimeo machine and also an       addressograph, where you put cards in and the envelopes are       addressed.        There was a lot of manual labor involved with being a press       secretary back then. You were dealing with newspapers and TV       stations by mail, and sometimes by fax--you know, those       stinky round machines that you clip a page in, turn it on and       it spins, and then it's got coated paper that stinks. We also       used alligator clips on a regular phone to send radio       actualities to radio stations.        When Paul moved over to the Senate in 1985, we had a dozen       major media markets in Illinois, and all of them had a       presence in Washington. The Sun-Times alone had 17 people at       one point in their bureau. And now it's down to one person,       Lynn Sweet. But there has also been an explosion of other       news organizations, given what's happened  [[Page S226]]       with the internet. I think there are more reporters covering       the Hill in one way or another now than there were back then.        Q: Your next job was with Leahy, and you worked for him for       26 years. What moments stand out?        A: After the plane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, we [evacuated       the Capitol] and walked to my house a few blocks away. It was       the senator and a few other senior aides, and all we could do       was watch television to try to find out what was happening.       This was before everyone had BlackBerries.        He tended to have people stay longer on staff than other       senators do. And he also had a reputation for attracting good       people, like John Podesta, who went on to be Bill Clinton's       chief of staff, and George Tenet, who went on to be CIA       director.        It was very rewarding to work with him on what I call the       white hat projects, like the Innocence Protection Act and the       landmine crusade.        I've been on very few CODELs, but the first one I went on       was to Ottawa, where Lloyd Axworthy, the foreign minister of       Canada, picked up on Leahy's legislation--the first in the       world to ban the export of landmines. And Leahy still pesters       every president to sign the Mine Ban Treaty. Some recent       Democratic presidents have inched toward that, but there's       always a big carveout for South Korea.        Q: How do you feel about the direction things are going on       the Hill?        A: I feel, as Sen. Leahy does, as he said in his farewell       speech, that the Senate in some ways is broken. It was never       perfect--he entered at a time when segregationists were       running committees, and he was part of the reform effort that       Walter Mondale led to bring the filibuster threshold down       from 67 to 60.        But now we have the rancor and the bumper sticker politics,       with people playing for a soundbite. Senators don't spend as       much time with each other and each other's families as they       used to, and the filibuster is abused.        Q: You're still playing press secretary, after all these       years. What are your own thoughts on where Congress is       headed?        A: When I was in ninth grade, our English class learned       what propaganda is and how to look at sources. So I'm kind of       shocked at how little media literacy there is these days. I       think people need to be more discriminating consumers of       news. I'm concerned about anti-science bias and media       literacy.        Q: What's next for you?        A: My dad is 92 years old, so I'll spend more time with       him. And I'll do some writing.        I've enjoyed the work. I'm a generalist by nature, and       being a press secretary, you have the opportunity to learn       something new every day. I feel so grateful for this       experience that I had. This has been a dream job with a dream       boss, working on issues that really made a difference. And       I'll never tire of seeing the Capitol lit up at night.                            ____________________
