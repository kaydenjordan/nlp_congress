 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 806.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Illinois?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 451 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 806.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1438                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 806) to facilitate efficient State implementation of ground-level  ozone standards, and for other purposes, with Mr. Reed in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) and the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Tonko) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 806, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of  2017, is about ensuring effective implementation of our air quality  standards.   We have learned that timelines and procedures established almost 30  years ago can be counterproductive today, resulting in unnecessary  costs, regulatory delay, and economic uncertainty.   H.R. 806 ensures we will continue to deliver effective environmental  protections, with reforms that will also help expand economic  opportunity in communities around the Nation.   H.R. 806 removes barriers to the planning and permitting of new or  expanded manufacturing facilities and to related economic activity  essential for building out America's infrastructure.   The bill's reforms reflect practical improvements to the law  suggested by State and local regulators, who have confronted the  growing challenges of implementing multiple air quality standards under  multiple implementation plans and under tight statutory deadlines. As a  result, these challenges have increased, and it has become more  difficult for many areas to enable the economic expansion needed for  their communities. This bill takes several sensible steps to fix this  situation.   First, it extends the date for final designations for the 2015 ozone  standards to 2025. This allows States time to implement the 2008 ozone  standards and other measures to improve air quality. The provisions  align requirements for new source construction permitting with this  phased ozone schedule, which will reduce permitting delays and still  ensure the use of the best available emissions control technologies.  The provisions would require timely issuance of implementation  guidelines by EPA so States can plan effectively.   Second, the bill aligns the air quality standard setting with how the  process works in practice, and it ensures fuller information about  regulatory impacts. For example, it updates the mandatory review of air  quality standards to reflect past experience by extending the  requirement to 10 years, and preserves the EPA administrator's  discretion to issue revised standards earlier, if necessary. The bill  ensures the administrator, prior to revising an air quality standard,  obtains advice from the EPA's Independent Science Advisory Committee  about any adverse effects on jobs, welfare, and other economic impacts  related to implementing the standards.   Finally, the bill takes several steps to address some of the problems  communities face when working to meet the standards. For example, it  ensures that, for certain ozone and particulate matter nonattainment  areas, States are not required to include economically infeasible  measures in their plans; it ensures that States may seek relief with  respect to certain exceptional events, including droughts; and it  directs EPA to examine the impacts of foreign emissions on standards  compliance, ozone formation, and identify effective control strategies,  including ways to facilitate EPA review to avoid unnecessary penalties  for foreign emissions.  [[Page H5944]]    The bill also helps communities with most severe air quality  challenges that are doing the most to clean up their air by providing a  reasonable way to avoid burdensome and unnecessary sanctions, which  harm their ability to grow their economies and create jobs.    The provisions of H.R. 806 represent important steps to update the  Clean Air Act to reflect what we have learned over the past 25 years  since its last major revisions.   There is more work to be done to modernize environmental laws, but  ensuring orderly implementation of air quality standards is an  important place to start and essential in our environment and our  economy.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this important bill today,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to highlight a few specific  things.   One is the standards established by the EPA remains unchanged. The  real premise of this bill is the fact that, when the 2008 standards  came out, it took the EPA 7 years to get to the guidelines for how  local communities and businesses could comply. While that was  occurring, they ratcheted down a new set of standards.   So when we talk, this is really more about having our citizens and  our communities be able to comply with the rules and regs before a new  rule and reg gets in place.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs).                                time  1500     Mr. Chairman, let me just remind my colleagues that--why  10 years? I mean, that is a good question.   When the 2008 standards came out, it took the administration 7 years,  to 2015, to tell people how to even implement the 2008 standards. Then,  3 months later, they say: Oh, no, we are going to have a new standard  set at 2015.   So this debate doesn't reduce or roll back. It says, let's let the  EPA establish standards and then give communities time to comply. That  is all this bill does.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia  (Mr. McKinley).   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, today the House will vote on a bill  addressing the ozone standards issued by the Obama administration.   Look, with the comments you have heard today, we all want clean air.  But America has made great strides already. Ozone is down by one-third  since 1980.   But the regulations imposed by President Obama in 2015 would cost the  economy billions of dollars each year and hamper job growth. In many  parts of the country, it is literally impossible to meet the new  standards due to the background levels of ozone.   Much of the country, as you just heard the chairman talk about, was  still trying to comply with the previous standard when, suddenly, a new  level was imposed. This has resulted in confusion and duplication.    The bill that is before us this afternoon provides a commonsense  approach. It delays the implementation, but, more importantly, it gives  the States flexibility to deal with this issue. It revises the  timeframe for changing standards from 5 years to 10 years. That is all.  It requires the EPA to consider--very important--the economic and  technical feasibility of the new standards.   So, Mr. Chairman, passing this bill today will remove a barrier to  economic growth while, at the same time, still protecting our  environment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chairman, let me just remind folks that what is  going on here is that we have a 2008 standard that we were told 7 years  afterwards: Here is how you comply.   That same year, we get new standards saying: Oh, no, no, no. You have  got new standards lower than what it took us 7 years to define.   That is really the debate. We are not eliminating standards, we are  not rolling back standards, we are just saying: Give us a break. Give  us time to comply with the 2008 standards before you even force down  the 2015 standards. Nothing in this bill rolls back either of those  standards.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from South Carolina  (Mr. Sanford).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader of the House.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time  and for his work.   Mr. Chair, when you drive up north through and past my district in  California, you go through some amazing places--Sequoia National Park,  Kings Canyon, then right on over to Yosemite. These are beautiful  places. American treasures. You don't have to go far off the road to  feel like you are remote and completely surrounded by the peacefulness  of nature.   I have had my troubles with the EPA--regulatory cap and trade, waters  of the U.S. rule. They are a couple that come to mind. But I do think  and believe there is a purpose to ozone standards that clean up our air  and make our communities healthier.   Yet the latest ozone and particulate matter regulations are so severe  and divorced from reality that even the national parks like Sequoia,  Kings Canyon, and Yosemite may not be clean enough. If such pristine  nature isn't clean, nothing can be.   The problem is that the EPA sets new standards before we reach the  old ones, and even before we have the technology to reach the new  standards, the only result will be failure.   California's Central Valley faces many disadvantages with air  quality. We have prevailing winds from the north to send us pollution  from San Francisco, and because of our topography, it traps it all in.  But we have made some amazing progress. Good days, when ozone isn't a  problem, are up 144 percent since 2002. Unhealthy ones are down over 75  percent in the same period. You see similar trends in particulate  matter as well.   But no matter how much better we make our air, we cannot catch up to  reach the latest unrealistic EPA hurdles. The head of the San Joaquin  Valley Air Pollution Control District said that, to do so, we would  have to stop all fossil fuel combustion in the Central Valley. If we  don't do that, don't stop all industry, stop building, stop businesses,  and even stop driving our cars, you know what will happen? We will be  punished, and we will be fined for where we live.   Now, something obviously has to change because these regulations are  not rooted in reality. In this legislation, Mr. Chair, Congressman Pete  Olson's Ozone Standards Implementation Act, we don't get rid of ozone  or particulate matter standards, we don't even oppose raising our  standards when we use our technology and abilities to improve. What we  do is make sure that the standards are set with a specific level for a  set time so that the EPA cannot come back and change the goalpost every  few years.   What we do is make sure that the EPA actually determines whether  something is technologically possible when setting new attainment  deadlines. What we do is make sure we aren't penalized for all things  affecting our air that we can't control.                                time  1530    We made sure that this legislation accomplished these goals without  rolling back the protections for our communities or without backsliding  on meeting current EPA standards in the Central Valley.   In the end, we must have clean air, but we have to be smart with this  and set achievable and fixed goals our communities can meet. Building  on our success, the people of our district and across America can  continue to have cleaner air tomorrow than we do today.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would first of all like to thank my colleague from New York who  serves as the ranking member of the committee. We have done some good  work together that we look forward to bringing to the floor in a more  amicable setting. Obviously, this one is not. I wish it could have  been, but so the public policy world goes.   Let me, in my remaining time, highlight some of the organizations  that are supporting our action. Through the committee process, we had  the Farm Bureau, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Fuel &  Petrochemical Manufacturers, the Portland Cement Association, National  Association of Manufacturers, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce express  the need to reform and modernize the Clean air Act in order to  encourage economic growth and job creation, because we understand that  what has, also, a major impact on health and welfare is our citizens  having good-paying jobs.   There is a focus on what we are trying to do as Republicans through  the legislative process, and we want to reduce the tax burdens, to ease  the regulatory burdens, and to create jobs so that all of our citizens  are able to achieve their economic goals and aspirations.   We also received a letter today that I include in the Record from  over 145 organizations and over close to 20 State chambers of commerce.                                                      July 18, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, and Minority       Leaders  [[Page H5953]]       Schumer and Pelosi: The undersigned, which represent a       diverse group of industries from across the country, write to       express our strong support for H.R. 806 and S. 263, the       ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017.'' This       legislation provides a common-sense approach for implementing       national ambient air quality standards, recognizes ongoing       state efforts to improve air quality through a reasonable       implementation schedule for the 2015 ozone standards,       streamlines the air permitting process for businesses to       expand operations and create jobs, and includes other reforms       that bring more regulatory certainty to federal air quality       standards. Additionally, the undersigned support language       including certain elements of H.R. 806 and S. 263 included in       the Fiscal Year 2018 Interior, Environment and Related       Agencies Appropriations bill.        We have significant concerns that the 2015 ozone standards       overlap with existing state plans to implement the 2008 ozone       standards, leading to duplicative and wasteful implementation       schedules, and unnecessary and severe economic impacts. The       new ozone standards were promulgated in October 2015, only       months after states received their final guidance from the       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on how to implement the       2008 ozone standards. This delay was the result of the Obama       administration's decision to halt work on the 2008 ozone       standards during a 2010-2011 reconsideration period. The EPA,       however, did not account for this self-imposed delay when       issuing the 2015 ozone standards, thereby imposing       duplicative costs and burdens of implementing multiple       standards simultaneously. This is particularly wasteful as       the EPA itself projects that nearly the entire country would       attain the 2015 ozone standards simply by being provided an       opportunity to fully implement already-planned measures like       their state implementation plans for the 2008 ozone       standards. Local economies also face severe impacts, as       analysis of data indicates that the 2015 ozone standards       could expand nonattainment to more than 950 counties if       planned reductions are not allowed time to take effect,       subjecting large parts of the country to costly nonattainment       control requirements.        Notwithstanding concerns expressed by thousands of elected       officials, state agencies, businesses, community groups, and       other stakeholders, the EPA issued the 2015 ozone standards       without addressing the overlap with the 2008 ozone standards       and the enormous impacts that dual implementation would have       on limited state resources, permitting, and the economy. It       is now up to Congress to address these issues, and that is       why we support H.R. 806 and S. 263. By better aligning the       2015 ozone standards with the 2008 ozone standards and their       associated emissions reductions, H.R. 806 and S. 263 will       help prevent unnecessary nonattainment designations and cost       burdens, without sacrificing environmental protection. The       legislation's permitting relief and other reforms are also an       important step towards national ambient air quality standards       that balance environmental protection and economic       development.        In sum, H.R. 806 and S. 263 and the related appropriations       language provide a common-sense plan that maintains continued       air quality improvement without unnecessarily straining state       and local economic resources.        We strongly encourage Congress to act quickly on this       critical legislation.

If I may, in the middle paragraph it says: ``We have  significant concerns that the 2015 ozone standards overlap with  existing State plans to implement the 2008 ozone standards, leading to  duplicative and wasteful implementation schedules, and unnecessary and  severe economic impacts. The new ozone standards were promulgated in  October of 2015, only months after States received their final guidance  from the Environmental Protection Agency on how to implement the 2008  ozone standards.''   Mr. Chairman, I couldn't say it any better than that. This is not, as  I have said a couple of times, a rolling back of our regulations. This  is identifying the fact that 2008 standards were implemented. It took 7  years to do the implementation guidelines, and when those guidelines  came out 3 months after that, the Federal Government, through the EPA  said, oh, we are going to now ratchet it down 5 more parts per billion,  which leads you to believe that people are trying to comply.   Other benefits of this bill address the fact that you could be in the  remotest parts of the country and fall against the EPA and ozone  standards based upon nothing that you can do. We have communities that  are trying to comply, are doing great work, but they are receiving  emissions outside of their control. Plus, they will be penalized for  that.   So we look forward to continued debates. I know that there have been  amendments offered that we will consider.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.  [[Page H5954]]    In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by  the Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the bill, it shall be  in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment  under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute  consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-26.

(f) Plan Submissions and Requirements for Ozone       Nonattainment Areas.--Section 182 of the Clean Air Act (42       U.S.C. 7511a) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii)(III), by inserting ``and       economic feasibility'' after ``technological achievability'';        (2) in subsection (c)(2)(B)(ii), by inserting ``and       economic feasibility'' after ``technological achievability'';        (3) in subsection (e), in the matter preceding paragraph       (1)--        (A) by striking ``The provisions of clause (ii) of       subsection (c)(2)(B) (relating to reductions of less than 3       percent), the provisions of paragaphs'' and inserting ``The       provisions of paragraphs''; and        (B) by striking ``, and the provisions of clause (ii) of       subsection (b)(1)(A) (relating to reductions of less than 15       percent)''; and        (4) in paragraph (5) of subsection (e), by striking ``, if       the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the       Administrator that--'' and all that follows through the end       of the paragraph and inserting a period.        (g) Plan Revisions for Milestones for Particulate Matter       Nonattainment Areas.--Section 189(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act       (42 U.S.C. 7513a(c)(1)) is amended by inserting ``, which       take into account technological achievability and economic       feasibility,'' before ``and which demonstrate reasonable       further progress''.        (h) Exceptional Events.--Section 319(b)(1)(B) of the Clean       Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7619(b)(1)(B)) is amended--        (1) in clause (i)--        (A) by striking ``(i) stagnation of air masses or'' and       inserting ``(i)(I) ordinarily occurring stagnation of air       masses or (II)''; and        (B) by inserting ``or'' after the semicolon;        (2) by striking clause (ii); and        (3) by redesignating clause (iii) as clause (ii).

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act and the amendments       made by this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out       using amounts otherwise authorized.    The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 115- 229. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in  the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered  read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally  divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be  subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division  of the question.               Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Castor of Florida    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in House Report 115-229.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague, and I don't  question her passion and her evaluation of her perception about what we  are doing.   But again, as I have said in general debate, nothing in this bill  rolls back the 2008 standards; nothing rolls back the 2015 standards.  The attempt is to say: Why is it so difficult to believe that we should  meet the 2008 standards and give our communities time to do that before  we throw on them a new 2015 standard? So that is the basic premise.   This amendment would allow the advisory panel to nullify one of the  central provisions of the bill, section 2(a), which allows States to  fully implement the 2008 ozone standards for which EPA only issued the  implementing regulations in 2015 before turning to 2015.   So EPA says meet the 2008 standards. Delay, delay, delay; don't know  how to do it; no guidelines. 2015 comes, they say meet the 2008  standards; 3 months later, oh, but now we have got 2015 standards we  want you to comply with. That is the basic premise of this bill.                                time  1545    Ozone air quality will continue to improve under H.R. 806. Regarding  the 2015 standards, the EPA projects the vast majority of U.S. counties  will meet the 2015 ozone standards by 2025 just with the rules and  programs now in place or underway.   The bill ensures hundreds of counties are on track to meeting the  2015 standards, and that can come into compliance without being  subjected to additional regulatory burdens, paper requirements, or  restrictions, which will not do anything to improve public health.   The bill also does not limit States from imposing more stringent  emission requirements if a State finds that such a condition exists in  section 2. Nowhere does the bill authorize States to increase their  emissions. This is not about continuing to improve air quality in a  manner that doesn't require the States to duplicate paperwork  requirements.   Since 1980, ozone levels have declined 32 percent, and as we talk  about in the environmental process, the low-hanging fruit has been  picked. It gets more and more difficult as you start reducing the  standards time, effort, energy, and technology.   So with the reduction of 32 percent by 1980, the EPA projects air  quality ``will continue to improve over the next decade as additional  reductions in ozone precursors from power plants, motor vehicles, and  other sources are realized.''   Nothing in the pending bill prevents these improvements to air  quality from being realized.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, under the Clean Air Act, section 319  provides relief to areas that violate National Ambient Air Quality  Standards due to unusual or naturally occurring events as that they  cannot control.   Section 3(h) would add--and I would argue strengthens the  definition--droughts and extraordinary stagnation to the act's  definition of an exceptional event.   Let me give you an example. In 2012, there was a major drought in the  Midwest. Now, I am from corn country, and  [[Page H5958]]  we don't irrigate our corn because we have got great soil, and we have  got weather conditions for most of the years that provide plentiful  rain for that to happen. But that didn't happen in 2012. It was an  extraordinary event. It was a drought.   Now the question is posed: Should we punish the communities for an  extraordinary event; i.e., a drought that is out of the control of any  human being?   It is an ``extraordinary event.'' This language would provide  reasonable relief for States in this condition, particularly those in  the Western United States for, as I said, events beyond their control.   Nothing in H.R. 806 does away with the detailed statutory  requirements under section 319(h) of the Clean Air Act for  demonstrating ``an exceptional event.'' Nor does anything in the bill  do away with the detailed regulatory procedures and guidelines that the  EPA has laid out for demonstrating exceptional events or the  requirements to measure air quality or to make that air quality data  available to the public.                                time  1600    This provision simply ensures citizens in areas experiencing unusual  or natural occurring events beyond their control do not become subject  to penalties or sanctions under the Clean Air Act as a result of those  events.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague. Again, he was  on the floor when I talked about the great work I do with subcommittee  members. Obviously, this is part of the debate where we are agreeing to  disagree.   I will just say that air quality standards are put in place so that  there are things that we can effect and we can deal with through mobile  emissions, as you would probably know about, as stationary sources.   Exceptional events, such as droughts, are out of our control. That is  why we think it should be placed into the language. We do believe it  strengthens the provision of the law, doesn't weaken it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Tipton). The gentleman from Illinois is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the subject of H.R. 806 is criteria  pollutants and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards program, not  the hazardous air pollutants programs, which my colleague is referring  to.   These two programs are addressed under different sections of the  Clean Air Act. The whole title is Clean Air Act, but you have one  section here dealing with national ambient air quality, and then you  have another section on hazardous air aspects, which is what my  colleague is trying to address. Criteria pollutants are addressed under  section 107 and 110 and part C and D of title 1 of the Clean Air Act,  while hazardous air pollutants fall under section 12.   This amendment, moreover, is wholly unrelated to the purpose of H.R.  806, which is to provide State regulators with additional time and  flexibility, as we have heard throughout this debate, to implement  ozone and other standards for criteria pollutants.   H.R. 806 makes process-related reforms to address practical  implementation challenges identified by State regulators. This  amendment would make substantive changes relating specifically to  regulation of the oil and gas sector.   This amendment would make significant changes to the Clean Air Act  that did not receive any Energy and Commerce Committee consideration  during the markup of this bill.   The amendment would also circumvent the established regulatory  process for listing new hazardous air pollutants set forth under the  Clean Air Act.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, to my colleague from Colorado, sitting in  with the Rules Committee yesterday, the question was asked: Would you  accept this amendment or would you not? I said: I appreciate my  colleagues on the Rules Committee. They will do the due diligence in  agreeing which amendment comes to the floor or not.   So it is good to see the Rules Committee has so much comradery and  comity that they would allow someone from the committee to offer an  amendment on the bill, but I still have to object because it splits  this bill and tries to bring in air issues that are in the hazardous  air program and jam it into this one where, basically, what we are  trying to do is send a signal and allow communities to meet the 2008  standards before a new 2015 standard gets placed upon them 3 months  after they do the implementing guidelines.   It is really a process, a bill that makes it easier for people to  comply. It really helps EPA more easily be able to evaluate the data  and move us forward to a cleaner environment.   Mr. Chair, I reluctantly hold my position that we should vote against  the Polis amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague for his  impassioned discussion, especially of his area. We all have a lot of  friends here. It is hard for the public to believe I am on both sides  of the aisle, so it  [[Page H5962]]  saddens me to have to speak in opposition to this amendment.   This is doing, similarly, what I had to address with Congressman  Polis in that it is taking a bill in which we are trying to streamline  the processes and then somehow creating a grant program out of the  money. I don't know where this money is coming from, whether it is  coming from the supposed savings from nonimplementation.   But as my colleague from Texas mentioned, the process, as you  followed through the committee, is to say: How do you force people who  are just told how to comply with 2008 standards, how do you then turn  around and give them 2015 standards when they were just told how to  comply 3 months prior?   And so what we have tried to do in this piece of legislation is to  say let's allow people to move forward on 2008 while making sure that  the 2015 standards occur with a deadline of 2025. That is the basic  premise.   And it also addresses the issue of, and I know, there are parts of  the country where they can do all that they can do and they are not  going to meet the standards because of what is being imported from  other regions, maybe, in your case, from Asia or from San Francisco or  those areas. So how do you end up punishing an area when they are doing  everything that they humanly can do?   There is some great, obviously, statistics that you have shared of  the success in that region, although they are still stressed under the  current standards.                                time  1630    So your amendment would eliminate the widely supported reforms in  this bill. And I read, and we will have submitted for the Record, the  145-plus organizations that support it, plus the five or ten that we  addressed earlier from the markup, and then really kind of apply only  to a few parts of the country versus the entire country as a whole.   Across the Nation, States and communities struggle to implement these  standards, and we are trying to streamline that process. This amendment  would deprive communities across the Nation of the benefits of H.R.  806. It would reduce red tape, relief from the sanctions and penalties  for emissions that are outside their control, as I said earlier, and  streamline the implementation of the standards.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friend and colleague. I know it is a tough  environment we are trying to address, especially some of those  concerns.   Mr. Chair, I still urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1\1/2\ minutes  remaining.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, clearly everybody wants clean air, and I  don't doubt that for a second, and I appreciate the effort that is  being made to streamline the implementation of clean air. But my  questions are: Is this going to be a message bill? Or is this something  we are actually going to get signed into law?   And my answer rhetorically is that if you want to get something  signed into law, you really have to work on both sides of the aisle.   Now, there are a couple provisions in the bill that I think are  completely objectionable. There may be room for compromise. The 10-year  extension seems out of bounds to me. Technology moves much faster than  10 years. The idea that technical achievability can be taken into  account really does lose sight of the important aspect of the Clean Air  Act, which is that we want to protect people's health.   So among other things, if you want to actually get something done, if  you want to actually work across the aisle and get something that we  may get signed into law, work with us. Otherwise, I am going to have to  put forward this amendment that replaces the ozone 805 and replaces it  with something that actually works.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I agree with my colleague that this  doesn't rise to the standard of the other bills that we will be  bringing in a bipartisan manner, and we kind of raised that initially  at the beginning. And it is, I think, to both of our losses.   But having said that, my colleague, Congressman Olson, the author of  the bill, did get a couple Democrats to sponsor the primary piece of  legislation, and there is a Senate companion bill, S. 263, which we  hope will be passed by the Senate. So we are a little more optimistic  that this can get over the finish line than Mr. McNerney might be, but,  again, we will continue to work together where we can work together,  and respectfully disagree when we have disagreements.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).   The amendment was rejected.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair    The Acting CHAIR.

There is 1 minute remaining.                                time  1720    So the amendment was rejected.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute.   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Hultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. Womack, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state  [[Page H5966]]  of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 806) to facilitate efficient State  implementation of ground-level ozone standards, and for other purposes,  and, pursuant to House Resolution 451, he reported the bill back to the  House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute.   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues and friends, I appreciate  the debate. Those who followed it here, just a couple of points.   The question is: Why are we here today?   In 2008, the EPA established ozone standards, and then it took the  EPA 7 years to tell communities how to comply with those 2008  standards. It is the truth. I am just telling you the truth.   Three months later, after they told the communities how to comply,  they said: Now we are going to give you 2015 standards.   That is why we are here. We are just here trying to say that if the  EPA is going to establish standards, then they ought to say: We are  going to give you the guidelines on how to comply now, not 7 years  later.   So what this bill does is allow communities to meet the 2008  standards. It doesn't roll back any standards. It says meet the 2008  standards. In fact, we don't even say roll back the 2015 standards. We  just say, give the communities time to comply with the 2015 standards.   This motion is a distraction. Let's reject it, and move to pass the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 18, 2017, on page H5966, the following appeared: objection,  the previous question is ordered.
