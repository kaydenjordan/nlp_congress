 Mr. Chairman, I rise to support H.R. 3621, a  bill that provides strong consumer protection for our Nation's  borrowers.   Often, we talk about access to capital and how many communities  across this country are either underbanked or shut out of the credit  market altogether. This bill goes further than any other piece of  legislation we have seen in protecting our Nation's student loan  borrowers, potential hires from biased credit reporting, and  guaranteeing that consumers have the necessary information to make  informed financial decisions.   I am particularly thankful that this legislation includes my bill,  H.R. 3614, that will limit the use of credit reports and credit scores  to make hiring decisions.   As with access to capital, there are many barriers in accessing  employment opportunities, particularly for communities of color and  other marginalized groups based on several factors. One of these  factors includes an individual's credit history.   Many people have fallen on hard times, had their identities stolen,  or have become ill, which have negatively impacted their credit  reports. But I ask, should that also impact their ability to become  employed?   Should an arbitrary number based on obscure algorithms that make up a  credit score shut someone out of being employed? The answer is no.   That is why this bill prohibits certain employers from using credit  history to determine someone's eligibility to be employed. This bill is  a much-needed solution in removing employment barriers.   As we move forward, I will continue to work with stakeholders to  protect job applicants while also guaranteeing that organizations and  companies can vet potential applicants adequately.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Congresswoman Pressley, Chairwoman Waters, and  the committee staff who have worked tirelessly into the night to help  draft this bill. I thank them for their advocacy on behalf of the  Nation's consumers.   It is about time we help people gain greater access to the job  market.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment.   As we know, the three major credit rating agencies, Equifax,  Experian, and TransUnion, retain credit profile information on more  than 200 million Americans.   The underlying bill represents a comprehensive reform of our Nation's  credit reporting system. This amendment would direct the GAO to review  just how well the credit reporting agencies are complying with these  new requirements and how that affects consumers.   We know that the credit reporting agencies have not been complying  with the law today. For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act contains  provisions requiring credit reports to be accurate, but it is estimated  that more than 42 million Americans have inaccurate credit reports.   The credit reporting agencies need to do better by consumers, and if  they did, perhaps consumer reporting problems would not consistently  rank in the top three of consumer complaints to the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau.   Mr. Chair, I support this study. If adopted, I hope that Mr. Timmons  would also support the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, in closing, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I rise to support Mr. Steil's and  Mr. McAdams' amendment.   Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan amendment would add clarity to title VI  of the bill that addresses restricting the use of credit reports in  most employment decisions.   As we know, in many cases, the use of credit reports unnecessarily  exposes consumers' financial information and potentially puts existing  employees and job applicants in an uncomfortable position of having to  discuss private matters such as: divorce; domestic abuse; or health and  genetic conditions in explaining their impaired credit history.   While financial events that cause diverse information to land on the  credit profile do not determine alone what value the person can bring  to an employer, there are some circumstances where financial background  is more relevant to a job.   While this bill already contains exemptions that address this, such  as exemptions when the credit file is needed for national security, or  is otherwise required for Federal or State or local laws or  regulations, we were able to draft a bipartisan compromise that adds a  tailored exemption if Federal, State, or local laws or regulations  require an investigation for financial information of an employee.   This compromise strikes the right balance of commonsense solutions  without creating loopholes that would hurt consumers.   I want to thank Representative Steil and Representative McAdams for  their work on this, and hope Mr. Steil will vote for the underlying  bill if the amendment is adopted.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment will allow for  more time for private student loan borrowers in the process of  rehabilitating their loans to repay their loans when also impacted by a  geographical disaster or emergency.   By changing the language from when a disaster or emergency is  federally declared to when the actual disaster began, private student  loan borrowers will have more time outside of when an emergency is  officially federally declared to explain and have their situation taken  into consideration for hardship.   For example, it was a shame that it took President Trump more than 2  weeks to declare the major disaster declaration after Puerto Rico  received a string of earthquakes beginning December 28. Consumers  should not be penalized by politics when they are in dire need for  help.   As climate change and other disasters continue to have devastating  consequences across this country, students who are demonstrating that  they can rehabilitate their loans and improve their credit scores  should not have to additionally suffer because extreme events like  these cause hardships that would reasonably interrupt a payment.   It can take years for communities to recover from natural and other  disasters, and this amendment further allows victims of these disasters  the time that they deserve, a fair chance to improve their credit  scores and future credit opportunities.   I support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Panetta) having assumed the chair, Mr. Payne, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3621) to  amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to remove adverse information for  certain defaulted or delinquent private education loan borrowers who  demonstrate a history of loan repayment, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
