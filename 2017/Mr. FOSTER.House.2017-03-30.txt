 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am opposed.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   This amendment is a commonsense and logical addition to this bill. It  will help ensure that members of the EPA's Science Advisory Board will  act in the best interests of the American people and our environment.   I think that we can all agree that, now more than ever, we need  integrity in government. And this amendment would simply prohibit any  member of the EPA's Science Advisory Board from being employed by any  entity, corporate or otherwise, which has interests before the Board.  This prohibition would be in place during the member's time on the  Board and would extend for 3 years after they leave the Board.   My Republican colleagues have taken up this bill with the stated  intent of protecting the scientific integrity of the EPA, and this  amendment will go a long way to making sure that they keep their word.   The underlying bill also includes a similar prohibition on board  members applying for a grant or contract from the EPA during their  service or for 3 years after. And as the chairman just said, there is  nothing wrong with a financial cooling-off period.   However, the authors of this bill are apparently concerned that  members of the Board would be tempted to favor environmental concerns  in the hopes of getting an EPA grant. Therefore, it also stands to  reason that they should worry equally about a board member tilting the  scales in favor of a specific industry in return for future financial  compensation or career advancement, the classic revolving door problem.   So what this motion to recommit does is something that I think we all  should be able to agree is a good thing. We have seen too many people  in the President's Cabinet who appear to have connections too close to  the big interests they regulate rather than the interests of the  American people.   This amendment would ensure that no one can unduly personally profit  from their time at the EPA, and that members are there to represent the  interests of the American people and our environment rather than their  own self interests.   Finally, I would like to close by bringing up a more general question  of why we seem to be having variations on this repetitive theme of  whether or not we can pollute our way out of the structural and  economic challenges that our country faces.   Mr. Speaker, you and your party have been very successful at selling  yourselves and your supporters on the idea that if we can just, once  again, dump unlimited pollutants into our rivers and streams, into our  groundwater, our food, air, lungs, our bloodstreams and those of our  children, then everything will be great again in America.   This week, we saw our President surrounded by earnest and hopeful  young coal miners as he gutted environmental regulations and promised  them that all their jobs were coming back. And then we have seen  interviews on TV with desperate families in Appalachia using up their  life savings to pay for training for underground coal jobs that they  have been told will be coming back now that Donald Trump is President.   Then we have seen interviews with coal executives quietly pointing  out that those jobs will not come back; that it was machines and  fundamental economic forces that took those jobs in coal country.   The story is the same in oil country, where even as oil production  has rebounded, the jobs and wages have not come back because of  automation, the same way that machines took the jobs in rural America,  manufacturing America, and increasingly middle class, white-collar  America.                                time  1000    So until we realize that we are all in this together and that a  fundamental restructuring of our economy is needed rather than a  mindless retraction of the protections on environmental quality on the  land that we will pass on to our children, then I am afraid that we are  destined to repeat this infinite loop of marginally productive debate.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
