Sec. 4.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 3 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres),  the newest member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself  such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution,  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration  of two bills: H.R. 4, which is the FAA Reauthorization Act, and a  closed rule for H.R. 3144, which would adjust operations at the Federal  Columbia River Power System.   We are lucky today, Mr. Speaker, in that we will have Mr. Newhouse,  who is an expert from Washington State on H.R. 3144, come down to the  floor and talk extensively about that measure and why it is important  for Washington State. But before we talk about Washington State, I want  to talk about the FAA reauthorization bill as well.   I would point out, Mr. Speaker, it is not every rule in every case we  are able to make every Rules Committee member's amendment in order, but  we are fortunate today that, during Mrs. Torres' very first rule on the  House floor, we are making her amendment in order, which, again, Mr.  Speaker, is one of those prerogatives of Rules Committee members.   I know that in the first few moments of the FAA bill, Mr. Speaker, we  are going to want to talk about the good work that went on in the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. It has really been my  pleasure as not just a Rules Committee member, but as a Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee member to be able to work on this bill now  in two committees.   You may recall, Mr. Speaker, that we went not only through our  initial hearings in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee; we  went through a summer markup last year. We have gone through five  short-term extensions on FAA, and we are now here prepared to consider  a full 5-year reauthorization on the floor.   It has not been the easiest process. There have been a lot of folks  who haven't gotten everything they have wanted in this process, but it  has been a collaborative process, Mr. Speaker, and I am glad that we  have it here today.   I would be remiss if I didn't thank our committee chairman on the  authorizing committee, Mr. Speaker, Chairman Shuster, for all the work  that he has done. As you know, he has been a long champion of reforming  the FAA, believing that we could get even more value for the American  taxpayer dollars out of the FAA. While he did not achieve everything  that he wanted to achieve in this bill either, Mr. Speaker, we have a  dramatic step forward in H.R. 4 today.   These things never happen by accident, Mr. Speaker, as you well know,  and I want to thank all the folks who have been toiling behind the  scenes in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee day in and  day out. I am thinking of folks, Mr. Speaker, like Chris Vieson. I am  thinking about folks like Naveen Rao. I am thinking about Hunter Presti  and Brittany Smith.   Mr. Speaker, even though he has left us to go, now, serve in the  article II Federal Railroad Administration, I want to thank Matt  Sturges, who was the former staff director there at the committee, for  all he has done over 2 years to get us to this place.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, getting this work done requires a  collaborative working relationship, Members and staff across the aisle,  from committee office staff to personal office staff, and it has really  been a rewarding process. I am very proud of the product that we have  on the floor today, but it wouldn't have been possible without all of  the staff working and the collaboration that went on. I am grateful to  folks for that. That is the authorizing committee side, Mr. Speaker.   On the Rules Committee side, we had an equal amount of work going on.  These past few days, moving this bill through the Rules Committee, the  staff has had to work tirelessly, in large part, because of all the  amendments that were offered to the bill. We now, in this rule, today,  Mr. Speaker, made in order 116 different revisions to this bill.   Let me say that again. We went through a complete, full, and open  markup in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, as you know,  Mr. Speaker; but then, in the Rules Committee, we made in order an  additional 116 amendments through this rule today: 56 of those are  amendments sponsored by my Democratic colleagues; 36 of those are  amendments sponsored by my Republican colleagues; and 24 of those are  amendments that have bipartisan support here in this Chamber. That is  just over 50 percent of all the ideas that were brought to the Rules  Committee last night, Mr. Speaker.   I hope that my colleagues are as proud of that as I am. It reflects  the commitment that Speaker Ryan made to having a more open and  transparent process. Here, again: 56 Democratic amendments, 36  Republican amendments, and 24 bipartisan amendments.   Mr. Speaker, this FAA bill is a good step towards bringing more value  to the American taxpayer from the FAA, and this rule is a good step to  making  [[Page H3515]]  that possible. With the passage of this rule today, we will be able to  move directly to that debate.   Mr. Speaker, don't believe the headlines that say Congress has packed  up its bags and gone home. I hear that day in and day out that folks  think this 2018 is not going to be a particularly productive  legislative session. I reject that. I reject that with no reservations  whatsoever.   I see the passion my friends on the Democratic side have for  continuing to make improvements for the American people. I see that  same passion on our side. Now, I am not saying we are not going to have  some challenges keeping people focused on the process at hand, but this  FAA bill is a good example of the fact that we are still hard at work,  and there is still much work that we can do together.    This bill, Mr. Speaker, finally delivers on the regulatory reform to  the FAA certification process.   Now, if you have any companies in your district that are involved in  FAA regulations in any way, shape, or form, you know exactly what I am  talking about. This certification process is going to allow companies  all over the country, including many in my district, Mr. Speaker, like  Meggitt in Suwanee, like Universal Avionics in Duluth, like Siemens in  Cumming, Gulfstream in Savannah, and many others, to get safer, more  innovative aviation products to market faster.   Let me say that again, Mr. Speaker: safer products, more innovative  products, more value to the American taxpayer to market faster.   This bill also provides a pathway to regulatory certainty for  unmanned aircraft systems. That allows companies like L3 Technologies  and Colonial Pipeline in Alpharetta, like UPS in Sandy Springs, like  our electric utilities in Gwinnett and Forsyth Counties, Mr. Speaker,  and many other companies in my home State of Georgia to get their  technologies out faster, to make environments safer for their employees  and for my constituents.                                time  1245    We all know that the transformative power of unmanned aviation is  upon us. We have got to regulate that in a safe and responsible way to  make sure that the rules are in place for certainty, for safety, and  for opportunity for innovation. I believe we have that in this bill.   We have a choice, Mr. Speaker. We are either going to lead the world  in unmanned aviation or we are going to cede leadership to countries  like China. I say we seize leadership, and we are seizing it here in  this bill.   The bill also commits that our airports--from the busiest airport in  the world, Mr. Speaker, my hometown airport of Hartsfield-Jackson, the  fourth busiest airport in the State; and also in my district, Mr.  Speaker, is Briscoe Field in Lawrenceville--that these airports have  access to long-term funding sustainability. We all know that yanking  the pendulum back and forth on Federal funding does not serve any of  our constituents' cause. Funding stability--knowing that they can count  on the Federal Government to be their partner in providing innovation  and improving the overall experience of those men and women who travel  through these airports--is of vital importance.   And finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill ensures that our American  airlines--like my hometown airline of Delta--can compete and win  against anyone on the planet in terms of the service, reliability,  safety, and customer service that we have come to expect. Again,  aviation is a partnership in this country, Mr. Speaker, between private  sector actors and public actors. We need to do all that we can, from  our end of Pennsylvania Avenue, to be the very best partners that we  can.   Of course, we can always do more, and I hope that we will continue to  do more. I am expecting a very robust Transportation Committee cycle  here over the next 9 months. But this bill today is a significant  downpayment on our commitment to the American people to make our  aviation infrastructure continue to be the very finest on the planet.   Mr. Speaker, this rule that, again, will govern debate of both H.R. 4  and H.R. 3144 is a fair rule. These are both commonsense measures that  will benefit the American people. I hope my colleagues will see that, I  hope my colleagues will come to the floor and support this rule, and I  hope my colleagues will also support the two underlying measures.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I say with no levity that we are absolutely thrilled to  have Mrs. Torres on the Rules Committee, as she has already made a  contribution. She is going to continue to make a wonderful  contribution.   I would say, Mr. Speaker, to my friend from California, that  sometimes setting expectations is the right way to find success in the  things that we pursue in our lives.   This FAA bill, I recognize her concerns that not every amendment was  made in order. She is absolutely right. However, this bill did go  through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where all of  our transportation subject matter experts are supposed to be, and  absolutely every amendment was considered in that transportation  committee.   Now it leaves the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where  the subject matter experts are, and we have now made in order over 100  additional amendments brought from all across this House, more  Democratic amendments made in order than Republican amendments made in  order, but over 100 additional amendments made in order to try to  perfect this bill.   It may not be everything that folks would like to see, but I would  share with the gentlewoman, Mr. Speaker, that from my brief Rules  Committee experience, we are getting close to a high-water mark here,  and I am going to try to take credit and share enthusiasm when we have  an opportunity to do it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Gianforte), for his insights on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington State (Mr. Newhouse), a member of the Rules Committee and a  subject matter expert on the Columbia River bill before us.    Mr. Speaker, with great optimism that we will return to  the bill at hand, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend from California I  do not have any speakers remaining, and so I am prepared to close when  she is. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I had a wonderful closing statement but, against that  backdrop of collegiality, I will say only this. I did mention earlier  that subject matter experts were assigned to the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee. My friend, Ms. Titus, is on that committee; I  am on that committee.   As a subject matter expert, my mom and dad come to me regularly to  help them with their airline reservations, Delta Airlines, of course,  being an Atlantan. But just recently, they were heading out to  California; demanded that I make those reservations going into Ontario  instead of LAX because, why in the world would anyone want to  [[Page H3519]]  battle LAX when they could be in the Torres district there in Ontario?   They were treated wonderfully and had a wonderful visit, so I  recognize the gentlewoman's passion for her airport.   Mr. Speaker, if you have an airport in your district, if you have  aviation travelers in your district, you want the FAA to be  reauthorized. This bill, this rule makes that possible. This bill gets  that job done in an open, collaborative, and bipartisan way. I urge my  colleagues to support this rule, support the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Torres is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 839 Offered by Ms. Torres         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3876) to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the official       travel of any senior political appointee on private aircraft,       and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall       be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3876.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
