 Madam Speaker, my amendment, which was rejected by the  majority, calls for cities--think about this now--that have defunded  their police forces from receiving Federal National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration grants for traffic enforcement.   Look at Austin, look at Seattle, look at Oakland, look at New York,  millions and millions of dollars being defunded from their local law  enforcement agencies. They should not be eligible to apply for Federal  grant funds in the millions of dollars after they have chosen to defund  their own agencies. It makes no sense.   Look at Oakland and look at the other cities today. Crime is on the  rise. Violence in these liberal cities is out of control, and still,  these cities continue to defund their police departments. They should  not be allowed to tap into Federal grant moneys when they have chosen  to defund their police.   Madam Speaker, I cannot support such hypocrisy, and I will be voting  against this bill.
