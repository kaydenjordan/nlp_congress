 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as the Senate knows, this week we will  complete our work on the 60th National Defense Authorization Act-- actually, 60 years in a row. For decades, this legislation has provided  the opportunity for us to take stock of the evolving threat landscape  and ensure that our national defense is prepared to meet the challenges  on the horizon.   As technological advancements have changed battlefield tactics, each  year's NDAA has allowed us to invest in a modernized force and advanced  weapons. As risks in cyber space emerged as a new vector for warfare,  this legislation has allowed us to invest in resilient networks and a  talented workforce.   As the global order has shifted, this annual bill has given us the  opportunity to identify the greatest threats to our country and to take  strategic action. This year's national defense authorization bill is no  exception. It continues to invest in a modernized national defense that  is critical to maintaining peace through strength.   That is something we need to remember, which Ronald Reagan taught all  of us. Weakness is provocative. Bullies look for opportunities to take  advantage of weakness. It is strength in our leadership, particularly  with our military, that helps us maintain the peace.   This bill also devotes resources to regain our competitive advantage  over our greatest opponents to freedom and democracy today, including  China and the Communist Party. In my lifetime, China has gone from a  poor and isolated country to now accounting for nearly 20 percent of  the global gross domestic product. But China's economic muscle isn't  the reason it tops America's watch list. The Chinese Communist Party's  ruling strategy can best be described as ``win at all costs,'' and,  sadly, the victims of that strategy are often the Chinese people  themselves.   On the Senate floor yesterday, I spoke about some of the latest human  rights violations by the Communist Party in China--their recent move to  erode the freedoms and autonomy of Hong Kong, their efforts to silence  and punish protesters who dare to speak out against the Chinese  Communist Party, their ongoing ethnic cleansing campaign targeted at  the Uighur people.   China continues to demonstrate a complete lack of respect for basic  human rights and dignities, and I remain concerned by the growing  threat they pose to the world order, including the United States of  America.   Attorney General Bill Barr recently gave a speech about the  challenges posed by an increasingly powerful, wealthy, and relentless  China. It is a great speech, which I commend to you. It provides an  impressive overview of how the Communist Party manipulates American  businesses and industries, steals intellectual property, surveils and  censors its own people, and seeks to exert its power and influence in  the United States.   For those who are unfamiliar with the modern relationship between the  United States and China and the risks and vulnerability this creates, I  highly recommend reading the speech of the Attorney General. In that  speech, he discusses the threats posed by the Communist Party's Made in  China 2025 initiative, which seeks to achieve Chinese dominance in  high-tech manufacturing. For everything from electric cars to advanced  robotics, to artificial intelligence, China wants to lead global  production.   While this is framed as a way to reduce the dependence on foreign  technology and strengthen domestic manufacturing, these ambitions paint  an alarming picture for the United States and our allies.   As the Attorney General noted, it is clear that the People's Republic  of China seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced  industrial economies but to replace them altogether.   Before any piece of technology becomes usable for its audience, it  includes parts, pieces, and materials that come from, literally, all  over the world. Regardless of where that final product is assembled and  packaged, each of those individual pieces are the key to protecting the  supply chain that creates our most valuable assets.   If the COVID-19 virus taught us anything, it has given us a clear  picture of how vulnerable our unsecured supply chains are. We lean  heavily on China--too heavily--for things like masks, gloves, gowns,  ventilators--all the equipment for which the need was skyrocketing  earlier this year.   As a result of the fact that the world was dependent on China to  produce this critical equipment, hospitals reached dangerously low  levels of personal protective equipment. In the meantime, China refused  to disclose to the rest of the world that the virus had indeed broken  out in its country so that it could, in fact, hoard the personal  protective equipment they knew the rest of the world would need.   As a result of the lack of a secure supply chain, healthcare workers  were using a single mask throughout an entire shift, putting both  themselves and patients at risk. This has been a wake-up call--or  should have been a wake-up call--on supply chain vulnerabilities and a  reminder that we need to take action today to secure our supply chains  for tomorrow.   One of the biggest of these vulnerabilities we are facing today is a  lack of domestic semiconductor manufacturing. These chips are  everywhere in almost every product. They are the underlying technology  in everything from our cell phones and towers to computers, to  precision agriculture, to missile defense systems.   As you can imagine, as technologies have become more sophisticated in  recent years, the demand for high-end semiconductors has skyrocketed.  In fact, U.S. companies command 47 percent of the global market of  these integrated circuit chips. But when it comes to manufacturing, we  are falling further and further behind.   Since 2000, the United States has dropped from producing roughly a  quarter of the world's semiconductors to only 12 percent, and you need  only one guess as to which country stepped up to manufacture these  critical devices. You guessed right. It is China.   In the same period, China has gone from manufacturing zero chips to  16 percent of the world's supply and plans on investing another $1.4  trillion in semiconductor technologies.   America has lost ground to our global competitors, and unless we take  action, it is estimated that by 2030, 83 percent of the global  semiconductor manufacturing capacity will be not here but in Asia.   We need to bring those manufacturing jobs back to the United States  and provide end-to-end security in our semiconductor supply chain.   Of course, that is much easier said than done. Building a new  foundry, which is where these semiconductors are manufactured, is very  expensive and, quite frankly, will not happen without an investment  from the Federal Government. The Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development estimates that 21 major semiconductor firms across a  number of countries receive more than $50 billion in government support  between 2014 and 2018.   Some of these countries investing in manufacturing of these  technologies were South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Ireland, Germany,  and, you guessed it, China. If we are going to regain lost ground in  semiconductor manufacturing and secure one of our most critical supply  chains, it is going to take a strategic investment, and that is exactly  where the CHIPS for America Act will deliver.   Senator Warner, the distinguished Democratic Senator from Virginia,  and I have introduced legislation to restore American leadership in  semiconductor manufacturing and ensure long-term national security and  economic competitiveness. We worked hand in hand with our colleagues,  Senator Cotton from Arkansas and Senator Schumer from New York, in  drafting the amendment before the Senate that we will vote on this  evening. It is truly a bipartisan product.   It achieves that goal by creating a Federal incentive program through  the Department of Commerce to encourage  [[Page S4326]]  semiconductor manufacturing right here in the good old USA. In short,  it would stimulate domestic advanced semiconductor manufacturing and  boost both our national security and global competitiveness. It will  enable us to bring manufacturing of these critical devices back onto  American soil and eliminate this critical national security and  economic vulnerability.   As I mentioned, these chips are literally everywhere. Many of you  have them in your pockets right now or on your wrists. Semiconductors  are the foundational technology for our military systems, our critical  infrastructure, our telecommunications, healthcare, agriculture, and  manufacturing. We want these devices to run on made-in-America  semiconductors.   As we conclude our work on the National defense authorization bill, I  am glad the Senate has the opportunity to vote on this legislation as  an amendment. I am grateful to the chairman of the Armed Services  Committee, Chairman Inhofe, and Ranking Member Reed for making sure  that happens. This legislation supports a critical goal of the National  Defense Authorization Act and our national defense strategy, which is  strategic competition with China. That is where we are right now.   It prioritizes advancements in the critical technologies that will  modernize our national defense and restore our competitive edge, all  while allowing us to secure our most critical supply chains.   I hope our colleagues will all join me in supporting this legislation  so that we can reclaim American leadership in semiconductor  manufacturing, so we can support American jobs, and so we can invest in  both a strong national security and our economy.                              Amendment No. 2244    (Purpose: To restore American leadership in semiconductor  manufacturing by increasing federal incentives in order to enable  advanced research and development, secure the supply chain, and ensure  long-term national security and economic competitiveness.)   Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 2244 and ask that it be  read.    Madam President, I yield the floor.
