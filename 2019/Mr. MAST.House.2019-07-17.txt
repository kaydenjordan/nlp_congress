 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 38. And I want to  focus my remarks on the rationale behind the President's emergency  declaration and ask that we think about the definition of the word  ``declaration'', what that means to each of us.   My friends on the other side of the aisle would prefer to forget that  these arms sales were expedited for a very specific reason. They are  omitting this information because it doesn't fit into their narrative  that the President is doing a favor to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab  Emirates. I can tell you that defense is no favor.   The threat that emanates from Iran that precipitated this emergency  declaration is very, very real, and, as a result, so is the need for  the weapons sales to our partners.   So let's think about it: Are these situations emergencies?   Do they pose an immediate risk to life--an immediate threat to life?   In May in the days leading right up to this emergency declaration,  Iran and its proxies executed several attacks throughout the Middle  East over just 2 weeks.   Four oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman. I would say that  is an emergency and a threat to life.   Armed drones struck Saudi oil fields. I would say that is an  emergency and a threat to life.   The head of the Quds Force called on terror groups to prepare for a  proxy war. I would certainly call that an emergency and a very direct  threat to life.   A rocket was launched near the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. I would call  that an emergency and a threat to life.   A bomb-carrying drone was launched by Houthi rebels targeting a Saudi  airport on May 21. I would say that is an emergency and a threat to  life.   Now in the weeks since the emergency declaration, Iran has only  ramped up its attacks and it is precipitating the need to have this  emergency declaration.   Houthi rebels have continued attacks on civilian airports in Saudi  Arabia. That is an emergency and a direct threat to life.  [[Page H5941]]    The IRGC perpetrated another attack on commercial shipping, this time  targeting Japanese and Norwegian oil tankers transiting through the  Strait of Hormuz. I would say that that is an emergency and a threat to  life.   A rocket hit an oil drilling site in Iraq's southern Basra Province  striking inside a compound that housed contractors and employees of  Exxon Mobil. I would say that is an emergency and a threat to life.   Iran shot down a U.S. military asset over international waters. I  would say that is an emergency.   Just last week three Iranian paramilitary vessels tried to impede the  passage of a British oil tanker transiting the Strait of Hormuz, and I  would say that is an emergency and a threat to life.   Now, even as Iran continues to threaten international shipping and  civilians in the Middle East, there are Members of this body who want  to create doubts about the commitments that we have to our partners on  the front lines. Now for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,  this is not an abstract threat. It is their tankers that are being  attacked, their airports that are being targeted, and their oil fields.    Now, our bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab  Emirates undoubtedly is complicated, and we absolutely have to press  for improvements in domestic human rights for both countries. I think  we can agree on this wholeheartedly: we have to seek justice and  accountability in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, undoubtedly. In fact,  earlier this week this body voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Malinowski's  H.R. 2037 which imposes sanctions on those responsible for Mr.  Khashoggi's murder.   Even as the United Arab Emirates draws down its position in Yemen, we  must press Saudi Arabia to minimize civilian casualties in that  conflict, but none of these challenges justify whatsoever abandoning  our partners as they face down a threat from an Iranian regime that is  on the march throughout the Middle East. In fact, we must continue to  show our investment in our strategic partnerships in order to  incentivize our partners to make the changes that we are asking them to  make.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have had a longstanding concern about these sales. We have a  codified congressional review process precisely to address such  concerns, however it is my assessment that my Democratic colleagues  abused this review process.   Prior to the emergency notification, Republican Members had supported  these sales, but Democrat Members subjected them to informal holds--in  some cases for over a year--without any clear path to resolution. Now,  given the wide range of conflicts and threats in the Middle East, I do  not understand why my colleagues were surprised when, after months and  even over a year of delay, it was assessed that our partners urgently  needed these defense articles and services for their national security  in these emergency situations.                                time  1400    Perhaps if my colleagues had taken a more active approach to  resolving their concerns, we would have avoided the situation in which  additional capabilities were needed to respond to the elevated threat,  this emergency situation that has been posted by Iran.   Now, Mr. Speaker, there has long been a consensus in this body that  Iran's malign activities in the Middle East are a threat to the United  States' national security and to our partners. In the past 3 years  alone, we have passed legislation responding to Iran's support for  terrorism, growing ballistic missile arsenal, and human rights abuses.  The Iranian regime has not backed down from these malign activities,  and it is my sincere hope that this body will not back down from its  resolve to counter Iran's destabilizing agenda.   Unfortunately, this resolution and the other joint resolutions of  disapproval for the 22 sales are very much a step in the wrong  direction.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Taylor).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
