 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   I rise today in strong opposition to the Financial CHOICE Act because  it will gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and roll back  important protections for seniors, for students, and for hardworking  families across the country.   The CFPB protects Americans from unscrupulous financial practices and  deceitful debt collectors. Since its creation, it has assisted more  than 29 million consumers, many of them seniors, with mortgages, credit  cards, and debt collection.   Unfortunately, seniors are especially vulnerable to financial fraud  and abuse. This bill would roll back the CFPB's ability to identify and  stop unfair and abusive debt collection and telemarketing practices;  and this harmful bill would also prevent the CFPB from cracking down on  predatory payday lenders who take advantage of struggling families by  issuing loans at exorbitant rates.   I worked as a consumer protection attorney, and I worked with too  many families there who lost their homes, too many seniors who were  harassed by debt collectors, too many people who were victims of  predatory payday lending and got into the quicksand and were not able  to get out. We cannot allow this shortsighted bill to stop the good  work of the CFPB.   This bill is called the CHOICE Act, but it is the wrong choice, and I  urge my colleagues to oppose it.
