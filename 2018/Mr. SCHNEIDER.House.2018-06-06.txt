 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  Trump administration's shameful new policy separating parents and  children at our southern border. This policy is even being applied to  those legally seeking asylum here while fleeing violence in their home  countries.   The current system of prioritizing criminal prosecution of those  seeking protection rather than assessing legitimate asylum claims has  to stop.   These are not our Nation's values. Our country is better than this,  our people are better than this.   But we have a chance to get something right. We are currently within  just a handful of signatures of forcing a vote on a series of  immigration proposals, including the bipartisan USA Act, which pairs a  resolution for our Dreamers with smart investments in our border  security.   June, this month, is Immigrant Heritage Month, a time to reflect on  the history of immigration that so many Americans share. We must live  up to our heritage by ending this cruel policy of family separation,  securing Dreamers a permanent future here in the United States, and  finally formally reforming our broken immigration system.                            ____________________
