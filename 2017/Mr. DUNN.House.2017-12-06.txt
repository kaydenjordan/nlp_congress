 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 38, the  Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. This commonsense legislation ensures  that our Second Amendment rights don't end when we cross State lines.   We are all aware of the story of Shaneen Allen, a mother of three who  was pulled over in New Jersey after committing a minor traffic  violation. She told the police legally that she had a handgun on her  person and a concealed carry permit. She was unaware that the permit  was not transferable to New Jersey, and she had no prior criminal  record. Nonetheless, she spent 40 days in a jail cell.   Americans like Shaneen are exposed to real risks of accidentally  breaking the law of another State simply by exercising their  constitutional right. This bill ensures that valid concealed carry  permits from one State are valid in all other States.                                time  1545    It creates legal protections for law-abiding gun owners against  States that violate this statute.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this important  legislation and to show the American people the Second Amendment is  safe with us.
