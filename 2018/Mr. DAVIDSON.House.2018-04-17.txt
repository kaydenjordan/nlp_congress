 Mr. Speaker, the Consolidated Audit Trail stands as the  largest financial database in the world and ranks second in size only  to the NSA's database.   The value of the sensitive information housed within this database  includes Social Security numbers, broker numbers, account numbers. In  fact, it is comparable to nine times the wealth that is in Fort Knox-- far more sensitive than the Equifax data, whose breach affects 143  million Americans.   Despite the enormity of wealth within this database, the unfortunate  reality is that its cybersecurity is not yet adequate. The Government  Accountability Office report found the SEC's systems ``at unnecessary  risk of compromise.'' The CAT operator recently delayed the issuing of  technical specifications, which means that industry will have just 1  month to transmit all of this market data.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced the Market Data Protection Act, which  passed this House with unanimous support, to guarantee the private  information of hundreds of millions of Americans transmits securely and  without risk. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate  to send this bill to the President's desk.                            ____________________
