 Madam Speaker, first of all, let me just say,  I taught my children that there are consequences if they break the law.   I am saddened, but I am not shocked, that we are here today  considering Articles of Impeachment against President Trump. I am  saddened, but I am not shocked because of the pattern of corruption we  have seen from this President.   Yes, I am saddened, but I am not shocked because this President has  routinely shown his disregard of Congress and the rule of law.   The facts are not in dispute. The President abused his power, defied  the public's trust, and betrayed his oath of office. He undermined our  elections by corruptly soliciting foreign interference in our elections  to benefit his own future reelection efforts. Then he obstructed  Congress every step of the way in an effort to cover it all up.   Donald Trump has been and remains a threat to our national security,  a clear danger to our democracy, and wholly unfit to serve as President  of the United States.   We have an obligation to act today to uphold the Constitution, but  also to show our children and grandchildren that no one is above the  law, and that includes the President of the United States.
