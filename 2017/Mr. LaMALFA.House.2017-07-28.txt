 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House was able to  pass the extension of the Veterans Choice Act funding for an additional  6 months to allow veterans to have choices, the ability to not wait in  long lines, long lists, and have local proximity to treatment and care  that they need.   We need to do much more on this in the future, but with today's  action, at least we can sustain that program for an additional amount  of time and serve our veterans who served us so well.   The Veterans Choice Act is a good outlet, a good opportunity for them  to receive the care they need timely and in proximity to where they  live.   Mr. Speaker, let's make sure the Senate gets this through and our  veterans are served well.                            ____________________
