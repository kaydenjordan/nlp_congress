 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   We do need tax reform. We need tax reform that we all described in  the beginning as something that would help the middle class, that would  simplify taxes, and would be revenue neutral. This bill, sometimes  described by its authors as doing those things, accomplishes none of  those things.   Now, first of all, for the middle class, wages have been stagnant.  The jobs people are getting aren't paying the bills. We know the  biggest challenge we face is increasing investment, increasing wages,  and increasing security.   There are some benefits in this bill for the middle class, but let's  get real. Those benefits are tiny and they are temporary.   If you are a Vermont family, if you are lucky--we get hit with the  SALT deduction loss--you might make a couple hundred bucks.   But at what price?   Once these benefits expire, 83 percent of the benefits of the  individual tax rate goes to the top 1 percent.   At what price?   $2 trillion added to the deficit.   Let me tell you this: Vermont families, hard-earning families,  working families, they would like a tax cut, but not one that their  children and grandchildren are going to have to pay. That is  unconscionable.   What about these corporate tax cuts?   We want simplification, so we are competitive. There is a 40 percent  reduction for multinational corporations.   But, in this bill, is there any corresponding requirement that they  start reinvesting in America?   Exactly the opposite.   There is a lower tax rate for companies that invest abroad, send jobs  abroad, rather than invest at home. That is outrageous.   And what happens because of this deficit?   Medicare is going to be cut directly as a result of this tax bill.  The infrastructure plan we all want is evaporating.   Defeat this rule and defeat this bill.
