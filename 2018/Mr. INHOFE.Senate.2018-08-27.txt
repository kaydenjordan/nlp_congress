 Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia.   I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the remarks of the  distinguished Senator from Georgia that I be recognized for such time  as I shall consider.    Madam President, I can't think of anything more difficult  than to speak after the last two speakers. Of course, I have known them  for a long time. They are two totally different, opposite people.   We have Susan Collins, who is a well-recognized moderate. She is one  who understands and has great appreciation for the environment. She is  not the kind of person you would associate with a tough guy like John  McCain, who has gone out there and has done things that other people  haven't done but just talked about.   Then we heard the statement from the Senator from Georgia. You know,  I was thinking about that. I am a few years older than he is. We have a  lot of things in common. He was talking about his being drafted; I was  drafted. I will always remember, I was actually enrolled many, many  years ago--I was going to be at the University of Mexico in Mexico City  in an international program. At that time, I was at the University of  Colorado. I did all of my finals and all that early so that I could get  back in time to go to Mexico.   I got back to Tulsa, where I am from, and I got a letter from a very  important person, the President of the United States. I thought, how  nice of Eisenhower to remember me. It was my draft notice, so that  changed my life. But it changed my life in a way that it was the  greatest single experience I have ever had, and I wouldn't be doing  what I am doing today if it were not for the discipline that comes from  being in the military.   We will always have heroes we deal with, and we are dealing with a  hero when we deal with Senator McCain.   I have often said that I think Timothy, who wrote 2 Timothy 4:7, had  John McCain in mind when he said: ``I fought the good fight, I have  finished the race, I have kept the faith.'' That is exactly what he  did.   He was kind of a mean guy. A lot of people didn't like John McCain.  He wasn't the most lovable person to be around. But he was a fighter.  He never shied away from a good fight. He was passionate for the causes  that he believed in and a strong advocate for human rights and  Democratic values, standing up for oppressed people around the world.  That is the softer side of John McCain that a lot of people don't know  about.   He was a fighter but not just a fighter; he was a fighter for the  people of Arizona. After he returned from the time he had spent in  prison, he got back to Arizona, and he started fighting again. He did  that for 36 years after his incarceration.   He was shaped by his own military service and that of his father and  grandfather. It has been said several times in statements about his  father and grandfather--and I have done some studying on them--that is  really what formed John McCain. Both of them were admirals in the Navy,  and it was natural that he was going to be in the Navy, and, of course,  he was.   During his time of leadership on the Senate Armed Services Committee,  he  [[Page S5947]]  continually focused on impact. There are those individuals--such as the  occupier of the Chair right now--who have served on the Armed Services  Committee with Senator McCain, and the Presiding Officer knows, as I  know and as anybody else who has served with him knows, he was always  for the underdog--always for the troops out in the field. I think the  Senator from Maine articulated that very well. They were the people he  had compassion for. He would always take care of the soldier, sailor,  airman, and marine.   He articulated this, by the way, in one of his books, ``Faith of My  Fathers.'' He was talking about his father and grandfather. This quote  says it better than any of the rest of us can say it.         An officer's obligations to enlisted men are the most       solemn of all. An officer must not confer his       responsibilities on the men under his command. They are his       alone. He does not put his men in jeopardy for any purpose       that their country has not required they serve. He does not       risk their lives and welfare for his sake, but only to answer       the shared duty they are called to answer.    That was Senator McCain. He looked after those individuals who were  under his command.   He was a ferocious opponent, but the key thing about Senator McCain  was that he was willing to take on those tough debates, which have  become more and more rare in this Chamber. We don't see them as we used  to, but John would relish the debate, earning the respect and  admiration of everyone.   I can remember--there are so many areas because of all the years we  served together, not just on the Senate Armed Services Committee but  also his time in the House and my time in the House. We had differences  of opinion. I think I am a little bit stubborn sometimes too.   I remember there was a commissary issue, and that got pretty violent  before it was over. We took each other on. There was the BRAC issue. He  wanted another BRAC round in this Defense authorization bill, and I  didn't want one because I thought that if there was anything we  shouldn't be doing, it would be closing down missions that we may be  needing as we are rebuilding. So we had an honest difference of  opinion.   I remember, in 2003, back when everyone was jumping on this whole  global warming thing, that was going to be everyone's ticket to the  White House. I remember when John had the McCain-Lieberman bill. I  remember that lasted for 3 days of debate--3 days of debate--and I had  hardly any Senators come down on my side of the issue, but we won  anyway. After that was over--and that was one John had his heart in--he  came over to me and said: Good job. You won; I lost. That was it. There  were no hard feelings. That is the kind of person John McCain was, one  whom we will never forget.   A lot of people look at Arizona and think it has always been a  Republican State. It wasn't. In 1994, I ran for the U.S. Senate. It was  kind of interesting because it was a Democratic State. It was kind of  interesting because this guy who was kind of the darling of the  Democratic Party was my opponent. Nobody would come out and help me.  Only three Senators came out and helped me during that race. They were  Senator Grassley, Senator Bob Dole, and John McCain.    John McCain came out. I will always remember this because we had a  lot of things in common, but I hardly knew the guy. He came out not  just once; he came out twice. The first time he came out because he had  a background in aviation and I have a background in aviation. I  remember I had a nice, air-conditioned, twin-engine plane, but I had  lost an engine the night before so I had to fly my kid's plane. It was  very hot. It is called a little Grumman Tiger. It doesn't have any air- conditioning. It was in the 90s and got close to 100 that day.   I wrote down the different places we went to--Oklahoma City; then we  flew to Shawnee, where he and I visited the Vietnam Memorial. Then we  flew to Lawton. Lawton happens to be the home of Fort Sill, the No. 1  area in the whole world for artillery, and we did our thing there. All  the time, he was campaigning for me, a guy who couldn't win.   We went to Altus Air Force Base. That is still actually one of the  top training bases. We now train C-17s and KC-135s. In fact, because of  John and some of us on the committee, we will be flying the KC-46. Of  course, this happened long before that. Anyway, we ended up in  Bartlesville, hosting a fundraiser for me with the NRA.   I guess he wanted to spend more time in that plane because he came  back 2 weeks later, and we did the same thing. There was no reason for  him to do that because we hardly knew each other when we started. We  got to know each other a lot better up there in all that heat.  Nevertheless, he was there. You always remember the people who help you  when nobody else will.   I can say a lot of things about John McCain. You heard him on the  floor. You will hear more--the hero, the patriot--but what is never in  dispute is that John McCain was a fighter who was always deeply loyal  to his country, his family, his constituents. He was a patriot and  always faithful. We all know that patriotism and loyalty to your  country isn't based on your words. You have to live it. Of course, he  did that every day.   As a young naval officer following in his family's footsteps--his  father and his grandfather--John kept the faith. He graduated from the  U.S. Naval Academy. It is interesting, he never talked about being an  outstanding student and all that. In fact, he used to say: I was fifth  in the class--fifth from the bottom. But he became a naval aviator.   He was deployed during the Vietnam war. He flew 23 missions and was  shot down in enemy territory. We all know the story. We know that he  kept his faith. It bears repeating that he was held by the North  Vietnamese for 5 years. I actually remember going there and seeing the  conditions under which he was held during that period of time. Because  both his father and grandfather were admirals, he had the opportunity,  if he wanted, to bail out. He didn't do that. He wanted to be there. He  didn't want to have any special kind of treatment. That was John.   After the Navy, John kept his faith by continuing to serve his  country--this time as a congressman, then a Senator, and, ultimately,  as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He also kept the faith on  the causes he believed were just, never wavering under political  pressure.   We all grieve because John has finished his race here on Earth--and  on his own terms, surrounded by his friends and his loving family. John  served his country faithfully for 60 years. We owe him a great debt for  that service.   This week, we will mourn him and honor him, and we will be  celebrating the truly remarkable life of an American hero. We all have  our John McCain story: a time when we were moved by his stubbornness,  his courage, his passion--sometimes all three at the same time. I look  forward to hearing these stories and tributes from my good friends.   We all grieve for Cindy and his family. They will continue to be in  our prayers.   Lastly, I do believe, now that I have thought about it, that is what  Timothy had in mind when he wrote: ``I have fought the good fight, I  have finished the race, and I have kept the faith.''   So we say thank you, John McCain.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
