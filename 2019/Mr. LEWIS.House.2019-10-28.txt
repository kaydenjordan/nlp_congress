 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the young lady from  Michigan-- Mrs. Lawrence. I love that.    Well, you are still very young--for bringing us together  to honor John Conyers.   The former dean of the House of Representatives and the cofounder of  the Congressional Black Caucus, John Conyers, was born at a time when  we needed someone to stand up and to speak up and speak out and to get  in the way of getting what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.   As a matter of fact, John Conyers and Martin Luther King, Jr. were  born  [[Page H8531]]  the same year, so maybe history, faith, and maybe God Almighty placed  the two of them here to work together.   Before being elected to Congress, Mr. Conyers served in the Korean  war and on the staff of Representative John Dingell. When the people of  Michigan elected Mr. Conyers in 1964, he brought Congress to the front  lines of the civil rights movement, and he took civil rights, voting  rights, labor rights, and human rights to the United States Congress.   John Conyers, perhaps more than any other Member of Congress, made  trips over and over and over again to the South to identify with the  struggle going on in the South. He came to Alabama, to Georgia,  Mississippi, and other parts of the Deep South.   Mr. Speaker, Representative Conyers was one of two Members of  Congress, both from Michigan, who voted on the original and every  single reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. He could give us the  backstory of every major law from the Civil Rights Act of 1968 to the  20-year effort to establish a National Day of Service honoring my  friend and leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   When Rosa Parks, a person I got to know so well, was forced to leave  her home State of Alabama after the Montgomery bus boycott, Mr. Conyers  more than anyone else gave her a position on his staff, and she was  very proud and pleased to work in the office of John Conyers. She  served in his district office for 23 years.   The record should be clear: John Conyers loved music, but he loved  jazz. He loved jazz more than any other form of music.                                time  2015    He loved this institution, and he dedicated his life to realizing the  dream of what our Nation could be. He was of the people, and he was for  the people.   On this difficult day, I offer my deepest condolences to his beloved  wife, sons, family, and the people of Michigan who mourn his loss.   May he rest in peace and in power.
