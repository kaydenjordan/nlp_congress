 Mr. Speaker, a lot of people are waiting to get this  done today. It is up to us to help Americans who can't buy their  groceries or pay their rent and are not in prison.   It is up to us to protect seniors in nursing homes.   It is up to us to ensure that every American has quality health  insurance and is able to get vaccinated.   These are Congress' burdens, our burdens.   I am voting yes, because Ingrid from Rutherford told me it would help  her pay the rent or utilities. How can I say no to that?   I am voting yes, because Bradley from Fort Lee told me that a new  stimulus check was the only way he could get help for his kids until he  finds work. I am voting yes for that.   Our cities and States are being bled into bankruptcy. They  contemplate cuts to public safety in schools that will be felt for a  generation without us acting.   Americans are crying out for help, Mr. Speaker. Can you hear them?  They have given us the burden to act. Today, we are going to deliver.  We should be happy today. We should not be angry.
