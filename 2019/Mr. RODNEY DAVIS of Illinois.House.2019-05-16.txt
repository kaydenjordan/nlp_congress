 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Jennifer Baumann, a high school senior from my district who was named  the recipient of the Good Citizen Award by the Illinois Daughters of  the American Revolution.   This year, over 400 high school seniors submitted essays for the DAR  Good Citizenship scholarship application. Among these, district DAR  chapters identified one student as the person who best exemplifies  dependability, service, leadership, and patriotism in their area.   Jennifer was selected from Mt. Zion High School as the representative  for the Stephen Decatur Chapter and attended the Illinois State DAR  Conference, where she was named the statewide winner of the Good  Citizen Award.   By all accounts, Jennifer demonstrates well the attributes of  dependability, service, leadership, and patriotism. She is active in  nearly every aspect of student life in her high school, where she is  the captain of all three of her varsity teams: cross-country,  basketball, and track and field. She also serves as the President of  the National Honor Society and treasurer of the Student Council, and  even finds time to dedicate to volunteering with both the Key Club and  her church.   She plans to study speech, language, and hearing sciences at the  University of Arizona in the fall.   I am proud to recognize outstanding students in my district,  including Jennifer. I congratulate her on this prestigious honor.                            ____________________
