 Mr. President, I appreciate the kind remarks and the  comments about the appropriations process and bill by the ranking  member, the vice chairman of the committee.   In this package of appropriations bills is the FSGG that was just  talked about by the Senator from Oklahoma, the chairman of the  subcommittee of which I am a member. Tonight, I want to speak about an  aspect of that appropriations bill. I want to speak on the evolving  threats in cyber security that not only pose harm to individual  Americans but also to Federal agencies that are tasked with ensuring  the economic and national security of our Nation.   In recent years, it has become clear that threats in cyber security  are rapidly changing. Cyber attacks are not only growing in volume but  also in complexity.   I chair a subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, the  Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and  Data Security. I have convened hearings and publicly questioned Federal  agencies and private corporations alike to determine what standards and  practices they have in place to better protect their customers'  personal and financial data.   With examples of breaches exposing the personally identifiable  information of tens of millions of Americans, such as in the 2015  breach within the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the ability to  compromise data networks in the Federal Government cannot be  overstated. Companies must do all they can to prevent hackers from  gaining access to their customers' information. The Federal Government  and State officials must do the same.   Advancements in information technology, or IT, will continue to drive  the changes in our Nation's security, economic competitiveness,  communications, healthcare, privacy, and other areas. The Federal  Government must keep pace with these changes through nimble,  expeditious, and results-driven decision making.  [[Page S5498]]    A stringent and cumbersome budgeting and acquisition process has tied  the hands of Federal agencies in their efforts to modernize their IT  systems in an efficient fashion.   The U.S. Government Accountability Office's 2015 ``High-Risk Series''  report highlighted several issues it deemed critical to improving IT  acquisition. Specifically, the report stated that about 75 percent of  the $80 billion the Federal Government spends annually on IT  investments is spent on operating and maintaining outdated and  unsupported legacy systems, creating major cyber security  vulnerabilities at home and abroad. In fact, the Federal Chief  Information Officer, Suzette Kent, recently testified to the House  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last week, where she  identified the replacement of legacy IT systems as critical to  achieving stronger Federal cyber security protections.   With the support of the Trump administration, I partnered with  Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico to introduce the Modernizing Government  Technology Act, which is being referred to as the MGT Act, in an effort  to address the foundational cyber security threats that outdated legacy  systems in our Federal agencies pose.   The MGT Act establishes IT working capital funds for 24 CFO Act- eligible agencies and allows them to use savings obtained through  streamlining IT systems, replacing legacy products, and transitioning  to cloud computing for further modernization efforts for up to 3 years.   The bill also creates the Technology Modernization Fund, a separate  centralized fund within the Department of the Treasury. These resources  would be administered across the Federal Government by the head of the  General Services Administration in consultation with a board of Federal  IT experts.   It is fitting that the MGT Act was signed into law last year as part  of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, as  cyber security policy is increasingly interwoven into comprehensive  national security discussions.   As contributors to the original drafting of the MGT Act, Senate  appropriators demonstrated their continued support for the innovative  policy by appropriating $100 million to the Technology Modernization  Fund for fiscal year 2018, last year's appropriations bill. Of this  original funding, the Technology Modernization Fund has already awarded  substantial grants to applicant agencies, including the Departments of  Housing and Urban Development, Energy, and Agriculture, to replace  their outdated, unsupported, and vulnerable systems.   Given these early-stage successes, I was disappointed to find that  the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Financial Services and  General Government, FSGG--the subcommittee that the Senator from  Oklahoma chairs and that I am a member of--provided no funds for the  Technology Modernization Fund in the mark for this fiscal year, 2019.   I appreciate the opportunity to work with Subcommittee Chairman  Lankford and his staff. It was clear to me in that conversation and  those discussions that GSA and OMB need to provide more information on  individual agency proposals submitted to and awarded by the Technology  Modernization Fund.   I worked with the subcommittee to include specific reporting  requirements in this bill for the agencies to provide Congress. Agency  officials have been providing necessary information to appropriators  since the markup of the bill, so progress is being made.   These commonsense requirements are absolutely critical and will lead  to more transparency, and it is important that the GSA and OMB work  closely with the Appropriations Committee on proposals for moving  forward. Congress and the Federal agencies must work hand-in-hand to  provide the necessary resources to the Technology Modernization Fund,  which, used responsibly, is a vital tool for the Federal Government's  task of keeping our Nation's critical IT infrastructure efficient and  secure.   Inherently tied to improving our Nation's critical IT infrastructure  is bolstering cyber security efforts against those who try to do us  harm in the cyber domain. The Federal role in cyber security involves  both securing Federal systems and assisting in protecting non-Federal  systems. Under current law, all Federal agencies have cyber security  responsibilities relating to their own systems, and many have sector- specific responsibilities.   One of the most well-known topics related to our Nation's cyber  security capabilities relates to the intelligence community indicating  that Russian cyber actors interfered with U.S. elections. These  exposures threatened to compromise one of the most sacred privileges we  have, as Americans, afforded to us in our constitutional freedom to  participate in democracy through election.    Back-end election systems, including voter registration databases,  ballot creation systems, voting machine configuration systems, absentee  processing and reporting, and tabulation software, are increasingly  vulnerable and have been compromised by both private and state actors.  While States are charged with the primary responsibility of securing  their systems, the Federal Government can bolster those efforts through  legislation, such as the Secure Elections Act, which I cosponsored in  an effort to strengthen protections against foreign interference and  prevent Russian meddling in our election, as they did in 2016.   Our Nation faces existential threats from adversaries such as Russia  and China in a warfare we cannot see that rages in the shadows of cyber  space, where cyber attacks know no bounds, affecting our Federal  systems, States, and crossing the line among numerous sectors in our  Nation's critical infrastructure.   As our intelligence and other communities analyze cyber threats,  whether attacking our democracy or our critical infrastructure, it is  important that the Federal Government promptly streamline and share  cyber security information with State, local, and private sector  partners.   Although talk of cyber threats to our State networks and critical  infrastructure across all sectors continues to grow, this threat is not  new. Just last July, we saw hackers infiltrate a network of companies  that run nuclear plants in the United States, including a nuclear  powerplant in my home State of Kansas.   Incidentally, a cross-section of stakeholders at the State and  Federal level and among the private sector are represented at the  Kansas Intelligence Fusion Center, which plays a critical role in  analyzing and comparing cyber data and intelligence among public- private partners and Federal agencies to identify similarities,  anomalies, and ways our cyber defenses can improve. The Fusion Center,  headquartered in Topeka and managed by the Kansas National Guard, has  analytical capability that works as an intermediary, supporting  companies across the United States in our financial and energy sectors,  as well as our intelligence community and the Department of Defense,  the Department of Energy, and the Department of Homeland Security. With  the Fusion Center's ability to access, analyze, and transmit data at  classified levels, they are able to more accurately assess cyber  threats from the vantage point that private sector partners cannot.  Similarly, they are able to share what they learn from cyber attacks on  private sector partners to Federal agencies.   As we look for ways to improve IT systems across the Federal  Government, there is much to be gained from the private sector and  their experience and exposure to cyber attacks. As the Departments of  Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security develop an assessment of our  Nation's cyber infrastructure, I hope they seek the perspective of our  private sector partners that have just as much at stake in protecting  our infrastructure across the country as does the Federal Government.   We must do all we can to keep our Nation's ability to detect,  prevent, and respond to cyber security attacks, which is why fully  funding the Technology Modernization Fund is so important to bolstering  an environment that incentivizes organizations to strengthen their IT  systems.   I hope my colleagues recognize the importance of investing in  defensive cyber security capacity and join me in supporting funding for  the Technology Modernization Fund in the Financial  [[Page S5499]]  Services and General Government appropriations bill and supporting the  Secure Elections Act.
