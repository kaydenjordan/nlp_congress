 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of S. 2155, the Economic  Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.   This pro-growth package provides the desperately needed regulatory  relief to our community financial institutions while providing  consumers with greater options for accessing credit.   For too long, we have seen many of the onerous regulatory burdens  restrict banks and credit unions from serving the needs of their  communities. After 8 years of failed economic policies, which led to  the slowest, weakest recovery in the modern era, the economy is finally  starting to take off, and consumer optimism is increasing each and  every day each.   As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, we remain  committed to passing legislation designed to roll back some of the most  burdensome provisions found in the Dodd-Frank Act.   This legislation was intended to rein in large financial  institutions, while harming our local community banks and credit  unions. These increased regulations created a higher cost of business  and diminished credit availability.    Frankly, the Economic Growth, Regulatory  Relief, and Consumer Protection Act tailors the rules to the size and  risk profile rather than imposing sweeping changes to our consumer  financial institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their work on this important  legislation, and I urge passage on the rule and on the final vote.
