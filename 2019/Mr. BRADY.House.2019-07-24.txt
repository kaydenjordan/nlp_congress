 Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), one of the key members of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a key member of the Ways and Means Committee,  a businessperson, and who funds retirements and know how hard these  workers work.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), one of the leaders of our Tax Policy Subcommittee  efforts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas  (Mr. Estes), a member of the Ways and Means Committee who, as a State  treasurer, has worked with these public pension programs.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Look, it is not enough to do something. We have to do the right  thing. We know the Senate isn't going to consider this bill. They have  told everyone. There is no one in the Senate predicting this bill will  be taken up.   The White House certainly won't support it in its current form. But,  like us, they believe we need to find a solution.   When all is said and done, I know this bill is well intended. I know  the author and leader is well intended because I know him.   I think this will actually delay Congress from making the progress we  really need to on this issue.   So, today, after what will be a largely partisan vote, we are going  to be forced to start over at step one.   I just think union workers and their families, who work incredibly  hard every day, that promises to them ought to be kept. And they demand  better from us.                                time  1815    To solve this issue, we have to work together to get to the root  cause, which is that there are lower standards and less accountability  for these union-managed plans. That is why the promises to union  workers are worth a third what the promises are to workers in other  plans. That isn't right.   This bill doesn't take any steps to make these failing plans more  stable. It won't end underfunding. It doesn't make them more solvent  over time for their children, who are working, by the way, in these  same companies.   Families of these union workers are counting on these plans, and  these workers have put their trust in these trustees to make good on  their promises. Too many failed, and too many are still failing.   The truth is, we are in this crisis today because not all managers,  by the way, did a bad job, but too many did. They dramatically  overpromised and underdelivered. Will we rely on the same people who  created this mess to do the same thing to the same workers they have  already let down?   It is the workers we worry about the most. I have been on the factory  floors with these men and women. They are good people. They care deeply  about providing for themselves and their families. They just want their  promises kept.   What our union workers need is for Congress to come up with a long- term, bipartisan solution now. We will need to start over, Republicans  and Democrats working together to develop serious bipartisan reforms.   Again, I pledge to our chairman that Republicans are eager to engage,  if asked, to try to find this solution--for the first time, if we are  asked, to find a solution.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in opposition to the  bill from Heritage Action for America, Americans for Tax Reform, and  National Taxpayers Union.                                    Heritage Action for America,                                                      July 23, 2019.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Brady: This week, the House is expected       to consider H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer       Pensions Act (previously known as the Butch-Lewis Act). The       bill would essentially bail out over $600 billion in pension       liabilities at taxpayer expense without making any reforms to       ensure future shortfalls will be  [[Page H7333]]       avoided. This bill would also set a dangerous precedent for       other insolvent pensions, including the $6 trillion in       unfunded pension liabilities currently held by state and       local governments.        Politically, this is not an easy issue for many offices.       Every member wants to assure their constituents that he or       she is doing everything possible to protect their retirement       security. But there are four important considerations       representatives should take into account before voting on       this bill: 1) Existing policies have allowed pensions       shortfalls to grow uncontrollably and must be fixed before       any other actions are taken; 2) Private sector workers were       promised their pensions by their employers and their unions,       not by fellow taxpayers or the government; 3) There are       alternative ways to ensure workers receive most or all of       their pensions without a taxpayer bailout if action is taken       quickly; 4) bailouts set dangerous precedents, create moral       hazard, and shield bad actors.        Rather than bailing out multiemployer pensions plans       through costly loans that will never be paid back, lawmakers       should make them solvent by applying some of the tighter       rules that govern single-employer pensions (which were 79%       funded in 2015 vs. 43% for multiemployer), increasing PBGC       premiums, placing reasonable restrictions on growth       assumptions, and giving workers a buyout option.        Allowing taxpayer dollars to flow to private pensions       without even addressing the underlying causes of the       shortfall is an irresponsible non-solution to a growing       national problem. Heritage Action opposes this legislation       and urges all members of Congress to oppose it.            All the best,                                                   Garrett Bess,                                   Director of Government Relations,      Heritage Action for America.                                   ____                                         Americans for Tax Reform,                                   Washington, DC, November 1, 2018.      Re Multiemployer Pension Solvency.       Hon. Orrin Hatch,      Chairman, Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer           Pension Plans. U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sherrod Brown,      Co-Chairman, Joint Select Committee on Solvency of           Multiemployer Pension Plans, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Co-Chairmen Hatch and Brown: As the Joint Select       Committee on Multiemployer Pension Solvency considers       proposals to address the multiemployer pension crisis we urge       Congress to enact meaningful reform aimed at preventing the       situation from reoccurring and protecting taxpayers from       future burden. This crisis has created uncertainty for       millions of American workers planning their retirement and we       appreciate the committee's attention to this issue.        The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) currently       estimates that there are 100 multiemployer pension plans in       danger of insolvency if benefits are not reduced. The       Heritage Foundation assesses that multiemployer pensions hold       roughly $638 billion in unfunded pension promises with only 7       years before plans begin collapsing. Insolvency on this       widespread scale would likely bankrupt the PBGC, itself       underfunded, as it is required by law to insure retirees'       benefits up to $12,870 per year.        While promises were made to participants in multiemployer       plans, they were made by private labor unions, not the       government and certainly not taxpayers. While the enormity of       the problem may make government intervention a political       inevitability, taxpayers have no direct responsibility to       intervene. Any action considered by the committee should       therefore focus on minimizing taxpayers' burden and enacting       serious reform to prevent a future crisis from occurring       again.        Any proposal seeking to provide federal assistance to       multiemployer pensions should include the following reforms:        1. Improved Solvency of the PBGC. The first priority should       be ensuring the PBGC is capable of providing its intended       level of insured benefits to retirees. While the PBGC is not       taxpayer funded, it is still an entity of the government and       has failed to meet its obligations. Efforts at properly       funding the PBGC should focus upon raising standard       multiemployer premiums significantly to increase PBGC       revenues, requiring termination plans for insolvent plans and       introducing a standard PBGC eligibility age for new       individuals receiving PBGC benefits. An underfunded PBGC has       contributed to this crisis and increases the burden placed on       taxpayers, this problem must be addressed.        2. Accrual of new benefits should freeze while switching       employees to 401(k) plans. It is standard practice for       single-employer pension funds to immediately freeze accrual       of new benefits and switch employees to 401(k) plans when       seeking assistance from the Pension Benefit Guaranty       Corporation. Multiemployer pensions must be held to the same       standard. Despite approaching insolvency, multiemployer       pension plans continue to promise benefits several times more       generous than the typical employer contribution to 401(k)s.       Almost two-thirds of contributions made by multiemployer       plans simply cover newly earned benefits, an irrational       amount for plans approaching insolvency and seeking taxpayer       aid. Halting accruals will free up funds to pay current       benefits while new benefits will be more appropriately funded       through both employer and employee contributions.        3. Multiemployer plans must be held to appropriate funding       standards. Taxpayers should not be on the hook for pensions       taking on greater risk. Multiemployer pensions have been       granted special funding rules that allow them to set lower       employer contribution levels and rely on higher returns than       comparative single-employer plans. For example, while single-      employer plans are expected to resume full funding in seven       years, multiemployer employer plans are given thirty years to       payoff unfunded liabilities. Allowing multiemployer plans       this substantially larger time period has allowed the funding       shortage to snowball. As several participating employers went       bankrupt or withdrew over time, the remaining employers were       on the hook for guaranteeing the same investment returns to       participants of these ``orphaned plans.''        4. Beneficiaries should be protected within reason.       Retirees should be granted protection to their benefits, but       that protection must be given within fiscally responsible       limits. 401(k) holders don't receive a bailout if their       account drops, despite plans being funded by the employees       themselves. Retirees under single-employee pensions don't       receive unlimited PCGC protection despite more stringent       funding rules. Beneficiaries of multiemployer plans shouldn't       receive special treatment from the government simply because       their union representatives overpromised on returns. Perhaps       most importantly, having taxpayers fully cover the loss for       retirees will be a signal to employees that their union       representatives successfully advocated to protect them, when       in reality union leadership overpromised and underfunded       their pensions. To avoid a repeat scenario, this situation       must be recognized as a pension crisis, not business as usual       with a taxpayer safety net.        As the Joint Committee continues to consider a potential       solution, Americans for Tax Reform hopes that the committee       will work to lessen the burden on taxpayers and will pursue a       solution that prevents a similar pension crisis from       happening again.        Thank you for your consideration.            Onward,                                                Grover G. Norquist,      President, Americans for Tax Reform.                                   ____                                         National Taxpayers Union,                                      Washington, DC, July 23, 2019.        National Taxpayers Union urges all Representatives to vote       ``NO'' on H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer       Pensions Act. This legislation would bail out failing private       pension plans with few guardrails for taxpayers and cost at       least $67 billion over the next decade. Congress should       instead pursue legislation that tackles the multiemployer       pension plan (MPP) crisis in a prudent, determined, patient       and gradual way.        NTU has noted before that the MPP crisis, which affects 1.5       million Americans, deserves attention from Congress. However,       H.R. 397 is a flawed piece of legislation. We wrote last       month and in 2018 that, when it comes to MPPs, ``[i]nfusions       of cash from the Treasury with few restrictions tend to       characterize overreaction rather than corrective action.''       Unfortunately, this is exactly what H.R. 397 does, by       providing 30-year loans to failing MPPs with few guardrails       for taxpayer dollars. We believe that H.R. 397 will hurt       workers in the long run, by allowing plan sponsors to double       down on unrealistic promises and assumptions.        H.R. 397 will also exacerbate the troubled state of the       Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which is       scheduled to reach insolvency during fiscal year (FY) 2025.       Portions of PBGC's operations have appeared on the Government       Accountability Office's High Risk List for over a decade, and       H.R. 397 fails to introduce real reforms to PBGC.        Finally, we are alarmed by the Congressional Budget Office       (CBO) report that pegged the cost of H.R. 397 at more than       $67 billion over the next decade. NTU must add, though, that       even this troubling CBO score fails to account for the 30-      year timeframe on the repayment of loans issued to failing       MPPs. It is reasonable to assume that the 30-year costs to       taxpayers will be at least tens of billions of dollars more,       and even greater if MPPs fail to pay back the full principal       and interest on Treasury Department loans.        We have outlined more prudent reforms before: require PBGC       to more fully embrace risk pricing and other management tools       to safeguard against liability surprises in the future;       include a uniform, significant benefit reduction to show good       faith in, the reform effort; and require that loans be       collateralized with real-world assets that ensure the loans       will be entirely repaid over a term measured in years rather       than decades. We believe any of these reforms would present       far better options to solving the MPP crisis than H.R. 397.        NTU strongly urges Representatives to oppose H.R. 397, and       instead work towards prudent, determined, patient and gradual       solutions to the MPP crisis that avoid putting taxpayers on       the hook for multibillion-dollar bailouts.        Roll call votes on H.R. 397 will be included in our annual       Rating of Congress and a ``no'' vote will be considered the       pro-taxpayer position.    I am convinced we can find a solution. This isn't the  right thing for our workers, but there is a right way to help them. We  are serious about making that happen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
