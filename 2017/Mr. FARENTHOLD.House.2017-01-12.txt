 Mr. Speaker, for the past several days, this morning  during our morning-hour debate, I have been listening to my colleagues  across the aisle talking about the dire consequences the repeal of  ObamaCare will have. Well, I have got to tell you something. It is  already having dire consequences. The law itself is having dire  consequences.   Americans like my constituent Dotty Legg from Victoria, Texas, wrote  to my office with a desperate plea to get relief from the effects of  ObamaCare. In 2012, Dotty's coverage was around $400 a month with a  $2,500 deductible. In 2014, it went up to almost $600. In 2015, $700 a  month, and that is coverage for just one person.   Well, in 2016, Dotty's carrier told her they could no longer cover  her, so she had to go somewhere else. She went to another carrier and  they only had an option that was almost $700 a month, and her  deductible skyrocketed to $6,500. That is pretty unaffordable for  something called the Affordable Care Act.   I have got to tell you, back before ObamaCare, back before the  Affordable Care Act, a policy with a $6,500 deductible would have been  one of the least expensive policies you could have bought. It would  have been a catastrophic policy. We have got to fix this.   It gets even worse. We don't see what goes on in 2017. The company is  pulling out. Dotty can't find coverage at all.   The Affordable Care Act is not affordable, and it is full of broken  promises. Most of the promises made were broken with Dotty. If you like  your doctor, you can keep them. She hasn't been able to keep her  doctor. Prices are going to go down? Come on. If you like your policy,  you are going to keep it. Didn't happen.   We have got to fix this, and Republicans have a plan. We are going to  work the plan. It is at better.gop. It is one of those new top-level  domains, better.gop. We have got to fix it because ObamaCare is nothing  but, as we say on the Internet, a big old #fail.                 Second Amendment Rights for Military Spouses     Mr. Speaker, I would also like to talk about our  military spouses.   We often overlook the tremendous sacrifice our military spouses make  to support their husbands and wives. They often move far from home and  family to be with their spouse on military orders, but they give up  their friends, the comfort of home, and even some of their Second  Amendment rights.   The Gun Control Act of 1968 limits citizens' rights to purchase a  handgun by requiring that it only be bought in the State where they are  considered residents. Exceptions were made for Active-Duty military  members but not their spouses; and that is why I have introduced H.R.  256, the Protect Our Military Families' Second Amendment Rights Act,  which allows spouses of Active-Duty servicemembers to purchase firearms  in the State where they live under their spouse's military orders.   Military spouses should not be denied their Second Amendment rights  because they choose to live with their husband or wife while they are  deployed. Spouses have the right to defend themselves and their  families, just like everyone else. While I believe we must continue to  push for things like constitutional carry, H.R. 256 is a good step in  ensuring Second Amendment rights are respected.                                time  1030          Congratulating Coach Jason Herring and the Refugio Bobcats     Mr. Speaker, on a lighter note, I would also like to  congratulate Coach Jason Herring and the Refugio Bobcats football team  for winning their fourth Texas State AA championship.   The Bobcats had a 15-1 record this school year and defeated Crawford  in the championship game 23-20 in an impressive game-winning 15-yard  field goal by kicker Diego Gonzalez with only 8 seconds remaining.   Quarterback Jacobe Avery was the championship game's offensive MVP,  and linebacker Kobie Herring was named defensive MVP. This was an  impressive year for the whole team.   Winning is a Bobcat tradition. Congratulations, Refugio Bobcats.                            ____________________
