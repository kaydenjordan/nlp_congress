 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to talk about the  economic resource warfare that the CCP has launched against the United  States.   As a former businessowner, I can tell you the CCP continues to steal  hundreds of billions of dollars in intellectual property from American  companies with no consequence.   Under the current weak administration that has lost credibility on  the world stage after the failed Afghan withdrawal, they have shown no  course of action to combat these issues, but there is a plan now.   Thanks to the American people who elected a Republican majority, I am  happy to support establishing this select committee to hold the CCP  accountable.   I am committed to putting us back ahead of the malign Chinese  aggressions. While this resolution is just a start, we need to also  look at mitigating Chairman Xi's One Belt, One Road initiative and  increase domestic production to offset our GDP-to-national-debt ratio  while unleashing American energy production and strengthening the U.S.  dollar.   This bill is a commonsense approach that will put America first and  stop adversarial reliance on nations that intend to eliminate the U.S.  dollar from being the global currency, cut off Western Hemisphere  supply chains, and advance China's goal of hegemony.   Let's get this done and put America first.
