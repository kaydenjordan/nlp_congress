 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my beloved Monroe  County as we enter the 200th year of our county's rich and storied  history.   A small rural county in south central Kentucky, Monroe County is home  to communities steeped in history and tradition. Whether you are from  Tompkinsville, Gamaliel, or Fountain Run, you have a shared Monroe  County identity.   If you are a Monroe Countian, you more than likely enjoy our  legendary barbecue and probably have countless stories to tell about  our county's rich history, especially our political history.   This Sunday, January 19, hundreds of us will gather to celebrate  Monroe County's 200th birthday. As we meet at the Tompkinsville  National Guard Armory for this proud occasion, I will be seeing many of  the friendly faces that shaped my upbringing and remain good friends to  this day.   Monroe County holds a special place in my heart; and now, more than  ever, I am proud to serve as a voice for our citizens right here in our  Nation's Capitol.                                time  1045                   Taking a Stand Against Sanctuary Cities     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern about the  upturn of sanctuary cities across the United States and push for action  to enhance public safety by further cracking down on illegal  immigration.   There should be consequences for not following the law. Local  governments that choose not to enforce immigration laws recklessly put  lives at risk. Senseless deaths occasionally result from crimes  committed by criminal illegal aliens who take refuge in sanctuary  cities.   Action is needed to prevent more harm from cities refusing to  cooperate with Federal immigration officials. Allowing cities to tie  the hands of our brave law enforcement officers and ignore the law  should not be tolerated. I am calling on Congress to strengthen the  safety of our communities by passing legislation banning sanctuary  cities.   But while we continue to await action on this important issue, States  are stepping up and making this a top priority. I want to commend the  leaders in my home State of Kentucky who are taking proactive action to  ban sanctuary cities and strengthen public safety. The leadership they  are showing on this issue is an important step toward giving law  enforcement more tools to go after major problems like drug trafficking  and will benefit all Kentuckians.                 Delayed Transmission of Impeachment Articles     Mr. Speaker, as of today, it has been 4 weeks since House  Democrats voted, in a historically partisan manner, to impeach  President Donald Trump.   In voting to silence the will of 63 million Americans, they made  clear that they were not here to work for the American people but to  carry out a personal vendetta. Even a few House Democrats realized that  impeachment was not in the best interest of our country, joining  Republicans to oppose this baseless crusade.   But after their vote, Speaker Pelosi realized they had made a grave  mistake. Their sham process and evidence-free case went against the  wishes of the American people.   Knowing their case was baseless, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats  sat on these articles for 1 month. After originally claiming that  impeachment was an urgent crisis and insisting that President Trump was  a threat to national security, Democrats sat on their hands and delayed  a timely trial on their own shoddy work product.   But the day has finally come where they are sending their weak case  over to the Senate. I look forward to the day where Congress may  finally move on from this partisan impeachment process that has wasted  an amazing amount of time and resources and distracted from issues that  matter most to the American people.   While I am disappointed that we have reached this sad point in this  congressional body, I look forward to seeing a more fair and  responsible hearing in the Senate.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the precious  lives of Preston Cope and Bailey Holt, two victims of a tragic school  shooting at Marshall County High School in Benton, Kentucky, 2 years  ago. This tragic event devastated the Benton community and took two  lives away from us far too soon.   Preston and Bailey continue to be dearly missed by their families and  the Marshall County community, which has shown incredible resilience in  the face of trying circumstances. Preston Cope and Bailey Holt remain  in our hearts and minds to this day.                            ____________________
