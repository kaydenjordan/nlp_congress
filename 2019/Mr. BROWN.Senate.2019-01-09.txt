 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday I left my home in Cleveland and  kissed my wife good-bye and headed to the airport early in the morning.  I went to gates A, B, and C in the Cleveland Airport and talked to the  TSA agents who are all working and working without pay.   Then, when I got to Washington--I flew into National Airport--I went  straight to a building in Arlington where I talked to cafeteria  workers. They are Federal contract workers who serve food at our  Smithsonian museums and other Federal facilities. They don't work for  the Federal Government. Their paychecks don't come from the Federal  Government. They are contracted through a company and then paid by  these companies. They have lost their jobs during the Trump shutdown.   These workers, making $12, $13, $14--some with some seniority make  $15. They are union. They make 2 or 3 dollars more than the nonunion  comparable workers. But they are not getting paid.   Unlike the 800,000 Federal workers, some working without pay, some  furloughed--unlike them, if history is a judge, they will not get paid  those lost wages. So these are people making $12, $13, $14 an hour who  have already lost 2 weeks of work because of the Trump shutdown, and  unless Congress acts, they have no prospect to get that back pay.  Again, their wages are at that level.   Then, last night, to sort of cap the day, in my apartment here I  watched the President of the United States talk about his wall and dig  in a little more.   You know, I wish President Trump would talk to the workers he is  hurting with this shutdown. I wish that he would go out and, as  President Lincoln used to say, get his ``public opinion bath'' and  listen to these workers; that he would leave the White House or Mar-a- Lago, where he spends most of his time, and talk to these workers I  talked to yesterday--the TSA workers in Cleveland who are working  without pay. The anxiety levels are going up and up and up for these  workers because this coming Saturday they will miss their first  paycheck--and then beyond that too. This also affects the food service  workers.  [[Page S93]]    Last week, President Trump said--imagine this, a billionaire  President--his shutdown, the Trump shutdown, which he proudly, as  Commander in Chief, said: ``I am proud of this shutdown.'' Last week,  he said: ``This shutdown has a higher purpose than next week's pay.''  Imagine that, a billionaire President, living in this beautiful house  paid for by taxpayers and having his estate in Mar-a-Lago, and he would  say: ``This shutdown,'' this Trump shutdown, ``has a higher purpose  than next week's pay.''   I wonder if he would tell that to TSA workers, the ones I met in  Cleveland, including Aaron Bankston, who told me:         If you're the only breadwinner in your family, and to have       your kids looking up at you, it's hard to tell them, we don't       have anything to put food on the table, that's the hard part.        We just have to get us back working. We're working       diligently over here, trying to make sure we're securing       America.    Mr. President, tell the cafeteria workers I talked with there is a  higher purpose than their week's pay because, remember, it is not just  Federal employees feeling the pain. There are also these contractors.  There are 800,000 Federal employees. We think--we can't get the number  from the government yet--I am not sure the administration wants to tell  us these numbers. There are thousands and thousands and thousands of  contract workers making $10, $12, $15 an hour--making a little more if  they are lucky enough to have a union, but some making as little as $8  or $9 or $10 an hour.   A lot of Americans don't realize that thousands of janitors and  cafeteria workers and security guards are out of work because of the  President. You know, it is all kinds of Federal employees. It is people  who process tax returns at the IRS. It is people who are helping  farmers adjust to the new farm bill we passed proudly--Senators Roberts  and Stabenow and a bunch of others. It is about people wanting to get a  mortgage, and they can't get it approved at FHA because of this  shutdown. It is also people making $8 and $10 and $12 an hour. Unless  we do something, these workers will not get the backpay they should get  because they are employed by private contractors. They have no way, at  $12 and $15 an hour--without pay, they have no way of making up their  lost hours and lost wages. I am working with a relatively new Minnesota  Senator, Ms. Smith, on legislation to try to come up with a solution to  get these workers backpay, the way that workers who are actual Federal  employees get backpay. Fundamentally, it comes down to respecting the  dignity of work. That means respecting the dignity of work and that  these workers make a decent wage with decent benefits.   Missing one paycheck may not seem like a lot to the billionaire  President and the multimillionaire Cabinet with their massive  investment portfolio.   I will say that again. Missing one 2-week paycheck or two 2-week  paychecks or even, if the President gets his way, three 2-week  paychecks may not seem like a lot to a billionaire President and a  multimillionaire Cabinet with their massive investment portfolios, but  it means a whole lot to these people. Missing a paycheck is a big, big  deal that the President of the United States clearly either doesn't  understand or doesn't care about.   The President doesn't understand that working people can't just send  a letter to creditors saying: Excuse me from paying rent this month or  paying my mortgage or paying for my medications. You can't put  groceries or gas in the car with an IOU.   One of those cafeteria workers told me in Arlington: I have to pay  rent. I have other bills. I have a college student in community  college. He needs help with his books. He said: President Trump, I am  asking would you please open the government. Everyone is going through  hardship. We really don't want this wall you want.   I am guessing the President of the United States, the billionaire  President, jetting back and forth between the White House and Mar-a- Lago in Florida, will never talk to not just these workers I talked to  in Virginia or those TSA employees in Cleveland--I am sure he will not  talk to them, but I hope he will talk to some people like them.   He spends his time in his resort, but he doesn't see them. To him,  they are invisible, but Mitch McConnell can see them. Mitch McConnell's  office is down the hall on the right about 100 feet. I have shared on  this floor before how lobbyists, during the tax bill, when President  Trump and the majority in the Senate and the majority in the House gave  a $1.5 trillion tax cut--and 70 percent of that tax cut went to the  richest 1 percent, people like themselves, the President, the Cabinet,  many Members of the Senate, many Members of the House. I documented it  to show--as I looked out this door and opened these doors, I showed  this is the place where the lobbyists go in and out of the majority  leader's office, talking to him about their special interest  legislation.   So I ask--right now, Senator McConnell could come out of his office,  and he could walk down this hall. I would be happy to open the door for  him, if that is not contrary to Senate rules. I would be happy to open  the door for him and welcome him. He could right now vote to reopen the  government and get this process moving and tell the President of the  United States. He also could go to Virginia. He also could go to the  airport in Louisville or Cincinnati, and he could listen to their  stories, but he doesn't seem to be listening either because I am  guessing if he did, he might be a little more inclined to let us vote  to get these workers back on the job.   I am calling on Senator McConnell to come out of that office, to walk  down this hall, and to come here and begin the process of opening the  government.   Let's talk for a minute about what the President said last night. The  President continued his record of telling lie after lie after lie after  lie, misleading the people he is supposed to serve. Facts matter. So  when you hear the President say we need a wall, remember that it is a  fact that illegal border crossings are at historic lows. It is not fake  news. My wife says if it is fake, it is not news, and if it is news, it  is not fake. It is a fact that border crossings are at historic lows.   Another fact, border crossings are down about 80 percent since 2000.  Another fact, the President's wall would do nothing to stop opioids  coming into our communities. First, most illegal opioids are seized at  legal points of entry, not tracked over some remote area of Texas.  Fact, the shutdown makes it harder for Customs and Border Protection to  do their jobs intercepting those opioids.   Another fact, last year we passed the INTERDICT Act. I worked with my  colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, and Senator Markey from  Massachusetts on a bipartisan bill to get Customs and Border Protection  the screening devices they need to test for opioids. Why would we focus  on the President's vanity project, building this wall? A promise he  made--remember his promise? ``I will build the wall, and the Mexicans  will pay for it.'' Well, he is now asking American taxpayers, over  time, to pay $25 or $30 billion.   Why would we focus on the President's vanity project instead of  getting the agents and technology they need? We can do this with  agents, technology, helicopters, and all the things we need to do to  protect the border because that is what we want to do. We don't want  this vanity project. We want to protect the border.   Another fact, most undocumented immigrants aren't committing crimes.  In fact, there are 56 percent fewer criminal convictions of  undocumented immigrants than of native-born Texans. So a native-born  Texan is more likely, percentagewise, to commit a crime than an  undocumented person living in Texas.   Keep in mind the facts of what this shutdown is costing the American  people; 800,000 Federal workers are going without a paycheck; 420,000  of them are on the job without pay; thousands of contract workers,  custodians, cafeteria workers, janitors not only are not getting a  paycheck, but they probably never will for this lost work.   Here is another fact. The President and Senator McConnell could end  the shutdown right now. The Senate passed a bill unanimously to fund  the government in December. That is a fact. We passed it. It is a fact.  It was unanimous. It is a fact. The House passed bills to fund the  government last week. It is a fact. Senator McConnell right now could  come out of that office, walk  [[Page S94]]  down this hall, and Senator McConnell could put those House bills on  the floor right now, and we could vote to end this shutdown. We could  send them to the President's desk, and if the President is going to  continue his vanity project and continue this Trump shutdown and he  vetoes it, we have the ability to override it.   The President doesn't tell us what to do. He seems to be telling the  Republican majority what to do day after day. I applaud those who stood  up to him recently and said they want to open the government, but it is  also a fact that this President said: ``I am proud to shut down the  government.''   The Commander in Chief of the United States of America--the Commander  in Chief--the top person in this country's government said: ``I am  proud to shut down the government.''   Facts matter. The fact is, President Trump, once again, as he  betrayed the General Motors workers in Lordstown, as he betrayed the  General Motors suppliers--all the companies that supply the building of  the Chevy Cruz--he has betrayed these Federal workers; he has betrayed  these contract workers who are making $10, $12, and $15 an hour; and he  has betrayed the American worker.   I yield the floor.
