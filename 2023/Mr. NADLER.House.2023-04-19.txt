 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 734,  the so-called Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act.   I say so-called because there is really nothing in this bill to  protect women and girls in sports. It is telling that every amendment  submitted by a Democrat to actually strengthen protections, such as  addressing unequal funding, was ruled out as not germane by  Republicans.   There are many real issues facing our Nation's women's and girls'  sports teams, including disproportionate funding and resources compared  to their male counterparts, but transgender athletes are not one of  them.   Every sports federation supports transgender athletes competing on an  equal basis, seeing no inherent advantage in sports competition for  transgender athletes.   Transgender young people experience increased incidences of bullying,  rejection, and discrimination, and nearly half of trans women and girls  report seriously considering suicide in the past year.   Why would we consider this hateful legislation that aims to isolate  an already vulnerable group of children further?   Mr. Chair, I am proud to have been the first Member of Congress to  speak out in support of transgender rights on the House floor. I do not  support traumatizing young children by subjecting them to intrusive  genital inspections.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to urge my colleagues to oppose this hateful  bill.
