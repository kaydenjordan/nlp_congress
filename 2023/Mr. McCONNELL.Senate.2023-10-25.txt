 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, government funding is set to run out in  23 days. We have a responsibility to keep the lights on and to avoid  the disastrous effects of a shutdown.   We also need to make serious headway toward the full-year funding  process the Nation actually deserves. This week, thanks to a lot of  hard work from Senator Collins, Senator Murray, and our colleagues on  the Appropriations Committee, the Senate will finally take an important  step in the right direction. As we continue to review the President's  request for urgent supplemental appropriations--and make necessary  changes--Senate Republicans stand ready to vote on a robust package of  amendments to this full-year appropriations measure and pass it quickly  out here on the floor.                                    Israel    Mr. President, now on another matter, it has been 18 days since the  brutal terrorist attacks of October 7, 18 days since savages confronted  the world with the depths of human depravity, since one of the oldest  forms of hatred in human history reared its ugly head, since radical  Islamic terrorists reminded us they pose a persistent threat to the  civilized world.   In our shock, the West vowed solidarity. We pledged not to look away  from the horrors Israel was grieving. We reaffirmed Israel's right to  defend itself, and we promised to stand with our ally as it fought back  against pure evil.   But in the last 18 days, silence, amnesia, cowardice, and outright  hate have begun to take their toll. All too quickly, the West's resolve  has shown signs of weakness.   First, we saw the most elite corners of higher education rush to  blame Israel for the deaths of its own children. We saw college  administrators tie themselves in grotesque moral knots to avoid  acknowledging reality, even in the face of alumni revolts.   Last night, for example, at George Washington University, here in the  Nation's Capital, student activists projected anti-Semitic messages on  the side of the campus building named for a pair of Jewish benefactors.  They issued a call to ``free Palestine from the river to the sea.''   For anyone unfamiliar with Israel's geography, that is a call for the  destruction of the Jewish State.   But, just a few blocks away, the Biden administration is in denial.  After protestors in Time Square displayed the Nazi swastika and an  Israeli student at Columbia University was beaten with a stick, the  White House Press Secretary replied to a question about rising concerns  of anti-Semitism that ``we have not seen any credible threats.'' That  is the White House Press Secretary. Even more absurd was how, in the  very next breath, without even uttering the word ``Jew,'' she pivoted  abruptly to condemning Islamophobia.    Seriously, after thousands of Jews have been tortured and murdered,  after hundreds have been taken hostage, after the sight of Jewish  bodies paraded through Gaza was met with rejoicing from Arab capitals  to London--after all of this--President Biden's Press Secretary  reverted to the disgraceful ``both sides'' talking points.   Of course, as I have discussed before, the media organizations who  engage with her deserve their own share of shame. Some in the press are  already indulging the same tired language designed to sap the free  world's sense of moral clarity. Headlines are already warning about the  indiscernible ``cycle of violence'' and amplifying morally bankrupt  calls for a cease-fire.   For anyone who needs a reminder, a cease-fire is what Israel thought  it had with Hamas and with Palestinian Islamic Jihad earlier this  summer. A cease-fire today is an amnesty for Hamas, a free path for  terrorists from the same savage tribe as ISIS and al-Qaida.   So less than 3 weeks after the deadliest slaughter of Jews since the  Holocaust, too many prominent corners of our society already need a  reminder--a reminder--of the terrorist horrors that actually started  the war.   Yesterday, I welcomed a group of important visitors to my office,  among them were family members of Israelis being held hostage by Hamas.  Two had survived the attacks and witnessed the terror firsthand. I  would like to share with our colleagues two of their stories.   First was Netta, a 20-year-old student who lived in a kibbutz in  southern Israel. Netta told me that he woke up on October 7 to the  sound of sirens. He talked about how he armed himself with a kitchen  knife, barricaded himself in an interior room, and leaned against the  door as terrorists ransacked his apartment. Netta told me about how he  realized hours later, when his mother stopped replying to his texts,  that his parents had been taken hostage by Hamas.   I also heard from a young woman named Maya who was at the music  festival that morning with her friends. Maya described to me yesterday  the sounds of rockets interrupting the party at sunrise. She described  how she cried the first time she saw a victim lying in the road as she  fled, not knowing if he was alive or dead. She recalled how she turned  left on a road in search of safe haven while many of her friends--two  of whom would be murdered--turned right. She told me how she called her  father to say, ``I love you, and I don't know if I will make it out,''  and how she waited hours in a kibbutz shelter, assuming that her ``time  was coming.''   She remembers how news spread in message groups about which of her  friends had made it out alive, and how friends witnessed bodies blown  apart by grenades. Maya told me she is haunted by the images her  friends shared of Hamas desecrating bodies and by how they seemed to  enjoy it. She said she feels guilty for encouraging her friends to join  her at the music festival that Saturday.   This is why Israel fights.   The attacks of October 7 confronted the world with the sort of  horrors Jewish communities have no choice but to remember for  generations. From European villages caught in pogroms to the horrors of  Nazi Germany, to Israeli kibbutzim burned and bloodied by Hamas  terrorists. For decades, the free world refrain has been: ``Never  forget. Never again.''   God help us if we do not mean what we say.   There is no room for false moral equivalency. Let me repeat that:  There is no room for false moral equivalency.   We must not forget who is responsible, and we must hold them  accountable. Terror and self-defense are not the same thing. One side  started the war, but the other side will finish it. And the United  States must give Israel the time, space, and support to bring innocent  people home and bring murderous terrorists to justice.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
