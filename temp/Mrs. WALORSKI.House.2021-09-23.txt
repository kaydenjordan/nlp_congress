 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of my fellow Hoosier, Corporal Humberto Sanchez. Alongside 12  of his brothers and sisters in arms, Corporal Sanchez died in the line  of duty while helping to evacuate Americans and allies from  Afghanistan.   This young Hoosier knew the risks of the mission and yet, he stood in  the face of danger to help vulnerable children evacuate Abbey Gate at  the Kabul airport. Instead of running from danger, he stayed at his  post and finished the job before him.   Corporal Sanchez exemplified the greatest of the American spirit, a  selfless willingness to lay down one's life to serve and protect. His  service is the starkest reminder today that freedom is not free.   The American people are indebted to Corporal Sanchez, to each of the  fallen, and to their families. We will never forget these heroes.                            ____________________
