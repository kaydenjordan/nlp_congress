 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I rise in support of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, led  by our esteemed colleague, Representative Sewell.   During the civil rights movement, I was the child in the stroller at  the March on Washington. My father served as the Illinois branch  president of the NAACP for over 25 years, and I was raised to always  fight for what is right and just, to stand up for those who do not  always have a voice.   My father planned marches to strengthen our voting rights. I can  still picture him presiding over meetings at our kitchen table, our  house filled with poster boards and preparations and hope.   When it comes to voting rights, my father's work is still unfinished.  Today, I am so proud that we are taking this step toward completing  that work.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Voting  Rights Advancement Act.
