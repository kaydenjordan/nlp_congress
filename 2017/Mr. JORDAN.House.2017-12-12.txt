 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, did the Comey FBI and the Obama Justice Department  coordinate with the Democratic Party to go after the Republican Party?  Did the FBI and the Justice Department work hand in glove with the  Clinton campaign to go after the Trump campaign? That is the  fundamental question. That is the fundamental question.   And think about what we have learned in the last several weeks:   First, we learned that the DNC and the Clinton campaign paid for the  dossier. The DNC and the Clinton campaign, which we now know are one  and the same, paid for the dossier. They first paid their law firm, who  then paid Fusion GPS, who then paid Christopher Steele, who then paid  Russians. This is a great irony.   We have Special Counsel Mueller investigating possible coordination  between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016  Presidential election, yet we know, just as sure as I am standing on  the House floor tonight, the Clinton campaign paid Russians to do what?  Influence the 2016 Presidential election.   They paid for the dossier. It has been reported--and I think it  happened--but it has been reported the dossier became the basis to  secure warrants at the FISA court. In other words, they took this  dossier, this disproven dossier, fake news, National Enquirer, garbage  dossier, they dressed it all up, they spruced it all up, they took it  to the FISA court and then got a judge to say: Okay, that is enough to  spy on Americans.   That is what has been reported. And all of the evidence points to  that actually taking place.   So they used this dossier, this disproven dossier, to spy on  Americans.   And then what have we learned in just the past 5 days?                                time  1745    Bruce Ohr, the Associate Deputy Attorney General; Bruce Ohr, four  doors down from Mr. Rosenstein; Bruce Ohr, the top guy at the Justice  Department, in 2016, during the campaign, is meeting with the guy who  wrote the dossier, meeting with Christopher Steele.   Bruce Ohr, the top guy at the Justice Department, the Associate  Deputy Attorney General, and four doors down from Mr. Rosenstein is  also meeting with Glenn Simpson, the guy who founded Fusion GPS, the  people who paid for the dossier.   So you have got Bruce Ohr, the top official at the Justice  Department, hanging out with the guy who wrote and the guy who paid for  the dossier during the campaign.   Here is the kicker. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Here is the  kicker. At the same time that Bruce Ohr is meeting with him, we learn  that Bruce Ohr's wife is being paid by Fusion GPS, working for the  people who paid Christopher Steele to write the dossier that we believe  was taken to the FISA court to secure warrants to spy on Americans  associated with the Trump campaign.   We know all that happened. That is all public. We know that is the  truth. Now, what Mr. Gaetz is saying--and this is why I appreciate the  work that Mr. Gaetz and my colleagues are doing on this--and what we  are saying: Look, give us the documents. Answer our questions, for  crying out loud. And if you won't, then appoint a special counsel--a  second special counsel so the American people can get the truth.   Because if this, in fact, happened--and I think it did--where you had  the Justice Department, the FBI working with one campaign to go after  the other campaign, working with the Clinton campaign to go after  President Trump's campaign, then that is as wrong as it gets. That is  something that should never take place in the United States of America.   That is why this is so important. That is why the work that  Congressman Gaetz and other colleagues are doing is so important.   Again, if you are not going to do the job, Justice Department, at  least appoint a second special counsel so we can get answers and we can  hold people accountable who did this in this great country.
