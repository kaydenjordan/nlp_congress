 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to this Republican rescission package.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump and congressional Republicans are trying  to take deconstructing government to a new level. They are proposing to  take $15 billion in Federal funds away from the citizenry and  investment in our economy budgeted for the Children's Health Insurance  Program, medical innovation, advanced manufacturing, infrastructure  projects, and the list goes on.   Why?   They are doing so to pay for a tiny fraction of their $1.5 trillion  tax cut for the rich. This is just another example of their  irresponsible governance.   What is on the chopping block?   With this rescission package, the majority would cut the balances in  the Children's Health Insurance Program by $7 billion, simply send them  back to the Treasury. They would cut funding when we should be  investing in critical services for children and families.   They would cut funding that helps workers who have lost their jobs  due to trade access health insurance.   They would cut funding for AmeriCorps and prevent more people from  serving vulnerable populations in their communities.   They would cut funding for critical healthcare infrastructure  projects.   Just a few months ago, we used these funds to replace the Biosafety  Level 4 laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control. This lab is  necessary for handling the most highly pathogenic organisms, such as  Ebola, other hemorrhagic fevers, and smallpox. This is a critical piece  of public health infrastructure. Why do Republicans want to cut its  source of funding?   They would cut funding for programs that rural America depends on,  rural housing programs, rural water programs. For example, it would  rescind $15 million from the Value Added Producer Grant Program, a  vital lifeline for small businesses in rural America.   Well, I want to remind Americans that the President and his House  allies are betraying the promise they made to the American people, Mr.  Speaker.   In March, we agreed to historic and urgently needed funding for our  families. The omnibus funding bill for 2018 made important investments  in health, education, and job programs. It made critical investments  that boost the middle class.   It was not easy. We worked hard to come to an overwhelmingly  bipartisan agreement that benefits the people of this country. And now,  months later, the Trump administration and House Republicans are  violating the spirit of that agreement. It is not a serious way to  govern.   This is money for our children, not for the President to claw back to  placate fervent conservatives who maintain their drumbeat on Twitter  and TV.   And what do Republicans get for breaking their word, going back on  their promises and taking from children?   Well, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Mr. Speaker, the  actual impact of this rescission package would amount to $1 billion  over 10 years. That is less than 1 percent of the Republicans' $1.5  trillion tax scam for the rich. In fact, it is one one-hundredth of a  percent.   If Republicans are so worried about spending, why not rescind the  money from the tax giveaway to corporations that are using it to buy  back stock? They are not raising wages.   Well, they appear to be beholden to the lobbyists and the insiders  who have profited so exorbitantly from that gift. And according to the  Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, 83 percent of the tax scam  benefits will go to the top 1 percent.   And those big boosts to paychecks? They have not materialized.   You look at Walmart. They spent $20 billion on stock buybacks for  their shareholders; yet, according to the Roosevelt Institute, had  Walmart instead dedicated that money to workers, they could have raised  wages to more than $16 an hour. They did not.    Mr. Speaker, budgets, spending, appropriations, and rescissions  reflect our values, and it is clearer than ever that President Trump,  Speaker Ryan, and the Republicans in the Congress value corporations  and the wealthy, not people who work for a living or those who are the  most vulnerable. They rig the rules for the rich and rob from the poor  to pay for it.   Congress must reject President Trump's proposal and put forth  policies that work for the middle class and families and for those who  are most vulnerable, not balance the budget on their backs.   The American people would be far better served if Congressional  Republicans joined with Democrats to fund critical investments in  education, healthcare, infrastructure, and protecting our retirement  programs.   When teachers are protesting across the country for fair pay,  Republicans want to go backwards. When Americans are stuck in jobs that  do not pay enough to live on, Republicans want to go backwards. When 40  percent of households cannot afford the basics of a modern, middle  class lifestyle, Republicans want to go backwards.   Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable, and the American people deserve  better.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   But the gentleman hasn't told us that the money they take from CHIP  is not going into programs for children. It is going back to the  Treasury, so we will take a look at cuts to Head Start, maternal child  health programs, childhood immunization, newborn screening, child lead  poisoning prevention, and many others. Tell the whole story.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Lowey), the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York.

Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Ryan), the ranking member of the Legislative Branch  Appropriations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Ohio.   Mr. RYAN of OHIO. Mr. Speaker, we have 50-some percent of the people  in this country who can't withstand a $500 emergency.   Our pension system is collapsing. Our financial aid system is  collapsing.   We have got to make a decision to reinvest back in this country. And  the Republican leadership here is disinvesting in the United States. We  are seeing it with the stock buybacks, we are seeing it with the tax  cut, and now we are seeing it with the rescissions package.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is the ranking member of the  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), who is a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of  opposition from First Focus Campaign for Children, the National  Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, Committee for Education Funding,  National Housing Conference, Service Employees International Union,  faith organizations, and other national organizations.                              First Focus Campaign for Children,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2018.        Dear Representative: I am writing on behalf of First Focus       Campaign for Children, a bipartisan national organization       dedicated to improving the health and well-being of our       nation's children, to express our strong opposition to H.R.       3, the so-called ``Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary       Programs Act.''        Unfortunately, the proposed rescission of $15 billion in       spending authority included in H.R. 3 targets children in       about half of all the cuts. Moreover, of all the thousands of       programs in hundreds of departments and agencies across the       federal government, the Children's Health Insurance Program       (CHIP), which just went through a nearly two-year       reauthorization process that was finally passed more than       four months past its expiration date, is targeted for more       than $7 billion of the proposed cuts.        Over the two-decade history of CHIP, it has--in tandem with       Medicaid and private health insurance--cut the uninsured rate       for children by more than two-thirds. During this recent       reauthorization process, a nationwide poll conducted by the       Kaiser Family Foundation found that 88 percent of Americans       felt that Congress should make the extension of CHIP funding       a top priority. The program has always had strong bipartisan       support, as it did this year.        CHIP is financed as a block grant, which means that its       funding is arbitrarily capped and fails to adjust to changes       in unforeseen or unanticipated need, such as economic       recessions, epidemics, changes in funding to the program to       improve access to care, or natural disasters. Consequently,       in the early years of CHIP, the program faced some difficult       moments whereby some states imposed waiting lists and       enrollment freezes when federal funding failed to meet the       needs of children. Those indefinite waiting lists and       enrollment freezes were imposed without regard to disability       or need, including children with cancer, cystic fibrosis,       severe asthma, and other life-threatening or severe       conditions.        In recognition of the fact that waiting periods and       enrollment freezes were threatening the lives and well-being       of children, Congress revamped CHIP's financing in a number       of ways, including the creation of CHIP's Child Enrollment       Contingency Fund in 2009. The CHIP contingency fund is set at       20 percent of overall CHIP spending and acts as a critically       important backstop that protects against unforeseen or       unanticipated federal funding shortfalls that threaten the       health of children.        During the lengthy two-year most recent bipartisan       reauthorization of CHIP that culminated in a six-year       extension and a subsequent addition of four more years for a       total of 10 years, there was no discussion or debate about       changing the CHIP Child Enrollment Contingency Fund, as it       has worked to protect the health of children. And yet, the       Administration is now proposing and Congress is considering       H.R. 3, which would slash the CHIP contingency fund by $1.9       billion, or nearly 80 percent, and undermine its very       purpose.        In making this proposal that targets CHIP for the bulk of       its proposed cuts, the Administration argues that the       contingency fund ``will likely not be spent'' and points to       the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score that the cut       doesn't save any money as confirmation that it probably won't       be harmful to children. And yet, during the lengthy CHIP       reauthorization process, the Administration never proposed       slashing the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund from 20       percent of the allotments to just 3-4 percent, as the       rescission would do.        Even worse, the proposed rescission of the contingency fund       fundamentally fails to understand the very purpose of a       contingency that, by definition, is ``a future event or       circumstance that is possible but cannot be predicted with       certainty.'' Neither the Administration nor CBO can guarantee       that there will not be an economic recession, a health       epidemic like Zika, or a natural disaster, which are all more       likely during the forthcoming summer months. In fact, CBO       doesn't ``score'' such events for that very reason.        As a result, the proposed rescission or raid of the CHIP       contingency fund by $1.9 billion, or 80 percent, undermines       the very reason for the fund, which is to protect the health       coverage of children against unanticipated or unforeseen       circumstances, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, or even       Hawaii's currently unanticipated erupting volcano.        Another critically important point to make is that the       proposed rescission to the CHIP Child Enrollment Contingency       Fund would not save money. The contingency fund is set at 20       percent of the overall CHIP allotment each year, so any money       raided from the fund this year is automatically restored in       the following year. In other words, over a two-year period,       this proposed rescission would not save a single penny       because any money raided from the contingency fund this year       would be restored in the following year.        Consequently, the only effect of the proposed $1.9 billion       rescission the CHIP contingency fund would be to needlessly       put the health and well-being of our nation's children at       risk. In other words, H.R. 3 unnecessarily gambles with the       health of our children under the guise that there probably       won't be unanticipated or unforeseen events that might cause       a state or states to need to tap into the contingency fund.        It is also important to point out that the CHIP extensions,       including the CHIP contingency fund, that were passed just a       few months ago were fully paid for. In fact, according to       CBO, the CHIP reauthorization saved billions of dollars.       Therefore, CHIP should not be the target of a rescission       package, and yet, it shockingly accounts for 46 percent or       almost half of all the proposed reductions in H.R. 3.        For these reasons, we stand with more than 500 other       national, state, and local organizations from across the       country that wrote a letter to Congress in opposition to the       CHIP cuts proposed in H.R. 3. As the letter reads, ``The nine       million children and families who depend on CHIP have already       faced months of uncertainty, when its funding expired before       Congress took long-overdue action to extend CHIP funding for       ten years. After breathing a short sigh of relief, however,       the long-term stability and protection these families fought       to ensure is once again in jeopardy. Our organizations urge       you to protect children and families, and to reject any       proposed cuts to the Children's Health Insurance Program.''            Sincerely,                                                      Bruce Lesley,      President.                                   ____           Oppose Attempt to Raid the Farm Bill Through Rescissions         Dear Christian: With the introduction of rescission       legislation in both the House and Senate, the National       Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC) urges your office to       oppose any effort to bring rescission legislation to a vote,       and to vote no if such a vote occurs.        If the rescission package were to become law it would       devastate farm bill conservation and rural development       programs. The package, as proposed, would eliminate       previously appropriated funding for the Value Added Producer       Grant (VAPG) program and cut over $650 million from farm bill       conservation programs.        The rescissions proposal would strip funding from three       different conservation assistance areas: the Environmental       Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Wetlands Reserve Program       (WRP), and emergency watershed and flood protection programs,       preventing USDA from entering into contracts to support       farmer conservation efforts. Cuts to these programs would       mean fewer voluntary conservation opportunities for farmers       and ranchers who are seeking to improve their operations and       be stewards of the land. Farm, conservation, and wildlife       organizations across the country voiced strong opposition to       the proposed conservation cuts.        The proposal to eliminate $15 million from the VAPG program       would mean that USDA is able to fund just a fraction of the       379 currently pending applications for business planning and       development grants. A recent Economic Research Service report       found that VAPG is facilitating job creation and long-term       business survivability in rural America. Cuts to the program       would mean less economic growth and fewer enterprise       development opportunities for farmers and ranchers around the       country.        For more information on how farmers and rural communities       would be impacted by this rescission package, please see our       recent blog on the topic.            Sincerely,                                                     Greg Fogel,                                                    Policy Director,                        National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition.

Hon. Richard Shelby,      Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Rodney Frelinghuysen,      Chairman, House Appropriations Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Shelby and Frelinghuysen: On behalf of the       110 national education organizations and institutions that       are members of the Committee for Education Funding (CEF), we       write to urge you to reject the Administration's proposal to       rescind $15.4 billion that Congress has already approved. The       rescission package will cut $7 billion that would otherwise       be available for education programs and other services funded       through the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill for       fiscal year 2019. The rescission package also rescinds       funding for educational awards for AmeriCorps volunteers who       have completed their terms of service. CEF is also very       concerned that the Administration has announced its intention       to submit additional proposals to rescind funding Congress       just enacted for fiscal year 2018, undermining bipartisan       support to make and keep its agreement to raise the level of       non-defense discretionary funding.   Congress and the Administration approved increases in the spending  caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 with the understanding of the needs  facing the nation and with the intention to use the available resources  to meet them. Congress regularly rescinds funding that is not  ultimately needed for the programs it has enacted, and then reinvests  the savings in other programs serving similar needs in the same funding  bill. Enacting large rescissions outside of the regular appropriations  process--one that is well underway already for fiscal year 2019--not  only reduces the resources available to appropriators but also reduces  flexibility to reprogram funding as needed.   CEF, the nation's oldest and largest education coalition, is a non- partisan organization reflecting the entire continuum of the education  community. Our long-term ``5 cents Makes Sense'' campaign supports the  goal of increasing education investments from the current two percent  of the federal budget to five cents on the federal dollar. CEF urges  Congress to reject proposals to rescind funding provided through  bipartisan negotiations, and to instead continue efforts to wisely  invest resources where they are most needed, including for education  programs, which are still below the fiscal year 2011 level when  adjusted for inflation.            Sincerely,      Jeff Carter,        President.      Sheryl Cohen,        Executive Director.                                   ____                                      National Housing Conference,                                       Washington, DC, May 21, 2018.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The National Housing       Conference and the undersigned organizations write to you to       express our strong opposition to the rescission proposal from       the White House and Office of Management and Budget (OMB).       The package requests over $234 million in rescissions from       housing and community development programs including the U.S.       Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Public       Housing Capital Fund, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's       (Treasury) Capital Magnet Fund and the U.S. Department of       Agriculture's (USDA) Rental Assistance program and Rural       Community Facilities program.        According to a recent HUD study, the public housing capital       backlog reached $26 billion in 2010 and has grown by       approximately $3.4 billion per year. Assuming a continued       growth of $3.4 billion per year, the current estimated       capital backlog is over $50 billion. Public housing capital       funds are awarded slowly as contracts are negotiated and work       is completed. Public housing agencies are able to save their       capital funds over three years in order to pay for more       expensive projects like new roofs that they would otherwise       not be able to afford from a single year's allocation. The       rescission would also impact funding for Resident       Opportunities and Self-Sufficiency grants and the Jobs-Plus       grants, including a complete elimination of all Jobs-Plus       grants for FY 2017. These are critical grant programs that       allow residents of public housing to work toward increased       self-sufficiency, something in which the administration has       expressed great interest. Rescinding over $31 million from a       program with such dire needs jeopardizes the initial       investment made by taxpayers to build public housing as well       as the residents who live in public housing. Ultimately, it       is ``penny-wise, pound-foolish.''        Treasury's Capital Magnet Fund has a proven track record of       success. The 2010 awardees of the Capital Magnet Fund       leveraged over $20 for every $1 of public funding to create       more than 13,300 affordable homes, far beyond the required       10.1 leverage ratio. The Capital Magnet Fund is funded       through a fee assessed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac       business, not taxpayer dollars. The $151 million proposed for       rescission was only made available to the Treasury on May 1,       2018, and will most likely be spent before the end of the       calendar year, providing it is not rescinded. The Capital       Magnet Fund has created thousands of jobs and provides much-      needed affordable housing throughout the country.        USDA's Rental Assistance and Rural Community Facilities       programs provide access to housing and essential community       facilities such as police stations and medical clinics.       Combined, the administration proposes rescinding $31 million       from these accounts. Through a public-private partnership       with landlords, USDA's rental assistance funding ensures that       low-income renters in rural America have access to an       affordable home. The FY 2017 spending bill specifically       appropriated $40 million to be spent in FY 2018. The       patchwork of continuing resolutions that Congress has passed       to fund the federal government has made it difficult for USDA       to renew contracts with private landlords in the rental       assistance program. In response, Congress has decided to       future fund the account to help alleviate the contract       renewal process. OMB cites the fact that as of the beginning       of FY 2018 on October 1, 2017, there was $40 million left in       the account. It is premature, at best to determine as of       October 1, 2017, that those funds have gone unspent and are       therefore unneeded.        The proposed rescissions will do little to reduce the       national debt while doing significant damage to people and       communities throughout America. We ask that you reject the       proposed rescissions from these programs and to do so in a       timely manner so that the agencies can continue to manage       their budgets responsibly. If Congress does not vote to       reject the rescissions, these accounts will be frozen for 45       legislative days, which will create damaging disruptions well       into the fall.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of       the Service Employees International Union (``SEIU''), I write       to oppose H.R. 3, the legislation that would violate the bi-      partisan funding agreement and compromise reached as part of       the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In what appears to be a       continuing escalation of a war on families and children by       the Administration and Congressional Republicans, H.R. 3 will       result in cuts in investments in health, housing, job, and       other supportive services that are vital to our communities       around the country. Perhaps most disturbing is that this       package raids funding that could be used to provide health       and other essentials for working families and children in the       name of so-called ``fiscal responsibility,'' even though       those supporting these cuts passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut       that mostly benefits corporations and the wealthy.        A significant portion of the cuts included in H.R. 3 are       from the Children's Health Insurance Program (``CHIP''),       which helps kids get the healthcare they need. Some of these       funds make sure that states have enough resources to provide       care in case of emergencies that may create increased CHIP       enrollment; for example, natural disasters--like hurricanes,       wildfires, and volcanic eruptions--economic downturns, public       health epidemics or other unexpected events. In addition, the       funding in question also supports investments in other       services and programs that are vital to our local       communities' economies and social infrastructure.       Furthermore, H.R. 3 eliminates $800 million from the Centers       for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (``CMMI''), which is       tasked with developing models that improve the quality of       care for Americans, undermining efforts to improve systematic       efficiencies without harming patients.        Unfortunately, it is not surprising that a Congress and       Administration so intent on sabotaging US healthcare is now       trying to use money designated for health and other supports       for our communities to offset the windfall for corporations       included in the tax bill. In addition, this bill breaks the       agreement reached in the Bi-partisan Budget Act. If those in       Congress cannot trust the promises and agreements they make       to each other and break the commitments that they make to       Americans, it is no wonder that the public has such low       confidence in the institution. Americans have been demanding       that Congress work together across party lines, and after       passing a landmark budget agreement with both Republican and       Democratic support, some have retreated to partisan-driven       policy making. H.R. 3 demonstrates that the Administration       and congressional leadership are unable to negotiate in good       faith, putting at risk future deal making and potentially       bringing our legislative system to a standstill at the       expense of our futures.        For these reasons, we urge you to oppose H.R. 3. We may add       votes on this legislation to our legislative scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                         John Gray,      Legislative Director.                                   ____                                                       June 6, 2018.        Dear Representative DeLauro: We, the undersigned 18       organizations, representing various religious denominations,       urge you to vote NO on H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired       and Unnecessary Programs Act. As currently written, this       measure contains a harmful provision that would rescind $7       billion in funding for the Children's Health Insurance       Program (``CHIP''). As people of faith we believe that       healthcare is a human right and that care for children is a       sacred responsibility. If enacted, this rescission to CHIP       would threaten the health and well-being of the 9 million       children who utilize the program every year.        We are especially concerned with the $2 billion in cut, to       the CHIP contingency fund. This fund has consistently been       used in times of economic downturn, natural disaster, and       other uncertain times to ensure that children can have access       to healthcare. More recently, the fund was used when Congress       was unable to pass a CHIP funding bill before individual       state funding for the program ran out. If this fund was not       available during the reauthorization process last year,       thousands of children would have lost healthcare while       Congress failed to act. Congress should not take away this       vital security measure for the health of our children.        Recent Congressional action to pass a 10-year extension of       CHIP was a major success for the 115th Congress, but this       risky rescission could undercut the program and undermine       this success. CHIP, as it is currently funded, is projected       to decrease the deficit by $6 billion over 10 years. The       health of our children is too important to be used as       additional means to pay down the deficit. It is especially       relevant to protect our children from additional cuts after       the passage of the tax bill provided enormous benefits to the       wealthy and large corporations while adding over $1.7       trillion to the deficit. Children must not pay for the       enrichment of the wealthiest in our nation.        CHIP has enjoyed bipartisan support and success for more       than 20 years. It has proven to be an effective investment in       the health of our children and should be protected and       supported. Our faith traditions teach us to protect the most       vulnerable people, especially children. We believe that a       rescissions package that threatens to take healthcare away       from children does not live up to our moral obligation. We       urge you reject and refuse a vote on H.R. 3, until and unless       these harmful CHIP cuts are removed.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the Committee on Education  and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the ranking member of the Committee on Ways  and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans want to talk about spending. Let's talk  about the Republican tax cut. It was rigged for the rich. It gave 83  percent of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent. They raised taxes  on 86 million middle class families. It cost $1.5 trillion.   We have a staggering national debt. They want to reduce that deficit.  Well, then why don't they go ahead and rescind the money from the tax  giveaways to the corporations? The corporations are just using it to  buy back stocks and not to raise any wages.   What we ought to be doing is reinvesting: create jobs; help children  and families, not millionaires and billionaires.   If they wanted to do something about the CHIP program, they would  have made it permanent or they would take that money and reinvest it in  programs that have to do with children, not send it back to the  treasury. What they ought to do is to find those resources from their  rich donors and others and put them back into where they belong, to the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letters in opposition to H.R. 3:                                                       May 22, 2018.        Dear Representative: The undersigned 151 national       organizations strongly urge you to reject the $15.3 billion       rescissions package proposed by the Trump Administration as       well as other rescissions messages that may be subsequently       offered. These cuts would violate the agreement enacted in       the Bipartisan Budget Act, by eliminating funds that make       fairer levels of domestic appropriations possible, so that       unmet needs in public health, education, job training,       housing, and other essential areas may be addressed.        The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is targeted       for nearly half the cuts in the rescissions package. Nearly       $2 billion of the rescinded funds could reduce CHIP's       capacity to respond if enrollment unexpectedly rises, as in       the aftermath of a disaster, large layoffs due to plant       closures, or an overall economic slowdown. Congress just       enacted a long-overdue 10-year reauthorization of CHIP; it       should not undermine that bipartisan agreement either by       tampering with CHIP in this package. Another $5 billion would       renege on the two-year Bipartisan Budget Act agreement, which       in part counted on the availability of unspent CHIP funds to       pay for needed increases in other services of importance to       children and families.        The rescissions package also includes an $800 million cut       to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, a program       which according to the Congressional Budget Office will save       $3 for every $1 spent between 2017 and 2026. It makes no       sense to end such a cost-effective investment. Nor does it       make sense to describe this package of cuts as putting ``. .       . our Nation on a sustainable fiscal path'' when the recently       enacted tax cuts, mainly for the wealthy and corporations,       impose a $2 trillion cost.        Congress made important progress in the FY 2018 Omnibus       appropriations bill because its bipartisan agreement allowed       for increases in child care, opioid treatment, and other       services. Congress should now turn its attention to building       on this progress in FY 2019. Reneging on the hard-won       bipartisan agreement now will make further gains extremely       difficult. With the limited number of legislative days before       you, please do not be distracted by undoing past progress.        We cannot emphasize enough that basic needs programs have       lost ground after years of reductions, making it extremely       important that you do not undermine the agreement to start to       reverse these downward trends. Adult and youth job training       has been cut nearly 15 percent since FY 2010, adjusted for       inflation. If we are serious about helping people to get good       jobs, we must undo these cuts. Many other services need       rebuilding, such as home heating and cooling assistance (cut       nearly 38 percent since FY 2010), juvenile justice programs       (cut more than 40 percent), maternal and child health  [[Page H4883]]       programs (cut 14 percent), and special education funding (cut       between 7-11 percent since FY 2010). In an analysis of more       than 180 human needs programs, the Coalition on Human Needs       found that nearly 70 percent are still at lower levels than       in FY 2010.        Please reject this rescissions package, and turn instead to       your real responsibility: to provide adequate resource to       address the unmet needs for education and training, child       care, housing, health care, and other essential services.

Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Speaker Ryan, & Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the 68       undersigned organizations, we are writing to express our       opposition to the Administration's proposal in its fiscal       year (FY) 2018 rescission package to recapture $151 million       in funding for the Capital Magnet Fund (CMF).        We respectfully request that Congress promptly reject this       rescission to enable the Community Develpment Financial       Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) at the Department of Treasury       to distribute the next round of funding of this highly       successful program as soon as possible. Organizations are       deploying these funds to address the housing affordability       crisis among our nation's seniors, veterans, persons with       disabilities, and families.        The origin and intent of the rescission mechanism in the       Congressional Budget Impoundment and Control Act is well-      established. Namely, it was designed and has uniformly been       used to return unspent funds in appropriated accounts from       prior fiscal years to taxpayers, typically for programs that       are poorly performing or have been eliminated entirely. The       Administration's effort to claw back CMF funding by means of       rescission flies in the face of this practice.        First, CMF is not an appropriated program. Rather, it was       created by Congress through the bipartisan Housing and       Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008, an early federal       response to the nation's growing housing and financial       crisis. HERA funded the CMF through a small fee on total new       business purchases of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac       (collectively, the Government-Sponsored Enterprises or GSEs)       to create an enduring program to generate new investment in       affordable housing and other economic development projects in       underserved communities across our nation through the housing       finance system and not be reliant entirely on the annual       Congressional appropriations process.        Second, CMF funds have not been sitting unspent at the CDFI       Fund. Rather, these funds were not released to the Treasury       Department by the GSEs until May 1, 2018, and if prior year       CMF rounds are predictive, the entire amount of funds will be       obligated to awardees before the end of calendar year 2018.        Finally, one would be hard pressed to find a program where       taxpayers are getting more ``bang for the buck'' than the       CMF. The innovation at the heart of CMF is that it provides       direct, entity-level investments in high capacity CDFIs,       nonprofit housing developers, banks and public sector       agencies.        This structure is designed to attract private capital and       maximize return on investment. Organizations that receive the       grants are required to leverage their funding 10:1 with other       sources of capital. The CMF multiplies the impact of awards       many times over because grant recipients are also required to       redeploy CMF-supported loans in new projects throughout the       grant term.        By any measure, CMF has succeeded. Earlier this year, the       CDFI Fund released new data that illustrates the powerful       impact of the FY 2010 funding round of CMF. The 23 awardees       from 2010 have used the $80 million in grants to attract $1.8       billion in other investment by the public and private sector,       a 22:1 ratio; have produced 13,325 affordable homes and have       created or retained 16,000 jobs across America.        The CMF is poised to continue its strong track record. The       2017 award round of $120 million will enable 40 grantees to       serve 41 states and the District of Columbia. Collectively,       awardees are projected to create approximately 17,000       additional jobs, produce 21,000 affordable homes and attract       more than $3.2 billion in additional investment, with 78%       ($2.5 billion) expected to come from the private sector.        The need for affordable housing--and for CMF funding--is       greater today than ever before. Although the economy has       improved since 2008, the number of renter households that pay       more than half of their income in rent is near an all-time       high of 11.4 million families, 3.7 million more than in 2001       and one in four of all renters in the United States.        The CMF has proven to be a highly cost-effective resource       for creating affordable housing and improving communities. In       2017, the CDFI Fund received applications for more than 3.5       times the amount awarded. The nation would be better served       if the Administration deployed the $151 million in available       CMF funds as quickly as possible to meet the demand for this       flexible, effective program rather than targeting it for       rescission.        We urge Congress to reject this rescission request.
