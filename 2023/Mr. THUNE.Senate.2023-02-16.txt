 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it was good to hear President Biden  acknowledge in his State of the Union speech last week that we still  need oil. He is right.   And while I am a big supporter of clean energy, and I am proud to  come from a State that gets the majority of our electricity generation  from renewables, the fact of the matter is that even in States like  mine, conventional energy sources like oil and natural gas are  essential to maintaining an affordable, stable, and reliable energy  supply.   Renewable technologies have come a long way, but they still have a  ways to go. And we, literally, wouldn't be able to keep the lights on  in this country without conventional energy sources like natural gas  and coal.   So it was good to hear the President acknowledge that we still depend  on affordable and reliable legacy sources of energy like oil. But it  would be even better if he pursued an agenda that acknowledged it,  instead of an agenda that is actively hostile to conventional energy  production.   From canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline on day 1 to hiking taxes on  oil and gas companies and making it more challenging for companies to  make more oil and gas, the President's agenda seems designed to do  everything it can to discourage production of the oil the President  says that we need.   And then there is ESG. The Biden administration has been attempting  to use the long arm of regulation to implement ESG policies-- environmental, social, and governance policies--to advance its anti- conventional energy climate agenda. The President's ESG regulations are  designed to choke off investment into the oil and gas industries and  even to other essential industries like farming and ranching due to  their natural methane emissions.   Take, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission's proposed  climate disclosure rule. This would require publicly traded companies  to disclose information, not only about their own greenhouse gas  emissions but, in many cases, about those of their suppliers and even  their customers. It would also require companies to determine the  effects of climate-related risks on each line item of their  consolidated financial statements.   There are multiple problems with this rule, one notable problem being  the fact that it is a totally unworkable regulation. Companies have  zero control over the emissions of their suppliers and customers and  little to no ability to accurately gauge those emissions.   But leaving aside the unworkability factor, the major problem with  this proposed rule is that it is clearly designed to coerce companies  to sever or reconsider their ties with certain industries, notably, of  course, the conventional energy industry but also with other industries  like agriculture.   Private companies, of course, have the right to consider whatever  factors they want when determining what companies they would do  business with and what they will invest in. But the Federal Government  should not be putting its thumb on the scale. And the SEC rule is just  one of the regulations the Biden administration has put forward  designed to encourage investment in industries that aren't part of  Democrat's Green New Deal vision.   There is the Biden administration's proposed Federal contractor rule,  which, like the SEC rule, would require companies applying for certain  Federal contracts to disclose not only their own direct and indirect  emissions but also, in some cases, related emissions over which the  contractor has no control.   The Federal Reserve--they are getting in on the act, too--has stepped  outside its statutory role and established a pilot program to analyze  climate-related financial risks for the Nation's largest banks. The  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation, and the Fed have all put forward principles for  large banks on ``climate-related financial risk management.'' And the  list goes on.   Then there is the Department of Labor. In November, the Department of  Labor issued a new rule that would allow pension plan fiduciaries-- these are individuals who manage Americans' retirement accounts--to  consider ESG; in other words, environmental, social, governance factors  and not just the rate of return when investing their customers' money.   In other words, the individuals--think about this--the individuals  who manage $11.7 trillion of Americans' retirement will no longer be  required to make investment decisions based solely on maximizing  return. Instead, they will now be allowed to opt for a less valuable  investment if they prefer its environmental profile.   I want you to just let that sink in for a minute. The Biden  administration has essentially announced that its top goal is not  giving Americans a secure retirement; it is giving them a retirement  that supports the Biden administration's environmental agenda. The  Biden administration is apparently happy to let your retirement money  suffer as long as the investments are advancing its Green New Deal  goals.   The very idea that the government is encouraging fiduciaries to  consider anything but maximizing a return on Americans' retirement  investments is outrageous.   I am very pleased to join all of my Republican colleagues on Senator  Braun's resolution to overturn this rule.   I also reintroduced legislation earlier this week that would require  Federal financial regulators, like the Securities and Exchange  Commission, to estimate the impact their rules would have on gas, food,  and energy prices, and prevent them from imposing any rule that would  drive up these prices when the economy is struggling with high  inflation, which gets to the heart of the matter here, and that is the  impact the President's ESG rules are going to have on hard-working  Americans.   Leaving aside the question of whether or not the government has any  business using financial regulation to advance its environmental  agenda, the fact of the matter is that choking off investment to the  oil and gas industries could seriously impair our oil and gas supply.  And that would mean two things: higher prices for Americans and a less  reliable supply of energy. And that is a big problem.   Americans have had a tough 2 years in the Biden economy. The last  thing they need is higher energy bills for the long term, and the last  thing our country needs is a less reliable energy supply that forces us  to rely on foreign energy sources or forces Americans to deal with  regular blackouts and other supply problems.   President Biden talks about building an economy that works for  working families. Unfortunately, so far, his policies have pretty much  succeeded in doing just the opposite. And if the President continues to  pursue his radical ESG agenda, working families, once again, will be  the ones who pay the price.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Congress finds the following:        (1) The Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students       Act of 2003 (20 U.S.C. 1098aa et seq.) was intended to       provide relief opportunities for members of the armed       services.        (2) The authority provided under the Higher Education       Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 has been abused       by the Executive Branch during the COVID-19 national       emergency regarding the payment of Federal student loans.        (3) The unilateral payment pause on Federal student loans       has cost more than $160,000,000,000.        (4) The unilateral payment pause on Federal student loans       has inflationary impacts.        (5) The individuals benefitting the most from the payment       pause continued by the Executive Branch are doctors, who       receive 11 times the benefit of bachelor's degree recipients       and 16 times the benefit of associate's degree recipients.
