 Madam President, back in February 2020, before the COVID  recession, there were 158.8 million Americans employed. We have gone  through a lot. COVID is probably the most significant event--certainly  in my lifetime--affecting people's lives, the tragedies we have seen,  affecting our economy, affecting the Federal budget.   At the end of June, there were 142 million Americans employed. That  is a reduction of 16.6 million Americans or 10.5 percent. I want people  to remember that 10.5 percent.   Over the last month or so, there have been a number of respected  economists who made forecasts of how much our economy is going to  shrink. These are folks from the IMF and CBO and the Federal Reserve  Board of Governors, economists at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The  range of what they are predicting our economy will shrink to is  somewhere between 4.6 percent and 8 percent. This is causing economic  devastation--a real human toll on real people.   As a result of that, Congress acted. We acted fast. We acted swiftly.  We acted massively. We wanted to provide financial help to individuals  who were unemployed all of a sudden through no fault of their own. We  wanted to help provide financial need to businesses that were viable,  that can hopefully survive and rehire and help us recover from this  COVID recession. We also wanted to make sure we provided enough  liquidity in the market so we wouldn't see any kind of seizing up and  see real financial devastation.   The result of all that was that within a very short period of time,  by the end of April, we had already passed four different financial  relief packages totaling $2.9 trillion. We just held an oversight  hearing in my committee 2 days ago. There is even dispute on that  number. Some witnesses said it is close to $3.6 trillion. I am going to  use $2.9 trillion as a minimum.   To relate that to what I just talked about, that represents about  13.5 percent of our economy. Again, employment is down 10.5 percent.  Economists are predicting our economy will shrink somewhere between 4.6  percent and 8 percent. But we acted swiftly and massively. We knew what  we were going to enact was far from perfect. We all understood that. It  was far from perfect, but it worked, and we had to do it.   We passed an amount equal to 13.5 percent of last year's GDP. Less  than a month later, Speaker Pelosi and her House Democrats passed a  fifth package out of the House worth $3 trillion--$3 trillion. I am  sorry. That is not a serious attempt at financial relief. If we add  that to the $2.9 trillion, that would represent 27.5 percent of last  year's economy.   Again, employment is down 10.5 percent. Our economy will probably  shrink by no more than 8 percent. Yet Speaker Pelosi and House  Democrats wanted to increase the amount of debt burden on our children  by passing a package that would bring the total relief package up to  27.5 percent of our GDP. It is not serious.   It should surprise no one when Leader McConnell and Chief of Staff  Meadows and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, as they tried to forge a deal  with Speaker of the House Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer, that they  couldn't reach a deal; that there was probably no goalpost that they  will not move to make sure that doesn't happen.   But the problem with that approach--and I would call it a very  cynical, political approach, really playing with people's lives and  livelihood--is that tomorrow the Federal unemployment extension that we  passed as part of the CARES Act--because we realized we wanted to try  to help everybody who was unemployed because of the COVID recession-- expires.   As I said, the CARES Act was far from perfect. I certainly did not  want one of the provisions. I voted against it. I actually supported  the amendment of the Senator from Florida to reduce the $600 flat  payment. That is a real problem because it represents something like  134 percent of average wages, and we are creating a very perverse  incentive for people to remain unemployed when our economy is calling  for more workers.   I want to quote an economic adviser to both Presidents Clinton and  President Obama, Larry Summers. He once stated:         The second way government assistance programs contribute to       long-term unemployment is by providing an incentive, and the       means, not to work. Each unemployed person has a       ``reservation wage''--the minimum wage he or she insists on       getting before accepting a job. Unemployment insurance and       other social assistance programs increase the reservation       wage, causing an unemployed person to remain unemployed       longer.    We want to avoid that situation. We want to help workers, but we want  to avoid the situation where we prolong unemployment or create a sense  for people to stay on unemployment insurance. The fact is that,  according to a University of Chicago study, 68 percent of people  collecting unemployment are making more on unemployment than they made  when they were working. CBO estimates something between five out of six  people currently collecting unemployment are making more not working  than working. The Bureau of Labor statistics at the end of May said  there were 5.4 million jobs open--not being filled.   We have a problem. We have two problems. We can't do a deal because I  don't believe our friends on the other side of the aisle are serious  about doing a deal. But we have unemployment expiring, and the current  provision was too generous to create a perverse incentive.   I have introduced a piece of legislation that I have cosponsored with  the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Florida, who would also  like to speak to this. It is called the Coronavirus Relief Fair  Unemployment Compensation Act. There is no fancy acronym. It describes  what the bill does. It extends Federal plus-up for unemployment to the  end of the year.   The COVID recession is not ending any time soon. Rather than having  to come back and do this over and over again and increase the anxiety  on Americans who are unemployed, let's extend this to the end of  December. Our bill gives States the option of either a $200 flat plus- up or a plus-up equal to no more than two-thirds of an individual's  average wage, not to exceed $500. The States have the option. If they  can't handle the two-thirds plus-up, they can accept the $200 flat  plus-up.   In case our Democratic colleagues are going to complain about that as  not being generous enough, two-thirds of weekly wages is exactly what  the House passed in phase 2 of the COVID relief package. Two-thirds of  average wages is what they set as the amount of money for paid sick and  family leave.   I also want to point out that $200 a week is eight times the amount  the Democrats, back in 2008 and 2009--I think 2009--passed as part of  the great recession relief package. They passed $25 per week plus-up,  so $200 per week plus-up is eight times that.   Again, we, as Republicans, are trying to meet them already more than  halfway to do a deal on unemployment. Again, those individuals who are  without a job through no fault of their own have the comfort and relief  that they will have assistance from the Federal Government.  [[Page S4608]]    I yield the floor.    Madam President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for  acting quickly in cosponsoring this piece of legislation.   I now yield to the Senator from Florida.    I thank the Senator from Florida for his words of  support.   Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of my  bill at the desk. I further ask that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, a quick response. The Democratic leader  states this is not adequate. Again, I would remind the Senate that in  2009, when they passed a Federal plus-up for unemployment benefits-- total Democratic control--they passed $25 a week. So the $200 a week is  eight times what they passed in 2009. Apparently, they felt that was  adequate back then.   There was also a study out of the University of Chicago that a $200  plus-up on State unemployment benefits coming from the Federal  Government replaces more than 100 percent of wages for 20 percent of  the workers currently unemployed. The other 80 percent get replacement  that ranges up to 100 percent.   Again, this is a very generous proposal. And, of course, the option  of two-thirds is exactly what the House passed in phase 2 of the  coronavirus relief packages--two-thirds of weekly wages for paid sick  and paid family leave. Now, all of a sudden, it is inadequate. And of  course their solution--what they are going to offer--is another $3  trillion, further mortgaging our children's future when we haven't  spent about $1.2 trillion of the $2.9 trillion we have already  authorized.   It is not a serious proposal, which is why Leader McConnell could not  negotiate, because they weren't negotiating in good faith. The  Democrats are being cynical. This is not a serious offer.   This is a very serious and, quite honestly, more than generous offer  to help Americans and alleviate the anxiety they are going to be  feeling if the Democrats just simply decide to reject this. It is very  unfortunate, but that is the state of play in the Senate. It is very  sad.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would  like to first respond to the Senator from Oregon about the economic  news: yes, on an annualized rate from the downturn in the second  quarter, 9.5 percent. But again, I pointed out, respectfully, that  economists are predicting a shrinkage of GDP 4.6 and 8 percent because  we are in recovery.   The employment has dropped by 10.5 percent. We have already passed  $2.9 trillion. We haven't spent $1.2 trillion of that at least. So we  haven't spent $1.2 trillion. Yet our Democratic colleagues want to pass  a bill that costs $3 trillion.   We are already $26.5 trillion in debt by the end of this fiscal year.  That would be approaching $28 trillion. They want to pass a bill by  unanimous consent for $3 trillion when we haven't spent $1.2 trillion  of the $2.9 trillion we have already passed. That massive amount would  represent 27.5 percent of our economy, when economists are saying it  will shrink by probably no more than 7 percent or 8 percent.   We don't need to authorize more money. What we need to do is help the  American people who are unemployed. I know the minority leader called  that stingy. The offer we are making--the $200 flat payment--does not  provide an incentive to stay unemployed. It replaces more than 100  percent of people's wages for 20 percent of the people currently  unemployed--a 100-percent wage replacement for 20 percent. That is  according to a study by the University of Chicago.   For the other 80 percent, it replaces up to 100 percent. What is  stingy about that? Why do our Democratic colleagues want to propose  continuing the $600 per-week plus-up that is preventing people-- incentivizing people not to reengage in the economy so that our economy  can recover. It makes no sense.   Again, I will point out that the two-thirds option is the exact same  amount that the House passed--the Democratic-controlled House passed in  phase 2 of the COVID-19 relief packages for paid sick and family leave.  So, again, we tried to tailor this to protect those American workers.  We tried to tailor this based on what Democrats themselves have  proposed and passed. Yet they would rather play politics. They would  rather be cynical and object to my unanimous consent request because  time is running out--I acknowledge that.   So we are responding, but as in so many other debates--whether it is  gun control or immigration--it is their way or the highway. They simply  will not take yes for an answer. It is very unfortunate they are taking  this position that they want to indebt our children for another $3  trillion, and they will not say yes to a very reasonable proposal  structured on things they proposed and passed in the past.   Madam President, It is very unfortunate, but I have to object to $3  trillion of additional debt on our children.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me  first state and make perfectly clear that I think the emancipation of  slaves is a day worth celebrating. I have no argument whatsoever with  the fact that we should probably celebrate it better than we have in  the past. But there are other ways of celebrating it--a resolution in  the Senate creating a national day of celebration without declaring it  a national holiday.   The effect of declaring it a national holiday is primarily one thing:  It gives Federal workers a paid day off. Now, Federal workers are  compensated quite well, and I want to quickly go through this again, as  we did last week. I have some charts up here.   If you take a look at just their wage, Federal workers, on average,  make about a little over $94,000 per year. In the private sector, the  average wage is $63,000, which is 67 percent of what Federal workers  make. If you also include benefits--total compensation--Federal workers  make, on average, about $135,000, almost $136,000 per year. In the  private sector, it is about $75,000, which is 55 percent of what  Federal workers make.   So if you strip out only the benefits, which is what we are talking  about with holiday pay and paid family leave and other things, Federal  workers, on average, get compensated about $41,000 annually, versus the  private sector's $12,000, which is only 29 percent of what Federal  workers make.   What we are talking about is a paid day off. Now, take a look at what  Federal workers get in terms of the number of days off with pay. It is  quite generous, particularly after last year's National Defense  Authorization Act, in which we added paid parental leave.   I have two charts here. Here is one: If a Federal worker gets paid  parental leave--and I realize that only happens a few times during  somebody's lifetime--but Federal workers get 10 paid holidays. That is  probably the max anybody gets in the private sector. In terms of paid  leave, minimum, they get 13 days off; maximum, they get 26; and by the  way, 26 is more than 5 weeks off with pay--basically paid vacation.  They get 4 weeks after only 3 years. That is virtually unheard of in  the private sector--very generous paid vacation in the Federal  workforce. Then, with paid parental leave, they get 60 days off  maximum.   So, a Federal worker taking advantage of paid parental leave will get  96 to 109 days off or, put a different way, for every 1.4 days a  Federal worker works, they get a day off.   Now, let's strip out paid parental leave. Let's look at people who  aren't having a child or adopting a child--again, same basic numbers:  10 paid holidays, 13 to 26 paid leave days, 13 sick days, for a total  of anywhere from 36 to 49 days of leave that is paid. For a more senior  worker, for every 4.3 days they work, they get a day off, which is  basically a 4-day workweek. By the way, if they don't take the paid  leave days, they can carry them over.   So, again, the private sector benefits aren't even close to this  generous. I am not objecting to celebrating Juneteenth. What I am  objecting to is the rest of America paying for another paid day off for  Federal workers. By the way, it costs about $600 million per year. The  CBO score is over 10 years; that is $6 billion. The sponsors of this  bill want to just go ahead and incur that additional cost on the  American economy and American taxpayers without a vote. They can't do  it just by unanimous consent, which is really what I am objecting to in  this process here.   So, again, I have a different proposal. We could either declare it a  national day of celebration. That would be fine. Or we can go ahead and  declare it and make it a national holiday, but if we are going to do  that, let's just take one of their paid days away. They come out whole.   Last week, I was accused of taking something away from Federal  workers. Not really--I am still leaving them  [[Page S4614]]  with the same 36 to 49 or 96 to 109 days off. I am just saying that it  strikes me as kind of strange that the only way we can properly  celebrate Juneteenth is by giving Federal workers a paid day off, paid  by every other American taxpayer, to the tune of $600 million a year.   So, again, what I would recommend is that modification: Declare  Juneteenth a national paid holiday but remove one of their paid sick  leaves. So I ask the Senator to modify his request to include my  amendment at the desk; that the amendment be considered and agreed to;  that the bill, as amended, be considered and read a third time and  passed; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    I object.
