 This is unacceptable. The Inflation  Reduction Act will allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices  with pharmaceutical companies. The cost to seniors per year will not  exceed $2,000. It also caps insulin for them at $35 per month. This is  a game changer for working class people, not only in my community but  across America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support this bill and to be proud to  help American families move forward.
