 Mr. President, the Senate is going to vote shortly on  legislation called the FAA bill. It addresses the concerns of air  travelers across the country. The bill before us has some key safety  and security aviation measures.   We have worked across the aisle to bring to Congress a 5-year  authorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. This is the first  5-year bill of the FAA that has passed and will pass this Congress  since the 1980s.   Why is that important? There needs to be stability for planning  purposes for the aviation industry. Fortunately, this bill is a new  mark of bipartisanship that would allow us to get an extensive bill  charting the authorization for aviation for the next 5 years. Remember,  there was a time during one year in which we had multiple extensions.  That has caused an inability to bring bipartisan agreement to the FAA's  governing of aviation.   Well, we have that agreement, and it is going to be a 5-year bill. I  have already commended Chairman John Thune in another hearing this  morning on another topic in the Commerce, Science, and Transportation  Committee. It is that bipartisanship that brings us to this point.   Along with the FAA bill, the bill will also provide long-term  stability and continued focus on security and safety at the  Transportation Safety Administration, the TSA, and the NTSB, the  National Transportation Safety Board, which is charged with determining  the cause of aviation and other transportation accidents.   This bill greatly benefits the flying public. It ensures the FAA's  core mission remains safety, and it helps American aviation and  aerospace companies remain competitive and produce good-paying jobs. In  Florida alone, my  [[Page S6467]]  State, aviation and aerospace companies employ over 98,000 people. It  is ``big time'' to us in Florida.   Most important of all, we have heard weary travelers loud and clear  with their cries for help, and help is on the way. That is why this  bill contains a number of comprehensive consumer protections.   We have all experienced the indignity and the frustration of being  squeezed into smaller and smaller airline seats. Under this bill, the  FAA will be required to establish minimum dimensions for passenger  seats. For airline passengers who purchased airline services that were  never received, the legislation requires prompt refunds. Remember how  infuriating it is if your bag doesn't arrive or if it is completely  lost--the indignity that you have already paid for that bag. You are  going to get a refund.   We also addressed the needs of traveling families by requiring early  boarding during pregnancy, private space in airports for nursing  mothers, and ensuring that strollers can be checked at the gate.   By the way, do you know how cigarettes are prohibited on flights?  This prohibits e-cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, on flights.   The bill calls for the development of a bill of rights for passengers  with disabilities.   We also established an aviation consumer advocate within the  Department of Transportation. The aviation consumer advocate will now  be there to help travelers who have been mistreated by the airlines.   Those are just some of the consumer-oriented reforms. It will be  incumbent on the Trump administration to carry out these improvements.  This Senate will be enacting our constitutional responsibility of  oversight to see that the executive branch is doing just that.   Aside from the consumer wins, I would also like to mention that the  bill advances the TSA's mission of securing our transportation system  by expanding the use of bomb-sniffing dogs, speeding up the deployment  of technology, and addressing gaps in surface transportation security.   The bill also addresses another topic, disaster recovery and  response, by including protections for local governments that have  experienced a natural disaster, by limiting the number of years the  Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, can demand repayment of  disaster assistance in cases that don't involve fraud or abuse. That is  a real problem in Florida, where years later--they call it a clawback-- FEMA is trying to clawback disaster assistance funds that it had  already sent to the State or local governments and then claimed years  later: No, you shouldn't have had that. Of course, those funds have  already been spent. It is a very important issue for Florida and for so  many of our cities and counties that are put in this economic, fiscal  bind.   For the residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, there  is also an extension of disaster unemployment assistance. Believe me,  after those island territories--our fellow U.S. citizens--had been hit  by the hurricanes that roared through that part of the world last year,  there is still a lot of unemployment, and they need that unemployment  assistance as a result of the natural disaster that occurred.   In the case of Puerto Rico, not just one but two hurricanes, Irma and  Maria, hit and devastated that island. This is, certainly, going to  help those who lost their jobs or those who were unable to work due to  Hurricane Maria to get back on their feet.    As the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, I have always sought  to address the national challenges by reaching across the aisle to find  bipartisan consensus, and this bill does that. As I said in my  comments, Senator Thune has been a great partner to work with. I  appreciate the opportunity to have worked with him, along with Senators  Blunt and Cantwell, as well as with Representatives Shuster, DeFazio,  McCaul, and Thompson, on this important legislation--5 years, an FAA  bill.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the October  1, 2018, vote on motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in  the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 302, long-term FAA  reauthorization. I would have voted yea.                            ____________________
