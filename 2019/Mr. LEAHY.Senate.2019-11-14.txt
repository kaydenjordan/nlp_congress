 Mr. President, we do not have to be reminded of the more  than  [[Page S6601]]  50 million lives lost in the 1918 influenza pandemic or the many  thousands lost in the SARS, Ebola, MERS, and other recent infectious  disease outbreaks to recognize that far more must be done to reduce the  risk of catastrophic pandemics. Rather than waiting until disease  outbreaks occur, then scrambling at great expense for 2 or 3 years or  however long it takes to develop a vaccine while countless people die,  we need to act proactively. It is worth noting that tens of millions of  people have died, and we still lack a vaccine against HIV.   Viral threats will continue to emerge at a rapidly accelerating pace  in response to expanding global populations in the least developed  countries, international travel, and human encroachment into wildlife  habitat. And we know that the vast majority of emerging viruses, like  HIV, are zoonotic--infectious diseases that can spread between animals  and humans.   In an effort to strengthen global capacity for detection and  discovery of zoonotic viruses, the U.S. Agency for International  Development, USAID, initiated the PREDICT project in 2009. Its goal was  to identify new emerging viruses with pandemic potential and improve  predictive modeling to better focus surveillance, data collection, and  analytics to reduce the risk of animal viruses spilling over and  spreading in human populations. Through the collection and analysis of  wildlife samples in areas of the world most at risk for zoonotic  disease, PREDICT was able to discover disease pathogens at their  source, rather than waiting for human infection.   Over the past decade and through its work in more than 30 countries,  PREDICT has identified hundreds of viruses and has estimated that there  are more than 1.6 million unknown viral disease species in mammalian  and avian populations, of which an estimated 600,000 to 850,000 have  the potential to infect humans. PREDICT has proven the feasibility of a  global, systematic viral discovery program and paved the way for  continued progress toward a more proactive approach to reducing  pandemic risk.   As the PREDICT project comes to an end next year, USAID is exploring  ways to build on its successful analytical and modeling work and is in  the process of designing the next phase of programming to continue this  critical effort. It is my hope that others in the international  community will use the lessons learned and techniques proven from  PREDICT to inform their own efforts.   Currently, the international community often targets global health  investments on infrastructure, institutions, and human resources. While  that approach works to strengthen public health systems and to tackle  existing diseases, reducing the risk of future pandemics will require a  substantially different approach. As the PREDICT project has shown,  there are ways to use data, research, and technology to proactively  identify viral threats. Using existing health science and technology to  continue to fill the knowledge gap for unknown viruses will save  precious lives and dollars in the future.   Thanks to the work of USAID, we have a strong basis of knowledge on  which to expand this critical research. While the large pool of viral  threats lying dormant in animals has not changed, human interaction  with wildlife has. In this increasingly globalized and densely  populated world, where it is easier than ever for zoonotic diseases to  rapidly spread across regions and continents, it is essential that the  international community focus on finding innovative ways to reduce  pandemic risk.   One approach is through a global viral discovery effort, in which  countries share data on previously unknown viruses, which will  transform the fight against pandemic threats from a reactive to a  proactive undertaking. This is not a technological challenge; it is  matter of political will and resources. It will require commitments  from governments around the world to collect and share data on  previously unknown viruses. While I recognize that is easier said than  done, better equipping humanity to protect itself against catastrophic  pandemics is an investment we cannot afford not to make.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Vermont, the Green Mountain State, is  filled with outdoor enthusiasts: people who ski, snowboard, mountain  bike, hike, and do so much more. Outdoor enthusiasts who live in  Chittenden County or who have visited the area are likely to have  perused the walls, shelves, and aisles of the Skirack in Burlington,  VT. Today I want to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Skirack, a  small business that has become a staple of downtown Burlington.   Just a few blocks from its present location at the corner of Main and  Pine Streets in downtown Burlington, the Skirack first opened its doors  on November 22, 1969, driven by the vision of a group of University of  Vermont students. The founders of the Skirack--Karen George, Zandy  Wheeler, Spike Clayton, and John George-Wheeler--opened the shop with  one goal in mind: to provide the finest outdoor goods and services.  Over the next 50 years, their store has equipped Vermonters and  visitors to our State with the essentials as they face the elements and  reach new heights, both literal and figurative.   Vermont has a proud and prominent legacy of outdoor recreation.  Vermonters, or those who visit, can cross country ski, swim in Lake  Champlain, mountain bike, or go on a trek through any of Vermont's  magnificent forest trails. Contrary to the store's name, the Skirack  has been Vermonters' one-stop shop for all of their outdoor  recreational needs, regardless of the season.   Since its inception, the Skirack has been the recipient of numerous  honors and accolades. The store has been named the Snowsports Retailer  of the Year and Nordic Retailer by Ski Industries of America. But  recognition of the Skirack goes far beyond their snow sport inventory.  For 5 years in a row, from 2013 through 2017, it was named one of  America's best bike shops by the National Bicycle Dealers Association  and in 2018 was named one of the 20 Best Running Shops in America by  Gear Patrol.   The Skirack has gone through many changes throughout its 50 years of  operation. In 1974, Karen, Zandy, Spike, and John moved the Skirack  from its small shop on Center Street to where it is currently located  on Main Street in downtown Burlington. Over time, they were able to  double the size of their store by expanding to the building next door.  Then, in May 2011, they began a special partnership with Patagonia and  opened a second store, Patagonia Burlington. And today, the Skirack  employs more than 80 Vermonters.   Vermont's economy depends on small businesses like the Skirack. Over  the years, those small businesses have become the backbone of Vermont's  economy. In 2018, the more than 77,000 small businesses made up 99  percent of Vermont businesses--99 percent. In Vermont, almost 60  percent of employees, over 158,000 Vermonters, are employed by a small  business. I am proud that small businesses such as The Skirack, have  not only been able to not only survive but thrive.   With the holiday season approaching, it is important for Americans  across the country to visit their hometown Main Street stores as they  shop for friends and family. Holiday sales represent 20 percent of  average annual sales across most industries and 30 percent or more for  some businesses.   Marcelle and I congratulate Karen, Zandy, Spike, and John on an  incredible 50 years of operations at the Skirack. We wish them all the  best of luck, and we hope for 50 more strong years.                            ____________________
