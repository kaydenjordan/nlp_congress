 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6602) to reauthorize the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail  Route, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6602         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. NEW JERSEY COASTAL HERITAGE TRAIL ROUTE.         (a) Reauthorization.--Section 6 of Public Law 100-515 (16       U.S.C. 1244 note) is amended--        (1) by striking subsection (a);        (2) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections       (a) and (b), respectively;        (3) in subsection (a) (as so redesignated by paragraph       (2)), by striking ``under subsection (a)'' each place that it       appears and inserting ``to carry out this Act''; and        (4) in subsection (b) (as so redesignated by paragraph       (2)), by striking ``2011'' and inserting ``2025''.        (b) Strategic Plan.--        (1) In general.--        (A) Plan required.--Not later than 3 years after the date       on which funds are first made available after the date of       enactment of this Act to carry out Public Law 100-515 (16       U.S.C. 1244 note), the Secretary of the Interior shall       prepare a strategic plan for the New Jersey Coastal Heritage       Trail Route.        (B) Contents.--The strategic plan shall describe--        (i) opportunities to increase participation by national and       local private and public interests in the planning,       development, and administration of the New Jersey Coastal       Heritage Trail Route; and        (ii) organizational options for sustaining the New Jersey       Coastal Heritage Trail Route.        (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 703(b) of the National       Heritage Areas Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-338; 120 Stat.       1859) is repealed.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route was authorized by  Congress in 1988, and it runs along the entire eastern coast of New  Jersey.   The National Park Service, the State of New Jersey, the Pinelands  Commission, and other local organizations have partnered to promote  recreation and appreciation of New Jersey's coastal areas along that  route. The route links wildlife refuges, historic sites, and natural  areas to tell the story of New Jersey's role in shaping U.S. history  and in providing important habitat for birds and other wildlife. The  coalition's efforts to enhance public enjoyment and access bring more  visitors to these special places from New Jersey and beyond.   H.R. 6602 will reauthorize the Secretary of the Interior's authority  to co-manage the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route through 2025  and to provide technical assistance. This authority expired in 2011.   Congressman Frank LoBiondo should be commended for his support for  his constituents and for the Coastal Heritage Trail, and I am pleased  to move this legislation before his retirement from the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, Congressman LoBiondo is going to be  retiring from this House after many, many years of distinguished  service at the close of this session, and it has been my distinct honor  and pleasure to serve with him.   Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor and pleasure to yield such time  as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo).    Mr. Speaker, I join Mr. Grijalva in asking for the  support of this Chamber of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that  a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is  not present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur  in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 2606) to amend the Act of  August 4, 1947 (commonly known as the Stigler Act), with respect to  restrictions applicable to Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes of  Oklahoma, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendments is as follows:   Senate amendments:       (1)On page 3, line 12, strike [, as of said date,] and       insert: , as of the date of enactment of the Stigler Act       Amendments of 2018,      (2)At the end of the bill, add the following:       SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION PROVIDING FOR NO RETROACTIVITY.         Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act,       shall be construed to revise or extend the restricted status       of any lands under the Act of August 4, 1947 (61 Stat. 731,       chapter 458) that lost restricted status under such Act       before the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of the Senate amendments to H.R. 2606. This  bill would amend the 1947 Stigler Act to remove the Indian blood  quantum requirement for certain land to be maintained in restricted fee  status for any member of the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma.   Under H.R. 2606, restricted fee land currently owned by members of  the Five Tribes would remain in restricted status regardless of the  blood quantum of the owners.   H.R. 2606 passed the House on September 12, 2018, by voice vote. A  clarifying amendment was adopted before being passed by the Senate on  December 13, 2018.   I thank the sponsor of the legislation, the gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), for his work on this bill.   I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the gentleman  from Arizona on an inspiring and eloquent speech on a subject that has  nothing to do with the bill at hand.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the author of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt the issues raised by the  gentleman will be addressed in the future. In the meantime, this bill  addresses an important matter to the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma,  and I would ask for its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H10305]]     Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that  a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is  not present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6652) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey  certain facilities, easements, and rights-of-way to the Kennewick  Irrigation District, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6652         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 8. LIMITATIONS.         After completing the requirements of the National       Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.),       the Secretary of the Interior shall convey title, if the       Secretary affirms in writing to the House Committee on       Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and       Natural Resources that the following criteria have been met:        (1) The Kennewick Irrigation District agrees to accept       title to the property proposed for transfer.        (2) The proposed title transfer will not have an       unmitigated negative effect on the environment.        (3) The transfer is consistent with the Secretary's       responsibility to protect land and water resources held in       trust for federally recognized Indian Tribes.        (4) The transfer is consistent with the Secretary's       responsibility to ensure compliance with international       treaties and interstate compacts.        (5) The Kennewick Irrigation District agrees to provide, as       consideration for the assets to be conveyed, compensation to       the United States worth the equivalent of the present value       of any repayment obligation to the United States or  [[Page H10306]]       other income stream the United States derives from the assets       to be transferred at the time of the transfer.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6652, authored by my colleague from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the  ownership of certain water infrastructure resources from the Bureau of  Reclamation to the Kennewick Irrigation District, which already  operates and maintains the facilities.   Now, to be clear, this is not a giveaway of taxpayer-owned property.  The district has a long-term contract with Reclamation to repay the  capital costs of construction, with the payment to be completed by the  time of the transfer.   This legislation is about supporting local water infrastructure. The  transfer will allow the district to more efficiently manage water  supplies, while giving the local community the ability to seek private  financing, through equity, to improve vital water infrastructure.   This is also a win for the American taxpayer. Title transfers like  this reduce regulatory paperwork and staff time for both parties,  reduce the Federal backlog for repairs and upgrades to improve the  environment and public safety, and reduce Federal liability.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse), the author of this  measure and a leader on the Natural Resources Committee.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that  a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is  not present.
