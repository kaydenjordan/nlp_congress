 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of Laura Eileen Orr, who passed away on January 16, 2019, at the  age of 68. Mrs. Orr was born in Missouri on October 2, 1950. She served  as a dedicated adviser to the students of Arizona State University for  50 years. Our State will miss her dearly.   Mrs. Orr began her career at ASU in 1968 and later went on to become  the academic and student services manager at the College of Public  Programs School of Social Work. She was a fierce advocate for students  facing adversities and was renowned by her pupils and colleagues alike  for her unwavering patience, encouragement, and magnanimity toward  everyone she encountered. I was privileged to work with Laura for over  10 years, first as a student in the master of social work program and  later as a part-time professor in the school of social work. She was a  joy to work with over the years.   An avid sports fan, Mrs. Orr enjoyed supporting both the Sun Devils  and the Cardinals at football games. She also enjoyed theaters and  frequently attended performances and listened to Broadway play  recordings.   Mrs. Orr is survived by her husband of 45 years, Karl Orr, her two  sisters Barbra Voelker and Nancee VanderPluyn; her two sons,  Christopher and Michael and their wives, Danielle and Amanda; as well  as four grandchildren; Brayden, Benjamin, Isabella, and Joseph. Please  join me in honoring her memory.                            ____________________
