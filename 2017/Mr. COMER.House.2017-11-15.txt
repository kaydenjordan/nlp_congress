Madam Speaker, it has been more than 30 years since  Congress passed meaningful tax reform. In those three decades, we have  seen unbelievable progress in technology, communications,  manufacturing, and so much more. I am thrilled we now have a chance to  pass meaningful tax reform, an opportunity to finally move to a Tax  Code that works for families, small businesses, and Americans across  the board.   We have a once-in-a-generation chance to bolster middle class  prosperity, strengthen our economy, and help America's global  competitiveness. These are not just abstract concepts. These are real  people, families, businesses, and workers.   Over this past year, I have traveled through the 35 counties that I  represent, and I have been so impressed by the countless Kentuckians  who are working to bring jobs of the future into rural America. Unlike  these innovative entrepreneurs, our Tax Code is, unfortunately, stuck  in the past.   Like many of my constituents in the First District, I run a family  farm and have experienced the challenges of dealing with an outdated  and cumbersome Tax Code. know firsthand the difficulties small  businesses face when they try to operate, grow, and hire more workers  while battling a Tax Code that does not work for them. Passing tax  reform is finally within reach, and I enthusiastically support swift  passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.    Throughout our Nation's history, small businesses have served as the  backbone of our communities. These companies provide high-quality jobs,  contribute to their local communities, and invest money right here at  home. That is why I am dedicated to enacting tax relief that allows  American small-business owners to keep more of their hard-earned tax  dollars, to grow their businesses, and to compete globally.   This bill will create almost 13,000 new jobs in the Commonwealth of  Kentucky and will raise after-tax income for middle class families by  almost $2,000. More than 59,000 taxpayers in the First District itemize  their taxes, and because of the near doubling of the standard deduction  and other simplifications, many of our taxpayers will have much simpler  returns. And for our Nation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will generate  economic growth adequate to increase Federal tax receipts by $1  trillion.   In the First District of Kentucky, there are nearly 44,000 taxpayers  who earn small business income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, small- business owners will benefit from the new lower 9 percent tax rate on  the first $75,000 of their business income for owners earning less than  $150,000. Families and small businesses will have more opportunities to  succeed with this framework.                                time  1930    Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the number of  deductions and credits aimed at special interests and other well- connected groups, which will create a simpler, more level playing field  for American taxpayers. Getting rid of these special privileges in the  Tax Code will ensure that all Americans, not just those who can afford  their own tax preparers, get to keep more of their own money.   President Trump, my colleagues in Congress and I have promised to  deliver tax reform in a big way. I am proud to be keeping this promise  now. My constituents deserve a system that enables them to keep more of  their hard-earned money and spend less of their time dealing with our  overly complicated Tax Code.   I think it is important to address a concern that I have heard  throughout the tax reform debate, one that I take very seriously: our  national debt, which currently tops $20 trillion and is growing every  day. The debt is a serious problem that poses an impediment to growth,  a burden on our future, and a threat to our national security.   While I am glad to finally hear bipartisan interest in addressing  this challenge and getting the deficit under control, I think it is  clear that any solution must include reducing government spending,  particularly on mandatory programs that are the major drivers of our  debt. I look forward to continuing to work towards this goal.   The last time we addressed our Tax Code was when President Reagan was  in office. Sticking with the Tax Code we have had for decades, one that  leaves U.S. businesses and workers behind, is not an option. Now, I  have high hopes for the future with this tax reform framework.   I will continue fighting for reform that will benefit Kentuckians and  our Nation as a whole, and I look forward to supporting progrowth  solutions that have proven to benefit our Nation and our citizens.
