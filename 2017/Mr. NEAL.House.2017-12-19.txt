 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, what you are about to hear from our Republican friends  for the next 30 minutes is the following: a mixture of theology and  science fiction. And then they are going to take you to revisionist  history.   This is the most regressive piece of tax legislation that has come  from the Ways and Means Committee in the 25 years that I have been a  member.   This is not about simplification. When you have a chance to look at  the phase-ins and the phaseouts, you will be passed out by the time  they get to the expiration dates.   They say it is about simplicity; it was going to be on a postcard.  You are going to need to carry a billboard around with you to  understand what is in this actual bill.   And here is the best part: when Secretary Mnuchin said, Mr. Speaker,  that under no circumstances would people at the top get tax relief.  Well, I guess if you are formerly in the 39.6 percent tax bracket,  which is summarily lowered to 37 percent, that that is dressed up as no  tax relief for people at the very top. But then again, to help out with  their argument, then they double the exemption on the estate tax, which  will go from $11 million to $22 million.   The people at the bottom in this, they are going to argue: Everybody  gets a tax cut. Well, here is where we go to revised history.   In 2001, President Bush said everybody gets a tax cut. The Federal  budget of $1.3 trillion included a tax cut for everybody. The people at  the bottom got a hundred bucks, and the people at the top got hundreds  of thousands of dollars. This is a creative replay of exactly what  happened.   And then in 2003, they came back and cut taxes again for people at  the very top and blew a huge hole in the Federal deficit, which had  been estimated at the time, after Clinton left on January 19, 2001, to  project surpluses of $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Instead, the  Federal deficit mounted to $6.1 trillion.   So here is the simplicity of their proposal today. They are borrowing  $2.3 trillion to give a tax cut to people at the very top of American  society. That is not in dispute.   In addition to borrowing the money, recall that the Federal Reserve  Board said they are projecting, already, three increases next year in  interest rates. We don't know what this is going to look like by the  time they get done, but this, today, is more about ideology than it is  about public policy  [[Page H10202]]    Think of it this way as well: This was done in 1 month. In 1 single  month, the entire revenue system of the United States is being  transformed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I yield myself an additional 1 minute, Mr. Speaker.   Not one public hearing was held on this bill. And when they say  today, ``Oh, we had 5 years of public hearings,'' we did not have one  hearing on this bill--not one. No witness testimony was sought. No  committee was convened for the purpose of a hearing. And then when we  went to conference, we were all granted an opening statement, and we  got to question the nonpartisan Director of the Joint Committee on  Taxation.   Mr. Speaker, more than anything else today, this is a missed  opportunity where both sides could have accomplished something great  for the American people.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), the longest serving member of the Ways and Means  Committee, and a well-deserved 1 minute, I might add.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia, Congressman John Lewis, one of the great men of our times.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia, Congressman John Lewis, one of the great men of our times.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the very capable legislator and Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), a distinguished Vietnam veteran and a well- known and valued member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), the former president of the State Senate and  a well-informed member of the Ways and Means Committee.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), a very capable member of the committee, and a  champion of renewable energy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), a very capable member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the very quotable Congressman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, a good  friend, and a former member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a very knowledgeable Member from the  city of Chicago and champion of all things Chicago.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, any way you cut it, with  this bill, the rich will get richer, the poor will get poorer, and  middle class families will get shafted. Thirteen million Americans will  lose their health coverage, and people with preexisting conditions can  forget it.   Then the writers of this bill will be coming after entitlement  programs, after Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, SSI. We are down  to the wire, and no matter what is said, this bill raises the debt,  raises taxes on middle-income families, and provides wealthy  individuals and corporations with big tax cuts they don't need.   It is a sad day for my district; it is a sad day for the State of  Illinois; it is a sad day for the United States of America; and I will  vote ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins), a capable member of the Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the rich and wealthy corporate  winners of this Republican tax scam love company, and they just got the  company of 14 United States Senators who will personally benefit from a  new 20 percent deduction for wealthy  [[Page H10207]]  real estate investors with no employees to pass that benefit on to.   One Senator who voted against the bill, before he announced he was  voting for it, stands to gain $7 million annually and personally. The  Senator said he was unaware of the provision and that he did not read  the bill.   Mr. Speaker, the conference committee, the reconciliation process,  was to narrow the differences between these two bad bills, not add new  provisions that benefit rich Senators. This bad bill just took a  dramatic and potentially illegal turn that should be fully investigated  before a vote is taken today.    Mr. Speaker, the stock market has been going up since March  of 2009, and we have had 88 straight months of economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms.  Sewell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), who is very successful.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, in this tax bill, Republicans have gifted  the wealthiest corporations and individuals with massive new tax cuts  and loopholes to take advantage of. But when I go home to my district,  there isn't a mother working two jobs to put food on the table or a  farmer struggling through a bad year or a senior trying to pay for a  prescription who has ever told me that tax reform means corporate cuts  on the backs of them and their families.                                time  1315    They know Republicans always promise that the benefits will trickle  down to working people, but they never do and they never will. What is  worse, Republicans have made it clear that cuts to Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid are next.   This bill takes care of corporate special interests, the wealthy, and  the well connected, while putting middle class Americans' finances and  healthcare on the chopping block.   We need tax reform that helps middle class families. This bill does  the exact opposite. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), the former revenue commissioner of the State  of California, who is going to tell us about the State and local tax  deduction ending.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, we were promised a middle  class tax cut. This is not it. What we have instead are tax cuts for  the wealthiest paid for by the rest.   So what happened?   Maybe Trump thinks multimillionaires are the middle class or maybe  this all is just a tax scam.   To see how working families will pay for corporate interest, all you  have to do is read the bill, which is hard to do, because it was  written overnight behind closed doors.   Tax cuts: they reduce the tax rate for the wealthiest from 39.6  percent to 37 percent.   State and local taxes: they cap the deduction to just $10,000. But in  my State of California, the average deduction is $18,500, meaning  families will be forced to pay taxes now on twice their income in order  to give a staggering tax break to corporations.   So hear this: 83 percent of the benefits of this bill goes to the top  1 percent.   Who gets cut?   Seniors, families, children.   Is this the right thing to do?   The answer is a resounding no.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Velazquez), who will tell us about the great harm that this  does to New York and to the island of Puerto Rico.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the assistant Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to how much time is  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 4\3/4\  minutes remaining.    I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   So, in 1 month, we have taken the entire revenue system of the  country without one public hearing, without any witness testimony,  without the solicitation of one expert. ``We,'' meaning the Republican  majority. They have decided to go forward with this reckless plan.    Contrast this with Reagan and O'Neill and Rostenkowski and Packwood  in 1986.   When Gephardt and Bradley first offered their bill in 1982 on tax  reform, 4 years ensued before the measure came to the floor for  passage, and, in that time, 450 witnesses offered testimony. Every  expert from every nook and cranny in America was invited to offer their  vision of what a better tax system might look like. And those  individuals--and I knew them all because I went to the committee when  Mr. Rostenkowski was the chairman--saw that as the fabled achievement  of their time in a bipartisan manner.   Do you know what else?   Secretary Reagan and Chief of Staff Jim Baker sat through the markups  on that tax reform measure.   Now, Secretary Mnuchin, instead, has said, nobody at the top will get  a tax cut. And then they cut the rate from 39.6 at the top to 37. Well,  nobody at the top will get a tax cut.   We are going to double the exemption on this estate tax so that you  might now keep $22 million rather than $11 million, without any  formalization of taxation.   My friend, Mr. Brady--and he is my friend--he spoke before about the  people's money.  [[Page H10211]]    Well, you know what the people's responsibility is?   A million new veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. That is the  people's responsibility.   When we talk about responsibility and the people's money, Medicare is  the people's responsibility. Social Security is the people's  responsibility.   As we celebrate the extension of life expectancy in America, Medicaid  today now cares for people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. That  is the people's responsibility.   They have carefully taken theology and wed it to science fiction.   Remember what we heard around here all these years?   Don't worry, tax cuts pay for themselves. That was the offering in  2001, $1.3 trillion worth of tax cuts.   Well, we get to 2003, another $1 trillion worth of tax cuts. By the  way, there was time in between for a repatriation holiday, at 5\1/4\,  all advertised on the basis of job creation, and layoffs ensued almost  the next day.                                time  1345    This money is going to be used for stock buybacks and dividends.  There will be little investment in this lost opportunity where we  should have invested in community colleges and vocational education and  apprenticeship programs.   Six million jobs in America go unanswered every single day because of  a skills alignment problem and also the horror of what opiate addiction  has done across the United States. It has sidelined 2 million people.   What they are telling us today is the following: We have got tax  simplification. What happened to the postcard? As I said earlier, we  are going to have to carry around a billboard for tax simplification to  figure out what is in it. They keep talking about phase-ins and  phaseouts. I am telling you, we will all be passed out by the time they  get done with this. This is more complexity.   And wait until people have a chance over the next few weeks to sort  through what is in this bill. But here is something you might give some  thought to: the bottom quintile, you are going to get $60 a year. The  second quintile, you are going to get $380 a year. The top 1 percent,  they are going to get $51,000 a year. The top 0.1 percent, they are  going to get $193,000 a year, all in the name of middle class tax  relief.   As we proceed to the holiday, they are telling us this is their  Christmas present. And you know what they are doing with it? It is  going to be Christmas hangover debt, and they are putting it on the  credit card and adding $2.3 trillion to the Federal debt.   Merry Christmas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the conference  report?    Mr. Speaker, I certainly am.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Neal moves to recommit the conference report on the       bill H.R. 1 to the committee of conference with instructions       to the managers on the part of the House to disagree to       section 11042 and part VIII of subtitle A of title I of the       conference substitute recommended by such committee.    Mr. BRADY of Texas (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The motion is not debatable.   Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to  recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by  5-minute votes on:   Adoption of the conference report, if ordered; and   Suspending the rules and passing H.R. 4323.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 191,  nays 236, not voting 4, as follows:                               [Roll No. 691]                                 YEAS--191       Adams      Aguilar      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Boyle, Brendan F.
