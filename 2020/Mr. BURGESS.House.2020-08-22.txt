 Madam Speaker, this bill, H.R. 8015, does seem to be  rushed. And here is the biggest thing, it is not going to address the  core problem that exists in the United States Postal Service.   This bill appropriates a $25 billion bailout using emergency  supplemental funding, removing it from the previously agreed to  bipartisan budget agreement numbers, and prohibits the Postal Service  from making any reforms until next year at the earliest.   So if this bill is intended to improve efficiency or effectiveness of  the Postal Service, I would just simply ask: How in the world is it  supposed to do that if it is prohibited from making any changes?   The Postal Service is in trouble, every Member of this Chamber,  Republican or Democrat, understands this. We should be deeply concerned  about the precarious position of the Postal Service. But despite the  narratives, this problem has been decades in the making.   The Postal Service's operational pains have been festering literally  for  [[Page H4264]]  decades. Since 2007 mail volumes have fallen year after year as  American consumers and businesses have chosen digital communication  over letters and mailed advertising. Over the same period, the number  of addresses requiring delivery and retirement obligations for retired  Postal Service employees have continued to grow. So in very simple  terms, revenues have fallen, and costs have risen for over a decade.                                time  1100    This novel coronavirus' impact on the economy is only exacerbating  this situation. The Postal Service lost $2.2 billion in the second  quarter of this year. H.R. 8015 kicks the can down the road and forces  the Postal Service to continue to sustain financial losses. No reforms  to modernize the Postal Service, so we should expect its fiscal health  to worsen.   Now, in spite of all the heated rhetoric today, the Postal Service  will not collapse tonight. The Postal Service has informed Congress  that it has enough cash on hand to remain solvent through August 2021.  That is a year from now if you are doing the math at home. And Congress  has already provided an additional lifeline by raising the Postal  Service's loan authority by $10 billion.   Instead of voting on this rushed and partisan bill, Members of this  Chamber could work together to solve the problem. Congress has time to  work through the proper committees, provide the proper oversight,  provide the proper reforms, and preserve this essential service.   Let's vote against this bill today, a dictatorial bill brought to us  by the Speaker of the House, H.R. 8015, and work together in finding a  meaningful and lasting fix for the United States Postal Service.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   There is a sudden sense of urgency to address the financial stability  of the Postal Service, but I would simply ask the body: Where was the  sense of urgency from our House Democratic leadership at the start of  the pandemic?   Look, I recognized in January this deal over in China was a bad deal,  a novel virus, biological behavior not known, not worked out.   The Postal Service's problems did not surface this week. They have  been going on for years. But the Postal Service will not go bankrupt  tomorrow, and yet we have been called back here to vote on an issue  that, quite frankly, is not going to get solved from today's  activities.   But I called on the Committee on Energy and Commerce last February to  do hearings on this novel coronavirus. My requests were ignored and  then subsequently dismissed because we had other important work to do:  horse racing, flavored tobacco, ticket stubs--any number of things-- other than work on the novel coronavirus.   But we could have provided support in the form of funding for  vaccines and testing and more. We have done some of that in the short- term sense, but we could continue to support our Nation's pandemic  response in additional ways, which is why I have introduced legislation  that aligns with the legislation already existing in the Senate, where  we could come together and provide our country with some of the  critical resources necessary to fight this novel coronavirus.   Unfortunately, the House Democratic leadership does not acknowledge  or seem even to be curious as to whether or not they are up to the  task.   So this legislation provides $29 billion for the Public Health and  Social Services Emergency Fund to develop additional medical  countermeasures and vaccines. A safe and effective vaccine is the  strongest arrow in our quiver to help society return to normal.   Importantly, the bill would provide $2 billion for the Strategic  National Stockpile and $2 billion for the Biomedical Advanced Research  and Development Authority for use in developing medical  countermeasures.   But you have to ask yourself: The business plan as promulgated by the  Speaker of this body, why is it antithetical to that development? Could  it be because the nominee of their party this week in a very important  speech promised the American people ``no miracle is coming''? Is that  because you are going to cut off the funding for BARDA? for the  Strategic National Stockpile? for research on vaccines?    Look, there are commonsense, bipartisan ways to help our Nation and  help our Nation respond to the coronavirus, but House Democratic  leadership has turned their backs on the needs of America.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to vote against the previous question.  Allow us to debate and pass this measure. It is of critical urgency.  Indeed, a miracle could be coming.
