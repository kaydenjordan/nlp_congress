 Mr. Speaker, making D.C. a city-state is  unconstitutional, it is impractical, and it flies in the face of the  Founders' intent. James Madison said it himself in the Federalist  Papers. Unfortunately, our colleagues across the aisle are trying to  make this about race. I thought that was inevitable. It is sad and  unfortunate.   But let's look at data. In 1800, this city was a White majority,  10,600 and 4,000 African-American residents. Then 150 years later, in  1950, 517,000 White residents to 280,000 African-American residents.  For 150 years, this was a White-majority city, and there was no serious  effort to make it a State.   But there is a way we can solve this issue because one core argument  is a pretty good one, no taxation without representation. It is flawed  because there is local government, and they have a Delegate here. But  with retrocession, putting Washington back into Maryland, that would  give them that added seat and would address that very issue. The GOP is  acting in good faith because we know that that seat will be a  Democratic seat, but it is the right thing to do.
