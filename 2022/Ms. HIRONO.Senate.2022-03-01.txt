 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution  that affirms the importance of our compact of free association with the  Republic of the Marshall Islands and apologizes to the people of the  Republic of the Marshall Islands on behalf of the U.S. Government for  the United States' nuclear testing program. I am thankful to Senator  Markey for joining me in this resolution as we seek to strengthen the  ties between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall  Islands.   After freeing what are now the Republic of the Marshall Islands from  Japanese control during the Second World War, the United States was  entrusted with administering the islands as a part of the United  Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Under the trusteeship,  the United States was charged with promoting self-government and the  economic and educational advancement of the islands. The trusteeship  also obligated the United States to protect the health of the  inhabitants of the trust territory.   President Harry Truman reaffirmed the United States' ``special  responsibility'' for the people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands  when he reassured the United Nations that the people of the Marshall  Islands ``will be accorded all rights which are the normal  constitutional rights of the citizens under the Constitution.''   In many ways, the Government of the United States failed to live up  to that special responsibility. From 1946 to 1958, the United States  conducted 67 thermonuclear tests in the Marshall Islands. The tests  contaminated at least 11 of the Marshall Island's 29 atolls. These  tests destroyed their land and led to their displacement. Nuclear  testing also exposed the Marshallese to radioactive fallout,  contributing to increased cancer rates, birth defects, and other  serious health conditions. The nuclear testing program has caused  irreparable harm to the people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.   That harm and our collective failure to live up to our nation's  responsibilities have similarly failed members of the Armed Forces and  civilian contractors that were tasked by our government with cleaning  up nuclear waste in the Marshall Islands. In the 1970s, the United  States sought to clean up Enewetak Atoll, where the United States  conducted over 40 nuclear tests. In an effort to contain radioactive  material on Enewetak, members of the  [[Page S886]]  Armed Forces and civilian contractors constructed the Runit Dome, an  unlined nuclear waste containment structure that stores approximately  110,000 cubic yards of radioactively contaminated soil and debris.  Thousands of servicemembers were exposed to radiation and nuclear waste  as they worked to clean up Enewetak Atoll.   To this day, those servicemembers remain ineligible for health  benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs that other  ``radiation-exposed veterans'' receive. I am thankful to Senators Smith  and Tillis for their leadership on this issue, as they seek to secure  health benefits for these servicemembers through the Mark Takai Atomic  Veterans Healthcare Parity Act.   The Republic of the Marshall Islands is one of the United States'  strongest allies and one of its most important partners in the Indo- Pacific region. Since entering into a Compact of Free Association with  the United States in the 1980s, thousands of Marshallese have migrated  to the United States to live and work. The Marshallese have made  invaluable contributions to my home State of Hawaii and have enriched  communities throughout the country. The compact also protects U.S.  national security interests by providing the U.S. military with  exclusive access to the territorial waters of the Marshall Islands and  serves as host to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site  on Kwajalein Atoll.   While our relationship with the Republic of the Marshall Islands  remains strong, they are in jeopardy. U.S. economic assistance under  the Compact of Free Association to the Marshall Islands is set to end  in 2023 while near-peer competitors threaten to undermine our  alliances. Additionally, climate change poses an existential threat to  the Republic of the Marshall Islands.   But in order to continue on with our relationship with the Marshall  Islands, we need to reckon with our past. The United States has never  apologized for its nuclear testing program in the Marshall Islands. The  harm caused by the United States' nuclear legacy in the Marshall  Islands cannot be taken back or undone. But as the Republic of the  Marshall Islands memorializes today, March 1, as Nuclear Victims  Remembrance Day, we can show our contrition and endeavor to build a  stronger relationship based on correcting the wrongs of the past and  strengthening the special ties that bind our two nations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution  that affirms the importance of our compact of free association with the  Republic of the Marshall Islands and apologizes to the people of the  Republic of the Marshall Islands on behalf of the U.S. Government for  the United States' nuclear testing program.
