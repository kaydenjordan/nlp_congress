 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congressman Young for his  leadership.   Mr. Chairman, it has been said during this debate that recreational  fishermen aren't being disadvantaged under the current system. Our  fishermen, both commercial and recreational, are absolutely being  disadvantaged, and that is exactly why we must pass this bill. I will  give you one example.   If you are a commercial fisherman in New York, you could catch 50  pounds of fluke once per day for 7 days. You have to go out. You can  catch 50 pounds. That is 350 pounds for the week.   Now, it would make more sense if we were able to have a system in  place where they were catching 350 pounds maybe in 1 day, like maybe  New Jersey, where you could do 500 pounds for 3 days.   Or if we want to talk about the science where you have black sea  bass, 240 percent over the target biomass, yet we are seeing a quota  reduction, compared to other States, in New York. Our fishermen are  getting disadvantaged under the current system.   Or the NOAA observer program, where you have a fisherman who is  taking someone out to go to an area where they know there is not going  to be any fish and they end up collecting flawed data that is sitting  on a shelf and not even ending up getting used.   The reality right now is that we have fishermen in my district who  are desperate to survive 365 days of the year, from early in the  morning until late at night, barely making ends meet, on a boat that  barely works, with overhead where they are having trouble being able to  pay their own bills to get by. They are looking for people to fight for  them in this Chamber, to fight for that business owner, to fight for  them so that they can make ends meet.   It is about protecting the fishery as those very fishermen care so  much about. But they know that the system could get better, and that is  why we are here, fighting for them. That is why I thank  Don Young for  his leadership, because they are watching right now on C-SPAN.   In my district, those fishermen are watching on the internet, they  are watching on TV, and they are looking for people to fight for them  because they have been struggling for years and decades, and they are  desperate to get this passed so that they can afford to pay their  bills, so that when they are going out at 3 a.m. tomorrow and they are  going to come back late at night, that they know that things are going  in the right direction, that their government is going to start working  for them at the Federal level, the State level, the regional level, we  are doing our part.    Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague, Joe  Courtney from Connecticut, for his bipartisan cooperation on this and  so many other issues that are important to the hardworking men and  women who make their living on the Long Island Sound, a precious  waterway we are both so fortunate to represent.   This amendment creates an industry-based trawl survey program for the  New England and Mid-Atlantic regions. Improving survey data so that the  quotas and regulations imposed on our fishermen are transparent,  equitable, and fair is a critical goal of the underlying bill, and it  is the purpose of this important bipartisan amendment.   Increasing industry buy-in and cooperation with the NOAA survey  program is essential for improving data collection. Without the right  data, fishermen in our region will continue to be shortchanged while  their counterparts in the Pacific Northwest are already benefiting from  increased cooperation between NOAA and the private sector.   What we have right now in our region is a massive failure on behalf  of NOAA because their vessel has fudged trawl after trawl. The people  who work on the water every day have the equipment, the vessels, and  the expertise to get this important data collection done, and done  right.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment, and I commend my  friend from Connecticut for his hard work on this issue. I look forward  to continuing to work together with him and others on bipartisan  solutions to help our hardworking commercial fishermen, charter boat  captains, and all the small businesses that are a part of the coastal  economy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 200 will provide  needed regulatory relief for fishermen from the east end of Long Island  and the entire region who are struggling under confusing and arbitrary  Federal restrictions on striped bass fishing in the Block Island Sound.   The unique maritime geography of our region means that making the 15- mile journey by boat from Montauk Point, New York, to Block Island,  Rhode Island, requires passing through a segment of waters considered  to be part of the EEZ, known as the Block Island transit zone.   For recreational anglers, charter boat captains, and commercial  fishermen, this shift in jurisdiction can mean the difference between a  nice day on the water and committing a Federal offense. My amendment  would permanently restore the right to fish for striped bass in this  waterway, ending decades of confusion and arbitrary punishment for  local fishermen.   These are hardworking men and women who run small businesses either  on the commercial, charter, or recreational side, and in my district,  they are the backbone of our coastal economy and part of our island's  way of life. No other species of fish, besides striped bass, are  subject to this confusing ban, which was meant to impact the high seas  of the EEZ, not a small segment of local waters situated between two  State boundaries. Fishermen should be able to legally fish for striped  bass in this limited area just as they currently can in adjacent State  waters.   We also must lift this unfair ban so that the resources of the U.S.  Coast Guard can be focused on their important national security and  safety mission, not waste it on the enforcement of an arbitrary ban in  a small waterway.   A recreational angler or boat captain on the water off of Montauk  Point can easily go from fishing legally and responsibly in State  waters to violating Federal law once they pass over the 3-mile limit  where New York State waters end and the transit zone begins. Many of  these individuals lack the expensive GPS technology to know if and when  they have crossed the boundary, and there are no buoys to warn them.   These are responsible men and women who have the greatest vested  interest in preserving the striped bass fishery, but they also  desperately need relief from confusing government regulations that are  hurting their livelihoods and access to local fisheries.   Last Congress, my stand-alone bill to address this issue, H.R. 3070,  the EEZ Clarification Act, passed this House with a unanimous vote. I  also passed two similar amendments on this topic through the House last  September, again, with unanimous support.   This amendment is supported by the Recreational Fishing Alliance,  Long Island Commercial Fishing Association, Montauk Boatman & Captains  Association, and the newly formed New York Recreational & For-Hire  Fishing Alliance.   On behalf of the hardworking men and women of Long Island who rely on  fishing as a way of life, I ask for all my colleagues' support on this  commonsense amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this should not be treated as Federal  waterways. It should be treated as a small local waterway in between  two State boundaries. It shouldn't have been designated EEZ in the  first place.   This amendment doesn't declare open season on striped bass fishing.  It is still going to be subject to the same management that currently  exists for surrounding waterways where striped bass fishing is  currently acceptable.   The science shows biomass for the striped bass fisheries strong in  our area, and, also, a science that is not discussed enough in this  debate is the science of my fishermen and those small-business owners  who are struggling to make ends meet.   So you have the science of the biomass being where it needs to be,  plus we have the science that we are not speaking about enough where  people right now are desperate for this kind of relief. They want  people in Congress representing them in Washington who get it, who are  going to fight for them.    We can't be lost in this beltway argument where, here, I am a  Representative from the east end of Long Island, the First  Congressional District of New York, and we have people who represent  the other end of the United States of America telling us what is best  for us.   We are here pleading for people to listen to us, to hear us, to hear  from these fishermen, the commercial fishermen, the recreational  fishermen, and to fight for them as well, especially when biomass backs  it up.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time I have left?    Mr. Chair, I would say that every level of government  needs to get it better than the way that we have the current laws,  current rules, current regulations, whether it is the Federal  Government, whether it is the regional councils, whether it is the  State governments.   Earlier on, when we were having a debate on the underlying bill and I  was talking about the fluke fishery for commercial fishermen, 50 pounds  a day for 7 days, 350 pounds, you are not going to let them catch 350  pounds in 1 day. You will make them catch 50 pounds a day for 7 days,  while the neighboring State of New Jersey could do 500 pounds a day for  3 days.   Well, guess what happened today. Talk about not getting it at other  levels of government. Our Governor in New York State, out of no notice,  cuts off the commercial food fishery. These people are struggling to  make ends meet.   So instead of pointing fingers at other levels of government and  regional councils where everyone is making mistakes and no one gets it,  how about we do our part? How about we get it? How about we listen to  them? we hear from them? we make a difference?   We are leaders. We are elected to represent our people. I am elected  to represent my people, and I would respectfully urge my colleagues,  especially those who are from faraway places several hundred miles  away, to do a better job listening and allowing me to represent my  folks and stop trying to undercut people who are hardworking business  owners struggling to make ends meet, especially when science is on our  side.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1700
