 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  budget resolution.   The American people have suffered. They have suffered greatly from  this pandemic, and this body has taken action to support those efforts.   It should be noted that Republicans have voiced support for targeting  relief where it is needed. Mr. Speaker, we get it. We know there are  still needs out there. We know there are still people hurting. We  understand that, and we agree that we need to have targeted relief.   Thus far, Congress has passed nearly $4 trillion in COVID relief  funding on everything from the PPP program to direct payments to money  for testing and for vaccinations.   However, a significant amount of funding has yet to be utilized, with  more than $1 trillion of available resources waiting on the sideline to  be spent. Of that $1 trillion, there is $280 billion left in the PPP  program, $239 billion in health spending, $172 billion in unemployment  insurance assistance, and $58 billion in State and local aid, to name a  few areas with leftover funding.   Now, we are discussing ramming through this budget resolution so that  the Democrats can pass a $1.9 trillion COVID package without any  bipartisan input or work. After weeks of talk of increasing  bipartisanship and working together on big issues for our country, this  resolution runs contrary to that. Not only does it do our budget  process a disservice, but it moves forward with the idea that the  bipartisan consensus of Congress should be cast aside.   As I said earlier, there is more than $1 trillion that has been  passed in COVID relief that is just sitting there unused.  Unfortunately, this budget resolution doesn't address that point or  build upon that point.   For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  resolution.
