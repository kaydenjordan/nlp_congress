 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 798, a  resolution condemning anti-Semitism on college campuses and encouraging  campus leaders to speak out in support of their Jewish students,  faculty, and guests.   One word that comes to mind is ``regression.'' The extreme rhetoric  on college campuses is, sadly, yet another chapter in the troubled  history between Jewish students and American universities. It started  with quotas. In 1922, Harvard President Abbott Lowell proposed a cap on  the number of Jewish enrollees each year. Many other universities  adopted similar policies.   Out of Jewish quotas, alternative Jewish education opportunities were  born. In 1948, Brandeis University was founded. It was named after  Lowell's great enemy, the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice, Louis  Brandeis. The initial 107-student class at Brandeis was overwhelmingly  Jewish and just 12 miles down the road from Cambridge. It stood as a  stark reminder of ethnic discrimination.   The world progressed greatly in the post-war period, but the events  of the past month have ripped open a wound in American postsecondary  education that had been festering.   There is no better example than modern Harvard. The coalition student  group letter from Harvard was the first anti-Semitic demonstration on  campus to make the news after Hamas' October 7 attack, hearkening back  to Harvard's Jewish quotas. Harvard is a bellwether, for better or for  worse.   H. Res. 798 condemns the support of terrorists and condemns anti- Semitism behavior. I thank Representative Owens for putting this  important resolution forward, and I pray that it is a step toward  reversing the abhorrent behavior that has taken over college campuses.   Madam Speaker, we must throw anti-Semitism into the dustbin of  history where it belongs.
