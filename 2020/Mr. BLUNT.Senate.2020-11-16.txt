 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mr.  Blake Hurst on an extraordinary career and well-deserved retirement.  Blake has been an outstanding leader and voice for Missouri's  agriculture industry and has played a vital role to elevate our State's  national presence among the agricultural community when it comes  [[Page S6721]]  to advocacy on behalf of Missouri farmers and ranchers. Among his  contributions to Missouri's agriculture industry, Blake has served with  the Missouri Farm Bureau in a variety of capacities throughout his  career, including as a district board member, vice president, and most  recently as the organization's president for the last 10 years.   Mr. Hurst was elected in 2010 as the 14th president of Missouri Farm  Bureau and will cap off a 25-year career with the Missouri Farm Bureau  upon his well-earned retirement. A devoted family man, Blake Hurst and  his wife Julie have three children, Lee, Ann, and Ben. The family  raises corn and soybeans on their family operation in northwest  Missouri. Blake also operates a wholesale greenhouse business with his  wife, Julie; daughter, Lee; and sons-in-law, Ryan Harms and Matt  Clutter. The family raises flowers in two acres of greenhouses.   In addition to his time consuming role at Missouri Farm Bureau, in  his spare time, Blake also contributes as a freelance writer, with work  appearing in the Wall Street Journal, The American, Weekly Standard,  Wilson's Quarterly, Reader's Digest, Today's Farmer, and the Show Me  magazine of Missouri Farm Bureau.   Mr. Hurst has had a tremendous career with the Missouri Farm Bureau  and is one of the most forward-thinking agriculture leaders in America.  Over the years, I have truly valued the working partnership and, most  importantly, the friendship, that I have fostered with Blake. Blake  brings a certain passion and tenacity when it comes to agriculture,  whether it is fighting against costly and burdensome regulations from  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, advocating for better  management of our Nation's rivers and inland waterway system, defending  the Renewable Fuels Standard, promoting healthcare services for rural  America, or delivering assistance to producers that are impacted by  natural disaster. He has demonstrated the ability to communicate big  ideas and advocate for commonsense solutions that has been a big help  to me and so many others across Missouri and the country. There is no  one I would rather be in the trenches with than with Blake.   Blake and Julie have done so much for our State and understand it  incredibly well. I look forward to their continued advice, success, and  friendship. It is with great pleasure I wish Blake continued success in  retirement and well-deserved time with his family.   Thank you, Blake, for all you have done and will continue to do for  Missouri.                            ____________________
