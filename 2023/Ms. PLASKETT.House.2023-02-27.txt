 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the role of  the National Park Service in the Virgin Islands of the United States.  While the National Park Service plays a vital role in preserving the  natural and cultural resources and facilitating outdoor recreation  throughout the Nation, I must acknowledge that the relationship between  the people of the Virgin Islands and the National Park Service has not  always been and is not the best.   On St. Croix, the park sits on some of our most sacred ground, and it  is incumbent on them to appreciate and preserve that, of course, which  is important, but also to make it accessible to those of us who are  living there. On St. John especially, St. Johnians are concerned and  have a history in which Laurance Rockefeller was able to take so much  land. There are questions even today about who owned what land, how was  it taken, and how did it become part of the National Park Service.   I have continually expressed concern about the National Park  Service's hiring and staffing practices in the Virgin Islands. I have  encouraged the recruitment of native Virgin Islanders who understand  the historical context of park spaces and possess a greater degree of  cultural awareness. While there have been some hires, I have yet to see  meaningful progress, and extended vacancies of National Park Service  positions are a concern.   Additionally, for the past 3 years, I have suggested the formation of  just a community garden within the Virgin Islands National Park Service  boundaries. Such action is authorized by the National Park Service  management plan of 2006.   In fact, the Virgin Islands National Park Service general management  plan of 1983 included the development of an approximately 2-acre garden  plot.   The park comprises 7,259 acres, and to not have a plot for the people  who live on that island to be able to garden, people who are locked  around water, who have an inability to be able to get fresh fruit and  vegetables to their families, it would also foster a better  relationship between the community and the national park.   Last week, my office hosted a meeting to ensure that Virgin  Islanders' voices--not just written comments--were received by the  Department of the Interior, the National Park Service, and the  Government of the Virgin Islands about the proposed Government of the  Virgin Islands National Park Service St. John land exchange for the  construction of a K-12 school on St. John. During this meeting, my  office learned of the barriers and difficulties to submit a written  statement during the final comment period.   Thankfully, the park allowed us to extend this until March 15.   While my office can advocate for the people of the Virgin Islands-- presently my office and Congress is not a party to the agreement--the  land exchange between the Governor of the Virgin Islands and the  National Park Service seems to be going through.   While I may not always agree with our Governor, in this instance I  recognize that he is between a rock and a hard place presently as  Virgin Islanders are quickly approaching their deadline for using  Federal funding to rebuild the school. As we all know, the National  Park Service process takes time.   Indeed, Senator Angus King, who last Congress headed up the Natural  Resources Committee in the Senate, was only able to get the National  Park Service to donate land in Maine after 30 years of advocacy.   The children of the Virgin Islands do not have that time.                                time  1215    Additionally, we are approaching the end of the Caneel Bay  Redevelopment and Management Environmental Assessment public comment  period. The National Park Service owns 70 percent of the island of St.  John, making it one of the most pristine islands not only in the Virgin  Islands but in the Caribbean.   The path forward for a resort at Caneel Bay must consider the  socioeconomic and environmental impact on the Virgin Islands. Caneel  Bay contains some of the best beaches in the world, and to not utilize  the property as a world-class, five-star resort would put the Virgin  Islands at a disadvantage for tourism dollars.   The path forward for Caneel Bay impacts not just St. John but the  entire territory. If Caneel Bay is relegated to  [[Page H881]]  a third-rate facility, it will have a cataclysmic impact on the Virgin  Islands economy. From reluctance to place plaques at sacred places to  rangers stopping people in public parades, among other things, the  National Park Service has to do better in terms of how it deals with  native Virgin Islanders.                            ____________________
