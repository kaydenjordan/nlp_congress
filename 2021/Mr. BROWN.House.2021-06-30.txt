 Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman DeFazio,  Chairwoman Norton, and Chairman Payne for their leadership.   This bill will get our infrastructure working again; fund new,  transformative projects; and create good-paying American jobs. We need  21st century infrastructure that meets the challenges facing the  Nation, and that is exactly what the INVEST in America Act will do:   With investments in our communities, including more than $6.2 billion  to Maryland's highway and transit systems;   With an emphasis on equity, including $3 billion to reconnect  neighborhoods, particularly communities of color separated from local  economic opportunities and divided by decades of bad infrastructure  policy;   And with a modern approach to growth and development, including $134  million to promote Transit Oriented Development needed to create  thriving and inclusive communities around our transit hubs, and promote  safe multimodal transits in communities like New Carrollton in my  district.   Mr. Speaker, this is a historic investment in America, and I urge its  adoption.
