 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4667,  which includes provisions of my bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act.   In 2017, 8 percent of the United States population was affected by at  least one disaster. This startling statistic highlights the importance  of investing in mitigation infrastructure before tragedy strikes.   Studies have repeatedly shown that, for every $1 invested up front,  we can save between $4 and $8 in avoided recovery costs. My bill would  allow us to realize those savings by transforming how we approach  disaster spending.   It would provide FEMA with the programs, authorities, and resources  to help our communities plan for, mitigate against, respond to, and  recover from disasters.   Every one of our districts, Republicans and Democrats alike, will be  impacted by disaster at some point. In 2011, my own district was  devastated by flooding from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee.  People lost everything, and homes and businesses were completely wiped  out.   I visited with families and employers affected by this tragedy, and  it made me realize that we need to do something to help communities  build better and smarter before disaster strikes. My bill, the Disaster  Recovery Reform Act, will do just that. It will save lives, lessen  damage, and speed up recovery.   I thank Chairman Shuster and my colleagues on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee and the Senate for their work on this  bipartisan and bicameral agreement.   Again, I urge swift passage of H.R. 4667.
