 Madam Speaker, tonight I had the rare privilege to preside  over the House as our colleagues spoke about our beloved colleague,  John Lewis, an honor I will remember for the rest of my life.   And as I turned to hear the stories from both Republicans and  Democrats, I was struck by the sentiments over and over about how John  not only gave them hope, but made them better human beings because of  his silent strength, his hopeful nature, and his love for all, even in  the face of despair.                                time  2145    As a new Member who is truly here because I believe there is need for  more good trouble in this world and the need for those who will stand  up for what is right, I am blessed to have been in John's presence and  to have learned from him even in quick moments on the floor. His hope  was contagious, as was his love for God, our country, and his fellow  Americans. His enduring teachings will live on in all who seek out  justice.   God bless John Lewis, God bless his family, and may he live in peace  and power.
