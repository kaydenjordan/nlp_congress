 Mr. President, I come to the floor today again to talk  about the drug epidemic that continues to be such a big issue in my  home State of Ohio and around our country. I am here now for my 56th  floor speech, I am told, on this topic, sometimes talking about the  opioid crisis that has gripped my State the way it has so many others  in this Chamber but also talking about other issues that relate to the  drug epidemic. It is not just about the prescription drugs, the heroin,  the fentanyl, and the carfentanil that have impacted so many women and  children and families and devastated so many communities; there are  also other issues. The one I want to talk about today is what is  happening with regard to crystal meth.   Methamphetamine is back with a vengeance, and we need to have a more  effective response to it. Congress has done quite a bit in the last  several years to push back against this drug epidemic.   New policies have been put in place at the Federal level for the past  few years that are promoting better prevention, treatment, and recovery  and helping our law enforcement respond with Narcan--that miracle drug  that reverses the effects of overdoses--and helping to ensure that we  have a prevention message out there that is more effective.   Congress has now spent more than $3 billion in additional funding-- taxpayer dollars--to support treatment and recovery programs, and it  has been needed. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act has  provided a lot of that, and so has the 21st Century Cures Act. That  goes directly to the States.   The good news is that these efforts are actually starting to pay off.  Drug overdose deaths are still way too high. In Ohio, we started with a  high-water mark, but after 8 years of more people dying every single  year, finally, last year, we saw in Ohio and around the country a  reduction in overdose deaths. That is great news. We peaked in 2017 at  72,000 Americans losing their lives. It is the No. 1 cause of death in  my home State of Ohio and the No. 1 cause of death for all Americans  under the age of 50.   The progress has been particularly encouraging in places like Ohio.  We saw a 21.4-percent drop in overdose deaths in the first half of last  year, 2018. Those are the last numbers we have and the most recent data  we have. That was the biggest drop in the Nation, actually, between  July of 2017 and June of 2018. So in that 1-year period, according to  the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, Ohio had the biggest  drop in the country. Again, that was partly because Ohio's numbers were  so high. We were second in the Nation in overdose deaths, from that  data.   Nationally, we are seeing a more promising, if more modest, downturn  in overdose deaths. Between September of 2017 and March of 2018,  overdose deaths fell from about 72,000 to about 71,000. Overall, the  overdose rate dropped in 21 States and nearly a full percentage point  nationally. So at least we are seeing some progress finally, after 8  years of increases every year and more and more heartbreak. This is  progress.   I think we would have been doing even better, frankly, if we hadn't  seen the big influx of fentanyl over the last 3 or 4 years. Again,  Congress has passed important legislation, but we are pushing up  against more and more fentanyl coming into our communities. That is an  incredibly powerful synthetic opioid--50 times more powerful than  heroin--inexpensive, and it is coming primarily from China and  primarily through the U.S. mail system.   Our pushback on that more recently that is starting to be effective  is called the STOP Act. We just passed it in this body last year. What  the STOP Act says is that the post office has to start screening  packages, particularly from countries like China, from which we know  fentanyl is coming in. They haven't done exactly what we asked them to  do yet, but they are doing a better job of stopping the poison from  coming in from China, which is where the vast majority comes from.   Today, even as we see progress on opioids and as we see somewhat less  fentanyl coming in and therefore higher prices for fentanyl on the  street, which is important--as we see this progress, we are also seeing  something that is very discouraging. What I have been hearing now for  over a year from law enforcement, treatment providers, social service  providers, and community leaders back home is that there is a  resurgence of methamphetamine--pure, powerful crystal meth--coming  primarily from Mexico.  [[Page S2738]]    I meet regularly with treatment providers and drug abuse task forces  all over our State. Recently, I talked to community leaders in Knox  County, at the Southeast Healthcare Services in Columbus, at the ADAMHS  Board in Adams, Lawrence, and Scioto Counties, the Hamilton County  Heroin Coalition, and community leaders and law enforcement in Butler  County. Every single meeting ended up the same way: We are finally  making progress on opioids. Thanks for your help--because all these  communities are taking advantage of the legislation we passed here--but  the new scourge is crystal meth. Help us with that.   Often they are saying that this crystal meth is being laced with  something else, sometimes fentanyl. So this same deadly fentanyl we  talked about earlier is sometimes now being laced with crystal meth,  making for a devastating cocktail.   The October 2018 report from Ohio University said that  psychostimulants--including methamphetamine--were found in just nine  unintentional deaths in 2010. That number rose to 509 in 2017, the most  recent data we have. That is an over 5,000-percent increase. Something  is happening out there. Again, having finally gotten control of the  opioid issue, even the fentanyl, synthetic opioids, which is the latest  surge, now we are seeing methamphetamine deaths rising dramatically.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, deaths  involving cocaine and psychostimulants, including meth, have also  increased nationwide in recent years. Among the more than 70,000 drug  overdose deaths in 2017, nearly 23,000--nearly one-third--involved  psychostimulants such as meth, cocaine, or both. From 2016 to 2017,  deaths rates involving cocaine and psychostimulants like meth each  increased by approximately 33 percent. This increase is across all  demographic groups, all census regions, and in several States.   A July 2018 report from the Ohio Department of Mental Health and  Addiction Services highlights the intertwined nature of rising meth  usage rates and the ongoing opioid crisis. They said some meth users  initially turned to this drug to manage the heavy crashes that followed  prolonged use of heroin and other opioids, and then they became just as  addicted to meth as they were addicted to opioids. So that is one  reason I think we see this increase in methamphetamines in Ohio-- because users are turning to meth to manage the crashes that follow  prolonged use of heroin.   Meth is now stronger and cheaper than ever before. Again, it is  coming almost exclusively to Ohio from Mexico. The days of home  chemists and the one-pot meth labs are actually over. You probably  heard about it in your community or other States where these meth labs  were a big setup, and they created a huge environmental problem, as  well as the issue of producing meth, which was devastating communities.   Those meth labs are pretty much gone now. In Ohio, there is not a  county that tells me there is a meth lab left. That may sound like good  news, but it is actually bad news. The meth labs are gone because the  meth coming in from Mexico is more powerful and it is cheaper. So why  make meth in the basement when you can have crystal meth delivered to  your doorstep from Mexico? It is being mass-produced by Mexican drug  cartels who are smuggling it into the United States.   According to Dennis Lowe, who is the commander of the Major Crimes  Unit in Athens, OH, ``[Mexican drug cartels] almost single-handedly  eliminated meth labs in the State of Ohio. . . . People are getting  better quality product and it's cheaper to buy from a cartel.''   So it is more powerful, more deadly, and cheaper.   By the way, one Columbus, OH, enforcement officer recently told me  that crystal meth on the streets of Columbus is less expensive than  marijuana now--another reason we see it increasing.   As I have heard from folks all over Ohio, we are also seeing meth  laced with other drugs, including fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine. Many  of these cartels splice these drugs into methamphetamine but don't tell  the customers, so users may be consuming dangerous opioids without  realizing it. Any street drug can be deadly.   Much of the methamphetamine, as I said, enters from Mexico through  the ports of entry. It comes in bulk through the ports of entry. It is  often hidden in cars and trucks. Smugglers make it through the  screening process, and they sell it to the distribution network.   So we need to do more at the ports of entry to have better screening.  According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection folks, the amount  of methamphetamines seized at our ports of entry has soared from 14,000  pounds in 2012 to 56,000 pounds in 2018--a huge increase. In fact, just  in the last year alone, we have seen a 38-percent increase in  methamphetamines trafficking across the southern border.   According to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of  Ohio, the number of crystal meth submissions to the Ohio Bureau of  Criminal Investigations' lab rose from 2,000 in 2015 to over 12,000 in  2018--in just a 3-year period, a 500-percent increase.   What's happening with crystal meth is one reason we need more  resources to secure our southern border. It is not just my opinion. The  experts at Customs and Border Protection tell us they need more  physical barriers; they need more border patrol agents; they need more  technology; they need more surveillance; they need more cameras; they  need more screening to stop this illegal flow of drugs.   I think we are beginning now to make some progress here since we are  deploying more sophisticated technology at the ports of entry, and that  is smart. But the traffickers are smarter, and they are also learning  ways to avoid those ports of entry, to go around them, to cross  wherever they can continue this evil and prosperous trade.   A story originating in Galion, OH, last year caught the Nation's  attention. A 5-year-old was out trick-or-treating for Halloween last  year, and he was exposed to meth and began suffering from seizures and  other symptoms of meth exposure.   Law enforcement checked his Halloween candy, thinking that was the  problem, and it was not. It wasn't laced with the drug as they feared.  But then they found the meth. It was in his own home--his own family  home. His father eventually was charged with possession of drugs and  tampering with evidence. But here is a 5-year-old kid suffering from a  meth exposure.   Two weeks ago, I was in Knox County, OH, Central Ohio, where I  participated in a roundtable discussion with local elected leaders and  law enforcement officials, mental health recovery folks. This board is  focused on the crystal meth problem. Why? Because it is overwhelming  them. Opioids used to be their No. 1 issue. Now it is crystal meth.   I was told that methamphetamines are now involved in 89 percent of  the drug cases in Knox County, and in many cases there is polysubstance  abuse or overlap with any combination of meth, heroin, and marijuana.   Last August the Knox County Sheriff's Department arrested three  individuals who were involved in trafficking, distribution of meth,  moving from Columbus into Knox County. By the way, what law enforcement  tells me about methamphetamines is that they are causing a new state of  crimes, somewhat closer to the cocaine crimes that would have been back  in the 1990s when cocaine was the primary concern.   Heroin is a drug that does not create the same stimulant effect; it  is not a psychostimulant. So the crimes primarily are crimes to pay for  the drugs--property crimes--whereas the meth crimes often tend to be  crimes of violence because it is a stimulant like cocaine.   So law enforcement tells me they are very concerned. Their jails are  being crowded now with meth users who are there for serious crimes. The  big issue they are looking at is this: How do you get people through  successful recovery?   Here is the other bad news: We do not know much about how to help  people in recovery with methamphetamines. We know that with regard to  opioids, there are medication-assisted treatments that can be used,  and, in general, recovery practices that work for opioids can work for  meth--taking people through a therapy process--but there are not the  drugs to be able to help you  [[Page S2739]]  through it, as there are with opioids. So it is an even tougher problem  in some respects.   We talked about the Federal funding that had been awarded to Knox  County when I was there, and they are really happy about it. They are  getting money through the 21st Century Cures funding that came from  here, then went to the State of Ohio, and went down to them. They are  getting money from my CARA legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and  Recovery Act. They are also getting funding from the Drug-Free  Communities Act--legislation that I authored when I was in the House of  Representatives many years ago, and it is being used for prevention  very effectively in some of these counties.   The one thing they said about the funding was that they want to be  sure that there is more flexibility, particularly in the 21st Century  Cures fund. So it can be used not just for opioids but also for dealing  with this meth issue, which is their big problem now.   So my hope is that we will begin to see some flexibility in those  funding streams to be able to help places like Knox County.   We need to build a sustainable infrastructure for prevention,  treatment, and longer term recovery from all drugs. For these  communities, having that flexibility gives them the ability to respond  to whatever the latest problem is that is facing their community.   The U.S. Attorney's Office based in Cleveland, OH, which is led by  Justin Herdman, has been deeply involved in this effort to combat the  spread and distribution of meth. Last August his office indicted eight  people in Federal Court for their efforts to create a methamphetamine  and cocaine trafficking supply network--a supply chain from Mexico all  the way to Ohio.   In connection to these arrests, DEA agents seized more than 144  pounds of meth from a warehouse outside of Cleveland. It is believed to  be the largest seizure of methamphetamine in Ohio history. Again, it  demonstrates just how serious this threat is and how these criminal  organizations pose such a threat to our State and our country.   Back in 2005, Congress passed a bill on meth. It was called the  Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act. It regulated the over-the-counter  sale of certain drugs, like epinephrine, because of their use in the  manufacture of methamphetamines. This helped to combat the ability of  the meth producers to manufacture cheap methamphetamine from over-the- counter medicines that were easy to get. It dropped the price and  reduced its availability. However, Mexican cartels have now again  supplanted these domestic labs so that legislation is no longer  effective because here we are laden with these cheap, high quality,  crystal meth supplies from Mexico.   As the public learns more about the dangers of opioids and works to  wean themselves off those drugs, methamphetamine, if left unchecked, is  primed now to become the new drug of choice, perpetuating the cycle of  abuse. We cannot let that happen.   As we begin to make progress again on the opioid epidemic, which is  the worst drug crisis in the history of our country--and remains so--we  can't take our eye off the ball. What we are doing is actually helping  in the fight against opioids. We need to keep it up. We are actually  making progress, finally. We have to keep the pressure on. But my  question is, What do we do about the next wave coming? What do we do  about the methamphetamine that is coming into my State and your State?   First, we need to continue awareness about the issue of addiction  generally. This is not about one drug or just opioids or just meth or  just cocaine. It is about the overall addiction--treating addiction  like a disease, which it is; providing better treatment so that people  can get back on their feet; providing longer term recovery. So raising  that awareness generally is important, not just as to opioids but as to  addiction, which is really the issue.   Second, we have to do more on our southwest borders to stop the flow  of this crystal meth coming in. It is not the ultimate solution because  there is enough demand in America for this drug. It will find its way  in, but we can stop some of it. We are beginning to do that. At a  minimum, we can raise the price on the street, which is one of the  problems right now. As I said, it is incredibly inexpensive. As one law  enforcement person told me, it is less expensive than marijuana in some  cities of America.   Next, we need to do more to support Federal prevention programs that  can address this issue--prevention, education, awareness. This is  ultimately the most effective way to stop this epidemic from growing.  One tool to do that is called the Drug-Free Communities Act. It has  established more than 2,000 coalitions now around the country. Let's  continue to support those coalitions.   Very little Federal money has gone in compared to the private-sector  money, the State and local money, the foundation money, but it  leverages some of that other money. We need to continue to support  these community foundations.   Next, let's start a new prevention program focused on this meth  challenge. One place we could find that funding, by the way, is in the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. We authorized and then  actually appropriated $10 million for a national prevention program. We  allowed HSS to set that up. They haven't done it yet. I think it is  important that we do it. I would take that $10 million and multiply it  manyfold by using it as leverage to go out to the private sector, to  encourage foundations, companies, pharma companies, and others to help  in this effort. I believe there is an interest in that. I know there  is. Let's do a massive prevention program because that may be, in the  end, the most effective way to keep people from getting into the funnel  of addiction in the first place.    Next, we need to continue to expand and support these high intensity  drug trafficking areas. They really work. I will tell you, in Ohio,  when you have Federal resources, combined with State and local  resources, when they are coordinated together, focused on this drug  issue, they make a lot of sense. They have stopped a lot of the meth  distribution, as I said, in Ohio. I talked about what happened in  Northeast Ohio. There was the largest meth seizure ever. That was  through the HIDTA Program.   Next, we need a more effective treatment for meth. NIDA--the National  Institute on Drug Abuse--and the NIH--the National Institutes of  Health--are working on answers. But we need new medications so we can  assist with quality treatment to help those suffering from addiction  get into recovery. This is a major challenge.   I spoke to Scott Gottlieb today, who is a former FDA Commissioner,  about this issue, and I have talked to others. We need to do everything  we can to support efforts to try to come up with medication that can  assist with regard to the treatment for these psychostimulant drugs.   Finally, we have to be sure that the communities have more  flexibility to use the Federal funding they are already getting through  Cures, through the State Opioid Response grants, to address issues like  meth. I am exploring whether legislation is necessary to provide that  flexibility, but I believe a lot of it could be provided through the  administration of these grants and through the States.   I will continue to ensure that the Federal Government is a better  partner for those working on the frontlines on this drug epidemic.  Opioids--yes, we need to keep up the fight. We are finally making  progress. After 8 years of increases in opioid deaths, finally last  year, for the first time in 8 years, we are seeing a reduction of those  deaths--the worst drug epidemic in the history of our country. It is  not a time for us to pull back. It is time to focus on what is working  and do more of it. But, also, we have these new challenges,  particularly crystal meth. We need to do a better job of addressing  that, as we talked about today.   Working together, I believe we can make a difference. I believe we  can turn the tide on addiction in this country.   Thank you.   I yield back.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S2740]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Park nomination expire at 1:45 p.m., Thursday,  May 9. I further ask that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 196, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 197, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution  [[Page S2749]]  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, May 9; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that the  Senate proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the  Park nomination under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, May 9, 2019, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
