 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to proceeding on  S. 3985, the JUSTICE Act, and want to briefly explain why.   On May 25, a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on the neck of George  Floyd for almost 9 minutes. Mr. Floyd repeatedly said he could not  breathe and pleaded for officers to stop. The officers ignored his  pleas and continued to kneel on his neck until his body went limp.  George Floyd's alleged crime? Using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy  groceries during a global pandemic.   As a nation, we have seen far too many unarmed Black men and women  killed by police. Rayshard Brooks was shot twice in the back while  running away from Atlanta police. The police had been called because he  had fallen asleep in his car and was blocking a fast-food drive-thru.  Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot eight times by  Louisville police while asleep in her home. Eric Garner was choked to  death by an NYPD officer for selling cigarettes. Freddie Gray was  killed after being taken into custody by Baltimore police for  possessing a knife. Walter Scott was shot in the back by North  Charleston police after being stopped for a bad brake light. Stephon  Clark was killed by Sacramento police in his grandmother's backyard for  breaking windows. And Michael Brown was shot six times by Ferguson  police while his hands were raised in the air.   Over the past month, millions of people--of all races, ages, and  backgrounds--have taken to the streets throughout the Nation to protest  these killings and to demand real police reform. We need to respond  with legislation that truly meets this moment, a bill that actually  holds law enforcement agencies and offices accountable under the law.   The Republican JUSTICE Act is nowhere near enough. It simply does not  impose accountability on law enforcement. Specifically, it does not  create a national use of force standard. For example, in California,  lethal force may only be used to prevent an imminent threat of death or  serious bodily injury to the officer or to another person. It does not  end racial profiling; in other words, it does not stop police from  using race to target individuals, a practice I would hope that everyone  agrees must cease. It does not prohibit no-knock warrants in drug  cases, the very type of warrant that led to the death of Breonna  Taylor. It does not reform qualified immunity, a legal defense that has  allowed officers to avoid accountability even when they have broken the  law. Instead of fixing these problems, the JUSTICE Act collects more  information and data on problems we already know exist.   We do not need more information. We need to address the underlying  issues of systemic racism and police use of force. That is where the  Justice in Policing Act comes in. Senator Booker and Senator Harris  introduced this bill earlier this month. It should be our starting  point. The bill makes meaningful reforms. For example, it requires that  police departments ban  [[Page S3202]]  choke holds and carotid holds in order to receive Federal funds. It  prohibits the use of racial profiling by police officers. It creates a  national police misconduct registry that would collect disciplinary or  termination history of officers so potential employers would know of an  officer's past misconduct. It gives subpoena authority to the Justice  Department to conduct ``pattern or practice'' investigations. It  eliminates the defense of ``qualified immunity'' so that police  officers can be held civilly liable under the law for misconduct. And  it amends Federal criminal law so officers can more effectively be  charged for violating people's constitutional and legal rights.   Meaningful reform is long overdue, and rather than rushing a weak  bill to the floor, the Senate Judiciary Committee should take up the  Justice in Policing Act as soon as possible. This is how the Senate is  supposed to work. We should not be trying to address this important  issue by rushing an insufficient bill to the floor. Now is the time for  leadership, courage, and real police reform.   Thank you.                            ____________________
