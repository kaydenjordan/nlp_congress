 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 5051.    Mr. President, I ask to dispense with any further reading  of the amendment.    Mr. President, the Senate is on the verge of honoring our  commitment to our country's toxic-exposed veterans and their families  through the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our PACT Act.   Look, generation after generation of veterans have been exposed to  toxic substances during their time in service, dating all the way back  to World War I and every conflict since then.   And they have returned only to face yet another battle here at home  when  [[Page S2844]]  they seek care and benefits because of the impact of toxic exposure on  their lives.   In the worst care scenarios, folks are paying the price with their  lives--veterans and heroes like Sergeant First Class Robinson, for whom  this bill is named after.   Look, we have made some incredible advances as a country over our  history when it comes to taking care of our servicemembers both in- theater and after they get back home. The survival on the battlefield  now compared to 50 years ago has been improved amazingly.   Prosthetics--we have done some amazing work with prosthetics for the  folks who have come back who are missing limbs. We have been working  hard on mental health. We are not where we need to be, but we are  making some advances. We have got more stuff to do, particularly in the  area of transition and implementation of alternate forms of mental  healthcare.   But the fact is, with toxic exposure, we have never done a good job.  This bill will put the VA and put this Nation on the right track to  addressing decades of inaction and failure by our government--by us--to  pay for the cost of the war.   So what does it do? It expands eligibility--expands eligibility--for  VA healthcare to more than 3\1/2\ million combat veterans exposed to  burn pits since 9/11.   It supports our post-9/11 and Vietnam-era veterans by removing the  burden of proof for 23 presumptive conditions caused by toxic exposure,  from cancers to lung diseases.   It establishes a framework for the establishment of future  presumptions of service connection related to toxic exposure. So why is  this important? Well, you know how the Senate works. Oftentimes, it  takes a long time to get much done, and it has taken an act of  Congress--literally, an act of Congress--to get these presumptives  approved in the past.   Now the VA is going to have a structure where they can follow the  science and get these toxic exposures covered, the ones that are going  to happen in the future--and, unfortunately, I am afraid that they will  happen in the future so this structure is important.   This bill also gives the VA the tools it needs to bolster its  workforce, to establish more healthcare facilities, to improve claims  processing, which will better meet the immediate and future needs of  every veteran that the VA serves.   I have talked about the costs. The costs are $287 billion over 10-- significant, very significant, but it is a cost of war.   Keep in mind that this substitute--because of the work that the  staffs have done in a bipartisan way--is $50 billion less than the  House-passed toxic exposure bill.   So we have done our best to make sure that this bill meets the needs  of our veterans and also meets the needs of our taxpayers.   This is the right thing to do, and it is the right thing to get done  today because right now our veterans are paying the cost. They are the  only ones paying the cost, and they cannot afford to wait any longer.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
