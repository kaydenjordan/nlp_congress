 Madam Speaker, very early this morning, my hometown of  Nashville, Tennessee, was terribly hard hit by a tornado.   At least 19 lives have been lost. Buildings were destroyed. Many,  many homes were destroyed, and countless lives have been disrupted. At  least 34,000 people lost electricity.   I have been in contact with our Governor, our mayor, our entire  congressional delegation, including my good friend   John Rose, to do  all that we can to bring emergency relief to the area as fast as  possible.   This is a genuine tragedy, and we need to praise our neighbors,  friends, residents, first responders, firefighters, police, and EMTs  who worked all through the night, despite fierce rains, to provide  first aid.   Nashville is strong. We recovered so well after the terrible 2010  flood that many parts of America didn't even know we had been  suffering.   Now is the time to beat this disaster.                            ____________________
