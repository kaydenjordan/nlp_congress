 Mr. Chair, for the past 2 years, President  Biden has made it his top priority to wage war on American energy.   On his first day in office, President Biden canceled the Keystone XL  pipeline and sent a message for those who wished to produce energy here  in the United States that they would not be welcomed during his tenure.   When gas prices soared to over $5 a gallon in Pennsylvania last  summer, his administration continued to tout the benefits of the Green  New Deal, instead of working to lower prices for American families.   Now, House Republicans are finally putting an end to Biden's failed  policies. H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, would create the  permitting reform that is required in order to allow American companies  to produce the oil, natural gas, and critical minerals that we so  desperately need.   Included in this bill is legislation that I crafted to provide  critical energy resource facilities the ability to participate in the  EPA's flexible air permitting program and providing them with the  ability to anticipate operational changes.   This isn't about cutting regulations. It is about giving certainty to  American energy producers. This legislation allows us to provide the  flexibility that American businesses need to mine and produce critical  materials safely while at the same time spurring investments into our  own communities.   It was President Reagan who said: We maintain peace through our  strength.   Today, that means returning to American energy dominance and ending  our reliance on foreign oil. It is time to streamline the permitting  process, it is time to lower energy prices, and it is time to create  American jobs.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1.
