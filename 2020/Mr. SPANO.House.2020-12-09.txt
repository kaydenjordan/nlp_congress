 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Florida 15th District  resident and local hero: Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Gary Clark.   Mr. Speaker, for 26 years, Gary wore his uniform proudly and defended  our  [[Page H7053]]  way of life. From Vietnam to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to  Desert Storm, Gary's leadership as a commander and director played a  key role in our force readiness policies.   Despite this distinguished career, Gary was just getting started. He  served on the National Board of Directors of the Military Officers  Association, as vice chair of the Florida Veterans Foundation, as chair  of the Polk County Veterans Council, as chairman of the Flight to Honor  Polk, and serves on the James A. Haley VA Hospital Advisory Board,  among others.   On a personal level, he has also aided my office and those of my two  predecessors with the military service academies nomination process-- his deep insight and knowledge have helped numerous students throughout  the years who also proudly served our country. And just this past  September, Gary joined the 8th class to enter the Florida Veterans'  Hall of Fame.   Mr. Speaker, it is Americans like Gary who have sacrificed their  time, their talents, and their treasures for both this Nation and their  neighbors. When I see an American flag, I think of Gary, and I am so  proud to call him my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Gary for his service; and to many more years  ahead, I salute him.                     Remembering Bishop Matthew Williams     Mr. Speaker, I rise to mourn the passing of Bishop Matthew  Williams, a longtime community and faith leader from our district, and  a personal inspiration to me.   Bishop Williams was born in March of 1956, in Lakeland, Florida, the  son of the late elder Matthew Williams, Sr., and the late Mother Louise  Williams. He graduated from my alma mater, Brandon High School, in  1974, and attended Hillsborough Community College. Yet, at the age of  17, and during a period of national unrest, he accepted Christ as his  personal Savior and, in 1982, became a full-time minister at Brown  Memorial Church of God in Christ, forever impacting countless lives in  our community.   Not only was Bishop Williams always available to help anyone in need,  he always was a source of strength and guidance to his peers. Given his  dedication to his neighbors and faith, it is no surprise that he was  elected to the Church of God in Christ's General Board, the highest  executive and administrative board within his denomination.   Mr. Speaker, our community and my family extend our deepest  sympathies to the Williams' family, especially to his wife, Gayle, and  his daughter, Deniece. Though, he will be missed, we know that he still  lives in the presence of Almighty God and awaits our next meeting.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lamborn, and I appreciate  the opportunity to speak.   Mr. Speaker, when I heard about the opportunity to talk this evening  in  [[Page H7100]]  celebration of National Bible Week, I was really, really excited. I was  excited because it gives me the chance to talk about something very  special to me.   When I was a boy, I remember seeing my mother read her Bible daily at  our kitchen table. Every now and then, I would look over her shoulder  at her open Bible to see numerous passages underlined or highlighted,  notes and prayers written in the margins. I also I remember my mom  quoting verses from the Bible in response to the circumstances of our  lives.                                time  1815    As I grew, my mom encouraged me to read the Bible. She assured me it  had the answers to life's questions, how to live, how to treat others,  how to know God's plan for my life. Most importantly, it would show me  how to connect with God, how to have a relationship with him that would  change my life here on this Earth, but also in the life to come.   Like many young people, I wasn't a very good listener, so I didn't  give the Bible much attention in my early years until I hit a  particularly hard stretch and was driven to my knees as a younger man.  It was then that I remembered what my mother had told me, the Bible has  the answers.   I began spending time every day reading the Bible. I learned about  how God created the Heavens and the Earth; how he created man with a  free will and so would never force man to love or serve Him; how He  called the Nation of Israel to be his chosen people; how He sent his  only son, Jesus, to live a perfect life and then to die a cruel death  to pay the price for every man's sin, if they would just accept Him and  the forgiveness that He offers.   These are important things. But the Bible also helps me today. It  helps me know how to love and care for my wife and my children. It  shows me how to love unlovable people, how to let hatred go and to  forgive, and how to have peace in my heart that passes all human  understanding. It gives me hope on tough days, at times when I can't  understand what is happening around me.   And now today, although it is hard to explain and probably as  difficult to understand, after 30 years eating and drinking,  figuratively, from the truth of the Bible, I can't get enough of it. I  can't go even one day without it. My soul becomes hungry and thirsty. I  become weak and discouraged. You see, now I can't live without this  Book. It is absolute life to me.   This is a crazy, messed up world, and it only makes sense to me when  I see it through God's lens when I see how the story ends and how He  redeems this mess and reconciles man to Himself once and for all time.   Yes, all of that is in this very special book called the Bible. And  so, if you are searching for meaning today, if you are searching for  truth, longing and thirsting for the answers to life's most important  questions, I encourage you to do the same thing that I was encouraged  to do. Pick up this book and begin reading it every day. I promise you;  it will change your life. The words and truth contained in it will give  you hope and peace and purpose like you have never before experienced.   I would like to take this last moment to thank you, God, for using  the Bible to show me how to live, and, most importantly, how to live  forever. I love you.
