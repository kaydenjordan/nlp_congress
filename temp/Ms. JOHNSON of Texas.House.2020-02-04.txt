 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Black History  Month to recognize the life and legacy of Doris Miller.   Miller was stationed on the USS West Virginia during the attack at  Pearl Harbor. Once the attack began, Miller left his role in the  kitchen to rescue shipmates and provide cover fire.   News hit Waco, Texas, where I was a little girl, that said he helped  to stop the U.S. invasion by the Japanese. Miller was awarded the Navy  Cross for his heroics, though his actions unquestionably merited the  Medal of Honor.   I recently attended a ceremony at Pearl Harbor with the Acting  Secretary of the Navy to announce the naming of the future aircraft  carrier in his honor. This will be the first aircraft carrier named for  an African American sailor. It is appreciated, but it is not the Medal  of Honor.   I have introduced H.R. 5549, the Doris Miller Medal of Honor Act of  2020. This bill would waive the statute of limitations to upgrade  Miller's Navy Cross to the Medal of Honor.                            ____________________
