 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to  join me in opposition to the proposed IRS reporting plan that would  intrude on the bank accounts of Americans and impose new regulations on  our already overregulated banking system.   First, it is not apparent that the IRS has any constitutional  authority to monitor Americans in this way.   Second, the American public does not support the expansion of IRS  bank data collection. Recent polling shows bipartisan opposition, with  67 percent of those polled opposed to the IRS collecting bank deposit  and withdrawal information.   Finally, this would add another regulatory burden to our financial  institutions after a historic year when banks and credit unions  provided lifelines to families, businesses, and communities during the  COVID-19 pandemic.   This proposal imposes upon our right to privacy and is bad for  families, small businesses, and financial institutions. I hope my  colleagues across the aisle will reconsider their support for this  unwarranted expansion of government.                            ____________________
