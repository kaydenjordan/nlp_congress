 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  the life of Representative Jim Hagedorn. I had the privilege of working  with Jim in D.C., and the opportunity to spend time with him in his  district where I know he was well-loved.   Jim was a tireless advocate on behalf of our Nation's farmers,  ranchers, producers, and foresters, and he never wavered in his  commitment to serving the great people of Minnesota's First District.   Jim was a warrior on the Ag Committee questioning and confronting the  administration when he perceived policies were hurting those families  that work hard every day to provide us food and fiber. I consider Jim a  dear friend and his passing a tragic loss.   His contagious personality and cheerful sense of humor will be missed  on the committee and in the Halls of Congress for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, scripture in Thessalonians 4:13-18 instructs us with  these words, ``Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be  uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve  like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.''   Jim Hagedorn lived his life dedicated in service to this Nation in a  manner that brought hope to so many. Let us find hope having known Jim  Hagedorn.                            ____________________
