 Mr. Speaker, I heard some of the Republican Members say  they want to fight the virus, yet they are voting ``no'' on this bill.  I would say they should do the opposite. If they want to fight the  virus, they should be voting ``yes'' on this bill.   Unlike under President Trump, when there was no national plan to  fight the virus, under President Biden, for the first time we have a  national plan to fight the virus that does not force States and local  governments to compete with each other for testing, contact tracing,  and medical supplies.   The American Rescue Plan will support the national effort to ramp up  distribution and administration of lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines, as  well as the implementation of a national testing strategy that will  help us quickly track and contain the virus. It also includes the  largest expansion of healthcare coverage since the passage of the  Affordable Care Act, including lower monthly premiums for millions of  Americans and a coverage expansion for millions under Medicaid who are  currently uninsured.   Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan lives up to its name. It  rescues families by providing critical utility bill assistance so they  can keep their lights on, the heat working, and the water running. It  rescues kids by boosting internet connectivity to bridge the digital  divide and close the homework gap.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are hurting. This legislation will  rescue our families, our communities, and our Nation as we continue to  confront this devastating pandemic and the ongoing economic crisis. It  is time to act, and this is the bill to bring us forward.
