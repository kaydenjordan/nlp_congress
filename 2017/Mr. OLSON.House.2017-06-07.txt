 Mr. Speaker, my hometown of Sugar Land, Texas, is bursting  with pride. A few hours ago, at the Johnson Space Center, Vice  President Pence announced that Loral O'Hara is a member of the 2017  NASA astronaut candidate class.   She is a native Texan. Her high school is in my neighborhood. She is  a proud Clements High School Ranger, class of 2001. She has a  bachelor's from a school in the former Republic of Texas, the  University of Kansas, and a master's from Purdue University.   Growing up with astronauts, I know they like to take lots of huge  risks, and by that standard, Loral is the most qualified candidate  ever. She is a private pilot, an EMT, a wilderness first responder, a  surfer, a sailor, a skier.   Currently, she works at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Center. That is  perfect training for her because she will spend hours in the water at  the Sonny Carter Neutral Buoyancy Lab outside the Johnson Space Center.   Loral, you know how to come home in style like only a Texas woman can  do. You are an astronaut. Welcome home.                            ____________________
