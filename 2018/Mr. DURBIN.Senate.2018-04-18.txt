(2) Federal share.--The amount of a grant under the pilot       program may not exceed 75 percent of the total cost incurred       in carrying out the activities described in subsection (c).        (i) Duration.--The Administrator shall require each       recipient of a grant under the pilot program to complete the       activities described in subsection (c), which shall be,       subject to subsection (h)(2), carried out using the grant       amounts, not later than 18 months after the date on which the       recipient initially receives the grant amounts under the       pilot program.        (j) Use of Census Data.--The Administrator shall make all       determinations regarding population under the pilot program       by using data from the most recently completed decennial       census by the Bureau of the Census.        (k) Grantee Reports to FEMA.--Each recipient of a grant       under the pilot program shall, not later than 30 months after       the date on which the recipient initially receives the grant       amounts, submit to the Administrator a report that       describes--        (1) the activities carried out with the grant amounts;        (2) how the activities carried out with the grant amounts       have met the objectives described in subsection (c);        (3) any lessons learned in carrying out the activities       described in paragraph (2); and        (4) any recommendations for future mapping modernization       efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.        (l) Biennial Reports by FEMA.--Not later than 2 years after       the date of enactment of this Act, and not less frequently       than once every 2 years thereafter until the date on which       all activities carried out with amounts from grants under the       pilot program are completed, the Administrator shall submit       to Congress and make available to the public on an Internet       website a report that--        (1) describes--        (A) the progress of the activities carried out with amounts       from those grants; and        (B) the effectiveness of technology-based mapping tools       used in carrying out the activities described in subparagraph       (A); and        (2) with respect to the final report that the Administrator       is required to submit under this subsection, includes       recommendations to Congress and the executive branch of the       Federal Government for implementing strategies, practices,       and technologies to mitigate the effects of urban flooding.        (m) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,       because the pilot program is limited with respect to scope       and resources, communities that participate in the pilot       program should acknowledge that the most successful efforts       to mitigate the effects of urban flooding--        (1) take a structural-based mitigation approach with       respect to construction, which includes--        (A) recognizing any post-storm damage that may occur; and        (B) pursuing designs that proactively minimize future flood       damage;        (2) make individuals in the community aware, through any       cost-effective and available means of education, of the best       approaches regarding the construction of properties that are       able to survive floods, which reduces the cost of future       repairs; and        (3) encourage home and property owners to consider the       measures described in paragraphs (1) and (2), which are the       most cost-effective and prudent ways to reduce the impact of       flooding, when constructing or renovating building       components.        (n) Funding.--There are authorized to be appropriated for       grants under the pilot program--        (1) $1,200,000 for fiscal year 2019; and        (2) $4,300,000 for fiscal year 2020, to remain available       through 2022.                                  ______    Mr. President, on Monday April 9, 2018, at 7:07 a.m., a  tiny little message to the Senate arrived: Maile Pearl Bowlsbey became  the very first baby born to a Senator, bringing joy to her father Bryan  and to her amazing mother, my colleague, Illinois Senator Tammy  Duckworth.   With this blessed arrival, this Chamber faced the reality of Senate  parenthood. And tonight, just moments ago, we made the decision to  allow Maile to help us make Senate history. Tonight we changed the  standing rules of the Senate so that Senator Duckworth, and any other  Senator who has an infant, can bring their child to the floor of the  Senate during a vote.   Senator Duckworth can keep her responsibility under our Constitution  and vote as a Senator without giving up her responsibility as a mom at  that moment.   I think it will do us good in the Senate every once in a while to see  a pacifier next to the antique ink wells on our desks or a diaper bag  next to one of these brass spittoons which sits on the floor--thank  goodness, never used. Perhaps, the occasional cry of a baby will shock  the Senate at times into speaking up and even crying out on the issues  that confront our Nation and the world.   We certainly revere history in the Senate, but part of our history is  recognizing change--the change that brought the first woman to the  Senate, the change that brought disabled people to the floor of the  Senate, and changes that will come to it in the future. These  adaptations have made us a better Senate and more reflective of the  people we serve.   I just can't say enough about my colleague Senator Tammy Duckworth,  an amazing woman who served her country, activated in the Illinois  National Guard as a helicopter pilot in Iraq. When a grenade was shot  into the cockpit and blew up and caused her grievous injuries, many  people wondered if she would survive. She not only survived, but she  prospered. She is determined and brave. She now is the mother of two  little girls--something just short of a miracle--and that motherhood is  something that is a source of great joy to all of us who count Tammy as  a friend and a colleague and a great leader in the Senate.   Let me also give special recognition to two of my colleagues who made  this resolution possible. Senator Amy Klobuchar worked closely with  Tammy  [[Page S2284]]  Duckworth on this issue and is our ranking Democrat on the Senate Rules  Committee. Amy put in a lot of hours and good humor, and I thank her  from the bottom of my heart for helping our colleague. And special  thanks to Senator Roy Blunt, the Republican chairman of the Senate  Rules Committee. Roy Blunt told me from the start: I support this  resolution. It will come right out of the Rules Committee to the floor  so we can move on it quickly. When Tammy Duckworth returns from  maternity leave, we will be able to accommodate her little girl and, if  it becomes necessary, to bring her to the floor during the course of a  vote.   Let me close by saying that today we officially say to Maile Pearl  Bowlsbey: Welcome to the world and welcome to the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.
