 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wish to make a statement about the  second vote we are going to have, and I urge my colleagues to vote  against the nomination of David Zatezalo as the Mine Safety and Health  Administrator.   MSHA is responsible for protecting the safety and health of miners in  this country and for holding companies that put their workers' lives at  risk accountable. So it really is disappointing to me that President  Trump nominated one of the industry's worst health and safety offenders  to lead this critically important agency.   This is, unfortunately, just another in a long list of decisions by  President Trump that jeopardizes workers' health, safety, and financial  security in order to prioritize corporations and special interests.   I really hope our colleagues will join me in rejecting President  Trump's extreme agenda and this nominee.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
