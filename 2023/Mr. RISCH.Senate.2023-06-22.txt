 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, the Senate is considering the Chile  tax convention. This treaty has been approved by substantial bipartisan  majorities in the Foreign Relations Committee in four separate  Congresses and has been pending since 2012. It is past time to approve  it and provide needed relief to U.S. investors and businesses in Chile.   Without ratifications, Chilean taxes on U.S. company operations in  Chile will rise up to 44 percent in 2027 when the special waiver  expires. Meanwhile, our competitors with Chilean operations would only  pay a 35-percent rate. That includes companies with headquarters in  Japan, Canada, Australia, Britain, and, of course, China.  [[Page S2209]]    Tax treaties help the business community by minimizing uncertainty  and promoting a favorable business environment. A tax convention with  Chile eliminates double taxation, provides certainty, and is a natural  counterpart to our free-trade agreement with Chile.   This treaty provides tools to ensure U.S. taxpayers will be treated  equally and fairly in Chile. It allows them to invest and compete with  the knowledge that they will not face discriminatory barriers. The  treaty provides tools to help resolve tax disputes between the United  States and our tax treaty partners. Without such tools, U.S. investors  would have limited ability to resolve these problems on their own. It  is not just businesses that will benefit from this treaty; the  convention imposes reasonable limits on the amount of tax Chile can  impose on U.S. persons who might live or work in Chile. Finally, this  treaty will help us prevent tax fraud in Chile.   The tax convention has been held up for a decade. I am pleased that  we are finally moving it forward today. I urge my colleagues to approve  this Chile convention. It is a treaty, of course, and requires two- thirds vote.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I thank the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee  for his work on getting bipartisan agreement on this declaration. This  declaration is necessary, given the reservation amending article 23.   The reservation regarding article 23 amends language addressing the  scope of double tax relief in connection with income earned by a  Chilean subsidiary of a U.S. company. That reservation, which was  initiated by the current Treasury Department, calls into question  whether article 23 provides sufficient relief for double taxation;  specifically, in the case of a U.S. company owning at least 10 percent  of a Chilean company, whether the U.S. would provide a credit under the  treaty for income taxes paid or accrued to Chile by or on behalf of  that U.S. company with respect to earnings that were also subject to  U.S. tax under the global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI,  provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA.   Although the Treasury Department did not agree to include a specific  clarification in the reservation with respect to that question, the  declaration in the resolution confirms that Treasury acknowledges that,  in light of TCJA's substantial changes to the international provisions  of our Tax Code, additional work is needed to evaluate the policy of  article 23 and whether it is sufficient in addressing relief from  double taxation. In other words, this declaration helps ensure that  outstanding questions regarding the scope of double tax relief provided  by article 23 are resolved before similar language is used in future  tax treaties.   Ranking Member Crapo, can you discuss why such a clarification is so  important with respect to future income tax treaties to which the U.S.  is a party?    I completely agree with the ranking member of the Finance  Committee. I will carefully review and consider future U.S. income tax  treaties to both ensure we resolve this important issue and to make  sure Treasury follows through on its commitment to further address  relief from double taxation in our tax treaties. I thank Ranking Member  Crapo for his leadership on this issue, and we will continue to work  together to hold Treasury to its commitment.                            ____________________
