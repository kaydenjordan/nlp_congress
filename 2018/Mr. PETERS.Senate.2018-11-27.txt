 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 150th  anniversary of Wayne State University. Located in the heart of Detroit,  MI, Wayne State University provides world-class education and has made  a tremendous impact on the community that surrounds it.   In 1868, just over 30 years after the State of Michigan joined the  Union, the development of what would become Wayne State University  began with the establishment of the Detroit Medical College by five  physicians who were inspired to improve medical education after their  service in the Civil War. Following shortly thereafter, the Detroit  Normal Training School--the predecessor of the college of education-- was founded.   At the turn of the 20th century, the school saw rapid transformation  and development. A change in attitudes brought on by the progressive  movement between 1890 and 1920 impacted institutions across America. In  1917, the Detroit College of Medicine and Surgery admitted its first  female students, as the Detroit Normal Training School began admitting  married women. These milestones in the school's history coincided with  the culmination of women's suffrage in the United States. In 1934, the  Wayne University name was adopted, eventually becoming Wayne State  University in 1956, after the Michigan State Legislature approved  public act 183.   Year after year, Wayne's footprint would grow to include more  programs and opportunities for students to excel. Growth of that  footprint included Detroit City Law School, which was founded in 1927  and later became part of Wayne University in 1933. Moreover, as  veterans from World War II came home and acclimated into civilian life,  Wayne University established the office of veteran affairs to help  veterans continue their education, enter vocational training programs,  and transition into the workforce. With the introduction of the GI  bill, Wayne University's programs saw it well positioned to increase  its veteran enrollment.   In 1950, the former central high school and main building of the  College of the City of Detroit was renamed Old Main, becoming one of  the City of Detroit's and Wayne University's most notable landmarks.   The 1960s proved to be a pivotal time in American history, with the  civil rights movement and the Vietnam war serving as the backdrop of  the public's conscience, ushering in a new era of barrier breaking  civic engagement. Throughout the 1960s, Wayne State University  continued to build on its rich tradition of progressivism by  establishing the office of counseling for the handicapped, the center  for urban studies, and covering pertinent social issues in the school  newspaper.   Continuing to build on its record of success, Wayne State launched  doctoral programs in the college of pharmacy and college of nursing,  and established the college of urban, labor, and metropolitan affairs,  and college of fine and performing arts. In 1994, Wayne State was  recognized for its research and was classified as a Research I  university by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.   Ever mindful of its position within the community as a bridge for  stakeholders across all fields of endeavor, Wayne State has forged  numerous partnerships to empower the community and its students to  succeed in a rapidly changing world. In 2004, the first phase of  TechTown was completed, which brought Wayne State together with the  Henry Ford Health System and General Motors to support entrepreneurship  and technological advancement. In 2013, Wayne State named M. Roy Wilson  as president of the university, and he has continued this rich legacy  of community partnerships.   Throughout its 150-year history, Wayne State University has fostered  an environment of innovation, inclusion, and community. The university  is deeply rooted in the city of Detroit and has been an indispensable  partner in the city's development and renewal. I am proud to be a law  school alumnus and am certain that Wayne State will continue to succeed  in its mission to cultivate the Warrior Strong leaders of tomorrow. I  ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this important milestone in  the history of Wayne State University as it celebrates its  sesquicentennial.                            ____________________
