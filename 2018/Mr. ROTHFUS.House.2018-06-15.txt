 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the unyielding  dedication that my constituents have for our military. In particular, I  would like to highlight the efforts of several folks back home who are  responsible for a number of billboards dotting the highways of Beaver  County that encourage people to wear red on Fridays to support our  troops who are deployed overseas.   For more than a decade, Americans across the Nation have worn red on  Fridays to show support for troops fighting in foreign lands. In this  effort, red is not just a color, but a message. RED is an acronym for  Remember Everyone Deployed. It is a message to remember our  servicemembers who are away from their families, risking their lives on  the front lines to defend our freedoms and values. Remembering them is  especially important since we often do not see news of those deployed.   Wearing red on Fridays is another way to show our troops that we are  thinking of them, that we support them, and that we appreciate their  sacrifices. I thank the volunteers of Beaver County for promoting and  reminding us of this wear red effort.                            ____________________
