 Madam Speaker, to tell you the truth, I am disappointed to  be here today, too, supporting the very idea and the very notion that  we have  [[Page H6932]]  to be here today exerting and codifying the right for women to make  their own healthcare and family planning decisions.   It is 2022, and we are standing here today with Roe overturned and  with 77 percent of this extreme GOP caucus voting against marriage  equality, so you had better bet, Madam Speaker, that we are here  because the Supreme Court has attacked reproductive rights. It is  absolutely necessary that we take action today.   For most of our lives, women across our country, including most in  this room, have relied on birth control to exert control over their own  futures. Yet, today, in the year 2022, many of those women are  wondering if they will see that control disappear.   Make no mistake about it, Madam Speaker, this is actually about  control. An extreme GOP and extreme Supreme Court want to take away  your freedom and your control over your own lives.   Quite frankly, it is tragic. My colleague is right. The idea that we  are even standing here today having to consider legislation that would  codify Americans' right to contraception, birth control, and IUDs--and  I can't believe the gentlewoman mentioned Trojan in her opening  remarks. We are here because we are in an absurd time where an  extremist GOP wants to take control.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation today.
