 Mr. Speaker, every day, we see more and more illegal  crossings at the southern border. March was the worst month yet, with  over 221,000 migrant encounters.   Instead of securing our border and empowering law enforcement, this  administration continues to make this crisis worse every day.   I am a proud immigrant and first-generation American. I came here  legally. There are 4.4 million people waiting their turn to legally  come to the greatest country in the whole world. Meanwhile, this  administration continues to allow millions of illegal migrants to take  advantage of our weak border policies.   We are a nation of laws, and enough is enough. The administration  must stop the flow of drugs and crime into our country and secure the  border to protect our citizens.                            ____________________
