 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Brunswick,  Ohio, resident Isabella Heinbaugh-McCroskey.   In 2016, Isabella began placing wreaths at the Ohio Western Reserve  National Cemetery.   In 2019, having noticed that local veterans were not being recognized  properly, Isabella walked the West View Cemetery grounds, at which  point she located 185 unmarked veteran graves. Isabella then solicited  donations and gathered volunteers to place the wreaths on the graves of  each veteran.   To educate the public, Isabella coordinated a Wreaths Across America  mobile trailer visit where the public learned more about the program.  She welcomed home and honored more than 25 Vietnam veterans at this  event.   Now, as just a freshman in high school, Isabella continues to work  with Brunswick VFW to coordinate flag retirements and Veterans Day  ceremonies, and she is a clear example of how women lead us.   We thank Isabella for her incredible devotion to our veterans and  congratulate her on being recognized as the 2023 Medina County Veteran  Advocate of the Year.                            ____________________
