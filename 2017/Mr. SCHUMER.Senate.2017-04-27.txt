 Mr. President, I enjoyed hearing my friend and gym  colleague talking about defense. I agree with him; we need a strong  defense. I agree with him that deficits are an enemy of getting the  defense spending that we need. I hope when we consider tax cuts, we  will hear that same view that we can't go deeply into deficit. I  appreciate my colleague's great comments.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, colleagues, I am objecting because we  still have to resolve the issue of poison pill riders before Democrats  can agree to the short-term CR.   Let's make no mistake about it, we are indeed making great progress.  I thank the majority leader. He has been cooperative and extremely  helpful throughout the process. I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator  Leahy the same. But our position has been clear, and it is nothing new:  no poison pill riders. The sooner we can resolve this issue, the  quicker we can have an agreement on appropriations for 2017.   So I object.    Mr. President, there is a simple way to resolve it, and  that is, the Republican leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the  House just agree to no poison pill riders.   I yield the floor.    We are aware.
