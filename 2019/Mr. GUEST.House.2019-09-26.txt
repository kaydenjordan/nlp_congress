 Mr. Speaker, September is National Recovery Month, a time  to look for ways to support recovery strategies for mental health and  substance use disorders.   Mississippi State University's Extension Service is working to reduce  opioid misuse by farmers and ranchers across our State.   Farmers have to face changing markets, weather events, financial  hardships, leading to farm stress while operating in one of the most  hazardous occupations. A valid opioid prescription given to a farmer  can lead to opioid misuse. Three out of four farmers have reported that  they have been affected by opioid misuse, and that opioids can be  easily accessed.   Through support from the USDA and SAMHSA, Mississippi State  University is training extension service agents to deliver mental  health first aid to farmers, as well as working with pharmacists and  medical personnel to better recognize misuse. This program is already  demonstrating incredible results as farmers are utilizing extension  agents to seek care.   I applaud the work of Mississippi State University and other  organizations in Mississippi that recognize needs in our community and  are finding creative ways to reach Mississippians with care.                            ____________________
