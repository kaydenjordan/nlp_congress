 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the exciting new  child tax credit that is part of the American Rescue Plan. I know the  words ``exciting'' and ``tax credit'' don't usually belong in the same  sentence, but this is different.   With the child tax credit, families with children under the age of 17  will receive $250 per child per month and $300 per month for kids under  6. These monthly payments can help cover everyday child-rearing  expenses--things like food, diapers, or shoes for the teenager who  outgrows his every 6 weeks.   More than 119,000 children in my district will benefit from the new  child tax credit, including thousands of children who will be lifted  out of deep poverty.   Let's be clear: The child tax credit is a special refundable tax  credit, so even families who don't earn enough to pay taxes will get  the automatic payment. But it is important to file a tax return before  the May 17 deadline so you can begin receiving payments as soon as  possible.   I look forward to making the child tax credit permanent.                            ____________________
