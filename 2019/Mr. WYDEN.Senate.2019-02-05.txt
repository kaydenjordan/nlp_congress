 Mr. President, today I am placing a hold on the nomination  of Elizabeth Darling to be Commissioner on Children, Youth and Families  at the Department of Health and Human Services.   Since Ms. Darling has been renominated by the administration in the  116th Congress, the Department of Health and Human Services gave the  State of South Carolina a green light for religious-based  discrimination in its State-contracted foster care agencies. Adults who  can provide safe, loving, and nurturing homes for foster kids will be  denied that opportunity on religious grounds.   I am also concerned about the slow implementation of the Family First  Act, which the Finance Committee passed on a bipartisan basis in the  last Congress. A big part of that law has been delayed, and the latest  information I have heard regarding my concerns is that there are  ``robust conversations'' happening behind the scenes. I expect that to  improve going forward.  [[Page S862]]    For these reasons, I will object to any unanimous consent request  concerning the nomination of Ms. Darling at this time.                            ____________________
