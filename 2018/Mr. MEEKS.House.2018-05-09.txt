 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Franklin Thomas  Sylvester, Jr., on his recent graduation from the University of  Connecticut Medical School, where he excelled in his clinical training.  Franklin, at 25 years old, is now preparing to embark on the next phase  in his preparation for life as a medical doctor.   I am proud to say that the city of New York will be welcoming  Franklin as he heads to Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital, where  he will do his residency training in pediatrics.   I commend Franklin and all those who are graduating this spring from  medical school. As an African-American male, Franklin's accomplishment  has an additional significance. Research shows that diversity in the  medical field is critically linked to better outcomes, and we also know  that there isn't enough diversity in a profession that so often makes a  difference between life and death.   Franklin recently said: ``Pediatrics is where I can make the most  difference. From children's health to their social issues, that is  where I want to make an impact where I can.''   With that kind of compassion and commitment to his profession,  Franklin will serve the children of New York and this Nation in ways  that make us all proud. I hope that today some young person listening  to my remarks will look to Franklin as an inspiration and strive to  similar accomplishments.                            ____________________
