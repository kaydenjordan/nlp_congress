 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for the  opportunity to address the House today as we come together as Members  of the House and read our U.S. Constitution.   Long-time British Prime Minister William Gladstone in 1878 said:  ``The most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by brain and  purpose of man.'' That is how he described the U.S. Constitution.   For 2 centuries the Constitution has dedicated the structure of our  remarkable Republic and created the operation of the consent of the  governed and the protection of a free people's individual rights.   All of us who work here in the people's House marvel at its daily  majesty, of James Madison's checks and balances, separation of powers,  and the institutional hybrid of Federalism.   Today, we gather at the heart of the Capitol, the heart of Article I,  the first branch, to read our governing document:   ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect  Union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the  common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings  of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this  Constitution for the United States of America.''    ``The Congress shall have power to dispose of  and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or  other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this  Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the  United States, or of any particular State.''   Section 4:   ``The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a  Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against  Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive,  when the Legislature cannot be convened, against domestic Violence.''   Article V:   ``The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it  necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the  Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States,  shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either  Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this  Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the  several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one  or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress;  Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One  thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first  and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that  no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage  in the Senate.''  [[Page H1166]]    Article VI:   ``All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the  Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United  States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.   ``This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be  made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be  made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme  Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby,  any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary  notwithstanding.   ``The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members  of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial  Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be  bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no  religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office  or public Trust under the United States.''   Article VII:   ``The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be  sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the  States so ratifying the Same.''   Mr. Speaker, this historic reading of the U.S. Constitution on the  floor of the House tonight, together with the Bill of Rights and all  the amendments ratified as described in the original document, make the  supreme law of the land. They are the law that we look to every day to  guide the work of this House of Representatives. And I will remind my  friends that 50 percent of the words in this historic document are  governed and written in regard to Article I, the first branch, the  Congress of the United States, the legislative branch.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues tonight who have joined us  on the floor in reading the U.S. Constitution: Virginia Foxx,   Tom  Emmer, Warren Davidson,   Mike Bost, Ted Yoho, Mike Conaway, Roger  Williams, Tim Walberg, Jody Hice, Rick Allen, Peter Olson, Buddy  Carter, Morgan Griffith, Andy Barr, Brian Babin, and Scott Perry. I am  grateful for their participation in reading this historic document.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
