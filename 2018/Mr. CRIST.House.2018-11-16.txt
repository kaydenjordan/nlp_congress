 Mr. Speaker, I rise today urging action to extend the  National Flood Insurance Program.   If Congress fails to reauthorize the NFIP by November 30, millions of  homeowners will be unable to obtain or renew their flood coverage;  housing markets will grind to a halt; and families will be left at risk  of financial ruin should a flood occur.   Congress must put this uncertainty to rest. Policyholders need  stability. Our housing markets need stability. American families also  need stability.   I urge my colleagues to bring to the floor, and to pass, the  reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program as soon as  possible.                            ____________________
