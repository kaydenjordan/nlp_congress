 Madam Speaker, today we vote to protect  the right to obtain and use birth control, a choice that should be  yours and yours alone.   As a reminder, the year is 2022, not 1922, not 1822. It is well  established. Birth control is central to a person's ability to plan  their future, to care for their families, get an education, have a  career.   But the extremist Republican Party is determined to take us back in  time and take away our freedoms. Politicians have no business in your  bedroom or your doctor's office.   They are coming for birth control. They are coming for IVF. We have  seen the plans. We have seen the legislation. House Democrats are  taking a stand. We will defend our rights and defeat the Republicans'  assault on freedom.
