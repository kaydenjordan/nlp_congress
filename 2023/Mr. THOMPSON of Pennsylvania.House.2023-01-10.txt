 Mr. Speaker, I rise to give thanks to  the men and women who keep us safe.   Yesterday was National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, a day to be  grateful for the officers who have dedicated their lives to serving  their communities.   Created in 2015, this day allows us to voice our appreciation to law  enforcement officers for their service.   National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day has become increasingly  more important in light of the growing negativity towards officers.   According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund  there are more than 800,000 sworn law enforcement officers serving in  the United States. Law enforcement officers don't enter this career  because of the recognition that they may receive, they choose this  career because of their passion for public service.   These officers knowingly put their lives on the line every day  because they know protecting and preventing crime creates a safer  world.   A simple way to show our law enforcement we care is to thank a police  officer. So, if you see a police officer, please thank a police  officer.   Mr. Speaker, I want to give my most sincere thanks to the men and  women of law enforcement for the dedication, sacrifice, and commitment  to the rule of law they display every day.                            ____________________
