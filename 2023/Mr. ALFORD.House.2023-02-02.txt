 Mr. Speaker, I am deeply honored to be here today to  recognize the life and the legacy of a great man of God named Fred  Lamaster.   He died January 29 at the age of 92, a life well lived. He was born  in Chicago. He graduated high school and went into the Marine Corps as  a sergeant, and continued his education at the University of Illinois  and Rockhurst University.   For 30 years, Fred worked for Pepsi in Kansas City and retired as a  vice president and general manager. Fred wrote gospel tracks and  distributed thousands of these, spreading the good news of Jesus Christ  in his later years.   He also helped his son, and my good friend, Scott Lamaster, with his  charity, taking it to the streets, feeding the homeless, and supporting  first responders.   Fred leaves behind a wonderful legacy, a love for God, a love for his  family, a love for this Nation, and a love for humanity.   Well done, sir. A good and faithful servant. We salute you.                            ____________________
