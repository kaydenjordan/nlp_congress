 Mr. Speaker, within just days of  assuming office, President Donald Trump has made a number of alarmingly  fictitious claims about anything from the alleged failures of the  Affordable Care Act to the skyrocketing murder rate throughout the  United States. President Trump has even felt it was necessary to  misrepresent the number of attendees at his inauguration. However,  among his most egregious ``alternative facts'' that he has presented to  the American people is the idea that there is widespread voter fraud  across the country, which is undermining the electoral process in the  United States. This is unequivocally false.   In fact, numerous reports, court findings, and official government  investigations over, the years have pointed to the fact that voter  fraud is, in reality, extremely rare. In 2016, the United States Court  of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which ultimately found the Texas  photo ID law to be racially discriminatory, noted in its findings that  there were only two convictions for in-person voter impersonation fraud  out of 20 million votes cast in Texas within the last decade. In a  separate case ruled in 2014, a special investigations unit for the  State of Texas was found to only have identified a single conviction  and one guilty plea of in-person voter impersonation in any election in  the State of Texas between 2002 and 2014. Nationally, countless  Studies--including one conducted by the nonpartisan Government  Accountability Office--have failed to identify any evidence of  widespread voter fraud. The story is the same in states all across the  country.   Yet, somehow President Trump and Republicans in Congress have arrived  at a separate conclusion and are using this false notion to promote  regressive voter laws that seek to suppress minority voting rights all  across the country. These laws are an example of your classic  ``solution in search of a problem,'' albeit with a more sinister  objective to suppress liberal leaning voters and deny select groups of  voters their fundamental right to vote.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I have worked tirelessly throughout  our careers to ensure that every American has equal access to the polls  regardless of race, income, location, or background. We will not stop  at making sure that every American preserves their right to vote, even  in the face of a Republican-controlled Congress and Administration. The  right to vote is a fundamental pillar of our democracy, and it is  counter to our principles that our nation had defended for centuries to  now try and erode that right for millions of Americans. I, and  countless other Americans, unequivocally reject these efforts and will  forever stand united against them.                            ____________________
