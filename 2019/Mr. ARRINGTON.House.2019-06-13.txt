 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  H.R. 2740 that would prevent funds from being used to contribute to the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.   Mr. Chairman, at the heart of America's economic prosperity and  unrivaled security is an abundant, affordable supply of domestic  energy, and the lion's share of that, 90 percent, is fossil energy. The  hardworking energy producers of west Texas and the folks in my district  are leading the way.   In the Permian Basin of west Texas, we went from producing a million  barrels of oil a day to 4 million a day, soon to be 8 million in just 3  or 4 years, making it the most active oil and gas producing region in  the world.   The blessings of these natural resources have given us an  overwhelming advantage for economic prosperity as well as national  security. To ensure we continue these advantages for the next  generation, I offer this amendment that would prevent U.S. taxpayer  dollars from going to the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change, a costly, ineffective, and irresponsible program that  has produced the likes of the Paris climate accord.   The climate activists' agenda, Mr. Chairman, and extreme ideological  views promoted by the Framework Convention embrace the view that the  only means to successfully reduce carbon emissions is to eliminate  conventional fuels, which, by the way, power our Nation's economy,  again, at 90 percent.   This framework is flawed in its assumptions, fraught with political  bias, hostile towards our main source of energy, and amounts to a jobs  program for ideological bureaucrats, and I oppose it and so do the  people of west Texas and most of the people in this country.   And did I mention that we spend billions of dollars to subsidize the  biggest polluters to comply with the mandates from this framework and  completely transition away from conventional energy sources?   America would pay out of the nose to fuel their vehicles and heat  their homes. It would hurt our poor people more than anyone else.   The Paris accord is the most recent product and egregious example of  this framework. At best, the Paris Agreement is political window  dressing. At worst, it is a tax on middle- and working-class families,  with a price tag that, in just 5 years, would amount to $250 billion in  costs to our economy and 2.7 million jobs. Meanwhile, it would have  forced us to subsidize the world's biggest polluters, like India, and  it would give a pass to hostile powers like Russia and China for years.   I believe we have an environmental stewardship responsibility to our  creator and to our children, but we must be responsible to balance  those stewardship responsibilities with our economic and national  security interests.   Here is the irony, Mr. Chairman. The irony is that America is already  leading the way for a cleaner environment, and we are leading by  example, not by words, by flowery words, fancy phrases, big speeches,  fear-mongering. We are leading by example.   And we are doing this not through Big Government solutions, one-size- fits-all, top-down mandates. We are doing it through innovation and  technology development in partnership with industry, and the results  are remarkable and measurable.   Greenhouse gases are down by 14 percent since `05, the rest of the  world up 20 percent; carbon emissions down 20 percent, the rest of the  world up; methane gas cut in half. Since 1970, all the six key  pollutants in the Clean Air Act, down 73 percent.   And this President is the only one who has put in a legally sound  greenhouse gas emissions standard that will reduce the coal power  plants' emissions by 34 percent of the levels they were at in 2005.   That is progress. Those are real results.   It is reckless and naive to bind taxpayers to international  agreements that compromise our freedom and our economic security and  virtually do nothing to impact the environment. Instead, we should put  forth solutions that encourage the continued development of all energy  sources while setting high but reasonable standards for environmental  quality in human health, and achieve those objectives not in hostility  to the energy source that has blessed us with all the things that I  have mentioned and not through abuse of Presidential powers, but in  partnership with States and other important stakeholders.   I urge my colleagues to support this very important amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1515
