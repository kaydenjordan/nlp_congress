 Madam President, I thank the leader, who is my friend  and colleague, Chuck Schumer, for his kind words.   I thank Senator Durbin, who is here, as well, and I thank all the  Members.   I see my friend Senator Fischer. We team up on the Strategic Forces  Subcommittee.   Of my friend Senator Grassley, not everybody knows Senator Grassley  has relatives who are spending eternal rest in Michigan City, IN, which  is not too far away from where I live.   To everybody who works here--to the incredible team that makes  everything go and to all of our pages who have done such a wonderful  job--it has been such a privilege to serve in the U.S. Senate. What an  unthinkable thing for a kid to have a chance to do. To actually be here  takes your breath away. Our Nation is so extraordinary, such a  wonderful place. The trust we are given to represent our people is  something that we take so seriously.   To the whole team, nothing we do could ever be done without your hard  work, and the effort we have put in to be part of that is something I  will never forget. I just say thank you. Thanks to everybody here. It  has been such a privilege.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
