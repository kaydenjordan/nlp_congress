 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, last month, I visited Israel and the West Bank. I talked  to Israeli Defense Forces leaders; Israeli settlers; members of the  Knesset from many parties; U.S. Ambassador Friedman; Palestinians' top  negotiator, Dr. Saeb Erakat; human rights activists; and ordinary  Israelis and Palestinians.   My trip left me more committed than ever to seeing, in my lifetime, a  two-state solution: a democratic Jewish state living in peace alongside  a democratic Palestine. That is why I am here today.   My colleagues have spoken a lot about the need to safeguard Israel's  security, and that is also why I am here today. We are at a moment when  the prospects for a peaceful two-state solution--something that has  long had overwhelming bipartisan support in this country and from  Presidents from both parties--could be fading. If we let them fade,  prospects for lasting security in Israel will fade as well.    Because, make no mistake, without a two-state  solution, Israel's future as a secure democratic homeland for the  Jewish people will be in jeopardy. And Israelis, like the ones I  visited in Netiv HaAsara, will continue to live in fear of rocket fire  that gives them 8 seconds to reach a bomb shelter.   We need to express our support for a two-state solution, and I thank  the chairman and my colleagues, Representatives Lowenthal, Bass, and  Connolly, for their leadership.
