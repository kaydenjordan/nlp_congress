 Mr. Speaker, the 2016 borrower defense rule created a  process for student loan borrowers to demonstrate that their loans did  not need to be repaid due to their school's misleading, fraudulent, or  otherwise illegal conduct.   Many of those that closed their doors left thousands of students with  no credible recourse. Instead of working to protect students and  taxpayers, however, the Education Secretary and the Department have  repeatedly sided with these bad actors.   By rewriting the borrower defense rule to favor those institutions,  the Secretary has made it harder for borrowers to get relief and  shifted the cost of providing debt relief from the schools to the  taxpayer.  [[Page H221]]    Several independent reports have concluded that this rewrite is  fundamentally rigged against defrauded borrowers, depriving them of the  opportunity for assistance promised them under the Higher Education  Act. According to an analysis based on the Department's data, the  changes to the financial triggers in the 2019 rule will result in  institutions repaying only 1 percent of the eligible loan debt.   Mr. Speaker, I have led three institutions of higher education. The  Secretary has created a bureaucratic nightmare. Even I, after reading  the regulation carefully, could not figure out all the information that  was necessary to apply for relief.   The Federal Government should be putting students and taxpayers first  rather than helping financially irresponsible schools stay afloat.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 20,000 students in my State are currently seeking  relief because they were cheated by predatory colleges. I did not come  to Congress to protect corporations that seek to take advantage of low- income students, veterans, and taxpayers.   Until we take a definitive stance on for-profit schools, they will  continue to defraud students.
