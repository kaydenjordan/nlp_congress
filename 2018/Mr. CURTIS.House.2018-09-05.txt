 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my friend and  colleague, Mr. Yoho, on the floor today with others to speak in support  of this bipartisan bill, H.R. 5576, the Cyber Deterrence and Response  Act. I would also like to give a special thanks to Foreign Affairs  Committee Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their support of  the bill and moving it through the committee process.   Mr. Speaker, more than 30 nations are currently developing offensive  cyber attack capabilities. Earlier this year, the Director of National  Intelligence testified before Congress that Russia, China, Iran, and  North Korea posed the greatest cyber threats to the United States. He  continued and said work to use cyber operations to achieve strategic  objectives will continue ``unless they face clear repercussions for  their cyber operations.''   This bill puts in place those clear repercussions for nations that  have and seek to continue to use cyber attacks against the U.S.  Specifically, the legislation authorizes the President, acting through  the Secretary of State, to designate, where appropriate, foreign  persons or agencies as critical cyber threats.   The bill also authorizes both travel and financial sanctions of  individuals and agencies designated as critical cyber threats, and the  legislation requires Congress to be briefed periodically on state- sponsored cyber activities against the United States.   This bill will help us better protect America's critical  infrastructure, national security, healthcare, energy, financial,  transportation, and communication systems from hostile state-sponsored  cyber attacks.   Additionally, the legislation is important to help us better protect  American companies and manufacturers from hackers and cyber intruders.                                time  1415    And maybe most importantly, H.R. 5576 will provide more tools for the  U.S. to deter state-sponsored efforts to attack our democratic  institutions and electoral systems.   I urge my colleagues to support me in voting in support of the Cyber  Deterrence and Response Act of 2018.
