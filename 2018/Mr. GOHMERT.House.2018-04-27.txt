 Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to speak here, and  especially to follow friends--very dear friends--hear  Steve King talk  about the importance of life.   I know there is historical accounts in the Old Testament when it  talked about different kings and what went on while they were there. It  normally says something like: ``and he did evil in the eyes of the  Lord,'' or ``he did right in the eyes of the Lord.''   And every now and then, there is an addition to emphasize just how  evil the people were. A society was under a particular king in Israel,  and that addition was whenever--now and then, it would mention that  mothers and fathers were sacrificing their babies on the altar of some  idol.   And only if you believe the Old Testament, like the majority of  Americans have for all our history, that ought to be quite an awakening  when you realize that we have killed over 60 million babies.   I have talked to so many women who are brokenhearted, and they have  got to learn to give it up and move on, but it eats away at them, the  thought that they allowed a precious life to be taken that nature had  entrusted them with. So, anyway, I just hate to see any women eaten up  with guilt.   And it is not because there is a pro-life movement. It was there long  before a pro-life movement. I hope that we can get the Heartbeat bill  that my friend  Steve King was advocating, I hope we could get that  passed and get it to the Supreme Court.   Some of the rulings over the years have had to do with the ambiguity,  the vagaries in at what point an abortion was no longer allowed. But  any of us, if you see someone hurt and you want to find out if they are  alive, you run up and you check. And if you find a heartbeat, then you  call an ambulance--you call 911 and ask for an ambulance. If there is  no heartbeat, then you report a dead body, and there is no lifesaving  effort at all made if there is no heartbeat.   So I thought it was brilliant to have an approach like that. There  are still some vagaries as to when a child first starts feeling pain in  the womb, but there is no question, if you have on videotape evidence  of the heartbeat, you see it, you hear it, then that is not so obscure  that even some of the dense heads at the Supreme Court would be able to  realize, yup, that is proof positive, that is hard, objective proof  that there is a life and being worth protecting.   So I really applaud and join in with my friend  Steve King's efforts,  and we hope that even the last holdout pro-life groups, the National  Right to Life, would get onboard. Most of us here that are pro-life, if  we hear that there is any bill that will save innocent lives, we get  onboard; count me in; I want to be part of it; I want to support it. So  it is really intriguing when we have a bill that will save lives, even  more than bills that that person or that group is already sponsoring.   And if anybody holds back, I don't know--there is not a good reason  for holding back, and hopefully, it is not just for selfish reasons.  Because the real pro-life folks, we support anybody's bill. We don't  care. If one of my Democrat friends bring it, it doesn't matter. If it  is a good bill, we want to be there for it.   I have just finished filing, just moments ago, a new bill, and it has  come over a long period of time--agonizing. Especially having been a  felony judge, handled major civil litigation as well, and then having  been briefly a chief justice of a court of appeals, when I see judges  that are so immoral and outrageously unconstitutional that they become  monarchs in their own little kingdoms, and they refuse to follow the  Constitution like I did--I wanted to legislate. I disagreed with laws  that existed, and especially some Federal laws that existed, so when my  term was up, I didn't--the Governor offered to appoint me to another  appeals position, and I said: ``No, I want to legislate.''   And to legislate, I have to run for office to do that as a  legislator. So I ran for Congress, and it was--it required financial  sacrifice of basically everything my wife and I had, except our home  and our cars, but, hopefully, before long, we will finish paying off  our kids' college loans. They shouldn't have to pay them because,  before I went on the bench, we had money set aside to deal with that.   But in the major financial adjustment from what I was making to what  I made on the bench as a judge, that was part of the sacrifice, and I  didn't want my kids to have to suffer--my wife and I didn't--because I  chose to be a public servant.   But coming to legislature, here is the way you legislate. And we have  too many judges that have not only been legislating, but on the issues  of immigration, asylum, naturalization, DACA, we have had judges become  all three branches. To me, that means they need to be removed from  office--just removed. They need to be impeached and removed from the  bench.  [[Page H3739]]    Doing that much damage to our constitutional system of restraint, of  checks and balances, they have blown away all the checks and balances,  and the only check on them, they think, ought to be in a higher court.   Unfortunately, we have people on the Supreme Court that are violating  the Constitution, violating their oath, which, of course, would be a  basis for removal. But they have become legislators, and anyone who can  read, can read the Constitution and see where the power is on  naturalization, immigration: it is in the Congress.   And there are certain executive powers that are newer to the  executive branch, to the President--through the President to the  immigration authorities, and we have judges that have usurped executive  power, congressional power. And Congress has given certain authority to  the President that we have the power to do.   And then to have judges come in and make national security decisions  when they have a fraction, a tiny, tiny fraction of the information  needed to make adequate national security decisions, that is why the  Constitution did not put national security decisions in the hands of  the courts.    So under our immigration laws that Congress had full authority to  pass and did, immigration courts were set up. Now, I had quite  significant concerns when I realized that Eric Holder, as Attorney  General, then Loretta Lynch, they appointed all of the immigration  judges without any other confirmation requirement. They just could pick  them, and they served. That was a bit alarming.   And in previous legislation, I had assurances that my concerns would  be fixed and we would come up with a way to confirm immigration judges.  We still don't have a consensus on that. But nonetheless, in view of  some of the decisions in recent days where a district judge in a small  district in the United States, one little district in one State decides  a national security issue for the whole country, it is outrageous.   Putting this Nation at risk because of their constitutional  violations, which means their violations of their oath--and I agree  with my friends here in Congress that say it is time to start bringing  those people--I believe my friend, Jeff Duncan, was mentioning it  earlier today. It is time to bring judges like that before our  Judiciary Committee and vote to impeach them for violating their oath,  violating the Constitution. Violating an oath is, I think, quite a  significant charge in and of itself. It is a crime. But we have got to  do something to rein in the runaway judiciary.   You know, the Founders, numerous of them had commented the judiciary  will be the least threat to our checks and balances because they will  have the least power. But somehow, all these years later, since 1789,  when the Constitution was ratified, the judicial part of our government  has become really the biggest threat to checks and balances, to the  constitutional restraints on power, which means they are a threat to  our ongoing representative form of government.   So we obviously have to have quick decisions, quicker than have been  made, regarding immigration status. And of course, the judges that Eric  Holder and Loretta Lynch appointed had no problem at all saying: Okay.  Here is your notice. We are not going to restrain you. You can go  wherever you want, but come back in 4 years for a hearing.   And, of course, most of them never came back. And many of them, turns  out, they have gotten taxpayer IDs so they can file tax returns, not  for the purpose of paying more tax, but so that they can get back more  tax than they paid in by claiming a bunch of children.   There have been TV stations and others that have looked into specific  claims and found there is some places where there would be one house,  dozens of kids would be allegedly in that house being claimed as  dependents, and different families claiming dependents, but there is no  telling how much.   I am sure it is billions of dollars that have been paid out to people  illegally in the country for claiming that they have children. Some  have been found. Okay, they had children, but they were in Mexico or  Central America, and yet we are paying them for being here as illegal  aliens, and not just through earned income tax credit--or the child tax  credit, rather, but also for all kinds of benefits that they sign up  for and get--food stamps, right on along the line.   But in order to stop one little district judge in one remote part of  the country from deciding national security issues that put American  citizens at risk, it is time to do what constitutional law professors  have talked about for years--maybe not in some Ivy League schools where  they don't really teach the Constitution. They teach how to avoid the  Constitution.   But as my constitutional law professor, David Guinn, used to say at  Baylor Law School, there is only one Federal court, tribunal of any  kind that owes its existence to the Constitution, that is the Supreme  Court. Every other Federal court owes its existence and its  jurisdiction to the United States Congress. Now, that is the  Constitution.   So, as some have said, Congress has the power to bring courts into  the world, and we have the power to take them out. We have the power to  say: This is your jurisdiction, and no more, or you will take on this  area.                                time  1345    So we created immigration courts. We do need them, and we have to  have them make decisions much more quickly. That is one of the things I  am so grateful to Jeff Sessions for. He is appointing great immigration  judges. They are making decisions as quickly as possible, so they don't  leave people in limbo for years, like was done in the past 8, or prior  to the Trump administration. So he is making progress there.   But since Congress clearly has the power to set the jurisdiction for  every Federal court tribunal of any kind, then it is time to do what my  new bill--and I just got the number, and I appreciate the clerk's quick  and efficient efforts--but this now will be H.R. 5648. It says:         To amend title 28 of the U.S. Code, to provide for Supreme       Court original jurisdiction over certain immigration actions,       and for other purposes.    Here is what it says on page 2:         The Supreme Court and any immigration court established       under the immigration laws, as such term is defined in       section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, are the       only courts that shall have jurisdiction in which a claimant       shall have standing to raise issues of immigration,       naturalization, refugee status, asylum, and any other related       matter or case involving a claimed right to enter or remain       in the United States, or any case or controversy of any       provision of the immigration laws, or any order issued or       rule made pursuant thereto.    In other words, we need to end these runaway rapscallion judges who  got through a confirmation by hook or crook and showed their real  colors when they got out on the bench that they want to be little  monarchs. It is time to rein in their jurisdiction so they can do no  further damage to this Nation to our national security, which was never  placed in the hands of the judiciary, it was always to be in the hands  of the President and the Congress.   I hope we can get plenty of cosponsors and bring that to the floor. I  really believe that, in this election year, if we can get that to the  floor and pass it here in the House, then, in this election year, there  could be so much pressure brought to bear on Senators down the hall.   We ought to be able to get it passed. It may be a long shot, but it  was a long shot that the little 13 colonies could take on the most  powerful country in the world, the most powerful Navy, the most  powerful Army in the world, and win their independence, but they did.  That is the hope that springs internal in the human breast. We have to  start somewhere, and that is a start.   Now, it took me weeks to get it done, but I have written an article  recently. Giving attribution, there are many other articles and sources  I used in accumulating these 48 pages. But after standing up a number  of times in our conference and pointing out to the Republicans in  conference that any Republican who says they know Robert Mueller will  be fair or come to a fair decision or a fair conclusion or be just,  they don't know the Robert Mueller I know. Here is where you get into a  lot of different opinions, but that is where it is helpful to look at  things that he has done in his life.  [[Page H3740]]    I had hoped that, because he seemed clearly to be a person who should  never have accepted the job of special counsel, that he was recusable.  He was not qualified to be the special counsel on anything involving  Russia, and certainly not the Trump campaign and Russia. Yet Rod  Rosenstein, as the deputy AG, who had been involved in the Russia  illegal attempts to gain control of U.S. uranium--and they knew that  Russia was committing crimes to try to get our uranium--and Mueller was  the head of the FBI, and he was the lead law enforcement person  overseeing the operation, there was an informant within the system that  was providing information to the Justice Department to Rosenstein and  Mueller. Yet they put the kibosh on the investigation and the crimes  that were being committed to get U.S. uranium. If they had not, then  the sale of U.S. uranium that would end up in the hands of Russia would  never have been allowed to go through.   CFIUS that approves sales that are sensitive to our security, they  surely could never have approved the sale if Rosenstein and Mueller had  just been honest and open that there is an investigation to Russia's  illegal attempts to get our uranium. But, if they had spoken up about  that, I don't think there is any question that the Clinton Foundation  would never have gotten $145 million in contributions from people  involved with the uranium sale. And it is quite likely that Bill  Clinton would not have gotten $500,000 to speak for 20 minutes from  Russia.   But I have written an article, 48 pages, entitled: ``Robert Mueller:  Unmasked.'' You can go to my website. You can go to Sean Hannity's  website, or others. I wouldn't do it on Google because of their  dishonesty when it comes to conservatives. But DuckDuckGo. Bing is not  as bad as Google. But look up ``Robert Mueller: Unmasked'' and download  this article, read it, and arrive at your own opinion.   This week, I found an article I had not seen before, by Eren Moreno,  back in January of this year, entitled ``Mueller, Rosenstein, and  McCabe Exposed Covering Hillary's Uranium One Scandal.'' At the end of  the article, they reference a succinct recitation of things that have  occurred. We don't know who this person is. He has used an anonymous  name. But here is the thread. He says: ``As we now know, the DOJ have  indicted a Mark Lambert on 11 counts related to his role in a bribery,  money laundering, and kickback scheme.''   Involving the sale of our uranium that would end up in Russian hands.   So they finally indicted somebody over this. There have been others  who have been quietly handled, and they are referenced here.   And they reference an article here from the New York Post. It says:  ``Exec charged with bribing Russian official in uranium deal. There's  an indictment in the FBI probe of the Uranium One scandal, in which the  Obama administration cleared a business deal that gave a Russian  company control of 20 percent of the U.S. uranium.''   ``Background and reminder: from at least 2008, Robert Mueller's FBI  were investigating Tenam, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Tenex, a  subsidiary of Rosatom, the Kremlin's (Putin's) energy company. The same  Rosatom that purchased Uranium One.''   ``Tenam was importing Russian uranium into the U.S. Between 2004- 2014, the local manager, Mikerin, engaged with U.S. companies Transport  Logistics (TL) and NexGen Security in a racketeering, wire fraud,  bribery, and money laundering scheme.''   ``When a TL insider, William Campbell, blew the whistle on what he  was seeing, Mueller's FBI started an investigation that led to at least  four indictments by Holder's DOJ.''   ``Remember--the Tenam investigation is related to the Uranium One  (U1) sale. That's because the Tenam investigation was hidden from  Congress and CFIUS''--the group that analyzes and approves or  disapproves foreign investments in the U.S.--``who approved the U1 sale  in October 2010. If either had known about it, it's highly unlikely the  U1 sale would have been approved.''   ``And the more you analyze the Tenam investigation, the more it  appears that the Obama administration and/or Clintons deliberately  wanted it hidden. Consider.''   ``William Campbell--the whistleblower. . . . `'   He is the one who was providing information to Mueller's FBI about  the illegal acts of Russia.   Now, there are times that the witness wants witness protection, wants  to be anonymous, and doesn't want anybody to know who he was, or who  she was, and so for those reasons of the informant's safety it is not  given. But that was not the case.   Mueller at the FBI, the DOJ took a very unusual step. Instead of  preventing others from knowing who this person was, they went after  William Campbell and made him sign--under threat that they would come  after and prosecute him--made him sign a nondisclosure agreement.  Incredible.   They didn't want--Rosenstein, who is the U.S. attorney over the  investigation--they didn't want Campbell out telling about all of the  crimes committed in Russia's acquisition of U.S. uranium. They have  their own informant sign a nondisclosure agreement under threat so he  wouldn't let anybody know about all the criminality surrounding  Russia's efforts to get our uranium. That doesn't make sense, unless  you know how much money came into the Clinton Foundation after the deal  was approved.   This goes on. It says: ``Now consider this--none of the four  indictments ever saw the light of day.''   Actually, that is not quite accurate. They just handled it very  quietly. It says: ``Every one was either quietly settled under plea  agreements, or dropped entirely, as follows.''   ``Mikerin, the Tenam manager, was sentenced to 48 months under a plea  deal, for crimes that had 20-plus year sentences.''   That was in: ``United States of America v. Vadim Mikerin--Original  Indictment 11/12/14. Conspiracy to Interfere with Interstate Commerce  by Extortion . . . Forfeiture.''   Darren Condrey had a plea agreement regarding his violations of  antibribery and conspiracy laws.   Carol Condrey had a plea agreement, and her case was dropped.   Rubizhevsky from NexGen had the case settled with a plea agreement.  That is astonishing given the charges.   This stinks to high heaven. Mueller needs to go ahead and recuse  himself and step down, and Rosenstein should do the same thing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 59 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday, May  1, 2018, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
