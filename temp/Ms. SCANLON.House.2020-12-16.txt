Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2174, the Missing Persons  and Unidentified Remains Act, a bipartisan measure aimed at assisting  State and local governments to locate missing people and identify human  remains.   This bill not only authorizes grant funding to States and localities  for such purposes, but it also improves the Federal Government's data  collection procedures and expands Customs and Border Protection's  response to the tragic rise in migrant deaths along our southern  border.   These changes bring much-needed financial relief to local  jurisdictions nationwide and provide a modicum of dignity and  consolation to the families of those who have perished.   Sadly, there is a pressing need for this legislation. The process by  which States and localities and law enforcement agencies must tackle  these issues exacts a financial and emotional toll. When remains are  found, their identification by State and local law enforcement and  medical examiners, often supported by crime and forensic laboratories,  provides decedents and their survivors with dignity and respect.   But bringing closure to these families is costly. State and local  entities must transport, preserve the remains, perform autopsies,  attempt DNA testing, and conduct forensic examinations. These tasks can  be particularly burdensome on small jurisdictions that often have to  rely on State support to carry out these complex tasks.   That is why the grant program that this bill authorizes is so  important. While the need for this support is greatest along our  southern border, the grant funds authorized by S. 2174 will support  jurisdictions nationwide to carry on this critical work.   S. 2174 also contains a number of provisions that will strengthen the  Federal Government's efforts to identify missing and unidentified  people. Notably, the bill would create a bridge between States and  localities and a Federal database to help match reports of missing  people with unidentified remains.   Importantly, the bill authorizes Customs and Border Protection to  install up to 170 self-powering cellular relay rescue beacons along the  southern border that will help stranded migrants call for help should  they find themselves injured or in need of emergency services.   A broad coalition of stakeholders have endorsed S. 2174, including  the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies; the League of  United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC; and the Christian Life  Commission. This broad swath of support speaks to the need for the  legislation and bolsters the bipartisan nature of the bill.   I want to thank Representative Vicente Gonzalez for his leadership on  this issue and his tireless work on behalf of his House companion to  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the assistance provided by this bill will help bring  peace of mind to the families of missing persons by taking meaningful  steps to improve the identification of remains.   I applaud the bipartisan and bicameral support for this bill. I thank  Representatives Gonzalez and Hurd for their efforts in the House, as  well as Senators Cornyn and Harris for championing the bill in the  Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill  today, and I yield back the balance of my time.
