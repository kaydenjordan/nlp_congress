 Madam Speaker, China is plotting a government-backed  digital currency which will be used to survey and manipulate financial  activities of its citizens and to crack down on dissent. A central bank  digital currency, known as the digital dollar, poses significant  privacy and government surveillance concerns.   Republicans have been clear that the Federal Reserve does not have  the authority to issue a digital dollar without an act of Congress. The  United States shouldn't have the ability to build and test one behind  the scenes either.   Right now the Federal Reserve is contracting with the private sector  to build digital dollars far beyond what we considered traditional  research. That is why I introduced H.R. 3712, the Digital Dollar Pilot  Prevention Act which closes this loophole.   Make no mistake, government-backed digital dollars are not about  innovation; they are about control. We must stop the Fed's current  development dead in its tracks, and my legislation does exactly that.                            ____________________
