 Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Shalala for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the bill we are debating today, in some ways I am  reminded of a Clint Eastwood movie. We have some good, some bad, and  some really ugly. But this bill gives consideration for fiscal year  2021 appropriations, as the gentlewoman from Florida just outlined:  State and Foreign Operations, Agriculture, Food and Drug  Administration, Interior, Environment, Military Construction, and  Veterans Affairs Administration.   It is appropriate that we are considering these bills. The fiscal  year ends on September 30, and we need to provide funding for the next  fiscal year; and without the appropriations bills, that doesn't occur.    But we never did a budget this year, and since we never did a budget,  House Democratic leadership decided to go without a budget. The only  budgetary reference we can make is to the Bipartisan Budget Act of  2019, which did include spending limits. But, unfortunately, today,  many of those limits are going to be jettisoned.   So division A of this bill appropriates $65 billion for State and  Foreign Operations, including $8 billion in cap-exempt Overseas  Contingency Operations funding and $10 billion in emergency coronavirus  funding. Funding is continued for important global programs to support  maternal and child health; combat AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria;  contribute to vaccine administration; and for the PEPFAR program.   Funding to the northern triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala,  and Honduras is provided to help those countries create economic  opportunities for their citizens, reduce violence, and strengthen the  rule of law. The Secretary of State is required to certify that these  countries meet certain conditions before 50 percent of that funding can  be obligated.   The good news is they have made some recent progress, but we are  obligated to continue the oversight of taxpayer-funded foreign  assistance to ensure that the citizens of the recipient countries, the  citizens, are benefiting and that we are effectively working to combat  the drivers of illegal immigration. It is unfair to ask our taxpayers  to have to subsidize this activity twice.   However, this division also prohibits the use of funds to implement  the Mexico City policy, which requires nongovernmental organizations to  certify that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a  condition of receiving United States funds. It also removes conditions  that promote transparency and accountability at international  organizations, including the World Health Organization.   We know that China withheld information from the World Health  Organization. We know that that contributed to the excesses of the  global pandemic, under which we now suffer.   It is disappointing that these partisan provisions were included in  this bill. We could have had a bipartisan bill to provide for the  American people. The poison pill provisions virtually guarantee that  that will not be the case.   The Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration division  appropriates nearly $24 billion in discretionary funding, $487 million  over the fiscal year 2020 level. In the midst of a global pandemic, it  is critical that our Food and Drug Administration be fully funded and  staffed to stand at the ready to process applications for medical  countermeasures as they are developed, things such as therapeutics and  vaccines against this novel coronavirus.   The bill continues to fund the FDA Innovation Account. This was part  of the 21st Century Cures Act and the various user fee arrangements  that have proven to be so successful. But, again, you have to have  concerns about the attempts to include authorizing language in the  appropriations bill, issues that authorizing committees have not yet  debated.   One of the issues is giving the FDA mandatory recall authority.  Currently, manufacturers typically recall products if the FDA requests  that they do so, because if they fail to act on a voluntary recall,  guess what? Big liability for them.   But the FDA also has other tools to keep a product off the market.  The section of code that this appropriations bill seeks to amend is  specific to controlled substances, which may not be an appropriate  place to incorporate such a policy.   Future considerations of such policies should happen within the  committee of jurisdiction, which would be the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.   Agriculture is the lifeblood for many American families, especially  in rural communities. This coronavirus pandemic has greatly impacted  our Nation's food supply, and this bill works to strengthen food  security and promote agricultural research. That is good.   As communities continue to work through the ``new normal'' we are  experiencing, with many people working from home and remote learning,  efforts to bolster rural broadband are, indeed, critical.                                time  1145    Once more, rather than simply providing for the American people, this  bill includes language that would permanently prevent any  administration--Republican or Democrat--from making changes to the  Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. This policy would result  in working age, nondisabled adults without children not being required  to seek employment in times of low unemployment in order to seek  benefits. When we are in the  [[Page H3710]]  middle of a national emergency, flexibility is appropriate. However,  the administration should not be permanently barred from making the  program more beneficial to both the recipient and the taxpayer.   Next, division C of this bill includes provisions that ensure that  our Nation's environment and public lands are preserved for future  generations. These funds will be used to combat invasive species,  mitigate harmful algae blooms, stop the trafficking of endangered  animals. They will also provide essential resources to maintain our  Nation's national park system.   Unfortunately, the bill threatens the advancement of fundamentally  pro-business and pro-worker policies. It adds unnecessary barriers to  administrative efforts to reduce regulation. Eliminating bureaucratic  red tape will be the key to unlocking future economic growth, which I  would submit is still important.   Division C also threatens the continued development of America's  energy resources, thus its energy independence and the thousands of  jobs tied to the energy sector. Specifically, it prohibits Federal  funds to be used for oil and gas sales on Federal lands and offshore  leases in Federal waters. These projects are important to America's  economic recovery, they are important to America's national security,  and they are important to America's energy independence. We, in the  House, should not be limiting the economic opportunities in the middle  of a global recession.   Division C of this bill contains many important provisions, but it is  pro-regulation and anti-energy in ways that will harm our economy and  thus hurt jobs throughout the country.   I would last like to discuss the Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs division. As a historically bipartisan committee, I am grateful  for the support that the committee has provided for important veterans'  programs, particularly in veterans' health and military construction,  and for prioritizing military family housing.   We have learned during the past couple of Congresses about the  unacceptable condition of private military housing that is part of the  military housing privatization initiative. Some reforms were included  in last year's National Defense Authorization Act, and my hope is that  we can continue the funding and the oversight necessary to ensure that  our Armed Forces and their families feel safe in their homes on their  bases.   Although I agree with and support the veterans' healthcare programs,  I am encouraged by the robust mental health programs and the opioid  abuse prevention and treatment assistance included in the bill, it is  also a time when we must be at least cognizant of where the Federal  Congressional Budget Office estimates are taking us with the budget  deficit exceeding over $3.7 trillion for this fiscal year. So I do  share some of the other Members' concerns on designating the $12.5  billion as emergency funding and disregarding the Bipartisan Budget Act  of 2019. Again, we are functioning without a current congressional  budget in this session of the House. Why do we even work on spending  caps in the first place if we are only going to ultimately disregard  them for partisan priorities?   Furthermore, I have serious concerns regarding provisions which would  restrict funds for military construction projects, specifically a  prohibition on funding for any type of border barrier. These  restrictions unfairly jeopardize our military's safety and well-being.  We are in the middle of a global pandemic. Mexico agreed to limit  border crossings with the United States. So legal and illegal entries  have been significantly reduced, limiting unexpected coronavirus  transmission to domestic cases. Despite our best hopes, coronavirus  cases are increasing, particularly along our southern border and our  southern States. Now is not the time to restrict the ability of the  President to act to further protect the country.   Last, I would like to note report language that presents pro-life  concerns. The language grants flexibility to the VA without pro-life  protections, thus including abortion referrals for those referred to  outside care resources for services not provided by the Department.   Again, this appropriations package incorporates many provisions that  both Democrats and Republicans can agree on. But it disregards the  Bipartisan Budget Act agreement and includes poison pill policy  provisions that, frankly, I will find, and many Republicans will find  difficult to support.   I hope my Democratic colleagues will come to the table and negotiate  so we don't abandon the American people as the end of the fiscal year  approaches.   With that, I urge opposition to the rule, and I will reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a valuable member of our Republican House  leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to sanction any senior foreign official who  conceals information about the outbreak of a pandemic, including this  current coronavirus pandemic.   We know that China delayed reporting what they knew about this  coronavirus. They withheld information from the World Health  Organization and attempted to silence doctors, silence researchers who  had alerted local health authorities.   China's continued attempts to avoid national humiliation resulted in  a pandemic that has killed well more than 600,000 people globally. It  is unacceptable, and we must hold China accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Curtis), my good friend, to speak on the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we really do not have time to waste. Not only must we  provide for the American people, but we have the added responsibility  of continuing to fight and recover from the coronavirus pandemic.   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will see the  futility of passing purely partisan appropriations bills. That being  said, there are provisions included in this bill where we can all  agree, and I hope we can sit down and negotiate with the other side so  we can prevent a disruption at the end of the fiscal year for the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, ``no'' on  the rule, ``no'' on the underlying measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
