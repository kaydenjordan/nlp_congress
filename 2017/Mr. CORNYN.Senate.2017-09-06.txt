 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it has been 1 week since Hurricane Harvey  hit the State of Texas, and although the rain has now stopped, the  damage continues, as much of the water that has moved through Houston  is now moving downstream to rivers and bayous and areas south of  Houston. People's lives are still being disrupted, and unfortunately  more and more bodies are being found, as the water has receded in  places that have been flooded. Eight days ago, Harvey's wrath was still  being felt.   Of course, we are still counting the cost, and, as one lady in  Houston told my staff, ``Normal is a long way off.'' It is more than  just days we are counting, though. As families return to their homes  and piece their lives back together, the numbers keep rolling in.  Numbers are how we keep track, and I want to mention a number of  numbers that I think will help all of us understand the magnitude of  what has occurred and will help us wrap our heads around what this  disaster has meant for not only Texas but for the country.   The largest numbers are the toughest--not the toughest to swallow,  and I will get to those in a moment, but simply to comprehend. They are  the ones that make your jaw drop.   Twenty-seven trillion--that is the number of gallons of rain that  Harvey pummeled on Texas and Louisiana.   Then there is 2.7 million--that is how many liters of water have been  provided to Texas by FEMA as of last Friday. Don't forget that parts of  the city of Beaumont are without drinking water or are subject to a  boil notice for 7 more days.   There is another number: 1 million. That is the number of cars  reportedly destroyed by the storm--1 million cars.   Forty thousand--that is the number of homes Harvey permanently  wrecked. At least that many people are still, even today, in shelters,  living off of cots at convention centers, inside government-funded  motel rooms, or living with friends and family.   Next come the middle batch of numbers, slightly smaller and more  manageable sums. Some of these actually come as a relief. Some of them  remind  [[Page S4976]]  us why writer Walker Percy, a native of our neighbor Louisiana, used to  say that hurricanes, as terrible and life-altering as they are,  sometimes give us hope--because they draw people closer together as  neighbor helps neighbor.   Four thousand two hundred--that is the number of pounds of flour  employees went through at El Bolillo restaurant in Southeast Houston.  The bakers were trapped inside their kitchen for 2 days during the  storm, so what did they do? They did what bakers always do: They baked.  In this case, they baked up pan dulce--traditional Mexican pastries-- for flood victims. Their ovens were on all night for their neighbors.  One young girl on Twitter praised the Bolillo bakers as ``angels.''  They gave people what they needed most, perhaps, during this storm, and  that is a sense of normalcy.   Two thousand seven hundred thirty-one--that is the number of cattle,  horses, and sheep which various ranchers and helicopter pilots, like  Ryan Ashcraft, have saved in places like Brazoria County and which are  now inside makeshift stables in fairgrounds and parking lots. Animal  rescue has been a crucial and difficult part of the equation in  communities affected by the storm. Of course, in the shelters Senator  Cruz and I visited, they had to make accommodation for pets because  people wouldn't leave their cat or dog in the floods. They wouldn't  leave unless they could bring their animal with them. They have had to  make some accommodation--and they have--which made it easier for people  to leave their flooded homes.   Then there is another number: 200. That is the number of soaking-wet,  stranded Houstonians Jim McIngvale and his staff rescued in their  delivery trucks. Most of us from Texas, and especially from Houston,  know Mr. McIngvale as ``Mattress Mack.'' He is in the furniture  business, and he opened up his giant furniture showrooms as shelters.  They provided portable showers and an inventory of brand-new beds and  sofas for folks who had nowhere else to sleep.   Getting rest couldn't have been easy, though, not when so many  displaced people were still thinking about the storm and its  consequences, still feeling the dampness in their clothes and  remembering the pounding rain and wondering what they were going to do  to get on with their lives.   One hundred thirty-two--that number represents the speed in miles per  hour of the most punishing wind gusts recorded in Port Aransas on  August 25. It is hard to imagine the power of the wind attacking homes  and structures--eight times faster than a charging bull.   In the days ahead, we need to remember just how strong the storm  really was. I brought a few charts to help remind us of that and the  aftermath.   This is a picture outside of Houston. I visited a synagogue in a  place called Meyerland in the Houston area where they have literally  been flooded 3 years in a row. This is one of the members of that  congregation, and she invited me to come to her home so I could see all  the damaged drywall, furniture, and other items on her front lawn which  have now been pulled out of her house.   Finally, we come to the last set of numbers, the smallest ones but in  many ways the most painful, the hardest to forget, numbers like 45,  which is the angle in degrees of bent electric poles I saw in Rockport  when I toured the destruction after the storm last week. Other  electrical poles lay on the ground. The town smelled of gasoline and  even natural gas leaks, which we smelled in the Rockport area. Of  course, the ground was littered with broken glass and strewn books and  things like that. Boats in the marina had been tossed about and  smashed, their sails ripped to shreds, as local residents had mostly  fled. Here is another picture of that damage in Rockport, TX.   Harder still, though, is the number 25, which is the years Andrew  Pasek lived before he tragically stepped on a live electrical wire in  ankle-deep water on August 29. A resident of Houston, Andrew was an  animal lover, and he was trying to locate and save his older sister's  cat when he stepped on this electrical wire and lost his life.   We, of course, offer our condolences to all of those families who  have lost loved ones, including Andrew's, in their time of grief, and  we pledge to remember him and all of the flood victims in our prayers.  Sadly, Andrew was joined by 59 others who lost their lives. As I said  earlier, that number continues to grow each day as the waters recede  and as we find people who did not leave their homes, perhaps because  they were elderly and unable to get out, living alone, for example. So  we expect that number to, sadly, get even higher.   Six is the number of family members Samuel Saldivar lost when a van  he was driving was tossed by a strong current into the bayou. As with  Andrew's family, our thoughts and prayers go out to Samuel during what  I am sure has been a dark and trying week, one nearly impossible to  make sense of.   But for each story of loss, each family that is hurting, there are  many other reasons for hope as we embark on what is a long road to  recovery.   Consider five--the number of bed-ridden, elderly patients from  Cypress Glen Nursing Home who required special boats to get them out,  boats with generators that could power their life support assistance.   We are grateful for Good Samaritans like Dan LeBlanc from Port  Arthur, Doug Barles, Jr., and Robert Bode for managing this operation,  which was no easy task. Here is a picture of those gentleman.  Volunteers with no special expertise in search and rescue, these  gentleman saved more than 100 patients.   Finally, the number I will end with is zero. That is the amount of  complaining done by a gentleman named Jim Rath who exemplifies the  Texas spirit. His house was destroyed in a flood 2 years ago, and he  had just finished rebuilding it when Harvey hit and destroyed it again.  Was he shaken by this course of events? Well, sure, he was. But did he  complain? No, he did not. Of all his lost possessions, Mr. Rath said,  ``The main thing is: This is just stuff.'' Then, like other Texans are  doing now, he rolled up his sleeves. With saws and jackhammers, they  are already moving forward.   Zero is also the amount of time we have to waste here in Congress.  The Texans I know aren't just sitting around waiting for the government  or for government aid, but that doesn't mean we should twiddle our  thumbs here in Washington, DC. We have to act. That is why I am working  with Senator Cruz and the entire Texas delegation in crafting an aid  request that addresses flood relief but without imposing burdensome  mandates or regulations. As Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street  Journal this week, this measure needs to be tight and specific. She  said:         There should be no larding up or loading it down with       extraneous measures. This is an emergency.    But that means we have to act and act with dispatch.   I applaud the House of Representatives for moving quickly today to  approve an initial $8 billion downpayment on disaster relief, and I  urge my colleagues in this Chamber to follow the House's lead and  expedite passage for this first tranche, this downpayment on what will  surely be a more expensive list of costs. We are going to continue to  work with Governor Abbott and the team back in the State to make sure  the Federal, State, and local actors are all on the same page. But  right now, let's quickly send Texas a downpayment. Let's show that we  are actually serious.   I was gratified by the outpouring of emails and texts--even the  Presiding Officer reached out, and I appreciate that--from people  expressing their concern about what was happening in Texas. I  appreciate that very much. But now we need to demonstrate that those  weren't just words and follow them up with concrete action.   As we all process the numbers from the storm, I believe the important  one today is zero--the amount of time we have to lose.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
