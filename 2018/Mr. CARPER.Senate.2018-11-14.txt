 Mr. President, I rise in response to a unanimous consent  request from my good friend, the senior Senator from Tennessee, to  consider the nomination of John L. Ryder of Tennessee to be a member of  the board of directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, known as TVA.  As I mentioned in Mr. Ryder's confirmation hearing, I have long  encouraged TVA to be an industry leader in the power sector, not a  laggard, especially when it comes to clean energy and energy  efficiency. While I am not prepared to object to Mr. Ryder's nomination  at this time, I am quite concerned about TVA's handling of the December  2008 Kingston Fossil Fuel Power Plant coal ash spill clean-up efforts  and would like to say a few words about my concerns.   Last week, a Federal jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern  District of Tennessee found that the contractor used by TVA to clean up  the coal ash spill, Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., did not adhere to  worker safety or health requirements, potentially causing sickness and  death. Although TVA was not on trial, there were troubling testimonies  from workers that called into question TVA's conduct during and after  the clean-up efforts. The court decision allows for the families of the  workers affected to seek compensation for medical treatments and  damages. To date, reports show that over 30 Jacobs Engineering Group  workers have died since working on the Kingston coal ash clean-up  efforts and 250 workers are sick.   In his nomination hearing, I called on Mr. Ryder to commit to ensure  TVA is a good actor in regards to the Kingston Fossil Fuel Power Plant  coal ash spill and is transparent to the employees and families that  are or may be affected by this issue. He promised me he would do so.  However, I want Mr. Ryder and my colleagues to be on notice that I will  be working on this issue as an oversight matter and will make sure all  the members of the TVA board and the entire workforce at TVA are good  actors when it comes to this issue. Thank you.                            ____________________
