 Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Gun  Violence Survivors Week, a time when we remember the tragic and life- altering impact of the gun violence epidemic that continues to affect  thousands of families across the country.   Every year, 36,000 Americans are killed by gun violence and 100,000  Americans are injured. In my city alone, an average of 765 people die  of gun violence every year.   Too many families have been touched by this violence. Too many young  people go to school afraid. Too many Americans live in fear.   Last night, the President's State of the Union only mentioned  firearms once. And instead of presenting a plan, it defended the NRA.   We owe it to every survivor and to everyone who has been touched by  gun violence to do more than hold a moment of science or post a hashtag  on Twitter. We owe the American people real action.                            ____________________
