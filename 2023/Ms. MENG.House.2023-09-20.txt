 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand in solidarity and speak  in support of our autoworkers who are currently on strike.   Working men and women are the backbone of this Nation, and their  desire for job security, for fair wages, and to simply be treated  fairly is something that every working individual deserves.   During the 2008 great financial crisis, these workers sacrificed pay  and benefits during a time of desperation to help keep their companies  afloat. Now, long after these corporations have bounced back, they are  making record profits that they refuse to share with their own workers.  That is unacceptable and wrong.   These workers have ensured that key industries that make our country  run stay functioning. In return for the billions that they have  generated, all  [[Page H4434]]  they want are wages and benefits commensurate with their company's  success. That seems fair to me.   I am proud to stand alongside the thousands of autoworkers that this  contract covers, and I hope an agreement is reached soon.
