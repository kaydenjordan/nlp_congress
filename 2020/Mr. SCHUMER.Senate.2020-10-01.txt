 Madam President, before I get into the subject of this  pending vote, I do want to thank my colleagues from Illinois and  Connecticut for bringing this important topic before the Senate.   President Trump's refusal to condemn violent White supremacist groups  in the Presidential debate has been around for several days. We have  hardly heard anything out of most of our colleagues, and no one--no  one, no one--is going to buy the argument that it came too suddenly.  White supremacy  [[Page S6014]]  hasn't come too suddenly. The President's remarks have been out there  for several days. It is the flimsiest of excuses to avoid criticizing  the President even when every American of decency--the overwhelming  majority of all Americans--would know he should be condemned.   They don't care if you are a Democrat or a Republican or are liberal  or conservative. You never know how low President Trump can go, but his  refusal to condemn White supremacy is among the lowest things he has  done, and--boy, oh, boy--there are lots of them lined up. I am ashamed  of my Republican colleagues and ashamed--for America, for decency--that  they have chosen to block this                                   S. 4653    Madam President, now, on another issue of great importance to  America, the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court  has thrust the issue of healthcare back into the spotlight. Her  confirmation to the highest Court in the land could put healthcare for  hundreds of millions of Americans at risk.   As you would imagine, taking away healthcare is deeply unpopular with  the American people. So it seems the strategy from the Republican  majority is to invent some new distraction--a fresh outrage--to talk  about. My colleagues on the other side would rather talk about anything  besides the fact that their President, their party, and their Supreme  Court nominee pose a dire threat to Americans' healthcare.   The outrage from the Republican leader was directed today, once  again, at the idea that the Democrats would attack a nominee's  religious beliefs, but of course, in their zeal to manufacture this  issue, the Republican Senators began telegraphing this line of attack  even before the nominee had been named. One Republican Senator wrote me  a letter to warn against anti-Catholic attacks that hadn't happened yet  against a nominee who had not been named. That is how transparent this  Republican diversion--ruse--is.   It appears the Republican majority will crank up the outrage machine  to any level of absurdity to avoid talking about America's healthcare-- the healthcare that so many Americans desperately want and need. In  fact, all week, the Republican leader has mocked the idea that a far- right Supreme Court majority might strike down the Affordable Care Act  and that Judge Barrett might play a decisive role. Of course, President  Trump promised to nominate Supreme Court Justices who would terminate  the Affordable Care Act, and he picked Judge Barrett. Those are the  President's words. He is only going to pick Justices who would  terminate the Affordable Care Act, and it is no mystery why he picked  Judge Barrett.   In both major cases brought against the ACA, Judge Barrett twice  sided against the law. She publicly criticized Justice Roberts for  upholding the law and said that, if the Supreme Court were to read the  statute the way she does, they would have to ``invalidate it.''  President Trump: ``terminate it.'' Judge Barrett: ``invalidate it.''  Guess what. President Trump and Republican attorneys general are in  court right now, suing to do just that--invalidate our healthcare law  in a case that will be heard 1 week after the election.   The threat to Americans' healthcare is very, very real, and Senate  Republicans are tying themselves in knots in trying to explain how it  is not. Leader McConnell, from the floor of the Senate, called it a  joke--a joke--that Judge Barrett and the far-right majority of the  Court might vote to take away healthcare or to turn back the clock on  women's rights.   Maybe he didn't get that message around to his conference, because  the Republican Senator from Utah, only a few days earlier, claimed that  the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional and that striking it down  shouldn't tarnish Judge Barrett if that is what she chooses to do.   Another Republican Senator said he wanted to see evidence that the  nominee understood that Roe was wrongly decided, that Roe was an act of  judicial imperialism, and I do believe Amy Coney Barrett's record bears  that out. That was his quote.   The junior Senator from Missouri expressed confidence that Judge  Barrett believes Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. On the Supreme Court,  a Justice Barrett could enforce that view.   So which is it, Republican leader? Is it absurd to think that Judge  Barrett might strike down the Affordable Care Act, or is it a good  thing that shouldn't tarnish her reputation?   Is it a joke that Judge Barrett could curtail women's fundamental  rights, or are Republican Senators relieved to think that she thinks  Roe v. Wade is judicial imperialism?   Americans are starting to get pretty sick of these double standards  and mealy-mouthed talking points--pretty sick of politicians who, just  4 years ago, declared they couldn't possibly confirm a Democratic  nominee to the Supreme Court in the early months of an election year  but are now rushing to confirm a Republican nominee in the middle of an  election that is already underway. Most of all, pretty sick are  Republicans claiming they support protections for Americans with  preexisting conditions while, at the same time, they support a lawsuit  that would eliminate them.   Well, we are about to put a few of these Senate Republicans on the  record. Soon, the Senate will vote on a bill that, if passed, would  protect the healthcare of hundreds of millions of Americans and prevent  efforts by the Department of Justice to advocate that courts strike  down the Affordable Care Act. I was able to move this measure to the  floor despite the fact that Republicans didn't want it, and now we will  have a vote.   Will Republican Senators vote to stop President Trump's Justice  Department from spending taxpayer dollars trying to eliminate the  taxpayers' healthcare? We will see very shortly.   If Senators truly want to support protections for Americans with  preexisting conditions, they would vote to damage President Trump's  legal effort to eliminate them. It is as simple as that.   No amount of sophistry or explanation is needed. Yes or no?   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given a chance to  finish my remarks in the next few minutes.    Thank you, Madam President.   It is as simple as that. Are they with the people who want protection  or not, or are they standing with President Trump, who wants to destroy  it? It is that simple, because if President Trump and the Republican  lawsuit are successful, every single American stands to lose vital  healthcare protections or access to care. Millions of Americans would  see drug costs skyrocket. Tens of millions of families would lose  healthcare coverage during the worst health crisis in a century. More  than 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions would lose vital  protections, including every American who contracted COVID, which would  be treated as a preexisting condition. Women would see their country  hurtle backward to a time when they could be charged more than men for  insurance simply because they are women.   This vote, which I was fortunate enough to obtain, will show America  which party stands with protecting Americans' healthcare and  protections for preexisting conditions and which party opposes it.   It is plain and simple. Are you with Leader McConnell, who wants to  rip away people's protections? Are you with President Trump, who wants  to wound our American healthcare by eliminating ACA? Are you with the  American people, who desperately need these protections? Are you with  the mother or father whose son or daughter has cancer and the insurance  company says ``You are not getting any insurance,'' or are you going to  require that company to give them the insurance that family so  desperately needs?   The eyes of America are on this body and on Republican Senators right  now. Whose side are you on--President Trump's or the American people  who want healthcare?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
