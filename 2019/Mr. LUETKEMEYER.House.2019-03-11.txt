 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1122, the Housing Choice  Voucher Mobility Demonstration Act of 2019.   As currently administered, housing vouchers often are insufficient in  helping American families get access to neighborhoods with greater  opportunities. That is why H.R. 1122 is so important.   A strong body of research shows that growing up in a safe, lower- poverty neighborhood with good schools improves children's academic  achievement and long-term chances of success, and may reduce  intergenerational poverty.   A recent groundbreaking Harvard study found that young children in  families who used housing vouchers to move to better neighborhoods  fared much better as young adults than similar children who remained in  extremely poor neighborhoods.   The Harvard study found that young boys and girls in families who use  a voucher to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods were 32 percent more  likely to attend college and earned 31 percent more as young adults  than their counterparts in families who did not receive an MTO voucher.  Girls in families who moved to lower-poverty neighborhoods were also 30  percent less likely to be single parents as adults.   And let us not forget that location also affects adults in many ways,  such as access to jobs, the cost of getting to work, the feasibility of  balancing child care responsibilities with work schedules, and other  basic goods and services.   Voucher mobility is key to enabling families with children to move to  safer neighborhoods with less poverty, thereby enhancing their chances  of long-  [[Page H2620]]  term health and success. H.R. 1122 will provide the foundation for many  of these key changes.   I thank Mr. Duffy and Mr. Cleaver for their hard work in looking into  this issue and providing evidence-based solutions to affect positive  change in families and communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1122, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my support for the bill.   I thank Mr. Cleaver for his personal testimony today. It was very  compelling. It is a tremendous story of success in the use of these  things and how changing our neighborhoods can really be helpful.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 974, the Federal Reserve  Supervision Testimony Clarification Act, an important bipartisan bill  that will provide Congress greater oversight of regulation and  supervision at the Federal Reserve.   The Vice Chairman for Supervision of the Federal Reserve exercises  and oversees the Board's supervisory and regulatory authority over a  variety of financial institutions and activities. This role is  imperative to promote a safe, sound, and stable financial system that  supports the growth and stability of the U.S. economy.   This bill before us today will ensure that the Federal Reserve will  come forth and testify before Congress on issues relating to the  supervision of financial institutions, giving added transparency to the  American people, as well as increasing the Fed's accountability.   The issues overseen by this position are of high importance to the  American people and our financial system. It is crucial that we have  the ability to hear testimony and ask questions of the Federal Reserve  on these complicated issues.   I would like to thank Congressman Gottheimer for sponsoring and  Congressman Lucas for cosponsoring this much-needed legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Lucas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1414, the FinCEN  Improvement Act.   This bipartisan piece of legislation passed the House by a voice vote  last Congress. I am happy to see that my colleague, Congressman  Riggleman of Virginia, has joined Congresswoman Wexton in reintroducing  it this Congress.   This is the first piece of cosponsored legislation Congressman  Riggleman had on the floor, and the fact that it focuses on terrorism  speaks directly to his past service in the Air Force and his continued  effort to protect the American people from bad actors. Mr. Speaker, I  thank him and Congresswoman Wexton for leading this fight to protect  the American people.   H.R. 1414 outlines how the terror landscape in our post-9/11 world  has expanded.   Now, we are tasked with protecting the American people not only from  traditional threats posed by groups like al-Qaida abroad, but also  domestic terrorism, where crimes are committed on U.S. soil by both  foreign and U.S. persons.   H.R. 1414 mandates that FinCEN focus on all forms of terror, not just  foreign terror campaigns. This is a commonsense update to the statute  that would bring added clarity to our antiterrorism laws.   H.R. 1414 also strengthens FinCEN by ensuring cooperation with Tribal  law enforcement agencies and the prioritization of virtual currencies.                                time  1630    Illicit actors have been found to be using virtual currencies because  of their ability to provide anonymity. Some virtual currencies have  been shown to frustrate law enforcement's efforts to link transactions  to people or IP addresses.   It is for this exact reason that FinCEN needs to be able to allocate  resources and manpower to investigate and thwart instances of terrorism  that involve all forms of virtual currencies.   Mr. Speaker, it is our sworn duty to protect the American people, and  H.R. 1414 allows FinCEN to adapt its investigative abilities to prevent  terrorism in our digital age.   Again, I thank Ms. Wexton and Mr. Riggleman for their leadership, and  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Riggleman), one of our outstanding freshmen from the  freshman class of this past fall.    Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my support for H.R. 1414,  the FinCEN Improvement Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
