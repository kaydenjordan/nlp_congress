 Mr. Speaker, we face a housing crisis in our country. In  metro Detroit, there are three extremely low-income renter households  for each unit that is both affordable and available.   In response, State and local public developers are using innovative  policy  [[Page H5990]]  tools to build new housing developments that are financially  sustainable and affordable.   That is why I co-led the introduction of the Public Housing for the  21st Century Act, which provides public housing authorities and housing  finance agencies with the latest best practices for mixed-income public  housing.   While Federal subsidies have long been insufficient to address the  housing crisis in our country, Mr. Speaker, the Public Housing for the  21st Century Act would ensure that communities have access to the  latest models and policy options, creating a pathway for real  affordable housing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please join me in promoting  housing access in every single district across our Nation by  cosponsoring this bill.                Rhetoric Incites Violence Against Palestinians     Mr. Speaker, Hisham, Kinnan, and Tahseen are all  Palestinian college students who were shot while wearing a keffiyeh and  speaking Arabic on their way to a family dinner in Vermont.   Just weeks ago, a 6-year-old Palestinian-American child, Wadea, was  stabbed 26 times in a hate crime in Illinois. They had to take the  knife out of his body.   Mr. Speaker, the constant dehumanization of Palestinians has real  consequences. It is fueling anti-Palestinian racism and violence. The  dehumanization and rhetoric repeated by many elected officials, many in  this Chamber, is inciting violence against Palestinians.   My heart goes out to every family affected by violence, Islamophobia,  anti-Palestinian racism, and any form of hate.   One of the Palestinian victims who was shot in Burlington, Hisham,  wrote: ``This hideous crime did not happen in a vacuum. As much as I  appreciate and love every single one of you here today, I am but one  casualty in this much wider conflict.   ``Had I been shot in the West Bank, where I grew up, the medical  services that saved my life here would likely have been withheld by the  Israeli Army. The soldier who shot me would go home and never be  convicted. . . . Any attack like this is horrific, be it here or in  Palestine.   ``That is why when you say your wishes and light your candles today,  your mind should not just be focused on me as an individual but,  rather, as a proud member of a people being oppressed.''   When I talk about Hisham, Kinnan, and Tahseen, I think of my two  Palestinian boys living right here in the United States.                     Remembering William ``Bill'' Goodman     Mr. Speaker, today I recognize my friend William ``Bill''  Goodman, a true people's lawyer who never wavered in his pursuit of  justice.   I met Bill over 15 years ago when he was president of the Maurice and  Jane Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice. He was a mentor  of mine and so many movement lawyers and a hero to those who sought  justice.   Over the course of his career, Bill sought to focus his work on the  protection of civil liberties, holding the powerful accountable to the  Constitution, and fighting for the working class at home and around the  world. He was always ready and willing to fight for the most vulnerable  among us.   Bill was a pioneering people's lawyer, both in private practice in  Detroit and leading the Center for Constitutional Rights and the  National Lawyers Guild.                                time  1030    He was proud of representing the Attica prisoners, the Guantanamo Bay  detainees, the Vietnam survivors of Agent Orange, and so many victims  of police violence and corrupt persecution.   It speaks to Bill's character that one of the most important lawyers  in American history will best be remembered by those close to him and  for his endless jokes and bottomless love for his children and  comrades. Please join me in honoring Bill Goodman and remembering his  life and legacy.                            ____________________
