 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  engage in a colloquy with my colleague from Missouri.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                   Congressional Baseball Practice Shooting     Madam President, I come to the floor today, along with my  colleague the Senator from Missouri, as the cochair of the bipartisan  Law Enforcement Caucus. We have come to express our concern and our  gratitude.   This morning our colleagues and our friends, including Congressman  Steve Scalise from Louisiana, were senselessly attacked while at a  practice in Alexandria for tomorrow's annual bipartisan congressional  baseball game.   Our deepest thoughts and prayers are with the members of the Capitol  Police and Congressman Scalise and everyone who was injured, as well as  their families.   While we still don't know all of the details of this morning's event,  one fact is true. Were it not for the skill, bravery, prompt response,  and professionalism of the Capitol Police and Alexandria police, this  tragic event would have been much, much worse.   For those of us who serve and work every day in Congress at the  Capitol, we see the men and women of the Capitol Police. They protect  the Members of Congress, our staffs, and the Capitol itself, but that  doesn't begin to describe the vital and noble work they do, because the  Capitol Police don't simply protect the people in the buildings on the  Capitol campus. They protect, they serve, and they honor our Capitol,  our country, and our democracy itself. They sacrifice and they risk  their lives each and every day to ensure that this Capitol is a Capitol  for the people, a Capitol for every man, woman, and child in the United  States. It is the Capitol Police, in close and important partnership  with local police, who ensure that everyone and anyone can come to this  place to make their voices heard and to take part in our democracy.   They make these sacrifices and take these risks every day, and this  morning's events are a sobering reminder of what the men and women of  law enforcement all across the country--and yes, today, here among the  Capitol Police--take on each and every day.   I urge everyone who works and serves here in the Capitol to take a  moment to pray for and be grateful for the men and women of the Capitol  Police, the men and women of the Alexandria police, and the men and  women of law enforcement all across the Nation.   With that, I yield to my colleague from Missouri.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the chance to work  together to lift up in a bipartisan way the men and women of law  enforcement and to express our prayers and our gratitude for the men  and women of law enforcement--for the Alexandria police and everyone  who serves in our entire Nation to help keep it safe and secure.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
