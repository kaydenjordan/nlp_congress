 Mr. Speaker, our country is in a crisis, and the  American people are looking to Congress for action and leadership. That  is why I stand in support of the CARES Act, which provides our workers,  small businesses, healthcare workers, and so many more in California's  39th District the relief they need.   Whether it is to provide PPE and medical equipment to our healthcare  workers, financial support for our workers without jobs, or resources  for our small businesses, Congress is taking significant steps to help  our communities.   At the same time, we are enforcing strict oversight to prevent secret  bailouts and ensure that those on the front lines of our global  epidemic come first.   While the CARES Act throws a lifeline to our workers and our economy,  we will need to do more. There is not a single community across the  United States that hasn't been affected by the coronavirus in some way.  That is why our next stimulus package must provide direct funding for  our cities and towns with less than 500,000 residents.   Although we have had to be physically apart, our community and our  country have come together with the American spirit and determination  needed to help us get through this crisis.
