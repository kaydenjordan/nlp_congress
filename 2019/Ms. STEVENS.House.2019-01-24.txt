 Madam Speaker, I rise today for the people suffering the  consequences of this shutdown. I rise today for our great country and  for the belief in our great government. I rise for our neighbors, our  friends, and all our taxpayers.   The impact of this unprecedented shutdown, the longest in our  history, has had real and deeply concerning impacts on our families,  particularly in Michigan. It is also posing serious threats to our  national security and safety.   Tim Mach of Waterford, Michigan, a professional aviation safety  specialist, has been working diligently throughout this shutdown. He is  doing the best he can with the materials he has to ensure our airplanes  are safe, but he is unable to access the parts for the planes that are  damaged.   The longer this shutdown drags on, the more dire these types of  operations become. For the well-being of our public servants and the  safety of our country, the government must open today.   Madam Speaker, I rise today from this body as his voice, imploring  the less than 600 among us who have been elected to this Federal  Government to open this government now.                            ____________________
