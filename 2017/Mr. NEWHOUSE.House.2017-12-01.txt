 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sheriff Harvey  Gjesdal of Douglas County, Washington, for his significant  contributions to the safety of the constituents in the Fourth District  and to congratulate him on his recently announced retirement.   Sheriff Gjesdal has served in Washington State law enforcement for  over 30 years. He began his career in 1985, at the Garfield County  Sheriff's Office, and he spent 8 years in the Bellevue Police  Department before landing in Douglas County in 1995. He was promoted to  sergeant in 2000 and elected to his current position in 2006.   Additionally, he served in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve for 26 years,  where he was activated four times, including two tours in the Middle  East.   For the last 22 years, Sheriff Gjesdal has been promoting safety and  building strong relationships in central Washington. I am thankful for  his leadership and compassion, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  congratulating him on a successful career.                            ____________________
