 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Mr. Tom McCall of Elbert County, Georgia, for being elected president  of Georgia's largest general farm organization, the Georgia Farm  Bureau, on December 8. Tom replaces Gerald Long, who retired from the  position after serving as GFB president since 2016.   He has been a dedicated Farm Bureau member since 1978, and Tom's  first leadership role with the bureau was serving as the chairman of  the Elbert County Farm Bureau Young Farmers and Ranchers Committee. Tom  also represented Georgia Farm Bureau's second district on the GFB board  of directors and served as Elbert County Farm Bureau's president for  several years.   The foundation of his leadership skills was developed when he served  in the Georgia House of Representatives for 26 years. I was blessed to  serve alongside Tom for 5 years in the Georgia State House, so I can  attest to his dedication to improving the lives of his constituents and  his commitment to the State of Georgia.   His wealth of knowledge in agriculture contributed to his success  while serving on the Georgia House Agriculture and Consumer Affairs  Committee, and I know his continued commitment to improving agriculture  in the State of Georgia will allow him to thrive as Georgia Farm  Bureau's president.   I wish him the best as he steps up to lead farmers across Georgia,  and I know he will do a great job.                            ____________________
