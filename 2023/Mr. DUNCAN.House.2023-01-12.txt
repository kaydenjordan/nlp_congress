 Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentlewoman from  Washington on her chairmanship.   Before the Biden administration's war on American energy, America was  increasingly dominant in energy production producing a surplus--a  surplus.   Exceeding demand usually means that you can have lower prices because  you are providing supply that exceeds demand, and then when we have  more supply, we can export. We can export to our allies at prices that  actually compete with the OPEC cartel on the open market. That is what  American energy dominance can do.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to keep pushing  green energy initiatives such as wind and solar. I think those are  groovy technologies.   Guess what, Mr. Speaker?   You cannot export renewable energy. You can export oil and gas in  order to lower prices and increase stability for our friends in Europe  who are more reliant on Vladimir Putin for their energy.   Do you know what, Mr. Speaker?   For political purposes, President Biden sold off a strategic asset of  this Nation. He started dumping oil out of the SPR, the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, and put it out there so that China could buy it, and  China did buy it.   This is an American asset.   Do you know what, Mr. Speaker?   This bill that prohibits that oil from being sold to China and other  adversaries makes sense, but the Democrat talking points make none.
