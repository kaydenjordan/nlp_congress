 Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentleman from  Massachusetts, the American people cannot take this anymore.   And my good friend from Oklahoma, I know the compassion that he has.  We have worked together, as well as my friends from Ohio and Arizona.   But yesterday, I stood with the mayor of the city of Houston, and we  announced a mental health hotline for people being impacted by COVID- 19. Yes, the stress of COVID-19 is taking a toll on the American  people. They need relief.   A very proud, brave parent got up to talk about how difficult it is  to virtually teach her children while she works and how concerned she  was. Why? Because the mandate comes from on high--the White House--that  if you are not having your children in school in some form, meaning in  the buildings, because that is the decision she was grappling with,  then you don't get money.   They have no money. They have no money to have expanded buildings or  temporary buildings so that they can help parents who work have  children safely in school. They have no money for testing. They have no  money to be able to provide for sick employees from COVID-19.   So I rise today to say: The American people cannot take it anymore.  The stress is enormous. What we have done here is a very merciful  response to the bill we already passed, that our friends, conflicted  with each other and the White House, cannot seem to get a grip on.   I support $225 billion for education and childcare, $436 billion in  assistance to our State and local governments.   I thank Mr. McGovern for making it clear. Those are our municipal  workers. Those are police and fire, and we need it because who has  gotten sick? Police officers, firefighters. And we need this money.    Mr. Speaker, we need the testing. We are doing  testing on the last pennies of the money that we were granted through  the leadership, our Speaker and others.   They need testing. I will be in a stadium this coming week, trying to  get people tested. That is how much we need it.   Then, of course, $28 billion in procurement, distribution, education,  materials for the vaccine.   But I want to focus on the $600 for unemployment, the money for the  $1,200, as well as the money for rental and mortgage to prevent  mortgage foreclosure. The restaurant money, I want it for the  independent pizza shops who hire people, for the workers who are going  to be out of work, like airport workers or airline workers. The food  insecurity, people are standing on line to get food.   What don't my good friends understand? That people are desperate, and  they are in need?   I wish we were not discussing questions about white supremacy and  whether or not someone believed it or not. I wish we would stay focused  on getting this bill passed for the desperate people, no matter what  backgrounds they are.   I want to rise in enthusiastic support for this Heroes bill, H.R.  8406. Let's pass it now.                                time  1700     Madam Speaker, I rise because in the last day, I  feel compelled to speak about healing the Nation.   Through my years of service, I have been able to serve on a number of  committees and alliances in my Congressional district, in my city, in  my State, that brought people together.   I was chairperson of the Interfaith Ministries.   I participated in a campaign of No More Hate.   I have interacted with Muslims and Jewish communities alike.   Where the Nation is now is not where her values are. The Nation is  not taking the attention that is being given by the world because of  the rise of white supremacy--Boogaloo Boys, Proud Boys.   The Nation needs a healer and a unifier. We, as the American people,  are much better when we disagree and acknowledge our disagreement, but  we are unified around the values of equality and justice in this  Nation.   Those of us who want to improve police community relationships are  not antipolice and should not be seen as that. Black Lives Matter is  not a terrorist group. In fact, the terrorist groups have been  designated as white supremacists.   Let us unify and come together around the truth. I am ready to do so  to heal the Nation.                            ____________________
