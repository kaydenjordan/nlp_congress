 Mr. President, reserving the right to object,  unfortunately, even though the Senate has had multiple exposures to  nonsense ideas like this bill, they keep coming back.   Agencies like the CDC and NIH are already looking closely at the data  on COVID-19 infection and natural immunity; they have been since the  earliest days of this pandemic.   In an August ``Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' CDC actually  assessed data from Kentucky and found that out of a group of people who  had been infected with COVID before, those who were unvaccinated were  twice as likely to get COVID again than people who were vaccinated.   And a CDC report from October looked at multiple studies and  concluded that vaccinating people who were previously infected  significantly strengthened their immune response and reduced their risk  from COVID.   In other words, being unvaccinated puts you at higher risk of being  reinfected, period. Getting vaccinated is a necessary step to protect  you and to protect those around you.   And now our Agencies are focused on a new variant, as we know, that  appears to be spreading quickly throughout the world--Omicron.   We are in the middle of the deadliest pandemic in American history.  It has killed 785,000 people and counting. If we are going to end this,  if we are going to reopen our economy, if we are going to save lives,  we need to get everyone vaccinated when they are eligible.   We certainly don't need politicians suggesting they know more than  the experts and ignoring the data. We don't need bills meant to weaken  one of our strongest tools to get this thing behind us, like the one  that the Republicans have repeatedly been pressing for.   Workplace safety standards are nothing new in this country.  Immunization requirements are nothing new in this country.   And let's be clear. The emergency temporary standard OSHA has put  forward specifically provides employers the flexibility to offer  testing as an alternative to vaccination.   People are dying every day. Families are scared and they are tired  and they are angry that, even as they try so hard to do the right thing  so we can end this crisis, even after all the progress we have made to  rebuild our economy and get students safely back in our classes, get  people safely back to work, and get unemployment back to the lowest  level since before this pandemic started--all that progress, all of our  hard work is at risk of being undermined by bills like this.   Can Republicans please stop wasting our time trying to take us  backward and pretending they know more than the experts about this  disease? Is that too much to ask? I think not.   I object.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to request  unanimous consent to move qualified, uncontroversial nominees from the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.   I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 300, 348, 349, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420,  421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 484, 485, 569, 570, 571, 589, 590,  591, 592, 593, 594; that the nominations be confirmed and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record;  and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action  and the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I am sorry that we had an objection  because right now, the HELP Committee has more than 30 nominees who are  waiting on us to confirm them. These are qualified nominees, and they  should be on the job and working, overseeing critical parts of the  Department of Labor and the Department of Education, leading  independent Agencies, and serving in very important roles. We need to  confirm them so they can get to work on behalf of the American people,  especially as we continue our economic recovery. If we are going to  rebuild from this pandemic, we need all hands on deck.   Many of the nominees whom I just tried to move by unanimous consent  were voted out of the HELP Committee unanimously, and they have  bipartisan support. But now my Republican colleagues are holding up all  these nominations for manufactured reasons and in some cases, for  absolutely no reason at all.   That was, by the way, not our practice during President Trump's  administration or any other administration, and it should not be the  practice now.   Obstructionism is not helping anyone. All this does is make it harder  for Departments and Agencies to do their work and harder for our  families and our communities to get the help they need.   It should not be this difficult for the Senate to perform its  constitutional duty and confirm nominees who are qualified and  supported by both Democrats and Republicans. Republicans are blocking  or have delayed nominees who received support from every Republican on  the HELP Committee, nominees who received support from bipartisan  groups and who will serve in nonpartisan roles, and privileged nominees  who are supposed to be fast-tracked through the Senate as part of a  longstanding bipartisan practice, and that, by the way, includes a  former colleague of ours, Dennis DeConcini. Every one of these nominees  has gone through the full process and cleared the HELP Committee.   I am extremely frustrated that Republicans have blocked nominations  despite their clear qualifications, the history of fast-tracking  nominations like this in a bipartisan way, and most importantly, the  critical challenge we are facing and the work that families are  counting on all of us to get done. They have been blocking several  other critical, noncontroversial nominees my colleagues have been  pushing to confirm as well.   We have heard plenty of excuses from across the aisle, but all we  know is that there is no good reason for this. We know these are  qualified nominees. We know the work they are being blocked from doing  is important if we are going to rebuild our Nation stronger and better.  I want my colleagues across the aisle to know that we are not going to  give up on this side. We are going to keep pushing to get these  nominees confirmed so they can do their jobs and get to work for the  people and the communities of this Nation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 4 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.
