 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the U.S.  Department of Transportation to develop intercity passenger rail  corridors across our Great Lakes region from Chicago to Cleveland.   We in the Great Lakes noticed the attention that the Department of  Transportation pays to the East Coast and the West Coast, but please  don't forget our Great Lakes northern region.   Take a look at the I-80/-90 corridor and think about that already  being carved into the landscape. Use it.   In 2021, I joined other Great Lakes Members of Congress to urge  Amtrak to retool its connect on U.S. 2035 Plan, which then excluded  improvements to the Cleveland to Chicago corridor. To this day, we  continue to lack daytime passenger rail service across this highly  congested rail corridor and, of course, constricted Chicago. Boy, does  it need help.   Our constituents deserve better. Leaders from the U.S. Department of  Transportation; State, local, and regional Departments of  Transportation; planning agencies; advocacy organizations; labor  unions; and the private  [[Page H6067]]  sector have joined together to address this longstanding constriction  to economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, I ask DOT: Please see us, hear us, help us.                            ____________________
