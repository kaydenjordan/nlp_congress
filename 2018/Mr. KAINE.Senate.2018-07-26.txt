 Mr. President, I regret it is necessary to introduce  legislation that prevents a President from withdrawing from NATO. Our  allies with whom we have fought alongside since World War II and  earlier in some cases, are seriously questioning our allegiance for the  first time in the history of the modern international order. President  Trump has chosen to call our European allies ``foes'' while aligning  himself with a brutal and repressive authoritarian, Vladimir Putin,  over the professional assessment of the U.S. intelligence community.  Troubling news continues to flow from the President's disastrous trip  to Europe for the NATO summit and his meeting with President Putin in  Helsinki. And for the first time ever, we are forced to ask what  options we have to preserve U.S. membership in the primary tool of  peace and stability for the last 70 years, the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization.  [[Page S5427]]    In response to the only invocation of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty,  more than 1,100 servicemembers from our NATO allies have given their  lives fighting alongside the United States. This is a sacrifice that  should not be so easily cast aside by our President who continues to  inaccurately depict the alliance as a protection racket and  ``obsolete.'' While we must continue to press every country to continue  increasing defense spending to meet the agreed upon goal of 2 percent  of GDP by 2024, it is disconcerting to watch the President disparage  these allies and make threats to withdraw the U.S. from NATO.  Unfortunately, without action from Congress, this President might try  to terminate U.S. membership in NATO. For this reason, we must  affirmatively pronounce our legal position with regards to NATO, use  our constitutionally required power of advice and consent to block any  withdrawal and we must preemptively authorize legal proceedings to  challenge any future decision to withdraw.   This legislation I am introducing today along with Senators Gardner,  Reed, and McCain, is a bipartisan message to the President and the  necessary tool needed to block the President from terminating the NATO  treaty. It is the affirmative position of the United States Senate,  supported by this Bill, and previous resolutions passed by this  Congress, including and by the original vote of 82-13 in 1949 to give  the Senate's advice and consent to join NATO, that the United States of  America through their elected officials are unequivocally opposed to  the U.S. withdrawing from NATO. This legislation also asserts our  constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent to U.S.  membership in treaties. Just as the President sought and received the  advice and consent to enter into NATO, the President must also receive  the advice and consent to terminate treaty membership--especially when  such a decision would be at odds with the opinion of the Senate and the  American people. Finally, this Bill will authorize Senate Legal Counsel  to represent the Senate in challenging any decision to withdraw from  NATO and specifically grant Federal courts jurisdiction to consider the  case.   I am proud to have bipartisan support for this bill to ensure that  the opinion of the Senate is upheld and the safety of the American  people prioritized through our continued membership in NATO. I strongly  encourage my colleagues in both the Senate and the House of  Representatives to support this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I regret it is necessary to introduce  legislation that prevents a President from withdrawing from NATO.
