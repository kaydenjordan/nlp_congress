 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 534) to require the Secretary of State to take such  actions as may be necessary for the United States to rejoin the Bureau  of International Expositions, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 534         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``U.S. Wants to Compete for a       World Expo Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) is the       organization responsible for governing World Fairs and       International Expositions.        (2) Section 1(a) of Public Law 91-269 (22 U.S.C. 2801(a))       found that ``international expositions . . . have a       significant impact on the economic growth of the region       surrounding the exposition and . . . are important       instruments of national policy''.        (3) The United States has not been an active member of the       BIE since 2001.        (4) State and local governments and private entities in the       United States have continued to participate in international       expositions held in foreign countries as a means of promoting       United States exports and creating jobs, but face       significantly higher costs for such participation because the       United States is not an active member.        (5) State and local governments and private entities in the       United States have expressed interest in an international       exposition being hosted in the United States, but the bid of       a United States city, region, or State to host an       international exposition is unlikely to be successful if the       United States is not a member of the BIE.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States should rejoin the BIE immediately to       promote domestic job creation, global branding, and tourism       to the United States;        (2) the Secretary of State, in partnership with the       Secretary of Commerce, State and local governments, and       private and non-profit entities, should take all necessary       steps to facilitate the timely submission of a request to       rejoin the BIE; and        (3) funding for the participation of the United States in       international expositions or other events facilitated by the       BIE should continue to be privately solicited and sourced, in       accordance with existing law.       SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of State is authorized to       take such actions as the Secretary determines necessary for       the United States to rejoin and maintain membership in the       BIE.        (b) Authorization to Accept Private Contributions.--In       addition to funds otherwise available to the Secretary to       carry out this section, the Secretary is authorized to accept       contributions for such purpose.  [[Page H2830]]         (c) Notification.--The Secretary of State shall notify the       Committees on Foreign Affairs and Appropriations of the House       of Representatives and the Committees on Foreign Relations       and Appropriations of the Senate upon taking any action under       subsection (a).       SEC. 5. CONTINUATION OF PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS                     FOR WORLD'S FAIR PAVILIONS AND EXHIBITS.         Nothing in this Act may be construed to authorize any       obligation or expenditure prohibited by section 204 of the       Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations       Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 (22 U.S.C.       2452b) (relating to limitations on the obligation or       expenditure of funds by the Department of State for a United       States pavilion or exhibit at an international exposition or       world's fair registered by the BIE).    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 534, the U.S. Wants to Compete for a World  Expo Act. As always, I appreciate the assistance of the ranking member,  Mr. Engel, in expediting this legislation. I would like to commend two  of our body here, Mr. Tom Emmer and Ms. Betty McCollum. We thank them  and their Minnesota colleagues for their leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will enable American citizens and our  businesses and State and local governments to once again compete on an  even footing against foreign countries to host a World Expo here in the  United States. It does so by authorizing the Secretary of State to take  those steps necessary to rejoin the Bureau of International  Expositions. This BIE, as it is called, is the organization that  governs World Expos, and it determines which cities get to host such an  event.   The United States originally joined the BIE back in 1928, but it  withdrew from active membership in 2001. Unfortunately, the rules of  the BIE make it virtually impossible for bids from nonmember nations to  compete against bids from member nations. This bill will revise this.  It will reverse the longstanding position, and we can lend our support  to a recent surge of American interest in once again hosting a World  Expo in the United States.   Citizens from Minnesota have developed a comprehensive bid and are  actively competing against cities in Argentina and Poland to host the  2023 World Expo, but since these countries are BIE members, the U.S.  must rejoin the BIE in order for Minnesota to compete on an even  playing field when the BIE makes its recommendations to the selection  committee in May.   It is not just Minnesota that is interested in this. At least five  other U.S. States and cities are actively exploring hosting a World  Expo in the future, including Los Angeles and San Francisco from my  home State of California. These cities know that World Expos create  American jobs. They promote American exports. They enhance the image of  America around the world. Indeed, in November, the Departments of  Commerce and State submitted reports to the President certifying that  the Minnesota proposal was in the national interest of the United  States and had guaranteed financial support from State, from local,  from private, and other sources.   Members should know that U.S. law requires that the cost of hosting  or participating in a World Expo be funded entirely by private donors.  This bill does not change that. In fact, it reaffirms that requirement.  This bill also specifically authorizes the Department of State to  accept private contributions in order to cover any costs associated  with rejoining the organization. Indeed, the organizers of Minnesota's  2023 Expo bid have committed to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 534 in  order to once again give the American people the opportunity to host a  World Expo here in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two  letters of support for this bill. One is from the administration, and  the other is from ExpoUSA, the United States World's Fairs Council.                              United States Department of State,                                     Washington, DC, April 24, 2017.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Department of State appreciates       Congress' interest in facilitating the bids of states to host       international expositions. Not only do such events       potentially generate considerable economic benefits but they       also create ideal opportunities for showcasing American       commercial capabilities to interested international       audiences. This is consistent with the President's policy to       promote domestic job growth and American innovation.        As the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) is the       international organization responsible for selecting venues       offered by bidders, the chances of U.S. bidders being       selected would be greatly enhanced if the U.S. were to renew       and maintain its membership in the BIE. H.R. 534, the ``U.S.       Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act'', as amended, would       provide the needed permissive authority for the Secretary of       State to do so.        Further, the Department greatly appreciates the efforts of       Congress to ensure the bill is consistent with similar       authorizations. Insofar as BIE has advised of the need for       United States membership to be renewed by May 12, 2017, to       ensure timely consideration of the Minnesota Expo 2023 bid,       the Department urges that, if possible, the bill be passed       quickly. This will enable the Department to take the       necessary steps to renew membership, enhancing prospects that       state bids to host upcoming expositions will prevail. With       the U.S. membership within BIE,  [[Page H2831]]       costs for states to bid and host will be decreased by half       and provide long-term savings for U.S. businesses interested       in participating in future expos, both domestically and       internationally.        Finally, expeditious renewal of United States membership in       the BIE will return the United States to the decision-making       body for future World's Fairs and Expos, offsetting the       growing influence of other countries, such as China.        The Office of Management and Budget has no objection to the       views expressed in this letter.        Thank you for your consideration in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                Joseph E. Macmanus,      Bureau of Legislative Affairs.                                   ____                                          ExpoUSA, The United States                                           World's Fairs Council,                                                     April 19, 2017.      Hon. Ed Royce,      Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Ranking Member, House Foreign Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel: On behalf of       ExpoUSA and Minnesota's World's Fair Bid Committee, we write       in support of The U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act       (H.R. 534). This bill authorizes the United States to rejoin       Bureau of International Exhibitions (BIE), the organization       that coordinates World's Fairs, also known as Expos. Renewing       membership in the BIE will promote public diplomacy, U.S.       exports and travel and tourism. It will also ensure that U.S.       cities wanting to host Expos will have that opportunity to       compete against cities around the world. H.R. 534 has gained       bipartisan and national support.        While the U.S. has not hosted a World's Fair in more than       30 years, there's been a surge of local interest over the       past few years. Houston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las       Vegas, and Philadelphia have actively considered bidding for       future Expos, and the U.S. Government gave official support       for Minnesota's bid to host a World's Fair in 2023 focused on       health and wellness. After passing a rigorous review by the       United States Commerce Department, State Department, and the       White House, the State Department formally recommended       Minnesota's bid to the BIE. Minnesota will now compete       against Buenos Aires, Argentina and Lodz, Poland. Voting will       take place at the BIE General Council meeting in November       2017.        Under current rules, the BIE is required to discriminate       against bids from non-member countries if there are competing       proposals from member countries. Since Argentina and Poland       are BIE members, the U.S. must rejoin the BIE in order for       Minnesota to compete against these foreign bidders when the       BIE makes its recommendations to the selection committee in       May. Therefore, Congress must pass legislation authorizing       the Secretary of State to rejoin the BIE by May 13, 2017 in       order for Minnesota's bid to be viable.        Expos held in the U.S. are local initiatives that are       funded entirely by the private sector; therefore no taxpayer       money will be used to pay for Expo 2023. Additionally, if       Congress acts to rejoin the BIE, ExpoUSA stands ready to pay       the costs of BIE membership with private sector funds,       including membership dues both past and current, in order to       save money by reducing fees and to give Minnesota and the       U.S. a renewed voice in the BIE.        World's Fairs are the largest gatherings held on the       planet, generating billions of dollars in economic activity       for the region and country in which they are held. Expo 2023       will attract 12 million visitors, generating 22,000 jobs in       the upper Midwest region, paying an annual wage of $47,000,       and another 18,000 jobs nationwide in the tourism, travel,       and hospitality sectors. Total economic impact in the Twin       Cities metropolitan area will be $1.4 billion. International       visitor spending will total $581 million, and on average will       stay 6 days in Minnesota and another 5 days in other       locations around the United States.        We ask for your support in expeditiously moving legislation       authorizing the United States to rejoin the BIE.        Thank you for consideration of our request and for your       interest in helping cities like Minneapolis/St. Paul bid on       future World's Fairs.            Sincerely,      Mark Ritchie,        President and CEO, Minnesota World's Fair Bid Committee,       Board Member, ExpoUSA.      Manuel Delgado,        Chairman, ExpoUSA.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer). He is the author of this bill. He  has worked very hard preparing this legislation for passage.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer). He is the author of this bill. He  has worked very hard preparing this legislation for passage.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   World Expos are designed to showcase a nation's products, the  technology, the innovative spirit. And what nation on Earth produces  more innovative products and technology than the United States or has a  better or more skilled workforce?   Simply put, when Americans compete in the world on an even footing,  America wins. It is therefore in our interest to once again compete to  host a World Expo.  [[Page H2832]]    This bill does that by empowering our fellow citizens to mount  competitive private bids to bring a World Expo to the U.S., and it does  so while maintaining a sound legal requirement that participation in  Expos continue to be privately funded. It goes further to permit  private funding for the relatively modest cost to rejoin the BIE. That  is why this measure has the support of Members from both parties and  the administration, which has written that H.R. 534 is consistent with  the President's policy to promote domestic job growth and American  innovation.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this measure and give our  fellow Americans the chance to compete and win a World Expo for  America. I again thank the bill's committed sponsors, Representatives  Tom Emmer and Betty McCollum. I want to give a special thanks to Sean  O'Neill, a detailee on my staff, whose skill and dedication have made  today's consideration of this measure possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 534, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 187) relating to efforts to respond to  the famine in South Sudan, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 187         Whereas on February 20, 2017, famine was formally declared       in parts of South Sudan;        Whereas South Sudan is the world's newest nation and for       the past three years has experienced an ongoing armed       conflict and the deliberate hindrance by the Government of       South Sudan of humanitarian access to opposition communities       in need;        Whereas due to this deliberate action on the part of the       Government of South Sudan and the armed opposition to prolong       the conflict South Sudan is experiencing a ``man-made''       famine currently affecting 100,000 people;        Whereas according to the United States Agency for       International Development (USAID) food insecurity is already       prevalent in South Sudan and the ongoing conflict is       exacerbating the situation;        Whereas the United Nations has reported that 4,900,000       people, over 40 percent of the population, are in urgent need       of food, agriculture, and nutritional assistance;        Whereas there are 1,900,000 Internally Displaced Persons       (IDPs) residing in South Sudan and according to the United       Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) an average of       approximately 2,400 South Sudanese refugees arrive in Uganda       every day;        Whereas 1,000,000 children in South Sudan are suffering       from malnutrition in part due to the deliberate actions of       the Government of South Sudan, at the same time according to       United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund       (UNICEF) there are more than 17,000 child soldiers forced       into combat;        Whereas an anticipated 5,500,000 people are at risk for       starvation by mid-year and without urgent humanitarian       intervention civilians will continue to die from acute       malnutrition and millions more will remain at risk;        Whereas failure to act prior to the upcoming rainy season       May to August, will further impede humanitarian efforts;        Whereas the areas where famine has been declared have seen       some of the most intense fighting;        Whereas USAID has been a leading provider of humanitarian       support to South Sudan, including more than 620,000 tons of       life-saving food assistance since the conflict broke out in       2013; and        Whereas support provided by the Food and Agriculture       Organization of the United Nations (FAO), UNICEF, and the       World Food Program have been critical in reducing the number       of civilians at risk of severe malnutrition: Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--        (A) the Administrator of the United States Agency for       International Development should continue to provide       immediate and robust assistance to respond to the famine in       South Sudan by providing food and other essential resources       and to collaborate with international relief organizations,       such as World Food Program and others in an effort to reach       vulnerable populations; and        (B) the Administrator of the United States Agency for       International Development should be encouraged to continue to       provide desperately needed and locally appropriate food aid       through the Food for Peace and Emergency Food Security       Programs; and        (2) the House of Representatives--        (A) calls upon the Government of South Sudan to declare and       observe a cessation of hostilities to allow food and       essential supplies to reach affected civilians;        (B) urges specifically that the Government of South Sudan       allow immediate and unrestricted humanitarian access to       southern Unity, where the famine is currently underway;        (C) condemns all threats and violence against civilian       populations and aid workers, including the over 70       humanitarian aid workers killed since the conflict began and       the brutal attack by the South Sudanese military on       humanitarian aid workers, including Americans, at the Terrain       Camp in July 2016;        (D) condemns the multiple instances in which security       forces have looted humanitarian assistance destined for       civilians in need; and        (E) supports effort of the United States Government,       working with partners in the international community,       including the United Nations, the African Union, and the       European Union, to facilitate humanitarian access to affected       areas, and encourages greater diplomatic pressure on the       parties to return to the negotiation table to stop the       violence, and to allow full humanitarian access.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in July of 2011, all of us here celebrated the  establishment of the world's newest nation. Finally, South Sudan had  emerged after more than 20 years of brutal suppression by the  government in Khartoum and a war that saw some of the worst human  rights atrocities of our time. They emerged out of that.   Tragically, though, the celebration was short-lived. By December of  2013, a long-simmering rivalry between two leaders--South Sudan's  ethnic Dinka President and ethnic Nuer Vice President--exploded in  violence, and South Sudan became embroiled in yet another deadly civil  conflict.   Today, over 100,000 people are starving to death; 5.5 million  people--half of the population--are at risk of starving by July; and  3.6 million people have been displaced by conflict and famine with  7,000 newly displaced South Sudanese crossing the Ugandan border each  and every week.   In February, famine was declared in two of the areas that have  experienced the heaviest fighting.   Let's be clear: the famine unfolding across South Sudan is completely  manmade. The leaders who have unleashed this horror upon the citizens  that they are meant to represent--Salva Kiir and Riek Machar--have  plundered billions of dollars in oil revenues and donor investment,  manipulated ethnic tensions, and armed proxy militias. They have, as we  can share with you, recruited child soldiers, killed U.N. peacekeeping  forces, and forcibly displaced millions of their citizens--civilians  who have been run from their homes.   Lifesaving humanitarian supplies have been looted by the government  and by the opposition. The government has blocked humanitarian access  through bureaucratic manipulation and through sheer brute force.  Humanitarian workers have been deliberately targeted. They have been  abused, raped, and murdered with impunity. Yes, humanitarian workers.  South Sudan is now the most dangerous place in the world for  humanitarians.   It is also the most dangerous place for their own citizens because  they are treated the same way by these two so-called leaders. And those  South Sudan leaders have, in effect, become exactly  [[Page H2833]]  like the government in Khartoum that their people fought against for  decades.   This is appalling. This is unconscionable. It cannot stand. Congress,  working with our Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, and  many other concerned countries, must make sure those who bear  responsibility for this calamity are held to account through sanctions  and other tools.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the  ranking member of the Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations Subcommittee, for introducing this timely  and important resolution, which seeks to bring attention to the  humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in South Sudan, because in South  Sudan it gets worse by the day. It has not mattered what arguments we  have brought to bear against the President and the Vice President. Many  world leaders and many of us have had these arguments face-to-face.   This resolution makes clear that the U.S. Agency for International  Development should have the flexibility to tailor their response by  using market-based food aid where appropriate, and U.S. commodities  where needed. We need to ensure that food is not being used as a weapon  in this civil war, and flexible food aid can help.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this resolution and, more  importantly, in continuing to demonstrate the compassion of the  American people through lifesaving humanitarian assistance. Deep,  arbitrary cuts to U.S. humanitarian assistance programs at a time when  we are facing famine in four countries beset by violence--including  countries where we are fighting designated terrorist groups--would be  reckless and irresponsible. Millions of lives are hanging in the  balance. It is in the U.S. interest to respond in South Sudan, just as  it is in these other countries.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  chairman for yielding and for his leadership. I especially thank my  good friend and colleague, Ms. Bass, for this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, last August, my staff director Greg Simpkins and I  visited Juba, South Sudan, to press President Salva Kiir, his Vice  President, the minister of defense, and five of his top generals to end  the civil war, protect innocent lives, and reverse the conditions  causing rampant disease and severe malnutrition that could soon lead to  a famine.   Mr. Speaker, just 2 months ago, famine was formally declared in South  Sudan. I especially asked President Kiir to personally intervene and  issue and enforce an executive order of zero tolerance on rape and  sexual abuse by his soldiers and security personnel against mostly  humanitarian aid workers and civilians. I told the President that it  was unconscionable in the extreme that South Sudanese soldiers had  raped, beaten, and murdered humanitarian aid workers in July at the  Terrain compound. One of those workers that was sexually assaulted, as  it turned out, was from my own district. I didn't know until 3 days  before leaving on that trip that she was in the compound and came close  to being raped and it was the intervention of other forces that  precluded her from suffering that horrible trauma, but she was, indeed,  severely traumatized.   I asked him for a review to hold people to account and put them in  prison--yes, there have been arrests, but there have been no  prosecutions yet--and, again, to issue a zero tolerance policy.   On March 28, I chaired a hearing on the famine and the growing crisis  in South Sudan, which is also being chaired by some of the other  neighboring countries in the region.   Matt Nims, the acting director of the Office of Food for Peace  testified that for 3 years the international community has employed  massive efforts to stave off famine in South Sudan. Yet, as conflict  intensified, the food security situation continued to deteriorate. And  he said:         This is a man-made crisis and the direct consequence of       prolonged conflict.    Ken Isaacs, the vice president of Samaritan's Purse--and Samaritan's  Purse has an extensive footprint in South Sudan doing unbelievably  great humanitarian work--testified:   [[Page H2834]]              The most significant driver of the current crisis in the       worst hit areas of South Sudan, however, is the political       insecurity and brutal conflict that continues to engulf       the region. In South Sudan alone, 1.85 million people have       been internally displaced because. Because of this, many       people are calling this a man-made famine, and it is hard       to argue with that assessment.    Today, the United Nations reports that two-thirds of South Sudan's  population requires humanitarian assistance, and almost 5 million  people--more than 40 percent of the population--are in urgent need of  food, agriculture, and nutritional assistance.   Clearly, the Government of South Sudan and the rebels they face are  more interested in winning and holding territory than in finding ways  to feed and nurture their people and allow humanitarian access. Two  months ago, there were 70 humanitarian-access incidents reported,  causing suspension of operations in multiple locations. Aid workers are  being targeted in South Sudan, where eight Samaritan's Purse workers  were kidnapped and later released in February, and six African aid  workers in South Sudan were killed in March.   Stephen O'Brien, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of  Humanitarian Affairs, accused South Sudan's Government of blocking  foods and medicines and restricting U.N. peacekeepers from protecting  civilians. He described active hostility, access denials, and  bureaucratic impediments to humanitarian organizations serving that  beleaguered nation. This is a manmade crisis. This resolution puts us  on record and, again, encourages our administration and the world to do  more to end it.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, many of us knew President John Garang who tragically  died after many years of trying to secure freedom for the people of  South Sudan, tragically died in a helicopter crash.   He was the father of his country. He was also one who always  championed peaceful coexistence among the tribes in South Sudan. He was  very different than obviously the current competing warlords for that  position.   I had worked with Don Payne's father. Don Payne, Jr., spoke of this  issue of the genocide resolution. We passed that resolution through  this House together. As a matter of fact, we brought it before the  Human Rights Council. Don Payne and I traveled up to New York to raise  this issue.   What is shocking to us about the current circumstances in South Sudan  is the effort being undertaken by the world community in order to try  to step in and provide some measure of peace. Of course, we have talked  today about what has happened to the people of South Sudan, what has  happened to our own aid workers there.   But if we reflect for a minute that Rwandans have lost their lives  there, when we were dealing with this genocide issue in Sudan, we took  Don Cheadle, the actor who portrayed Paul Rusesabagina, who was also  with us on that trip.   We went into Sudan in order to document the genocide that was going  on, to speak to some of the survivors. We brought in a Nightline camera  crew.   Yes, we have, in this case, brought the world community along to a  certain extent. But here is part of the tragedy: those Rwandan  peacekeepers were slaughtered in South Sudan. So were Chinese  peacekeepers. So were Indian and Kenyan and Fiji and Danish  peacekeepers. So were Egyptian and Ethiopian and Bangladeshi  peacekeepers. So were Benin and Burkina Faso, and Chad and Mongolia. So  were peacekeepers from Nepal and Nigeria and Norway, and the  Philippines and Pakistan.   And this is the kind of attitude that we see from these warlords  against their own people and against others who try to come in to keep  the peace.   And this is why, frankly, in addition to this resolution, it is  time--and I know the support is there in the Security Council, I know  now there is the support--to cut off the arms and the ammunition going  in to South Sudan that helps fuel these warlords.   We have heard the passion and dedication of Congresswoman Bass of  California. Of course, she has worked with Mr. Smith of New Jersey, the  chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa, to shine a light on this  crisis. As always, I appreciate the assistance of Mr. Engel, the  ranking member.   I share the anguish of my colleagues in seeing the aspirations of  South Sudan citizens dashed by kleptocrats and warlords, certainly not  in the tradition of John Garang, warlords bent on maintaining power at  any cost. The blood of countless civilians is on their hands, and the  people of South Sudan deserve better.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to recognize the bravery and  selflessness of the humanitarians who are working to save lives and  bring an end to the suffering that has been imposed upon the people of  South Sudan.   I have personally met with humanitarian workers who have been held at  gunpoint, who have been threatened, who have been abused in the worst  ways. I have met with people who have carried food and medicine on  their backs through swamps because there were no roads.   Without their commitment, without their sacrifice, countless lives  would have now been lost. And while they don't do this work for the  accolades,  [[Page H2837]]  they deserve our recognition and thanks here tonight.   I urge Members to join me in honoring them today by supporting this  timely resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
