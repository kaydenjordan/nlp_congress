 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for  National School Choice Week.   Every American enjoys choices, and, indeed, it is the American way;  yet, when it comes to educating our children, one size fits all seems  to be the norm--and is even forced upon families.   Every family, regardless of their background, should be able to  choose an educational option that is right for the needs of their  children, whether that is traditional public schools, charter schools,  magnet schools, private schools, or other alternatives.   There is plenty of evidence to suggest that, when a family can choose  a school based on their own children's needs, there is an increase in  college readiness and success in life after graduation.   If we expect today's students to become tomorrow's world leaders, we  should give them every opportunity to learn and grow and thrive, to  have choices that work for them, not for the government and not for  special interests.   Expanding school choice is the most viable option to prepare students  for success.                            ____________________
