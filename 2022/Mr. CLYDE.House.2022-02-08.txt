 Mr. Speaker, I thank Vice Chairman Johnson for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that President Biden's slew of crises  are self-inflicted wounds that have devastated American workers, their  families, and small businesses across this great Nation. The ongoing  energy crisis is no exception.   President Biden's destructive energy agenda has created skyrocketing  gas prices, forced burdensome home heating bills on Americans already  struggling with record-high inflation, destroyed thousands of energy  jobs, and canceled American energy independence.   The energy crisis has been fueled by the Biden Administration's  failed policy decisions, starting with canceling the Keystone XL  Pipeline, which eliminated over 11,000 American jobs.   Infamously, President Biden also greenlit Russian President Putin's  Nord Stream II pipeline. He begged OPEC to produce more oil, and  released three days' worth of oil from our own Strategic Petroleum  Reserve ahead of last Thanksgiving.   Unfortunately, the ramifications of President Biden's ill-advised  policies extend far beyond the gas pump and now into matters of  national security. President Biden surrendered American energy  independence to benefit our adversaries, including Russia. By handing  Russian President Vladimir Putin the Nord Stream II Pipeline, Biden  abandoned vital leverage, leverage that could be used right now as  tensions rise between Russia and Ukraine.   Yet, after conceding this opportunity many months ago, the President  now claims he will bring an end to the Nord Stream II Pipeline if  Russia actually invades Ukraine. Really? So do you think this new claim  is going to make Russia tremble in their boots?   Following a year of embarrassing weakness on the world stage, this  empty threat means nothing to Vladimir Putin. But energy independence  means everything to Americans struggling to fill their gas tanks and to  keep their families warm this winter, as they wonder why President  Biden prioritized Russian energy above their own.   Mr. Speaker, we must always put Americans first, yet the Biden  administration and their self-inflicted energy crisis have again failed  America.                                time  1915
