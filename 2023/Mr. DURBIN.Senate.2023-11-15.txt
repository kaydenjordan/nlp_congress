 Mr. President, serving as a U.S. Senator is a singular  opportunity to improve the lives of the American people and make a  difference. When you think about the areas where we have made real,  tangible progress in preventing suffering, disease, and death, the area  of tobacco prevention and control stands out for its dramatic success  in saving lives.   This has required a comprehensive campaign to shift public thinking,  promote public health practices, empower the medical and scientific  communities, shed light on the despicable tactics of Big Tobacco, and  change the laws at the Federal, State, and local levels. That is a  daunting task.   But not for Matt Myers--it has been his life's calling, and for more  than four decades, he has made it his mission to save lives and hold  the tobacco industry accountable. Matt recently stepped down as the  president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which he helped to  found in 1996. He has had an outsized impact by playing an  indispensable role in just about every tobacco-related policy debate,  and he is leaving a lasting legacy of success measured in lives spared.   As a leader, advocate, and lawyer, Matt helped transform our  country's perception of the tobacco industry: by placing children, one  of the main targets of the tobacco industry's predatory tactics, front  and center. And he has produced remarkable results. While Matt has  worked on this issue, the percentage of high school students who smoke  cigarettes has declined from 28 percent in 2000 to 2 percent today.   He began at the Federal Trade Commission in 1980, where he worked on  regulatory and litigation efforts related to tobacco tax increases,  warning labels on cigarette packs, banning advertisements on television  and radio, and many other topics. He worked extensively on the historic  master settlement agreement to hold the tobacco industry responsible  for its lies, deceit, and marketing over the years, which took millions  of lives far too soon, including my own father's.   Matt worked alongside me as we pushed to finally empower and  authorize the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the  manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. Since then, we  have collaborated to further raise the prices of tobacco products out  of the reach of children, increase the age to purchase tobacco  products, and close loopholes that e-cigarette manufacturers have  exploited. Matt also has recognized that we can make a difference  through other avenues as well. We worked together to kick chewing  tobacco out of Major League Baseball and out of Hollywood movies.   On virtually any issue that Matt has engaged on, he has prevailed--no  matter how long it took--and our children, our public spaces, and the  Nation's health are better for it. But that is not to say it has been  easy--far from it. One can characterize Matt's approach as a dogged,  comprehensive pursuit of what is right, no matter the challenge or the  strength of the adversary. And with the riches and shamelessness of Big  Tobacco, Matt has taken on the giants, and more often than not, he has  come out on top.   It has been an honor to work alongside Matt on so many of these  efforts. When a new problem arises, and I am considering what course of  action to take, I often find myself asking, ``What does Matt Myers  think?'' I know many others have counted on Matt's counsel and wisdom.  He has been recognized for his leadership by the Harvard School of  Public Health, the Surgeon General of the United States, Smokefree  America, and the American Cancer Society. He has been selected to  advise the United Nations and World Health Organizations on global  health conventions, spreading his lasting legacy overseas to address  disparities worldwide.   While I will miss Matt's trusted advice, tenacity, and creativity, I  know the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the broader public health  community will carry on the effort to safeguard our successes, continue  to protect children from the harms of vaping, clear the market of  menthol and flavored cigars, and promote smoking cessation.   I thank Matt for his service to the country and wish him the best of  luck in his new, well-deserved chapter in life. I know that will  include more time with his wife Louise, sons Micah and Daniel, and  grandchildren Elliot, Eva, David, and Sofia. Congratulations, again.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
