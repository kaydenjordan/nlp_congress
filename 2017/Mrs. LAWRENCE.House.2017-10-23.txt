 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Veasey for  his leadership and for his dedication.   Today, I am at this mike for a number of reasons. One is that we have  witnessed, over the weekend, another time in history that will be  written for many to read, for generations to try to understand what  exactly happened.   Most of us are raised that, in a time of grieving and mourning, you  are sympathetic, you are patient, and, most of all, you try to be  understanding.   I am at a loss in trying to understand how the dialogue was reduced  to name-calling and then just unfactual information. But what I had  hoped and what I feel that, as an American, as a Member of Congress, as  a citizen, if someone gets it wrong, that at least I deserve, ``I'm  sorry, I didn't get the information right,'' or maybe ``I spoke out of  turn.'' And when you are grieving the loss of someone you love dearly,  someone who was serving this country, someone who, as the family of a  military service person, gave the sacrifice as well for them to  represent our country.    I would hope--I was hopeful that that would happen, but it did not.  There comes a point in time, Mr. Speaker, as American citizens, that we  begin to stand up and say, as our country, there is an expectation.  There is an expectation for those we elect, there is an expectation for  those in leadership, and truly, there is an expectation of civility  and, at minimum, truth.   As we know, the FBI has had a long, troubling history of using its  broad investigatory powers to target Black citizens. It is not a myth.  It is a fact. It has been written. During the 1960s, Director Hoover  used the counterintelligence program to surveil and discredit civil  rights activists, members of the Black Panther Party.   For an example, the FBI falsified a letter in an attempt to blackmail  the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King into silence.   So the Congressional Black Caucus is concerned by the assertion that  coins a new term, ``Black identity extremists,'' and claims, with high  confidence, that they are likely to target law enforcement based on  perceptions of police brutality against African Americans.  [[Page H8071]]    In August, the FBI Counterterrorism Division issued a chilling and  outlandish warning to its agents, all hidden behind the veil of an  internal report never meant to be seen by the American people. It  worries me because, in 2017, such a misguided and hateful and dangerous  report exists at all.   Released just 9 days before the hateful violence in Charlottesville,  this report targets so-called Black identity extremists by falsely  linking peaceful and necessary calls for justice from Americans, from  the African-American community, to entirely unrelated acts of violence  against law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I served as a mayor of a diverse city for 14 years and  had the responsibility of an entire police force for a city. I have  such respect and honor for those who serve us.   I understand how, when there is trouble, the police run to that  trouble to protect us, but I also know that the power that is held on  the shield of a police force can be used for other than protection of  their people. And that in this great country that we live in, time and  time again in history, some people will use the comment: Don't be so  sensitive about everything that happened. But history has shown us,  every change that we have made in this country of freedoms and rights  have come from people who had the courage, the political courage, to  stand up and fight for that. Is that extremism?   Will you say the right to vote were Black extremists? Would you say  that the women who protest and march so that women could have the right  to vote, were they extremists? Or were they Americans who believed in  this country and had the courage to stand up not just for them but for  generations to come?   Our Social Security, when we looked at--and we looked at hunger in  this country, and people repeatedly have shown, of all ethnic groups,  that nothing in America happens without protests and the courage to  stand up. Are they extremists, or they part of this amazing democracy  that we have?   And the threat of being labeled by our FBI so you have permission to  now treat these individuals, who have the courage to stand up, as  unlawful villains and terrorists, and you have the permission now by  the FBI to attack and to imprison them.   We must, as a Congress and a country, learn to understand the power  of our words, and I am going to close with this.   Your words mean something. If this administration has taught us  anything, the words of those who are elected to leadership do matter,  whether it is the truth or whether it is a lie. It matters.   It fuels anger and hatred in people. It tells people that it is okay  to disrespect others. Words mean something. And for me to be a Black  woman in America and be labeled, if I stand up and fight for my rights,  if I stand with others, if Black Lives Matter has not just been Black  people standing up--it has been all members of the United States,  citizens saying that all lives matter and that we will not tolerate  criminal injustice against Black people and the murder rate that we see  of those who are of color.                                time  2015    This has been a movement in our country, and now we see this internal  labeling by our law enforcement in our country. Does that cause me to  feel afraid in my own country? Does that give me the fear that history  is going to repeat itself because words have given permission for this  to happen when you legitimize people whose only purpose to stand and be  in a position in your community is to say that you have no value less  than me and we hate you?   But do you know what? There are some very fine people there. Being a  Black person in America, I can tell you, we have had some fine days. I  would not be standing here, this little Black girl from Detroit, if  this country did not give me the opportunities. But it came from the  protests; it came in the death and the riots of the people in my  generation before me who would not sit down and be quiet.   So now are we being told that we are not to use our constitutional  rights of free speech and protests and to gather to say that now you  are being an extremist? I am not going to allow that to happen in this  country, and if you want to label me, label me. But I would not be here  today if it were not for those who had the political courage to stand  up for what is right, not just for Black people, but for Americans in  this country. And that is something that this report strikes a chord  with me.   I stand in opposition. I understand when someone takes their freedom  to stand up and oppose something that is happening in America, and I  want to protect that First Amendment right. But if we can avoid the  consequences of halfway speech fueled by fear and false perceptions, we  will be stronger as a country.   Mr. Speaker, I call on Congress to join me and my colleagues in  condemning this report and standing with us for a more peaceful, a more  accepting, and a more equal country where we can really mean, when we  stand up and we say the Pledge of Allegiance and we say, ``one nation  under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,'' and for all  of us we have a name.   We have a name that we were given at birth, and we expect our  leadership, our President, our Congress, our Chief of Staff, our  military to address us by our names. It is not acceptable, it is  embarrassing for us as a country, to reduce ourselves to that level.  And I stand here tonight, on the Record, that I am an American. I am a  Member of Congress. I am a woman. I am an African American. I deserve  respect, and I expect all of our colleagues to conduct themselves the  same way, including the President of the United States.
