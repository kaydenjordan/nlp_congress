 Madam President, Americans across the country, led  by Concerned Women for America, the Nation's largest public policy  organization for women, and other faith-based organizations continue to  celebrate April as Faith Month. I commend this noble effort calling all  people of faith to join in prayer, thanksgiving, and celebration of  their faith.   The United States of America was born of the unanimous Declaration  that we are ``endowed by [our] Creator with certain unalienable  Rights,'' based on ``the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God,''  ``appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world,'' and acknowledging our  ``reliance on the protection of divine Providence.'' We are a people of  faith, which is why religious freedom is known as America's first  freedom, as laid out in the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses  of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The freedom of speech  is guaranteed by the First Amendment and also supports America's unique  focus on freedom of expression, including in matters of faith.   America's Judeo-Christian founding promotes religious diversity and  tolerance. Our motto, ``In God We Trust,'' further emphasizes the  importance of faith in our Nation's founding. From our first President  to the last, we have always acknowledged America's faith. President  George Washington recognized ``it is the duty of all Nations to  acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be  grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and  favor.''   Preserving our religious freedom, which strengthens our country's  appreciation of all peoples, regardless of faith, requires eternal  diligence. Sadly, attacks on religious liberty and people of faith are  growing, with some religious charities forced to betray the tenets of  their faith in order to participate in certain government programs. We  must actively reject all efforts to criminalize or cancel religious  beliefs as somehow incompatible with our democracy.   Religious organizations in America have a rich history of charitable  engagement by helping the sick, poor, and afflicted. Their presence in  my State of Mississippi following devastating and fatal tornadoes in  March has been a blessing to those trying to rebuild their lives. Their  service demonstrates why these organizations should be celebrated, not  maligned, for their contributions to improve life. According to the Pew  Research Center, more than 75 percent of Americans practice some type  of religious faith. This rich, diverse religious heritage is to our  credit and should be encouraged.   This Faith Month, I join millions of Americans in honoring the right  to practice our faith freely and openly, with public displays and  celebrations, including prayer and expressions of thanksgiving. In this  manner, we reaffirm our commitment to the religious liberty principles  of our founding.                            ____________________
