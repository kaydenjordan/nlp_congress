 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Puerto Rico and the nearby U.S. Virgin  Islands have been buffeted by not one but two successive hurricanes,  including a direct hit by the powerful Hurricane Maria. Many citizens  have had their homes and businesses destroyed, tens of thousands-- hundreds of thousands--are living without electricity, husbanding gas  and food and water and their remaining cash. The situation is  desperate. Puerto Rico has taken a serious punch to the gut. They need  our help, and they need it now.   These are our fellow Americans--3.5 million of them. It is our duty  in the Senate to speedily send aid to the people of Puerto Rico and to  the U.S. Virgin Islands, just as we did for the people of Texas and  Louisiana who were hit by Hurricane Harvey and the people of my own  State when we suffered from Hurricane Sandy, as we will do for the  people of Florida who were hit by Hurricane Irma.   So let's all work together to help the island of Puerto Rico rebuild  and recover, just as we would anywhere else in America.   At the same time, we must bear in mind that much of the western part  of our country is besieged by wildfires. The Senators from Oregon have  come to the floor to remind us of our duty to help those parts of the  country also.   The administration must quickly prepare an appropriate aid package  for Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Western  States for Congress to act on in the near future. We Democrats will  insist that any package of supplemental aid for Hurricanes Harvey and  Irma also include aid for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the  Western States ravaged by forest fires. We owe it to every State and  community impacted by these devastating hurricanes and these horrible  firestorms.   One beautiful thing about this country is, although we are 50 States  with different ideas and politics and accents, we are also one Nation,  bound together, and we will come to the aid of any individual State or  territory whenever one of them is in need.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on healthcare, last night we began to see  reports of a new version of the Graham-Cassidy bill. Faced with stern  resistance from several Members of their own caucus, it appears that  the authors of the legislation have tweaked the bill in an attempt to  gain the support of the holdouts. Despite sending more money to the  States of those Members, this new bill, if anything, is worse in many  ways than before and, in the long run, will still result in a net cut  for every single State in the country.   It still contains a massive cut to Medicaid, it still defunds Planned  Parenthood, and it actually further weakens consumer protections, and  almost completely does away with protections for those with preexisting  conditions--even worse than in the first version.   The S&P has just come out with a study that estimates that Graham- Cassidy would result in 580,000 lost jobs and $240 billion in lost  economic activity by 2027. That is not a Democratic propaganda machine,  that is Standard & Poor's; down the middle, 580,000 jobs lost and $240  billion in lost economic activity if Graham-Cassidy is enacted.   Under the latest version, States would be able to lift the regulation  that caps out-of-pocket costs, meaning insurance companies could offer  barebones policies with sky-high deductibles and copays.   Under the latest version, States could do away with lifetime limits,  meaning insurance companies could cap the amount of coverage you  receive for a given illness. Imagine the parent of a child suffering  with cancer being told your policy only covers 4 months of treatment;  you are on your own after that--devastating to too many families in  this country.   Under the latest version, States could remove the benefit of getting  preventive services at no cost, such as birth control, cancer  screening, and immunizations. Under the latest version, States could  opt out of the preexisting condition without even applying for a  waiver. So even more so than in the old bill, preexisting conditions  are not protected.   States just have to submit a plan that allows for adequate and  affordable insurance. In other words, the new Graham-Cassidy makes it  even easier and even more likely that States will allow insurance  companies to discriminate against Americans with preexisting  conditions. Again, that parent of a child aching with cancer is in real  jeopardy. Maybe they can't even get insurance at all.   In short, the new Graham-Cassidy tells every American with  potentially high medical costs, you are on your own. If you have  diabetes, cancer, congenital illness, or asthma, Graham-Cassidy says  that you are on your own. It eviscerates the protections that make  healthcare affordable for those who need it most.   It is no wonder that it is so unpopular with Americans. Recently,  even though the bill has just been introduced, a majority of Americans  say they don't like it. The more they learn--just like with the old  TrumpCare--the less they like it.   Americans want good healthcare, lower premiums, and more coverage.  This bill does the opposite--higher premiums, fewer people covered, and  it makes it harder to get good insurance.   Guess what. We are expected to vote on this bill in just 2 or 3 days.  There will have been only a single hearing, which Republicans scheduled  almost as an afterthought, just to say they had one. Certainly, there  will not be any amendments to the bill. It is not going to go through  the committee process. There will not be a shred of input from the  minority, despite all the complaints that ObamaCare, which did have  input from the minority, was passed by one party's vote.   The Senate's former Historian said he could not think of ``anything  comparable'' to the process Republicans are employing in the entire  history of the Senate. The Senate's former Historian, a scholar, said  that there is nothing comparable to the process being employed now-- one-sixth of the economy, no amendments, one hearing, no changes.   Add to that fact that the CBO will not have enough time to properly  analyze this legislation. We will not know how it actually impacts our  healthcare system. At most, we will get a barebones analysis sometime  today that may not tell us a thing about how Graham-Cassidy would  impact coverage--the cost of care, the quality of care, and the  stability of marketplaces.   It is shockingly incomplete not to have our CBO tell the American  people and tell us--the representatives of each State--how it affects  their State and rush it through. Even after the minimal CBO report  today, Republicans will still be voting on a healthcare bill with thick  blindfolds on their eyes. They will not be able to see it. My guess is  that I don't think they want to see it.   When the American people learn what is in this bill, they are going  to dislike it intensely--intensely. The new TrumpCare is bad policy. It  is being jammed through this body at an alarming, ludicrous pace. To  say it is hastily constructed and considered barely scratches the  surface.   New versions are coming out every few hours. The websites of the  Senators from Louisiana and South Carolina keep saying: We are changing  this; we are changing that.   It is Monday. We are voting this week. The Republicans are basically  scrawling a healthcare law for 300 million people on the back of a bar  napkin. The bill should go down. I believe my Republican colleagues who  were skeptical about this policy and this process are too principled to  be swayed by last-minute formula tweaks.   Governor Walker of Alaska, an Independent, has said he will not  support a healthcare bill that is bad for the country, even if it might  be good for his State, which the bill isn't. That is principled  leadership. I believe the same kind of principled leadership exists in  this body as well. I know it does.   I wish to say to all of my Republican colleagues directly: Vote down  this bill. If it goes down, we Democrats are pledged to work in a  bipartisan way to improve our healthcare system. We are pledged to work  through committee, to support the efforts of Chairman Alexander and  Ranking Member Murray, and to find a bipartisan consensus on a  healthcare package.  [[Page S5875]]    We welcome bipartisan change. We know there is always give and take  when that happens, but usually the product is better. A bipartisan  process led by Alexander and Murray to make the present system better  will be a whole lot better for both the process in this body and for  the health of the American people than this rushed-through, half-baked  proposal.   We disagree in the Senate a lot. Very rare are the times when there  is a clear right and wrong, but this bill and the process it has gone  through are clearly wrong. The bill would hurt so many people in our  great country. The process has damaged this institution and would do  much greater damage if it were to pass.   We have a chance--a chance--to legislate the right way, through  regular order, by resuming bipartisan work already started by the HELP  Committee, which has had hearings and intends to--at least, as I  understand it--go through a process with amendments. We Democrats are  at the table. We ask our Republican friends to join us at the table  once again.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, first, let me so commend my friend and  colleague from Connecticut for his intelligent, articulate, and, most  of all, passionate words. I hope that everyone on the other side of the  aisle hears this.   This is not a game. I know that it is not the Presiding Officer's  State, but the States that are taking the money are the ones that did  not want to give good coverage--enough coverage--to people. The States  like Connecticut and like New York that wanted to help people and had  to put in half the money themselves are now being penalized by the  States that did not. Most Americans are against that. The vast majority  of Americans are against it. When Americans hear what this bill is  about, almost none of them like it. None of them like it. That is why  we are hiding this bill. That is why we are not debating this bill.  That is why we are trying to rush it through without a score.   Yet, just over an hour ago, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office released a preliminary analysis of the latest version of  TrumpCare, the Graham-Cassidy bill. The CBO is nonpartisan. The head of  it was appointed by the Republican leadership. This is not one of those  liberal think tanks that the other side dismisses as we dismiss the  conservative ones. This is down the middle.   While the CBO has not filled in all of the details, the outline is  devastating enough: The new TrumpCare bill would gut Medicaid, cause  millions to lose coverage, create chaos in the marketplace, and not  protect Americans who have preexisting conditions.   Members should not need any more details to know how bad a piece of  legislation this is--though, certainly, we need to await more details.  The other side does not want to. Even in plain language, without the  numbers, the CBO makes clear that Graham-Cassidy would be the largest  step backward for American healthcare in our Nation's history.   Let's go over a few things that the CBO report listed. These are  down-the-middle, green-eyeshade findings that are not political.   First, Graham-Cassidy would gut Medicaid: ``All told, Federal  spending on Medicaid would be reduced by about $1 trillion . . . and  the program would cover millions fewer enrollees.''   That means they do not know how many millions. My guess is it will be  about the same as the previous bills or even worse. That means there  will be a drastic cut to healthcare funding that goes to help older  Americans in nursing homes, those in opioid abuse treatment programs,  and low-income Americans who rely on Medicaid as their source of  coverage. All of those would be slashed.   If you are a middle-class family on Long Island, in Anchorage, or if  you have someone in a nursing home--a parent--you will be faced with an  awful choice with too many likelihoods. Pay thousands of dollars a  month out of your own pocket or ask Mom or Dad to come live with you  when you don't have a spare room in your house, and you are trying to  raise your kids. It is not very pretty.   The CBO writes that Graham-Cassidy would cause millions to lose  healthcare coverage, with the most abrupt loss of coverage occurring as  soon as 2020 due to ``substantially lower'' enrollment in Medicaid,  nongroup coverage, and insurance of all types because there would be no  incentive to sign up.   The CBO also wrote that Graham-Cassidy would destabilize the  individual market, creating a death spiral.         [Under Graham-Cassidy], average health care costs among       people retaining coverage would be higher, and insurers would       have to raise premiums in the nongroup market to cover those       higher costs. Anticipating such an unsustainable spiral, some       insurers would not participate in the nongroup market. . . .       In many States, the transitions starting in 2020 would be       difficult, and some areas would probably have no insurers       offering policies in the nongroup market.    That is a quote from the CBO. It is not by Chuck Schumer, not by  Chris Murphy but from the CBO--destabilizing markets and huge numbers  of people not getting insurance.   Here is another thing that the CBO wrote. Graham-Cassidy also fails  spectacularly to protect Americans with preexisting conditions because  it allows States to opt out of very popular consumer protections in our  current law. According to the CBO: ``Coverage for people with  preexisting conditions would be much more expensive in some of those  States than under current law.''   I have heard my colleague from Louisiana say that this will not  change the law with regard to preexisting conditions. Then why did they  have to add this clause and give States the option? If they want to  keep preexisting conditions, they should keep existing law.   The CBO even predicted that the ``flexibility'' of Graham-Cassidy  would likely drive some States to pursue an age tax, charging older  Americans five times as much or more for their healthcare than younger  Americans.   If you are 50 to 64 and you have worked hard your whole life, your  healthcare costs go up. There is a little bit of protection in present  law. Much of that protection is removed by the Graham-Cassidy bill. If  you are a senior citizen or close to it, you are going to pay more in  too many places. That is why the AARP--again, not a very political  organization--has come out so strongly against this bill, as, by the  way, has the AMA and the American Cancer Society. Chris Murphy listed  many of the groups.   All in all, even without specific numbers for estimates, the CBO  report confirms much of what we already knew about Graham-Cassidy. It  is a wholesale dismantling of our healthcare system, which would create  chaos in many places, cause millions to lose coverage, drive up costs,  and put healthcare out of reach for the folks who need it the most.   To boot, today, Standard & Poor's--another hardly partisan  organization--estimated that Graham-Cassidy would carry a staggering  economic cost.  [[Page S6095]]  Standard & Poor's estimates that Graham-Cassidy would result in 580,000  lost jobs and $240 billion in lost economic activity by 2027.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are starting tax reform.  They want to cut taxes on the wealthiest people, such as big  corporations, because it will create jobs. Maybe yes but maybe no--many  of us think no. But right here, if we are interested in creating jobs,  don't pass Graham-Cassidy because we will lose 580,000 jobs, according  to Standard & Poor's.   A number of Republican Senators have expressed their opposition to  this bill--most recently, Senator Collins. To Senator Collins and to  the rest of my Republican colleagues, I want to say that once repeal is  off the table, we want to work with you to improve the existing system.  Once this bill goes down, we are ready to work with you to find a  compromise that stabilizes markets and that lowers premiums.   We are ready. We have proven some of that already. Senator Alexander  and Senator Murray--one a Republican and one a Democrat, the chair and  the ranking member of the HELP Committee--were making great progress  toward a bipartisan agreement. They held hearings, heard expert  testimony, and solicited input from colleagues on both sides of the  aisle--something not done with this Graham-Cassidy bill. They were  crafting a fair package, where each side got a little and each side  gave a little. Once this bill goes down, those negotiations should pick  up right where they left off. That is what we on this side of the aisle  believe, for sure, and I think many on the other side as well.   There is no time to waste. Insurers are about to set rates for the  next year. Whether we can come together or not could be the difference  between a stable market and premiums that are several hundreds of  dollars more expensive.   We should pick up where Senators Wyden and Hatch--again, one Democrat  and one Republican--left off, to come to an agreement to extend the  Children's Health Insurance Program, for community health centers, and  for several other programs that need to be extended this week.   CBO, even with the bare structure of what this bill is all about,  issued a devastating report. It is very, very hard to look that report  in the eye and say: This bill improves healthcare for Americans--very  hard. I hope for the good of our healthcare system, for the good of our  country, and for the good of this institution that my Republican  friends abandon Graham-Cassidy and its one-sidedness and choose instead  to come back to the table with Democrats to do the hard work of forging  a bipartisan consensus on healthcare. That is what America wants. That  is what America needs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:48 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, September 26, 2017, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
