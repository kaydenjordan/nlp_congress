 Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize  Stephanie Bellino, the Duval County Teacher of the Year from Garden  City Elementary School in Jacksonville, FL.   Stephanie was named Teacher of the Year for successfully pushing a  growing number of disadvantaged students to achieve grade-level  performance or better in reading and language arts. She helps students  by taking scripted lesson plans and adapting them to fit each of their  individual needs. Stephanie is credited with helping Garden City  improve from a D to a B school.   While teachers typically stay at one grade level, Stephanie loops  with her  [[Page S3291]]  students. Many of her current fifth grade students were also in her  third grade class. About 16 of these students were a year or two behind  their grade level but have now caught up, with Stephanie being credited  for this accomplishment.   Stephanie has worked at Garden City Elementary School for 3 years and  was a Teach for America recruit. She taught reading and writing to the  entire fourth grade and pushed students to a 48 percent passing rate, a  15 percentage point increase in 1 year.   I extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Stephanie for her  work and wish her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Shannon Ellison, the  Dixie County Teacher of the Year from Dixie County High School in Cross  City, FL.   Shannon's colleagues attest that of the many excellent teachers in  her district, she stands above the rest due to her commitment to  excellence and passion for helping every student develop a love for  learning. She designed a rigorous curriculum to equip her students with  the necessary skills for success in college and the workplace.   She is passionate about helping her students reach their academic  potential by maintaining relationships with her students, their  parents, and her community by inspiring trust and confidence in both  her instructional skills and leadership abilities.   Shannon's teaching skills as an advanced placement teacher helped her  school earn national recognition from the College Board. She has  attended the advanced placement summer institutions for the past 5  years, qualifying her ability to teach AP world history, AP psychology,  and AP art history.   Shannon earned her bachelors of arts degree in history from the  University of Florida in 1993 and her master of arts/education in arts  and academic interdisciplinary education from Southeastern University  in 2011.

Tracy's inspiration for her students and enthusiasm for teaching led  to this important recognition. Her students recognize that she goes  above and beyond her required duties to be the best teacher for them.  She focuses on putting her students first and believes their emotions  are as important as their schoolwork. She teaches them to believe in  themselves and their ability to achieve. She is especially proud that  two former students were inducted into the National Honor Society after  they previously had difficulty learning and adapting while in third  grade. They are now extraordinary students.   Tracy has been a teacher for 21 years. She graduated from Florida  State University with honors in 1997 and currently teaches third grade  reading at Taylor County Elementary School. She has also taught at the  primary and elementary levels with the Florida Virtual Academy.

Mitchell High School in New  Port Richey, FL.   As a journalism teacher, Susan's students state she deserved this  award not just for what she does in the classroom, but because she  helps her students before, during, and afterschool. Susan is a caring  teacher and is always available to lend a hand when they need it the  most. She is viewed as a person to confide in, with her students  knowing instantly that they could depend on her.   I extend my best wishes to Susan for her perseverance as a dedicated  teacher for her students.
