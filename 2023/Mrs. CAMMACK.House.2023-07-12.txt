 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment,  No. 44, which is included in en bloc No. 1.  [[Page H3474]]    This amendment aims to establish a working group that will explore  the potential applications of blockchain technology, smart contracts,  and a distributed ledger technology to enhance efficiencies and  functions within the DOD.   While blockchain technology is a relatively recent innovation, it has  already proven its value in both private and public organizations,  enabling cost reductions, supply chain optimization, improved  traceability efforts, and so much more. DOD can benefit from numerous  applications where blockchain or distributed ledger technology can save  both time and money.   The proposed working group will consist of officials within the DOD,  the Office of Science and Technology Policy, relevant private-sector  entities, and academic institutions. By assembling this working group,  the DOD will initiate the evaluation of how blockchain, smart  contracts, and distributed ledger technologies can be effectively  utilized to ultimately yield taxpayer savings.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Rogers for his work on the underlying  bill, and I urge adoption of this amendment.                                time  1545
