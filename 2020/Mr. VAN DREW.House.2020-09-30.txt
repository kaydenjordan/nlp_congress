 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize a well-known and  beloved family in south Jersey, the Bottos.   The Botto family embodies the American Dream. Under the vision of  Robert Sr.--the Sausage King, or Big Bob--the Bottos followed their  meat market with the Botto's Italian Line restaurant, a supermarket,  catering and banquet hall.   I can attest, the Bottos' family sausage, meatballs, and meats are  absolutely delicious. I had the pleasure of touring some of the  facilities last month with Dominic and Enrico Botto.   Your family is a testament to the fact that hard work and passion  will get you far in life. And in the minds of everyone who has ever had  the pleasure of enjoying a meal or spending time with you, this is the  true American Dream, a family who worked hard, who reached for the  brass ring, who did more, and never gave up.   God bless you and your family for your commitment to the community,  and I look forward to plenty of full stomachs in the future.                            ____________________
