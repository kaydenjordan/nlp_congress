 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4350, the  National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022.   I congratulate my colleagues for fulfilling our obligation to debate  and pass the National Defense Authorization Act. This year's bill  contains multiple provisions to address strategic challenges presented  by China, to confront our adversaries in the gray zone of conflict, and  to strengthen the relationships with key allies and partners.   As chair of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee, I  am proud of the provisions in this bill that represent critical reforms  to the defense intelligence enterprise, special operations forces, our  ability to counter weapons of mass destruction.                                time  2145    Our bill creates more agility across the defense intelligence  enterprise by breaking down barriers to information sharing to enhance  warfighters and combatant commanders in their ability to counter China  and Russia in the information environment and focusing on expanding  access to partners such as India and our steadfast Nordic partners such  as Finland.   The bill further supports rigorous oversight of our security posture  in Afghanistan and includes provisions to better understand the  Department's plans to address the threat environment while postured in  an over-the-horizon capacity. Importantly, the bill also contains $500  million in relocation support for Afghan SIV holders.   Finally, our bill authorizes an increase of $105 million to the  Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which will enhance our efforts to  detect and fight emergent chemical and biological threats and develop  medical countermeasures such as vaccines and therapeutics.   Most importantly, I want to thank subcommittee Ranking Member Trent  Kelly for his contribution to this bill and his bipartisanship, which  helped create the foundations of such a strong bill during a  particularly challenging year. I would also like to thank the staff-- Shannon Green, Jessica Carroll, Zachary Taylor, and Patrick Nevins--for  their tireless efforts to get it across the finish line.   Colleagues, in addition to meeting the most pressing security  challenges we face as a Nation today, this bill supports our  servicemembers with a 2.7 percent pay raise, increases parental leave  for military families, improves women's healthcare, and combats  extremism in the military.   Madam Speaker, this is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.
