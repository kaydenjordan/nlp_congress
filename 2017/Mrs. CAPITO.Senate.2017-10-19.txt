 Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1393.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    Thank you, Madam President.   I would like to speak, for my 1 minute, about this amendment, which  prioritizes tax relief for the middle class over the State and local  tax deduction, which disproportionately benefits the wealthy and high  earners.   Only 1 percent of the State and local deduction benefits go to  taxpayers who earn less than $50,000 annually. Tax reform means higher  wages, lower taxes for middle-class workers. To unlock these benefits,  we must reduce expensive deductions that do little to benefit everyday  Americans. Keeping the State and local tax deduction without  modification would cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years. That money  would be better spent on relief for the middle class.   Middle-class workers will benefit from the enhanced 0-percent  bracket, enhanced child tax credit, and lower rates that will be part  of this reform. We cannot let an unwillingness to reduce deductions for  the wealthy stand in the way of relief for the middle-class working  folks of this great country.   I hope my colleagues will join me in prioritizing middle-class  families by supporting this amendment.    Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the christening  of the United States Navy's T-ESB 4 Expeditionary Sea Base, USNS  Hershel ``Woody'' Williams taking place on October 21, 2017. This  vessel is named after the proud West Virginian and last surviving Medal  of Honor recipient from the Pacific theater during World War II. This  ship will serve as a flexible platform to support Special Forces  helicopters and aircraft, as well as counterpiracy and mine  countermeasures.   This ship could not have a better namesake than Woody Williams.  Woody's life is the embodiment of what it means to serve this country,  both in his military service during World War II, and his service to  veterans and Gold Star families in his civilian life. Corporal  Williams' actions on Iwo Jima are the definition of heroism. He went  forward alone, facing deadly machinegun fire from entrenched Japanese  positions and fought bravely for 4 hours, taking out enemy positions  one by one. His actions were crucial to his regiment's success on Iwo  Jima, wiping out a heavily defended Japanese position.   In addition to Woody's wartime heroism, for which he received the  Congressional Medal of Honor, he also has devoted his life to  servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Through the Hershel Woody  Williams Medal of Honor Foundation, he honors Gold Star families who  have lost loved ones that bravely sacrificed their lives in defense of  our freedom by seeking to establish Gold Star Families Memorial  Monuments in all 50 States. His foundation also offers scholarships to  Gold Star children and sponsors outreach programs that educate  communities about Gold Star families and the sacrifice that they have  made. To date, the foundation has established 26 Gold Star Families  Memorial Monuments across the country, with 50 other monuments underway  in 38 States. Woody also served our Nation's veterans for 33 years as a  veterans service representative in the Department of Veterans Affairs.   At 94 years old, Woody continues to be an energetic, unyielding force  for good. I have had the privilege of knowing Woody Williams for many  years, and the christening of this mobile sea base vessel is a  testament to Woody's  [[Page S6638]]  bravery, his dedication to our Nation's servicemembers, and his  unwavering commitment to serving others. I am proud to rise today to  recognize Mr. Williams and congratulate him on the christening of the  USNS Hershel ``Woody'' Williams.                            ____________________
