 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my friends, my  family, my neighbors, and my fellow Americans in rural communities all  across this land. I am proud to represent 29 counties in rural west  Texas. I am grateful that I grew up in a small town--the town of  Plainview, Texas, a little farming community.   We are the sum of many things and many contributions and influences,  and I am thankful for the influences of that town. I am grateful to my  coaches and my teachers. I was inspired by Ms. Becky Taylor, my first  government teacher at Plainview High School. I have countless people to  thank, and as I walk the Halls here, and as I stand on the floor of the  House and cast my vote for the people I represent, I think about all of  those people who have made an investment.   You see, in rural America, they take responsibility for their  community.  [[Page H6281]]  They believe in making investment in all of those young people who are  working their way through the school system, who have big dreams to  make a difference in the world, and I was one of them.   I pray I could be a champion for rural America. I pray I will be an  effective legislator and that I will be a strong voice for a people  that feel often that they don't have a voice. Maybe it is because we  don't have the votes, and maybe it is because we don't have as many  people, but what we don't have in numbers of people, we more than make  up for in our contribution to this country in the food, in the fuel, in  the fiber that we produce in rural America.   The folks who I represent help put food on the table of all  Americans. They put clothes on the backs of all Americans. They help  fuel this great American economy. They give us energy independence.   They allow us to have an affordable, safe, and abundant supply of  food. We take it for granted. When you ask folks around the country,  especially in urban and suburban areas, ``Where does your food come  from,'' many answer, ``The grocery store or the food truck.''                                time  1730    My colleagues and I are standing today to speak about the virtue and  the values of rural America and the contribution to this great  experiment in democracy and liberty. We know that it is by the blood,  sweat, and tears of farmers and ranchers all across this great land.   I love everything about rural America, Mr. Speaker. I love the  people, I love the values, and I love our way of life. We are not just  the energy basin, and we are not just the breadbasket. We are the  backbone of this country. If you lose rural America, then you lose  something very special. You lose those traditional American values that  are at the heart of the greatness of this country.   They are counting on us--all of us who represent rural communities-- to fight for them. If you think about this Presidential election, more  than 70 percent of rural communities and people living in rural areas  in the swing States voted for our President. They felt voiceless and  powerless. They felt like they were losing their country, and they  wanted their country back. They were tired of political correctness.  They were tired of do-nothing institutions and politicians that said  they were going to change things and then--status quo.   They know, as well as anybody, what is at stake in the next few years  and the next several years. This window of time is special. They came  out strong in support of our President because they wanted something  different. They wanted results.   Rural America defines leadership different than we do. They define  leadership as working together to solve problems and deliver results.  If you don't deliver results, you are not a leader in rural America.  The proof is in the pudding. So I am especially excited about this  opportunity in the life of our Nation. I am exceptionally honored to  serve in this august body with so much history.   I am overjoyed that I wear the rural America jersey when I stand on  this floor. I am going to do all I can to fight for the future of this  country, which means I am going to fight for rural America's  traditional values, and I'm not going to apologize for it because,  again, where we come from is a lot of who we are, and who we are is a  whole lot more important than what we do.   I am rural America. I am traditional values. I am from the land of  farmers, ranchers, and public schoolteachers who believe they can have  an impact on a kid and inspire him to believe he can change the world.  You are looking at one of them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Miss Becky Taylor, I thank Coach Cunningham, I  thank Coach Irlebeck, and I thank youth minister Karl Shackleford. I  could go on and on.   I stand on the shoulders of a lot of good people in small town,  middle America, and I don't stand alone. I stand in the company of  great men whom I have met since I have been here. I know a lot of  Americans look at this United States Congress as dysfunctional and do- nothing, and do you know what? They are right in many ways. But I look  at the individuals, and I see some of the most impressive, patriotic  people who want to make a difference.   I am thankful that in this fight for the heart and soul of this  country, in this battle for the identity of our Nation, this  constitutional Republic, I have got folks in the foxhole with me.   To start my foxhole friends who stand on the side of rural America, I  want to introduce a great American, a dear friend, and the president of  our freshman class. He comes from a big swath of rural Michigan,  Michigan's First District. He is a general, he is a soldier, he is a  businessman, and he is a proud granddad. When I think of Jack Bergman,  I think of a leader. He is a leader.   I am proud to serve with Jack Bergman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for  his wonderful, beautiful, and heartfelt words about where he comes  from, how that shaped him, and how deeply he believes in the people in  the country, as we say in west Texas. He talked about a lot of things.  He talked about the folks who work the land, and he talked about  traditional American values. Mr. Speaker, I think you are going to hear  some common themes from my colleagues this evening.   The gentleman also mentioned the burden of Big Government. I said,  coming into this office and after 8 years of the advent and explosion  of Big Government, that when our economy in urban and suburban is like  a patient who is sick, the rural patients are in the ICU because small  businesses, community banks, and family farmers bear a disproportionate  burden when it comes to the trillions of dollars and the cumulative  effect of all the rules and regulations out of the last year.   So rescuing the American economy is about helping a sick patient.  Rescuing the rural economy is getting the patient stabilized and off  life support so we can live to farm, to fight, and to have the kind of  quality of life that we love for another day.   Mr. Speaker, I have got a good friend that I have made since I came  to the United States Congress. The gentleman is from the 12th District  of the great State of Georgia. He is a son of a farmer. I bet he knows  something about working the land. I bet he knows something about a work  ethic. I bet his daddy taught him something about that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen) who is  my friend and a businessman. The gentleman received the Augusta Metro  Chamber of Commerce Small Business of the Year Award, and he will talk  about rural America and why it is so important to making America great.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his  personal experience in agriculture, in a farming family, and a man who  loves all that is good about rural America and knows that what is good  about rural America is what is helping make this country great.   I have got other colleagues that I want to invite to speak. We have  got folks from Illinois, Michigan, and some colleagues from Texas.   I am looking at a guy from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, another new  friend, a dear friend, and a friend of agriculture. He is a guy who not  only knows agriculture because he took a loan out right after  graduating from Western Kentucky and started a farming operation--he  claims it is successful today. I believe him--he was also the ag  commissioner of Kentucky. He served in the Kentucky House, and now he  is lending his expertise and his love for this country and all things  about rural America to the First District of Kentucky.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  his passion and his resolve to be a voice for rural America and for  agriculture. It has been great to serve alongside of him on the  Agriculture Committee.   I have got another dear, new friend and fellow freshman Member of  Congress who is a great American. He hales from the great State of  Louisiana, my wife's home State. He represents the Third District. I  was about to say I have a couple more racehorses for rural America in  the stable. He actually was raised on a horse ranch near Covington,  Louisiana.   He is a veteran and highly decorated law enforcement officer. He is a  man of deep and abiding faith. I say that God probably hears all of our  prayers, but when he speaks and prays with that thick Louisiana accent,  I think he enjoys his prayers more.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins)  and prayerfully ask him to speak about rural America and why it is  important to this country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the great  State of Louisiana for his comments and his heartfelt commitment to his  district, to the farmers, and the ranchers like the ranch he grew up  on. This is personal for Clay Higgins, and I know when he says he is  going to be a champion for rural America, you can take that to the  bank, and I want to thank him for his comments.   I have other colleagues who are here and want to speak loudly and  proudly for the folks from rural America who are counting on us. What  we lack in numbers up here, we got to make up for in strength of  leadership. I am looking at the bench right now, and I am believing  that we can overcome those numbers with effectiveness and with the  strength of leadership and courage that it takes to get something done  in this town and in this institution.   The next gentleman who I want to introduce to the American people who  are watching with great anticipation is another freshman wonder from  the great State of Georgia, whose district is home to a portion of  western Georgia. He went off and got his dental degree and came back to  where he grew up, West Point, Georgia, came back home to small town  America, and I reckon he did for a lot of reasons, but probably at the  top of the list was he wanted to raise his kids in small town America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia's Third District  (Mr. Ferguson), to talk about that and anything else, and there are  lots of great things to talk about with respect to rural America.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  his comments, and what a strong leader he has been for our freshmen  class, and what a great representation of his district in the great  State of Georgia.   And who knows better about the challenges of sustaining rural  communities than a mayor who is fighting the fight at the local level.  And so I am just so grateful that he spoke from his heart this evening  about our friends and family and our neighbors back home in small town  America.   I have got another good friend and a guy who knows something about  rural  [[Page H6285]]  America. His district takes up almost the entire State of Nebraska. He  has had Nebraska as his home and his family's home for six generations.   He served at the local level and at the State level, but his greatest  claim to fame is that he married a good friend of mine who served with  me in the George W. Bush White House, Andrea. And I didn't know him  before Andrea, but she has done a great job of cleaning him up, and I  look forward to his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the Representative from Nebraska's Third  District (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I am honored that the gentleman from  Nebraska joined us to lift our voices high, as our flag of rural  America flies high in this House. We think about those families, those  middle and working class families, every day as we govern on behalf of  the people we represent.   Mr. Speaker, I have got another gentleman who I am learning a great  deal from as I serve with him on the House Agriculture Committee and  the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. He is a very passionate man  from the great State of Illinois' 12th District. He is a firefighter,  the son and grandson of coal miners, and a proud daddy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for  his heartfelt comments about rural America. I am so proud to be  shoulder to shoulder with him in this righteous cause.   Mr. Speaker, I now have the greatest privilege of the night for me,  because this man has been a mentor and a friend for many years and has  probably done as much as anybody to welcome me and coach me up so I can  represent west Texas to the best my abilities. He is from the 25th  District of Texas, and he is an all-American baseball player. Let me  tell you, he won back then and he is winning now. I am just so proud  that he is on the side of rural America and helping rural America win  in the outcomes of public policy so we can keep it strong and vibrant  and keep America great.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the great  State of Texas. I appreciate his friendship, his mentorship, and that  acid test that he taught me when I first stepped foot on the floor of  the House of Representatives--your conscience, your constituents, the  Bible, the Constitution. If you vote that way, you are going to do  right by your children and grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Roger Williams, a great American.   Mr. Speaker, I have another colleague here. He came here because he  feels so passionate about rural America. I am so grateful that he is  here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the great State of Texas  (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  those remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
