 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Alabama for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we have a crisis at the border. Finally, our colleagues  across the aisle have recognized that this is not a manufactured  crisis.   Just this month, over 800,000 illegal aliens have now crossed our  southern border in 2019. That is two times more than crossed in all of  2018.   These numbers are at historic highs in large part due to our broken  immigration system that incentivizes illegal crossings, and H.R. 2203  does nothing to fix it.   This bill does nothing to stop children from being used as pawns by  traffickers to cross our border. This bill does nothing to support law  enforcement officers, which as a lifelong enforcement officer myself, I  take particular issue with. This bill does nothing to hire more  immigration judges, which are desperately needed in order to decrease  the growing and historic backlog of cases that we have now seen. This  bill does nothing to alleviate the pressure on our detention  facilities.   In fact, this bill will make these problems worse; worse, Mr.  Speaker.   Requiring the release of all migrants after 72 hours in detention  will incentivize even more people to cross our southern border, because  they are guaranteed to be released into the interior of our country.   This bill negates the positive steps that President Trump has taken  to secure our southern border.   A bipartisan majority in the House and Senate did not support these  ideas before when we passed the border supplemental in June, and they  will not support them now.   Instead of giving law enforcement the resources they need to keep our  communities safe, House Democrats are tiptoeing around real solutions,  and are more interested in obstructing our President than solving  problems for the American public.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2203.
