 Mr. President, for the past several years, I have heard  some pretty remarkable stories from the other side of the aisle and  from the national media.   We heard from an Atlantic article that the President called  servicemembers killed in action ``losers.'' It was spread all over the  place until it was refuted flatly by 14 different officials who were on  the trip.   We heard claims that the Trump administration has deployed Federal  troops to Portland, and they were taking over the streets of Portland,  until leadership of ICE and of DHS came to Congress and reported what  actually happened, starting with, there were no Federal troops that  went. There was Federal law enforcement there, but it is because it is  a Federal building that was under attack. And they weren't just  aimlessly roaming the streets arresting people, although they did  arrest the people who threw Molotov cocktails at the building.   I have heard that the post office cannot handle the increased volume  of mail, and the Trump administration is intentionally trying to slow  down the post office so mail can't come in, saying with frantic,  breathless voices: It could be 100 million ballots coming in the mail.  Can the post office handle it? Until you find out that 2 weeks before  Christmas last year, the post office handled 2.5 billion pieces of  first class mail just that 1 week--certainly they can handle 100  million ballots coming in over a month.   I heard last summer that the President had taken away toothbrushes  from children at the border--until a group of us were actually at the  border the very next week and went into that exact facility saying  there are no toothbrushes there available for the children and saw a  storeroom full of toiletries--yes, including toothbrushes.   I read the story and followed up with the ICE leadership about  Muslims in our ICE detention facilities being forced to eat pork-- tormenting them by feeding them pork, against their faith--until we  actually followed up on the facts of it and found that story was  completely false.   It seems every day--sometimes multiple times a day--there is a new  accusation that comes out to attack the Trump administration and to  challenge them on every angle of every direction you can possibly do  it.  [[Page S6569]]    And then for the Presiding Officer--you know this full well because I  sat in that same chair for 2 hours last night during our 30 hours of  continuous debate, following Senate rules to conclude a confirmation of  a Supreme Court Justice, and I was quite amazed at some of the things I  heard while I sat in the chair.   I heard things like, well, Amy Coney Barrett should have never even  come out of the Judiciary because Democrats boycotted coming, actually,  to the hearing. If they don't come to the hearing, the nominee cannot  come out; the Republicans have broken the rules.   In fact, some of my colleagues went dangerously close to say: Because  they broke that rule, we are going to break the next rule and pack the  Court. Except they leave out one little thing: That has happened  multiple times before. They did follow the rules. There wasn't a  breaking of the rule in the committee. In fact, one of the Members  speaking last night even said so far as, they broke the rules, except  the Parliamentarian ruled them in order. And so the Parliamentarian was  wrong as well.   At least seven times since 2006--most recently in 2014 when  Democratic Chairman Leahy sent a circuit court judge and two district  judges to the floor, out of committee, when only one member of the  minority was present--not fulfilling ``the rule.''   Republicans did not break the rule as they came out of committee with  Amy Coney Barrett.   I heard over and over again that there has never been a time like  this that anyone has brought a Supreme Court nominee during an election  year like this--except when you actually go back and look at the  history, which I have recounted on this floor before, and multiple of  my colleagues have recounted the actual history. But then last night I  heard once again: Even Abraham Lincoln, the month before the election,  could have put in a nominee for the Supreme Court, and he chose not to,  to wait for the election. All I could do was sit with my mask-covered  face in the presiding chair and smile and think about the Washington  Post article that came out just a few weeks ago when Senator Harris  gave the same lesson about Abraham Lincoln and the Supreme Court. The  Washington Post, the day after, wrote an article titled ``Kamala  Harris's `little history lesson' about Lincoln's Supreme Court vacancy  wasn't exactly true.''   No, Abraham Lincoln didn't hold back and say: I will wait until after  the election. That is not how that occurred. The Senate was not even in  session during that time period. And Abraham Lincoln, in the middle of  the Civil War, was waiting it out, trying to keep his fractured  Republican coalition together and not fracture it by naming someone. In  fact, he shrewdly ended up naming one of his opponents in the  Republican Party as the nominee who would come after he was reelected.   It is interesting to me how things seem to get twisted around in some  of this debate. I heard last night during the debate time that Amy  Coney Barrett refused to answer the questions--the most basic questions  about what she believes about things. The shocking thing is, Amy Coney  Barrett did the exact same thing that Ruth Bader Ginsburg did during  her nomination and that every nominee has said. They said: I am a  judge. I can't tell you how I am going to rule on it because it has to  be based on the facts of the case. It not something I can just make up  on the spot.   In fact, this is what was quoted from Justice Ginsburg when she was  Judge Ginsburg at the time and going through the nomination process.  This is from Judge Ginsburg:         I come to this proceeding to be judged as a judge, not as       an advocate. Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge,       it would be wrong for me to say or to preview in this       legislative chamber how I would cast my vote on questions the       Supreme Court may be called upon to decide. Were I to       rehearse here what I would say and how I would reason on such       questions, I would act injudiciously.        Judges in our system are bound to decide concrete cases,       not abstract issues. Each case comes to the court based on       particular facts and its decision should turn on those facts       and the governing law, stated and explained in light of the       particular arguments the parties or their representatives       present. A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no       forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard       for the specifics of the particular case, it would display       disdain for the entire judicial process.    For some reason Justice Ginsburg was celebrated by the left for not  saying how she would rule, but Amy Coney Barrett has been shown disdain  for saying she is not telling exactly how she will rule on every single  issue.   The most painful thing I heard last night when I was in the Chair and  that I have heard over and over again in the dialogue has been a sad,  personal destruction and deception, pushing Amy Coney Barrett over and  over again as a closet racist and segregationist. I am disappointed  that even this candidate is being challenged as a racist, quiet  segregationist. It is the firebomb thrown into the middle of a  dialogue.   Over and over again, she was challenged by saying what would she do  with Brown v. Board of Education, as if quietly she is a  segregationist.   Over and over again, her concept on originalism was pushed, and here  is how it was framed on the debate on this floor: She is an  originalist. That means she is backward-looking. That means she is  supportive of those White men who supported slavery and would not allow  women to be able to vote because, in their perspective, that is what an  originalist is. They want to go back to slavery and segregation and  removing the rights of women to vote--even saying last night that  originalists go back to the time of child labor.   It is a smear. It is a personal attack, and it is an act of  desperation. It is an attempt to terrify the American people that this  mother of seven is to be feared because she will take away your  healthcare; she will take away your rights; she will remove every  option that protects the rights of individuals in a free society; and,  as was stated last night, she is afraid of ``we the people.''   We have a responsibility in this body to set the tone for the debate.  We disagree on things strongly, and so do the American people. But this  should not be a place of smears and personal attacks and disdain for  each other and for labeling people--something that if we were to sit  down face-to-face and I were to ask the Members on the other side of  this Chamber ``Do you really think that Judge Barrett is a  segregationist?'' I have every confidence that Members on the other  side would say ``No, but it plays well to the base.''   What have we become?   Future Justice Barrett, now Judge Barrett, was labeled over and over  again as a person who doesn't have her own mind, who is running big- dollar donors from the Federalist Society and is just a puppet of the  right, someone who actually was labeled to be groomed by the right for  this position, as if that judge has not studied, worked, and prepared  her entire life to serve.   She has her own mind. She is well prepared. She is eminently  qualified, and she is not a secret racist segregationist coming to take  away healthcare from Americans. She is a judge who has heard 600 cases,  graduated first in her law school class, taught law for 15 years at  Notre Dame University, is well prepared, and, yes, does have this  originalist view of the Constitution, meaning you can't just look at it  and make it say what you want to. People on this floor can try to put  words in her mouth which she has not said, as I heard over and over  again, like her desire is to suppress voters. You cannot change how  well prepared she is for this task and this moment.   I am grateful that America continues to produce great leaders and  great individuals who work hard in their personal lives, who study and  prepare themselves to be ready to do whatever God calls them to do, and  who are intently focused on serving their fellow Americans in the best  way they possibly can.   We ask of Justices one thing--at least I do: Follow the law. It seems  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are terrified that someone  may just come follow the law and that policy arguments may have to be  debated back in Congress again. Well, I hope that is true because there  are policy arguments we need to resolve as a country, but let's resolve  them in this Chamber, not in the one across the street. The one across  the street, let's keep it nonpolitical, focus on just helping Americans  follow the law.   I look forward to voting for Amy Coney Barrett later on tonight, and  I  [[Page S6570]]  look forward to the day when false accusations are seen for what they  really are. Let's do the right thing, and let's do it the right way.   With that, I yield the floor.
