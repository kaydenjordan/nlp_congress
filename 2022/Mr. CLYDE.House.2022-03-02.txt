 Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Johnson's leadership in  this Special Order.   Last night, President Biden had an opportunity to pivot his failing  administration by using the State of the Union to present a new plan  that would actually help the American people and address the multitude  of crises that he created by his policies.   Instead, President Biden wasted his State of the Union speech by  doubling down on his failed agenda and flat-out lying to the American  people.   When I heard his tough talk on sanctioning Russia and his vow to buy  American, I had hope that maybe this would include energy, American oil  and gas. But no, his administration continues to double down on Green  New Deal priorities and promote the purchase of oil and gas from other  countries.   Why would he do that? Why would he encourage the United States to  continue to buy over 635,000 barrels a day from Russia alone? Just look  at the spot price of oil, $114 per barrel today, which means we are  sending Vladimir Putin over $72.5 million every day to fund his war  machine against Ukraine. Every dollar we spend on foreign energy  weakens domestic energy production.   When he spoke about inflation, Biden's only so-called solution to  combat 40-year high prices and hyperinflation was to tell businesses to  lower costs. That was it.   Despite promising that he will secure the southern border, Biden's  severely misguided immigration policies have led to over 2.1 million  illegal encounters at our border in his first year alone, not to  mention record high levels of dangerous drugs like fentanyl flooding  into our communities.   Just today, his own acting assistant secretary of Border Security and  Immigration Policy at DHS admitted in our Homeland Security Committee  meeting that they are actively working to fight against and overturn  the lower-court-mandated remain in Mexico policy at the Supreme Court  level.   Last night, the President conveniently claimed victory over COVID and  urged Americans to stop looking at COVID as a partisan dividing line.  But don't forget, Biden has routinely enforced medical tyranny and used  the pandemic as a weapon to sow division. Throughout his Presidency,  Biden has said that unvaccinated Americans are destroying our economy,  killing our people, and are the root of our country's problems. No, Mr.  President, that is simply not right.   But it was right to say last night that the answer is not to defund  the police. So why the change in message? For years, Democrats have  dangerously called for defunding our brave men and women in law  enforcement. Even candidate Biden said funding should be redirected  away from our police.                                time  1815    Meanwhile, there was no mention of the Biden administration's abysmal  failure in Afghanistan that resulted in 13 fallen heroes, handed  billions of dollars worth of military equipment to the Taliban, and  abandoned Americans behind enemy lines.   After a year of his failed leadership, the American people know good  and well that Biden's speech was nothing but lip service. Actions speak  louder than words, Mr. President. Americans are desperately waiting  for--and deserve--a leader who will act on their behalf to fix the  crises facing our Nation. We are still waiting.
