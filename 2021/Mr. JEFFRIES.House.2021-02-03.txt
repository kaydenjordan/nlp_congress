 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair of the  Budget Committee from the Commonwealth of Kentucky for yielding, as  well as for his tremendous leadership in connection with this  resolution and the effort to deal with this moment that we find  ourselves in this country.   These are challenging times in the United States of America, filled  with pain, suffering, and death. More than 425,000 Americans have died.  Over 26 million Americans have been infected by the coronavirus. More  than 100,000 small businesses have permanently closed. Tens of millions  of Americans have been grappling with unemployment or food insecurity.  Many are on the brink of homelessness.   These are challenging times in the United States of America, filled  with pain, suffering, and death. Now is not the time for obfuscation or  moderation. Now is the time to go big and to decisively deal with the  problems that everyday Americans are confronting.   COVID-19 is a once-in-a-century pandemic. It requires a once-in-a- century, comprehensive, continuing, and compassionate congressional  response. That is what the American Rescue Plan put forth by President  Biden is all about.   We must crush the coronavirus through testing, tracing, treatment,  and vaccinations for every single American. We must provide direct  relief to everyday Americans by increasing survival checks to $2,000  per person. We must lay the foundation to supercharge our economy so we  can build back better for the people. That is what the American Rescue  Plan is all about. That is what today's vote is all about.   Vote ``yes'' so we can move America forward and put this virus behind  us once and for all.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H.
