 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill  that does nothing to stop the unconstitutional collection of Americans'  international communications without first obtaining a warrant, and it  codifies the practice of indiscriminately sweeping up massive amounts  of domestic communications.   What makes us different from those who would harm us is our  commitment to our constitutional values: that we are innocent until  proven guilty and that our government must obtain a warrant and show  probable cause that there is a legitimate reason to listen in on our  conversations.   This bill will further expose people to warrantless prosecutions or  detention and deportation in cases that have absolutely no connection  whatsoever to national security.   I hope we reject this bill, unless we approve the Amash-Lofgren  amendment.
