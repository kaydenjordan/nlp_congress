 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate the John R.  Buchtel boys' basketball team, from Ohio's 13th Congressional District,  for winning their first State title in the program's history.   This past weekend, the Buchtel Griffins defeated Lutheran West 51-49  in a dramatic Division II title game that went down to the buzzer.   As someone who grew up on the west side of Akron, where Buchtel is  located, this title means so much to our community. Buchtel is the  first Akron Public Schools team to win a State boys' basketball  championship since 1986.   The entire 1040 nation is so proud of these student athletes for  their incredible win and their excellence, determination, and work  ethic both on and off the court.   I also congratulate the head coach, Rayshon Dent, and the staff,  trainers, parents, and cheerleaders who all supported this team in  their journey to the State championship.   Ohio's 13th Congressional District is truly the birthplace of  champions, and Buchtel's win cements our status.   Congratulations once more to the Ohio 13 Champion of the Week, the  mighty Griffins, for bringing the 2023 Division II trophy back to  Akron.                            ____________________
