 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Veterans and  Consumers Fair Credit Act (VCFCA) along with Senator Merkley, Senate  Banking Committee Chairman Brown, and many of my colleagues. This  important legislation would extend the bipartisan Military Lending  Act's (MLA) protections for active-duty servicemembers and their  families to all Americans by imposing a nationwide 36 percent cap on  the annual percentage rate (APR) for most extensions of consumer  credit.   The MLA was enacted on a bipartisan basis in 2006 to rein in payday  and other unscrupulous lenders that targeted American troops with  abusive and predatory loans. Unfortunately, the MLA does not protect  veterans or Gold Star families from these exploitative practices. Our  servicemembers and their families should not lose important consumer  protections simply because they retire, separate from honorable  service, or lose their loved ones. As such, our legislation would  extend the MLA' s protections to veterans and Gold Star families as  well as ensure that all Americans are shielded from predatory loans.   Hundreds of millions of American consumers could benefit from a 36  percent APR cap. In states that do not have such a cap, predatory  lenders are permitted to offer loans with triple-digit APRs that trap  individuals in cycles of debt. For instance, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau found that 80 percent of payday loans are rolled over  or renewed within two weeks. This practice can cause borrowers to pay  more in fees than the amount of money they originally borrowed, which  is a sign of predatory lending and poor underwriting.   According to a coalition of community organizations, payday lenders  are known to target the most vulnerable, including seniors, veterans,  and low-income borrowers. Many in these communities were already  struggling to make ends meet before the pandemic, and continuing to pay  exorbitant APRs may cause them to fall deeper into economic insecurity.  This is why it's important to extend strong protections against  unscrupulous lenders to all Americans.   The MLA's successful track record demonstrates that providing for  reasonable, responsible limits on interest rates does not cut off  consumers' access to credit. According to a May 2021 report from the  Department of Defense, ``credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans  are widely available at risk-based rates under the 36 percent  [military] APR'' and ``[s]ervice members continue to have ample access  to necessary credit.''   Moreover, this legislation would follow the trend in many states  towards greater protections against predatory loans. Eighteen states  and the District of Columbia have enacted APR caps of 36% or lower for  payday loans or banned them altogether. Lenders in these states have  incentives to offer more affordable loans that borrowers have an  ability to repay. The same incentives should apply across the nation.   I thank the bill's supporters, including the Consumer Federation of  America, the National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low income  clients), the Center for Responsible Lending, Americans for Financial  Reform, Veterans Education Success, the Military Officers Association  of America, and the National Military Family Association.   I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this important  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Rubio):   S. 2509. A bill to authorize the New Partnerships Initiative to  expand and diversify the partner base of the United States Agency for  International Development and to provide more entry points for  organizations to work with USAID; to the Committee on Foreign  Relations.
