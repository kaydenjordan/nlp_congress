 Mr. Speaker, October is National Pregnancy and  Infant Loss Awareness Month, and I rise today on behalf of every parent  who has suffered a miscarriage, a stillbirth, or an infant loss.   The unanswered questions and mystery, as well as the feelings of  guilt that surround pregnancy loss and the death of a newborn, add to  the excruciating heartache. We see you.   No one should grieve alone. We stand alongside those who have  experienced this great tragedy and do our best to comfort, listen, and  support. We also vow to honor the legacy of those precious lives lost  by working to eliminate preventable infant deaths.   Today, we remember the 1 million pregnancies in the United States  that end in miscarriage, stillbirth, or the death of a newborn baby  each year. Their intrinsic value, no matter how short their lifespan,  is profound.                            ____________________
