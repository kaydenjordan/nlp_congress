 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1181. As a  combat veteran in the Iraq war, the issues we are debating this  afternoon are deeply personal to me.   Veteran suicide has reached crisis levels in this country, and our  failure to do more to help veterans in desperate need of mental health  care is truly shameful. Unfortunately, Republicans have brought forward  a bill today that will make this crisis even worse.  [[Page H2108]]    Here is the plain truth. If we allow people with serious mental  illnesses to purchase dangerous weapons, we are putting their lives and  the lives of their loved ones at risk.   Mr. Speaker, at a time when more veterans are taking their own lives,  we should be debating how to get them greater resources and support,  not easier access to firearms. At least 10--10--esteemed military  leaders, including David Petraeus, Michael Hayden, and Stanley  McChrystal all agree. Here is what they wrote in a heartfelt letter to  Congress:   ``Our Nation is facing a devastating epidemic of veteran suicide. The  bill you are debating comes at a time when an average of 20 veterans  commit suicide each day, two-thirds of whom do so by buying a firearm.   ``We know that nondeployed veterans are at a 61 percent higher risk  of suicide compared to the American civilian population, and deployed  veterans are at a 41 percent higher risk'' than the American civilian  population.   ``When vulnerable veterans have access to firearms, they can do harm  not only to themselves but also to their family members and loved ones.  The impact of these tragedies is felt in communities across our Nation.   ``The VA has submitted over 174,000 names of servicemen and -women  who require a fiduciary to manage their benefits and have been  determined through clear and convincing evidence to meet the Federal  standard for gun prohibition.   ``Of these 174,000, 19,000 are individuals that suffer from  schizophrenia, and another 15,000 have severe PTSD.   ``For these individuals, possession of a firearm could be fatal.''   They conclude by calling the bill before us today ``irresponsible,  dangerous, and life threatening to those who need access to care, not  weapons,'' and I couldn't agree more with that.   The question for my Republican friends is a simple one: Do you know  more about what is best for our veterans than General Hayden? Do you  have a better understanding of what would improve their welfare than  General McChrystal? Do you appreciate their needs more acutely than  General Petraeus? If the answer is no, then you should vote ``no'' on  this bill later today.   Mr. Speaker, if this legislation is signed into law, more veterans  will take their own lives. That is the tragic reality we face. Please  side with General Petraeus and General McChrystal. Side with your  conscience and your values. Side with our veterans. Please vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Law Center to  Prevent Gun Violence regarding a summary of the effect of H.R. 1181.                                                       Law Center to                                            Prevent Gun Violence,                                                     March 10, 2017.                                 Memorandum       To Interested Parties.      From Americans for Responsible Solutions.      Re Effect of H.R. 1181 (2017): Veterans 2nd Amendment           Protection Act.                                   Summary         H.R. 1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, would       mandate that veterans determined to be mentally incompetent       or incapacitated by the Veterans Administration (VA) shall       not be considered to have been ``adjudicated as a mental       defective'' for the purposes of federal firearms law without       a finding by a judge or judicial authority that the veteran       is a danger to self or others.        The VA has reported records to the FBI's National Instant       Criminal Background Check System (NICS) regarding more than       170,000 beneficiaries who were adjudicated as mentally       incompetent under a very different standard. The vast       majority of those incompetency adjudications have been made       (1) without a finding of dangerousness and (2) without the       involvement of a judge or judicial officer.        In short, this bill would drastically change the standard       under which veteran beneficiaries may be considered       ``adjudicated'' for the purposes of federal firearms law, and       it provides no express time limitation to ensure that this       new standard would not be applied to VA adjudications that       occurred before enactment of this bill. As a result, there is       significant concern about how this legislation would affect       veterans who have previously been adjudicated as mentally       incompetent by the VA, and who are, as a result, currently       considered subject to federal law's firearm prohibition.        The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) states       that once a federal department or agency is aware that, when       the basis under which a record was made available to NICS       does not apply, or no longer applies, a federal agency must       ``update, correct, modify, or remove the record from any       database that the agency maintains and makes available to the       Attorney General, in accordance with the rules pertaining to       that database; and (ii) notify the Attorney General that such       basis no longer applies so that the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System is kept up to date.'' A strong       argument could be made that, if H.R. 1181 were to become law,       most beneficiaries who have been found to be mentally       incompetent by the VA could no longer be considered subject       to federal law's firearm prohibition.                              Relevant Language         The relevant language of the bill states: ``Notwithstanding       any determination made by the Secretary under section 5501A       of this title, in any case arising out of the administration       by the Secretary of laws and benefits under this title, a       person who is mentally incapacitated, deemed mentally       incompetent, or experiencing an extended loss of       consciousness shall not be considered adjudicated as a mental       defective under subsection (d)(4) or (g)(4) of section 922 of       title 18 without the order or finding of a judge, magistrate,       or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction that       such person is a danger to himself or herself or others.''        The key phrase is ``in any case arising out of the       administration by the Secretary of laws and benefits under       this title.'' This phrase determines the scope of the       individuals that would be affected by this bill. It is not       limited to cases that the Secretary administers subsequent to       the enactment of the bill, but rather is unbounded in time.       This language could therefore be interpreted to apply to any       case arising out of the administration of these laws and       benefits by the Secretary, regardless of when the case       occurred. If the NICS Section of the FBI follows this       interpretation, it may remove records of these individuals       from NICS.        This would have far-reaching impact. Currently, few if any       mental incompetency determinations by the VA are made by a       judge, magistrate, or judicial authority. These       determinations are made my VA examiners who determine, in the       course of processing veterans' benefits claims, that as a       result of as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or       mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease, a       beneficiary ``lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage       his or her own affairs'' and requires a fiduciary to handle       the disbursement of benefits. Because these beneficiaries       require a fiduciary to handle disbursement of their payments       due to mental incompetence, they are considered to ``lack[]       the mental capacity to . . . manage [their] own affairs . . .       as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental       illness, incompetency, condition, or disease,'' and are       therefore prohibited from possessing a firearm under existing       federal law.        These incompetency determinations may be appealed to the       VA's administrative Board of Veterans Appeals, and then       eventually to federal court, but the federal judges reviewing       the case would be reviewing the VA's finding that the veteran       is mentally incompetent, and would have no basis for       determining whether or not the veteran was ``a danger to       himself or herself or others.'' Determining whether a person       is a danger to self or others is generally outside the       purview of the Veterans Benefits Administration or cases       arising out of the administration of laws regarding veterans'       claims for benefits.        If an incompetent beneficiary seeks relief specifically       from the NICS firearm prohibition, the VA must determine       whether the beneficiary has proven by clear and convincing       evidence that ``he or she is not likely to act in a manner       dangerous to self or others, and the granting of relief is       not contrary to public safety and/or the public interest.''       Essentially, the VA is tasked in these cases with assessing       whether the beneficiary met a substantial burden of proving       non-dangerousness. This does not involve a finding by a       judge, magistrate, or judicial authority. Though veterans may       then appeal an action by the VA denying NICS relief to a       federal district court judge, that judge would be tasked with       reviewing whether the evidence reasonably justified the VA's       determination that the veteran failed to provide clear and       convincing evidence that he or she was not dangerous. It is       not clear even in these rare cases that a judge upholding the       VA's determination would have occasion to make an affirmative       finding that the person was a danger to self or others.        In short, this bill would drastically change the standard       under which veteran beneficiaries may be considered       ``adjudicated'' for the purposes of federal firearms law, and       provides no express time limitation to ensure that this new       standard shall not be applied to previous adjudications by       the VA. It could therefore threaten to implicitly require       that NICS lose nearly every prohibiting mental health record       it has ever received from the VA.                              Limiting Amendment         In order to avoid the loss of these records in NICS, we       suggest amending the phrase ``in any case arising out of the       administration . . .'' to refer only to cases arising       subsequent to the enactment of this law.
