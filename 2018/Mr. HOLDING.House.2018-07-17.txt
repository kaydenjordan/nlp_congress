 Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few words this  morning about the work that we have been doing here in the House to add  workfare requirements to the food stamp program.   President Ronald Reagan once stated: ``The Federal Government  declared war on poverty, and poverty won.'' That is as true today as it  was when President Reagan said it.   Over the last five decades, Congress has spent more than $22 trillion  of taxpayers' money on government welfare programs. The result: 50  years later, the poverty rate stands unchanged. If anyone ever needed  more proof that more government isn't the solution to every problem,  here is the proof.   If you were to measure success solely on how much taxpayer money the  government spends to solve a problem,  [[Page H6267]]  then the government's war on poverty has been wildly successful. After  all, we now have 13 Federal agencies running more than 80 government  welfare programs.   But if we judge success based on how many people have been able to  rise out of poverty to take care of themselves and their families,  these government programs have failed.   So what have we learned after spending $22 trillion? It is simple:  Workfare helps people stand on their own two feet. It helps people get  off the welfare treadmill.   For example, before Congress reformed Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families, also known as TANF, to incorporate a strict work requirement,  there were 4.9 million families on the welfare rolls. Now, thanks to  workfare reforms, we have seen 3.3 million families rise out of welfare  dependence. That is a success.                                time  1015    In 2014, when Maine began enforcing workfare for able-bodied adults  without dependents who are receiving food stamps, the Maine caseload  decreased by 80 percent within months.   The simple requirement that able-bodied adults without dependents  should work in order to receive welfare benefits, paired with job  search assistance and training opportunities, works. It gets people out  of welfare and into the workforce.   We have learned that it makes a profound difference in people's lives  when they understand that welfare is not meant to be a handout but,  actually, a hand up.   Now, we need to apply these lessons about the benefits of workfare to  more government welfare programs like food stamps and housing. That is  especially important today because, with the economy growing, thanks to  tax reform, job openings recently hit a record high of 6.6 million,  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By taking a stand for  workfare requirements, we now have an opportunity to move millions of  Americans from reliance on welfare to work and financial independence.   I commend the House for passing a farm bill that includes a strong  workfare requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents. We have  opened the door to welfare reforms that will help put people on the  road to self-reliance, and I encourage my colleagues to build on this  foundation and continue to stand up for workfare instead of welfare.                            ____________________
