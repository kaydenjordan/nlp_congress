 Madam Speaker, I stand today to reinforce the  importance of the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation  Administration, the FAA, because it is particularly important to  realize that to move this Nation, we must make sure that we protect our  passengers and our flight crew.   Besides the almost $4 billion in airport improvement dollars, in  addition to reinforcing the training and the protection of our crews,  reinforcing pilots' doors, making sure we have diversity and reach out  to all over the Nation to build the aviation industry by reaching out  and training new pilots, as well as ensuring that passengers are  dignified or treated with dignity and have the respect of airlines.   This is a bill that should have the ability to move forward out of  this House, but I am unhappy about how the pilots were treated in terms  of their opposition to the raising of the age. I will continue to work  with the Senate to ensure that we listen to our pilots. I listened, and  I hope that we will finally have an FAA bill that will really be  securing growth and robust leadership in the American aviation  community.   We must respect our pilots. They get us off the ground, they get us  to our destination, and they get us back on the ground. We will  continue to work and fight for our pilots and their issues.                            ____________________
