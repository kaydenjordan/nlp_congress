 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an  impressive and dedicated public servant in Oakland County, Michigan,  Phil Bertolini, who is being honored here in Washington, D.C., this  week.   Phil is the chief information officer of Oakland County and has been  recognized as the 2017 Public Official of the Year by Governing  magazine.   Phil has spent most of his career handling technology issues for the  county and has, most notably, spearheaded a program to help smaller  communities gain access to better technology. In 2011, Phil created a  process online allowing smaller governments to take advantage of  Oakland County's state-of-the-art computing services through G2G Cloud  Solutions.   Due to Phil's hard work and dedication, Oakland County's G2G Cloud  Solutions now provides services to 82 agencies in Michigan and 721  users throughout the United States. Phil's experience and innovative  mindset has earned Oakland County national recognition as a tech  leader, being named as the second-most digitally advanced county in the  country.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to congratulate Phil Bertolini on being  recognized as the 2017 Public Official of the Year. I would like to  personally recognize and thank him for his tireless efforts and  unwavering dedication to the community.                            ____________________
