 Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to take a  moment to honor a good friend, an incredible young man, one of Miami's  best, Patrick Hidalgo, who passed away last week.   Words cannot begin to describe the brightness that Patrick reflected  on the world. His smile was infectious; his passion for life was  palpable; and his empathy made everyone feel seen, feel heard, and feel  valued.   Patrick accomplished more in his lifetime on Earth than many will in  their entire lives. He was a Belen High School grad. He graduated from  Georgetown, Harvard, and MIT. He was appointed by the Obama  administration to work in the White House, and he was a huge driving  force in helping normalize relations with Cuba.  [[Page H1550]]    While Patrick could have done anything with his life, he decided to  move back home to Miami and work to ensure that our city became the  best version of itself, a more equitable, more just, more accessible  place for all Floridians. He recently cofounded the Miami Freedom  Project to achieve just that.   I know that Patrick has found his freedom and his peace. We will  honor his legacy by working to ensure that our city is a more just and  freer place.   Patrick, you touched the lives of so many people from so many walks  of life. You made us better. You challenged us. You believed in us. We  promise to honor your legacy.   May you rest in peace, Patrick.                            ____________________
