 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  2954, the Securing a Strong Retirement Act, also known as SECURE 2.0.   It is a sad reality that today too many hardworking Americans enter  retirement without enough savings.   In fact, according to a recent report, only 36 percent of working  adults feel their retirement savings are on track to meet their goals  and more than one-third of U.S. workers have never even had a  retirement account.   It's clear that millions of Americans could face a financial crisis  during their retirement years. Congress can help head off this  avoidable emergency and give individuals, families, and businesses more  tools to boost their retirement nest eggs.   Last year, the House Ways & Means Committee unanimously passed the  bipartisan Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2021, legislation  providing new incentives to help improve the retirement financial  landscape for Americans across the country.   This bipartisan retirement savings bill seeks to build on the  momentum from legislation that passed last Congress.   Specifically, this important new legislation would double the  existing tax credit for businesses with 50 or fewer employees that  start a company retirement plan, expand-auto-enrollment, push back the  withdrawal retirement age, and allow workers to double their catch-up  contributions. This bipartisan bill also authorizes new protections for  people paying down student loan debts and incentives to America's  veterans.   SECURE 2.0 is also completely budget neutral.   Retirement doesn't have to turn into another U.S. financial crisis.  With responsible incentives and smart planning, we can give more people  the peace of mind they deserve as they grow older. I'm pleased to see  Congress put aside partisan games and finally come together to enact  SECURE 2.0 and strengthen America's retirement security.
