 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R.  2824, the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents  through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act.   We need more support for early childhood, and to support families in  that effort. They need to be evidence-based programs to ensure that we  get more of the right beneficial programs implemented.   This bill seeks to strengthen the home visiting services to families  in at-risk communities, and that is important because it will help  reduce infant abuse and neglect across America.   The law's six benchmark areas will improve maternal and newborn  health and will increase families' economic self-sufficiency. It also  looks to better the coordination between community resources.   I would like to thank Chairman Brady and Chairman Smith for putting  forth this piece of legislation.                                time  1415    Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson).
