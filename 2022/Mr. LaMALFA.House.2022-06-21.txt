 Madam Speaker, as we are becoming painfully aware as  Americans, energy independence is vital to our national security and  our everyday lives.   America needs to embrace a true energy policy that supports every  type, from natural gas, oil drilling, nuclear, hydroelectric, and the  other renewables. We cannot simply declare that some methods of power  generation are off limits like the Biden administration and others have  been trying to do to natural gas and oil.   Energy production of all kinds is important for rural economies which  provide jobs, income at the farm level and at the wildcatter level, tax  revenue, et cetera.   Take California, for example. We are the leading State in biomass  production, right, our crowded forests, untended for so many years due  to policies of the Forest Service getting sued to not do anything  before or after a fire.   So in my northeast part of the State, we have millions of tons of  waste biomass just sitting on our forest floors, dry, decomposing,  turning into CO2, waiting to be part of the next  catastrophic forest fire which we see happening in overabundance.   The Dixie fire started in my district last year--one million acres-- when a tree fell into a power line.   Using biomass is a win-win-win for everybody. It brings local jobs,  putting our workers in these rural towns that are suffering  economically for years due to the shutdown of this timber industry,  basically, putting those folks back to work, tending to work that needs  to be done to have forests thinner, cleaner, healthier, and less fire- prone.   But as we continue toward green energy and strict carbon and  environmental regulations which only recently began, we are seeing that  other forms of energy are not being available, too.   Nuclear. Nuclear energy is a serious alternative energy source and  really shouldn't be alternative because it is CO2-free. It  has been around for a long time, but for some, it isn't politically  correct.   California has one remaining nuclear reactor, the one at Diablo  Canyon, not too far from San Luis Obispo, where my tie comes from.  Diablo Canyon takes up only 900 acres of land and provides nearly 10  percent of California's energy portfolio, almost 10 percent in  one power plant, and they want to take it offline because it is not  politically correct.    Of course, in California, it is responsible for 23 percent of our  carbon-free generation, if you want to play the carbon game.   In a State that faces rolling blackouts to our grid every summer,  every time the wind blows because we don't want tree branches falling  into power lines, we can't fare without that 10 percent of energy  provided by nuclear power, which doesn't have that threat.   Nuclear power plants are cheaper to run than most, even accounting  for managing and disposing of radioactive material, which there are  ways to deal with the radioactive leftovers, too, if we can just get to  them.   Nuclear power is consistent, 24/7. Unlike solar and wind, it is  available all the time. It is not affected by the clouds or lack of  wind. Solar and wind power do have their place in our portfolio, but we  know we can't completely rely upon them.   We can't build enough batteries to store enough power without having  mines in Africa taking advantage of kids' labor to put them in place.   When a wildfire inevitably rages like it has year after year, sending  thick, black smoke into the air, our solar panels are obscured by ash  and screened from direct sunlight. The solar and wind systems just  don't put out what they need to in order to have a modern grid.   Our State has already inexplicably banned the sale of gas-powered  backup generators. What are people supposed to do at their homes? When  they take away backup generators that are gas-powered, what are you  supposed to power them with, a battery? Ridiculous.   One of the most critical sources of renewable energy along the entire  Pacific Northwest is hydroelectric generation. It accounts for about 12  percent of our State's total portfolio and is the cheapest form of  renewable energy available.   It is about 50 percent the cost of nuclear, 40 percent the cost of  fossil fuels, and 25 percent the cost of using natural gas. Yet, it  faces numerous obstacles as well.   They want to remove the dams. They are calling it the largest ever  dam removal project--they are so proud of, it seems--up on the Klamath  Basin, up on the Klamath River.   Four dams: the J.C. Boyle, Copco No. 1 and No. 2, and Iron Gate are  scheduled to be removed, if they have their way. That will take  renewable, available 24/7, power to over 70,000 homes offline, and it  will have to be replaced by miles and miles of solar panels or  windmills chopping up birds someplace.   Why do they want to remove this? Because of political correctness.  They hope that maybe it will help the river have slightly cooler water  for salmon spawning, maybe 1 degree, but it won't really work that way  because it is going to leave all sorts of silt and hurt the Klamath  River.   So one thing after another. We have to find a reliable energy source.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, for months, the Democrats and the liberal  media have been intentionally falsely accusing Border Patrol agents of  whipping illegal immigrants coming across our southern border. The  media falsely mislabeled the agents' long reins, which they use to  control their horses, as whips.   Of course, where are all the fact checkers about this information? I  guess they are absent over at The Washington Post and CNN.   Yet, the Biden administration's Department of Homeland Security isn't  interested in the truth, either. They want to punish these Border  Patrol agents who are doing their job and arresting illegal immigrants.  Following a false narrative and special interest pressure, the DHS has  announced plans to discipline these folks on horseback involved in the  so-called incidents.   Prosecuting these law enforcement officers will do nothing but lower  the already-low morale at the CBP.   The Biden administration's open-border and soft-on-crime policies  have incentivized 2 million illegal immigrants to come across our  southern border and have stripped Border Patrol agents from having the  authority to stop it. Instead, they have become Welcome Wagon workers.    There is a caravan of illegal immigrants, nearly 20,000 strong,  awaiting the day Biden fulfills his destructive promise of ending the  border protections under title 42.   We need a true border policy that protects Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Hern's strong effort in  helping shepherd our budget concept through the RSC to get back to  fiscal responsibility and make sure it is on the front burner.   I am also pleased to follow my good colleague from New York, too. You  have California and New York, and if you throw in Illinois, you don't  see a whole lot of conversation coming out that you want the country to  emulate as far as fiscal responsibility. I hope that is a bit of a  breath of fresh air.   We are looking at the situation we are in right now as a country. It  is just unbelievable, in this last 15, 16, 18 months, just how far it  has turned upside down. We can't blame it all on COVID. We have to look  at the policies that have been put in place.   Yes, we did spend a lot of money in Washington, D.C., on the COVID- era problems. Some of it is justified. Some of it is completely out of  control.   There are still COVID dollars sitting in little pots somewhere that  people are envying and wanting to turn into things that are completely  unrelated, just make it slush-fund-type stuff. That is not right  because these are the American people's dollars. This is the American  people's debt.   Unfortunately, we are just adding debt to it. We don't really have  sustained income to back up the money we have been borrowing from the  future on this. When you couple that with the inflation that we are  dealing with now, when we are looking at interest rates that are edging  up in order to basically try, essentially, to put the brakes on  government spending, that is what has driven this.   The higher numbers for interest rates, for payments on American debt,  are going to devour our ability to budget on things that we actually do  want to do and care about around here. If the interest rates and  interest payments are so high, we can't do the elective part of our  national budgeting. That is going to be horrendous for the American  people.   Mr. Hern, when we are looking at the overall inflation picture with  the numbers we are talking about earlier, 8.6 percent, we know it is a  lot higher. I can echo what Mr. Barr was saying a while ago. My  farmers--I am a farmer myself in my real life--we are not seeing a mere  8 percent on fertilizer, diesel, parts, tires, service calls, on  everything. It is a much higher number than that.   My family grows rice and has been doing it for nearly 100 years. My  colleagues and my neighbors have been doing the same thing. How are we  going to afford to be able to put food on the table for the American  people that is affordable? I just don't see that. With what you are  dealing with in Oklahoma on energy--your energy helps us.    Mr. Speaker, it is fascinating that he would say that.  You plug it into the wall.   I just saw a recent interview with a major figure with a major car  manufacturer introducing and talking about their electric vehicles.  They were questioned at that press conference: Where is the power  coming from to charge this electric car?   Well, from that building right over there.   Okay. It is a building, but it is not a generation plant.   Well, I don't really know.   Another person in the group answered and said: Well, this is powered  by a source that is about 90 percent coal-driven.   I am not against coal. I think coal is great. It has powered our  country for many decades. It is extremely important and shouldn't just  be phased out. It is still at least 35 percent.   The naivety of a major manufacturer not understanding that the  electricity has to come from somewhere, and it is going to have to be  somehow reasonably priced in order to make it somehow work for this big  dream they have of electrifying everything, it is unbelievable what the  people are going to face.   As Mr. Hern mentioned, President Biden called it the incredible  transition. The people I know, the regular folks, haven't been asked if  they want to transition to electric vehicles or an electric stove or  anything else. They want to just stick with what they have because you  are looking at the price of electric vehicles, which are $50,000,  $60,000, $70,000. The price is bumping up, and they have to recall them  because things aren't working quite right.   We are force-feeding something just because government can mandate  and pass a law that--hey, we are just going to require that you do it.  Well, the market and technology don't always keep up with the whims of  a dream that somebody would have in a bureaucracy.   Phase them in, but we are looking at an issue that is being force-fed  in the Biden plan to have an incredible transition. It is incredibly  painful to the American public.   That is why the direction that the RSC budget is trying to go is to  achieve balance finally. If we are going to service more and more debt  at a higher interest rate, and we keep adding the numbers, as my  colleague from New York was talking about--if the Biden plan calls for  $73 trillion of increased spending over what we are already doing at a  deficit over the next 10 years, we have big trouble.   Government doesn't always do that well with a dollar spent. In the  hands of the American people, they are going to make the best decisions  for their families on: Do they want to upgrade their car? Do they need  to add a room to their house for an expanded family? Are they going to  redo their garage or redo their roof? Maybe they are even going to take  a vacation if they can afford the $7 gas in California to run an RV and  go see Yellowstone or something.   It is amazing how this place continues to think that the massive  deficit spending is going to somehow benefit the economy. It doesn't  work that way. Inflation drives higher prices to the end-users, driven  by government spending. We have to get it under control.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Hern's work is really stellar on trying to put this  out there. This should really be nonpartisan, Republicans and  Democrats. The blueprint for this would be back in the mid-1990s when  we achieved a balanced budget, I believe it was 4 years in a row, with  President Clinton coming to the table and working with Newt Gingrich  and Senator Dole and others on actually passing four balanced budgets  in a row.    That is credit everybody can take for having a strong economy at the  time. I think it would still be a legacy of the Reagan and Bush years,  where we put things back on track of having an income that they  benefited from in that context.   Mr. Hern, what do you see as far as that blueprint of balancing back  then as something we can emulate here?
