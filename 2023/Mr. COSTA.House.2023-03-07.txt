 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  extreme winter storms that continue to batter California and the West  Coast, leaving some Californians stranded in their homes and  communities across the State with damaged infrastructure. Approximately  16 million people have been impacted in recent weeks.   Last week, Governor Newsom declared a state of emergency for 13  counties, including Tulare County, which I represent, and other  important areas. State officials estimate damage costs could surpass $1  billion.   California's snowpack is approaching record levels in California's  Sierra Nevada. In most cases, that would be good news. Officials  believe this may rival the 1982-1983 snow year.   However, this is good news for a State that has suffered long-term  drought that forced residents to cut usage and ration water, farmers to  fallow hundreds of thousands of acres of productive land, and left  landowners with a record number of dry wells in the Central Valley.  That was just a few months ago.   However, now the situation has changed. We now have to do a better  job of managing in real time long-term water regulations that aren't  working. We need to be better prepared to avoid what happened in  communities like Planada and others where flooding damaged farms and  displaced farmworkers.   That is why we need to fast-track improvements to our water  infrastructure, using every tool in our water toolbox to divert water  to recharge overdrafted aquifers. You can see from the snowpack here  and from the flooding there, this is what has been occurring since the  beginning of the first of the year. Therefore, we must increase water  storage in all ways in wet years, like this one, to ensure that we can  withstand the dry spells.   If we would have completed projects like the Sites Reservoir, which  has been talked about for years, we would have been able to store 1.5  million additional acre-feet of water.   Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, we do have Federal  dollars available to expand projects that are currently in progress:  Los Vaqueros and Del Puerto Reservoirs and raising the dam at the San  Luis Reservoir, which is expected to be filled in the next 45 days.   Mr. Speaker, in addition, this weekend, we are going to have a major  test in California because forecasters are predicting another  atmospheric river that will provide warm storms, which could melt  recent snow up in the mountains. When warm water hits that snow, it  melts. If that happens, our rivers will carry a deluge of water toward  vulnerable communities that we may not be able to protect.   These massive fluctuations, from extreme wet years to extreme dry  periods, are a result of climate change, and we need to make smart  investments to do a better job to prepare for the new reality. Knowing  this, we need to make real changes in how we allow water managers to  adjust and focus on real-time operations, not some predetermined date  rooted in decades-old data.   I commend Governor Newsom for issuing an executive order to expand  California's capacity to capture storm runoff during these wet times by  accelerating groundwater recharge projects, which is absolutely  necessary.   Last week, the Bureau of Reclamation announced an initial allocation  of 35 percent for south-of-the-delta agriculture and water service  contractors. We can and should do better. It is understandably a  conservative initial allocation, but now we have more heavy rains  coming. It is time to raise those allocations to the highest feasible  levels. We must divert water to our communities and farmers who are  ready and willing to take water to recharge groundwater.   Toward the future, I am working to rewrite the farm bill this year to  improve water conservation, enhance opportunities for groundwater  recharge so that our overdraft aquifers reach sustainability. The  people of the San Joaquin Valley deserve no less.   California, with a new water blueprint needs to invest, invest the  $1.2 trillion in the bipartisan infrastructure law, $4.5 billion for  drought relief. Taking action and mastering real-time  [[Page H1118]]  management will mean that no one goes without having access to clean  drinking water; our farmers can grow food--where water flows, we say  food grows--for our country and for other parts of the world that need  that food; and our environment can thrive. That is what we must do.   We have a current crisis. We must act now to address that crisis, and  that is a challenge we face.                            ____________________
