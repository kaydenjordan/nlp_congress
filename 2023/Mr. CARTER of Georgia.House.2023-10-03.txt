 Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Lanna Aldridge Denison.   This July, Lanna passed away following a fight with a sudden illness.  She was known for her radiant smile and her love for others. She earned  her position as principal of Blackshear Elementary through her years of  dedication and hard work, earning many accolades, including being named  district coordinator of student learning objectives for Pierce County  Schools and director of student achievement in 2017.   She transformed her school through her tireless and creative efforts,  making it a happy, thriving place for the 800 students who looked up to  her.   She took every opportunity to put others first and lift their  spirits. It was never too early or too late to call her for anything.  She truly put everyone else first and many called her their best  friend.   Ms. Lanna will forever be known as someone who ``loved big'' and her  impact will be felt for decades to come.           Congratulating Errol Roach on 40 Years of Teaching Music     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Savannah native Errol Roach for hitting a major milestone. This past  June he celebrated his 40th anniversary of teaching music.   At just 4 years old, Mr. Roach was able to play music by ear, and  that began his lifelong passion for music. He attended what is now  Savannah State University, where at just 19 years old, he started  passing down his love of music through teaching lessons out of his  parents' home in Carver Village.   Mr. Roach founded the Sound of Joy School of Music in Savannah,  Georgia, and was recognized for reaching this milestone of teaching  through a proclamation from Savannah Mayor Van Johnson.   The slogan for Mr. Roach's school is ``for a world of harmony.'' He  hopes his students will continue to pass on the gift of music and  harmony for many more generations to come.   Madam Speaker, I take this moment to congratulate Mr. Roach on  reaching this significant milestone, and I know that he will continue  to touch many through his love of music.                     75th Anniversary of Central Hardware     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  75th anniversary of Central Hardware. Central Hardware opened on  Norwich Street in downtown Brunswick in 1948 and quickly became known  as ``The Store of 10,000 Items.''   The store is still family owned and is managed by Anne Strother and  her brother Baxter Shaw. Their father, Jimmy Shaw, always emphasized  the importance of quick, friendly customer service and competitive  pricing. This is the main reason the store has survived in the face of  competition from big-box stores.   Shaw taught his children everything about the business, and they  continued managing it the way he did.   I am proud to say Central Hardware has been an important part of the  First District community for 75 years now. Again, I congratulate them  on their success, and I know they will continue to bless our community  for many more years to come.                            ____________________
