 Madam Speaker, here is a quote: ``I just don't even know  why there aren't uprisings all over the country. And maybe there will  be.''   Or, ``Sadly, the domestic enemies of our voting system and honoring  our Constitution are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue with their  allies in Congress of the United States.'' We were called enemies of  the state.   Those are all quotes from our Speaker.   Now, on our side, we didn't take those to be impeachable because we  didn't believe she surely meant that. By the Democrats taking this  action, you are telling me, no, when we say those words, we actually  mean to incite violence. That is what this action is saying.   Look, I just looked on the History Channel. It says these words: ``If  the Judiciary Committee,'' talking about impeachment, ``finds  sufficient grounds, its members write and pass Articles of Impeachment,  which then go to the full House for a vote.''   Half of all of the impeachments ever conducted, ever voted for,  occurred under this Speaker. You are setting a precedent that says very  clearly--because this impeachment isn't going to work, but it is  setting the precedent.   Unlike a year ago, when we said, look, it shouldn't go through the  Intelligence Committee, it should go through the Judiciary Committee,  forget that. Now the message is: If you have a whim and you want to  just go after a President, just go straight to the floor--no  investigation, no Judiciary Committee. Go straight to the floor. Use it  as a political weapon as you wish.   This is so dangerous, what you are doing, forgetting all the  precedents. Yes, we can argue back and forth, but you are using this as  a weapon, and you are destroying this little experiment in self- government in a year's time. It needs to stop.
