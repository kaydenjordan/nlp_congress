 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule  governing debate on H.J. Res. 40, and the underlying legislation,  because in a nation that leads the civilized world in deaths by gun  violence, the last thing we should be doing is making it easier for  persons suffering from a very severe, long-term, mental disorder that  makes them incapable of managing their financial benefits and unable to  do any kind of work in the U.S. economy, even part-time or at very low  wages to obtain deadly firearms.   The Republicans have brought to the floor this week a Congressional  Review Act (CRA) of Disapproval to overturn Social Security  Administration (SSA) regulations to comply with existing federal law  governing the submission of records to the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System (NICS).   H.J. Res. 40, would vacate an important rule issued by the Social  Security Administration implementing the NICS Improvement Amendments  Act of 2007.   That law, which we adopted in the wake of the tragic mass shooting at  Virginia Tech, requires federal agencies to report to the National  Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) records of individuals  who are statutorily prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms.   The statute was enacted with bipartisan support, and we should stand  together to defend efforts to see that it is fully implemented.   Let us be clear what a submission vote on this legislation is about:  the Republican's goal is to weaken our firearms background check  system.   The shootings at Virginia Tech in April 2007 presented the deadliest  shooting rampage in U.S. history.   On April 16 2007, the violence began around 7:15 a.m., ending in the  deaths of 32 students and teachers after being gunned down on the  campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University by Seung  Hui Cho, a student at the school, who later died from a self-inflicted  gunshot wound.   Only four months prior, on December 13, 2005, Cho had been ordered by  a judge to seek outpatient care after making suicidal remarks to his  roommates and was subsequently evaluated at Carilion-St. Alban's mental  health facility.   On February 9, 2007, Cho picked up a Walther P-22 pistol that he  purchased online, just days before, on February 2 from an out-of-state  dealer at JND Pawn shop in Blacksburg, across the street from Virginia  Tech.   In March of 2007, Cho purchased a 9mm Glock pistol and 50 rounds of  ammunition from Roanoke Firearms for 571 dollars.   The attack, resulting from these preventable actions, left 30 people  dead and another 17 wounded.   In all, 27 students and five faculty members died as a result of the  actions of a known mentally unstable individual who was nonetheless  allowed to purchase a firearm.   On December 14, 2012, Lenny Pozner dropped off his three children,  Sophia, Arielle, and Noah, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,  Connecticut.   Noah had recently turned 6, and on the drive over they listened to  his favorite song, for what turned out to be the last time.   Half an hour later, while Sophia and Arielle hid nearby, Adam Lanza  walked into Noah's first-grade class with an AR-15 rifle.   Noah was the youngest of the 20 children and seven adults killed in  one of the deadliest shootings in American history.   Depending on whom you ask, there were twenty-six, twenty-seven, or  twenty-eight victims in Newtown.   It is twenty-six if you count only those who were murdered at Sandy  Hook Elementary School; twenty-seven if you include Nancy Lanza--Adam's  own mother; twenty-eight once Adam turned the gun on himself.   There are twenty-six stars on the local firehouse roof.   On the anniversary of the shootings, the governor of Connecticut  asked churches to ring their bells twenty-six times.   Americans have spoken and they are outraged by the countless,  needless gun related deaths claiming the lives of their children.   To ensure the continued safety of American families, the Gun Control  Act of 1968 prohibits certain categories of individuals from possessing  firearms, including those who, using outdated terminology, are  ``adjudicated as a mental defective.'' (This is referred to as the  ``federal mental health prohibitor.'')   The 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requires federally  licensed firearms dealers to run background checks on prospective gun  purchasers through NICS.   NICS includes records from various databases on individuals who are  prohibited by law from purchasing and possessing firearms.   In response to the mass shootings at Virginia Tech, prior to which  the shooter's mental health prohibitor should have been, but was not,  reported to NICS, Congress in 2007 unanimously approved legislation to  adopt the NICS Improvement Amendments Act.   As senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland  Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, I supported the 2016  Social Security Administration (SSA) rule, which committed the SSA to  submit records to the gun background check system for social security  recipients prohibited from possessing guns due to severe mental  illness.   It is a critical process for enforcing the law that bars prohibited  people from passing background checks and purchasing firearms.   The only way we are going to prevent guns from getting into the hands  of people who should not have them, people who pose a known and  documented danger to themselves and others, is through a system based  on robust, accurate and complete information.    Prior to the new SSA rulemaking, the agency had no process for  submitting records of prohibited people to the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System (NICS).   NICS therefore, has been missing records for those prohibited  individuals.   NICS is only as good as the records it contains.   With those records missing from the system, these individuals are  able to pass a background check and complete a purchase even though  they are legally prohibited from purchasing guns under longstanding  federal law.   The SSA regulation closes this gap by committing the agency to begin  submitting prohibiting records into the gun background check system.   The rule does not impact any beneficiaries who are not already  prohibited under law, and does not impact people based on disability  findings that have been made prior to the rule taking effect.   Americans have spoken and they are outraged by the countless,  needless gun related deaths claiming the lives of their children.   Under the regulation, only individuals with the most severe mental  impairments, who are (1) unable to earn any income due to their mental  incapacity, and (2) have been found incapable of managing their own  benefits meet the NICS reporting system cautionary criteria to report  the names of certain individuals who are prohibited by law from  purchasing or possessing firearms to the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System (NICS).   SSA has evaluated legal, medical and lay evidence and determined that  these individuals are not capable of managing their own benefits.   SSA estimates that about 75,000 people per year will meet these  criteria for reporting to NICS.   Disability examiners make the determination based on medical and  other evidence, but physicians or psychologists review the evidence and  sign off on the cases.   An individual who has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, suffers from  hallucinations and delusions, and most days cannot care for herself-- feeding, dressing, communicating with those around her.   Her symptoms and medical history meet the criteria in the listing for  schizophrenia.  [[Page H838]]    She receives disability benefits and has a representative payee.   She would meet the criteria for reporting.   An individual who has significant intellectual disability that  prevents him from working at any level (i.e., he meets the listing for  intellectual disability), and is unable to understand how to pay rent  or use his benefits to buy food.   He qualifies for disability benefits and has a representative payee.   He would meet the criteria for reporting.   Placing anyone into the NICS as a ``prohibited person'' is not  something we should take lightly, but it is a task that must be done in  limited circumstances and as required by statute.   The circumstances addressed by this rule require that we work  together on this serious and unfortunate issue.   The Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of Disapproval would,  if passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President, deem the  rule to have not been in effect at any time and would also prohibit SSA  from reissuing a rule that is substantially the same.   The Republican's use of the CRA process to overturn the rule is an  extreme exercise in bad governance.   Rather than fixing or improving the rule, it would ban reporting by  the SSA entirely.   There would be no opportunity to simply improve aspects of the rule,  and we would prevent full implementation of the law we enacted after  the Virginia Tech shooting.   I cannot support that result and therefore oppose this resolution,  and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Subverting long-standing gun safety laws under the guise of  protecting Constitutional rights, while simultaneously pushing for  repeal of health reform laws that provided care to these communities  rings hollow.   Now is not the time to weaken our background checks system by  excluding those with the most severe and incapacitating forms of mental  impairment.   The Social Security Administration should be commended for its  efforts to keep children and families safe by following the lead of  other agencies and enforcing laws that have been on the books for  decades.   I urge you to oppose this Republican scare tactic of a rule, and the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 71 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       724) to provide that the Executive Order entitled       ``Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the       United States'' (January 27, 2017), shall have no force or       effect, to prohibit the use of Federal funds to enforce the       Executive Order, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 724.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to  acknowledge the fallen Navy SEAL officer in Yemen and offer my concern  to his family. I will rise tomorrow to continue my questioning on that,  but today I wanted to make sure that I prayerfully acknowledged the  sacrifice he made for this Nation.   I rise today because we are one step further for the nominee for the  Attorney General of the United States of America. And I join my  colleagues in the Senate, the other body, who raised concern of not  being able to inquire of Mr. Sessions what his position would be on  what has been determined by five courts, at least, of the  unconstitutionality of the executive order. It is a ban on Muslims, it  is a violation of the First Amendment, equal protection of the law, and  due process--First Amendment being freedom of religion.   Therefore, we now have an Attorney General making the first step, Mr.  Sessions, where we do not know whether you will be able to embrace the  laws that protect the most vulnerable women, children, the civil rights  of many, and the voting rights of many, and, frankly, I believe those  questions should be answered.   I conclude by saying, when you questioned Deputy Attorney General  Yates, she was able to say that she would stand as an independent,  objective person Attorney General having oversight over the White  House. Will you be able to do the same?                            ____________________
