 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1017, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3617) to decriminalize and deschedule cannabis, to  provide for reinvestment in certain persons adversely impacted by the  War on Drugs, to provide for expungement of certain cannabis offenses,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 3617.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3617, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and  Expungement Act, or the MORE Act, is long-overdue legislation that  would reverse decades of failed Federal policies based on the  criminalization of marijuana. It would also take steps to address the  heavy toll these policies have taken across the country, particularly  among communities of color.                                time  0915    For far too long, we have treated marijuana as a criminal justice  problem, instead of as a matter of personal choice and public health.  Whatever one's views are on the use of marijuana for recreational or  medicinal use, the policy of arrests, prosecution, and incarceration at  the Federal level has proven both unwise and unjust.   That is why the MORE Act would set a new path forward and would begin  to correct some of the injustices of the last 50 years. The bill  decriminalizes  [[Page H4088]]  marijuana at the Federal level by removing it from the Controlled  Substances Act. This change applies retroactively to prior and pending  convictions. It does not, however, undermine the ability of States to  apply their criminal laws to marijuana or to legalize and regulate it  as they see fit.   The bill also eliminates barriers to medical research, allows the VA  to recommend medical marijuana to veterans living with PTSD, and it  allows financial institutions to service the marijuana industry. It  provides for expungement or resentencing of certain Federal marijuana  arrests and convictions and supports expungement programs at the State  and local levels.   In addition, the bill authorizes a sales tax on marijuana sales and  directs those revenues to an Opportunity Trust Fund to support  communities harmed by the war on drugs. It also establishes a wide  range of grant programs to support equal access to the benefits of  decriminalization.   When it comes to our immigration laws, the bill prospectively and  retroactively ensures that marijuana will not be considered a  controlled substance, directly mirroring the protection and relief  under the criminal justice provisions of the bill. This protects  individuals from the collateral consequences for marijuana activity and  ensures that immigrants can participate in their State's legal cannabis  industry.   In recent years, 36 States and the District of Columbia have  legalized medical cannabis. Nineteen States and the District of  Columbia have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use.   If States are the laboratories of democracy, it is long past time for  the Federal Government to recognize that legalization has been a  resounding success and that the conflict with Federal law has become  untenable.   While I am proud to be the sponsor of this legislation, there are  many people who are responsible for getting us to this point today. I  want to thank them for their efforts.   This includes Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the mother of this movement,  and Congressman Blumenauer, whose dogged persistence was critical to  moving this legislation forward. Congressman Cohen has also been a  long-time champion and an important voice in the movement for reform,  as has Congresswoman Jackson Lee, who helped shepherd this legislation  to the floor.   I also want to thank Chairman Neal, who has been a critical partner  in drafting the revenue provisions in this bill and in helping move  this legislation to the floor, as well as Chairman McGovern, who  structured a good debate on this bill.   Finally, Speaker Pelosi, Whip Clyburn, and Chairman Jeffries have all  been steadfast in their support of this legislation, and I want to  particularly thank Majority Leader Hoyer for everything he has done to  bring this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, criminal penalties for marijuana offenses, and the  resulting collateral consequences, are unjust and harmful to our  society. The MORE Act comprehensively addresses these injustices, and I  urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would command the attention of the  gentleman to the sections of the bill that deal with all the different  problems he raised.   I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), the distinguished chairman of the Democratic  Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, this bill will greatly reduce crime by  redefining as not crimes things that are now considered crimes. And by  releasing people in jail who should not be in jail, it will produce  justice and it will reduce the expenses to the public.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), who has been such a great champion in the fight  for this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.  [[Page H4096]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), another great champion of this legislation.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Bentz refers to the cartels. Of course there are  cartels. Of course they are making money because they have a monopoly  of supply of a substance that has a great demand. If you pass this bill  then those cartels will no longer have a monopoly and law enforcement  expenses will go down because they will not have to enforce the  marijuana laws and the marijuana prohibition laws. Nor will they have  to fight the cartels, which won't be there anymore because their  monopoly of supply will have been eliminated.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, last Congress, the House voted, on a bipartisan basis,  to address this issue. Unfortunately, the Senate failed to act, so I am  pleased that we are moving forward again today.   Over the past two decades, public support for legalizing marijuana  has surged. States have led the way and continue to lead the way on  marijuana reform, but our Federal laws have not kept pace with the  obvious need for change. It is time for the Federal Government to catch  up, to do what is right.   The MORE Act would treat marijuana as a public health issue rather  than a criminal matter and would begin to rectify the heavy toll that  criminalization has taken, particularly on communities of color and  low-income communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
