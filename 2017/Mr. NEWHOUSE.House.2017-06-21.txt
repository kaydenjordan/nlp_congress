During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, before I begin the rule on the two  measures that are before us today, let me just make a couple of  comments that have come to mind in light of the events over the last  week.   Mr. Speaker, you may know that this is the first formal debate that  we have had as a legislative body since last Wednesday morning's  shooting. I think  [[Page H5006]]  it is appropriate that we take a minute to reflect and remember those  who were injured and are still struggling to recover from their  injuries as well as those who did not receive physical injuries on last  Wednesday morning but who are still recovering.   Let me also say, if I could be so presumptuous, Mr. Speaker, I  believe that perhaps some people in the United States look to us here  in Congress--their Representatives--and look and see how we act towards  one another and how we conduct ourselves in our interaction with each  other. Let me just say that if we are disrespectful to each other,  others may see that and think that it is okay; that if Congress can be  that way to themselves, maybe we can act that way, too. They may not  even realize that. It may be just a subconscious thing.   I ask how can we expect others to have a high opinion of us if we  don't even show each other the respect that we should and that we  deserve?   I believe that we must all remember that we are--before we are  Republicans, before we are Democrats or Independents--all Americans. We  are all here trying to do what is right, what is right for our country,  certainly what is right for our constituents, and we shouldn't say that  someone is not here for those purposes.   I don't know your district, Mr. Speaker, and I might say that you  don't know mine. So let's argue, which is what we are here for. As ugly  as sometimes it can be, that is our job, to debate on the merits of  ideas. But it is not our job to win a debate by degrading the ones who  are making the arguments against. I think we all have this obligation  to win debates or to argue debates on the merits of the issue. Last  Wednesday reminded me that it is up to us, if we want changes, to make  them and to begin them here in this body.   I was heartened in our meeting as a Congress in the auditorium over  at the Capitol Visitor Center that there were several Members asking  for a change in tone--a change in tone in how we interact with each  other. It is important that we act civilly, that we be polite, and that  we be respectful--kind of like how we treat each other on the journey  over here from our offices in the elevators and in the hallways.   I would assert that this is also something that is the responsibility  of our President, our country's leader, someone who can set the tone  for our country, someone who can describe our hopes and our dreams and  help us aspire to reach those things. It is also the responsibility of  our media and for those advocacy groups that we all have and that we  all work with. It is up to our parties. I think it is up to every  single American.   We need to rediscover the faith that we should have in each other,  our respect for each other and those bonds that make us one nation  under God.   Now, it is simple to state, but how do we accomplish this?   It can start right here on this floor. Say something positive. We all  call each other lady and gentleman. We all start off that way, and then  sometimes the gloves come off.   I can assert to you that not every idea that is presented here is all  good or all bad.   What is the risk of acknowledging a good part of a larger idea even  if you may disagree with that larger idea?   I believe we have some very articulate people in this body who can  figure out quite easily how we can accomplish that.   We shouldn't impugn the motives of others. We don't assign blame. We  don't get personal. In fact, if you look in the rules that were adopted  by this Congress, in section 363 of Jefferson's Manual of Parliamentary  Practice, it says: ``The consequences of a measure may be reprobated in  strong terms; but to arraign the motives of those who propose to  advocate it is a personality, and against order.''   So it says in no uncertain terms that we should not make this  personal. We can object without being objectionable, and maybe--just  maybe--others will see this and discover a tone that we need and a  change in America. I believe that we can start this right here, today,  with our very first debate right now.   Will we agree on everything?   Absolutely not. In fact, this is where our disagreements should show  the most. We are duty-bound to shape legislation by pointing out  weaknesses but also by accentuating strengths. Mr. Speaker, every  debate, every speech on the floor or in committee, our interactions  with the media, in townhalls, or press releases, we are being listened  to and being watched. I hope that we can change our tone and begin to  change the tone in the United States of America.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to announce that, on Tuesday,  the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 392,  providing for consideration of two important bills: H.R. 1873, which is  the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act; and H.R. 1654,  the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act.    This combined rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1873 under a  structured rule, making three amendments in order, all of which were  submitted by Democratic Members of our Chamber. H.R. 1654 will also be  considered under a structured rule, with one Democratic and one  Republican amendment made in order.   H.R. 1873 will help ensure reliable electric service and reduced  wildfire hazards, which can result from inadequate vegetation  management near power line rights-of-way on Federally owned and  operated lands.   Mr. Speaker, over the past several decades there have been numerous  electricity outages as well as incidents of wildfires due to contact  between power lines and trees on Federal lands.   In 1996, my home State of Washington was impacted when three power  lines in the Pacific Northwest sagged onto overgrown trees, leading to  a massive electricity blackout that impacted 7.5 million people across  14 Western States, two Canadian provinces, and even parts of Mexico.  Then, in August of 2003, an outage left 50 million electricity  customers without power when a falling tree came into contact with  transmission lines.   These are not isolated incidents. According to the U.S. Forest  Service, in 2012 and 2013, contact between power lines and trees on  Forest Service lands led to the outbreak of 113 and 232 wildfires,  respectively. This legislation would reduce such wildfires in part by  promoting Federal consistency, accountability, and timely  decisionmaking to protect electricity transmission, grid reliability,  and distribution lines on Federal lands from overgrown and under- maintained trees and vegetation.   H.R. 1873 will cut red tape to create a streamlined and consistent  process for removing hazardous trees and vegetation without wasting  time and money before they cause a wildfire or an outage. Preventing  forest fires and maintaining a reliable electrical grid for our  communities is an obvious priority for all of us here in Congress,  which is why I was pleased to see this bill pass through the House  Natural Resources Committee with bipartisan support.   I have seen countless catastrophic wildfires devastate Western  communities just in the past several years, which is why this issue  must be addressed and resolved. However, due to existing regulations,  it is extremely difficult for utility companies to remove hazardous  vegetation or trees that have the potential of falling on these power  lines.   The scope of this problem is evident when considering the U.S. Forest  Service manages 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands-- encompassing over 192 million acres--that include 2,700 authorized  electric transmission and distribution facilities.                                time  1245    Similarly, the Bureau of Land Management administers 245 million  acres, including over 71,000 miles of electrical transmission and  distribution lines on its Federal lands.   In order to perform infrastructure inspections and operate and  maintain power lines on these lands, electric utilities must seek  permission and approval from the appropriate Federal land management  agency, which typically use processes under the National Environmental  Policy Act of 1969 to assess whether the proposed vegetative management  measures comply with Federal environmental laws.   This often leads to delays and cumbersome bureaucratic requirements,  which often prevent utilities from carrying out important vegetative  management activities on a consistent and  [[Page H5007]]  timely basis. Yet the costs of operating, maintaining, and repairing  these electric lines on Federal lands fall to the utility companies and  their customers, which can lead to higher electricity costs for  ratepayers.   Mr. Speaker, the rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1654,  the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act. This legislation will  streamline the permitting process for new surface water storage  projects, which is critically important for many Western and rural  communities that have endured severe droughts in recent years.   Currently, the regulatory process for constructing new surface water  storage projects often involves applying for a host of Federal, State,  and local permits, as well as approvals from various agencies, which  can be a very cumbersome, costly, and time-consuming undertaking.   Additionally, conflicting permit requirements and agency reviews can  add time to the project, the planning, and implementation process while  also increasing the potential for last-minute surprises that could  endanger the success of a project or require significant additional  work.   In order to address this problem, H.R. 1654 creates what is seen as a  one-stop-shop permitting process to expedite construction of both new  and expanded non-Federal surface water storage projects. The measure  establishes the Bureau of Reclamation as the lead agency for purposes  of coordinating all reviews, analyses, permits, licenses, or other  Federal approvals as required by law, which will streamline the current  multiagency permitting process and eliminate unnecessary delays for  job-creating construction projects that directly benefit local  communities and economies.   As the lead agency, Reclamation will be required to coordinate and  prepare the unified environmental documentation that will serve as the  basis for Federal decisions authorizing the use of Federal lands, as  well as to coordinate project development and the construction of  qualifying projects.   Additionally, H.R. 1654 will allow the Secretary of the Interior to  expedite the evaluation of permits for qualifying projects through the  use of funds contributed by a non-Federal public entity.   Mr. Speaker, the rule we consider here today provides for the  consideration of two bills that will have positive and lasting impacts  for the American people, ratepayers, rural communities, and many  Western States, as well as our entire country's economy.   H.R. 1654 will provide the type of coordination and streamlining that  is essential to the development and construction of much-needed water  storage projects, certainly benefiting my home State of Washington, as  well as water-stricken communities across the country.   H.R. 1873 will create a framework for vegetation management near  transmission and distribution lines on Federal lands while also  providing electric companies with much-needed clarity and defined  authority to remove hazardous trees that pose a risk of falling into  power lines. Managing this vegetation is a critical component in  ensuring the safety and reliability of the electrical grid, which will  benefit all of our constituents.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well  as the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the beauty of having a diverse membership  in this body is that we have people from all over the country who live  and breathe the issues that are before us. We are privileged today to  have the young lady from Wilson, Wyoming (Ms. Cheney) here to speak on  these bills. I appreciate her offering to help in these arguments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney), my young colleague.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say that it is good news that  our brother from Louisiana is in fair condition. I appreciate that news  report.   And I also want to take up the previous speaker's offer to work with  us on tax reform. We look forward to his assistance in moving that  issue forward.   I might say that he is mistaken. The bill that we are talking about  today is about protecting public interests. The last time I checked,  people who I know like green trees, not black ones; they like their  electricity to be there when they turn their light switch on; and they  like water. These are three issues that we are looking to protect and  make sure that people in the United States can enjoy all of these  attributes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Buck) to talk about exactly that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the time of my colleagues, who have joined me on the  floor today, to speak in support of these underlying bills, as well as  for the hard work of the House Natural Resources Committee.   First of all, H.R. 1873 is a bipartisan bill by any measure--five  Democratic cosponsors, passed bipartisanly through the committee.   This will reduce the threat of electricity outages caused by contact  between overgrown trees and power lines. It is that simple.   Existing Federal regulations and red tape can make it extremely  difficult for utilities to gain the access that they need to their  rights of way in order to perform needed maintenance. Before taking  this action, they must receive approval from Federal agencies. They  have been criticized for not allowing these utilities to carry out  vegetative management policies on a consistent and timely basis.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, just one down tree on a transmission line  can have devastating impacts, causing blackouts for thousands or  millions of homes as well as businesses, or it can ignite fires that  consume entire forests. Yet it can take months to remove one single  tree, due to our outdated Federal regulations and cumbersome  bureaucracy.   H.R. 1654 streamlines the current multiagency permitting system,  which creates significant delays for project construction and  completion, by creating a one-stop shop, a permitting process at the  Bureau of Reclamation.   Mr. Speaker, the Bureau was created to oversee water resource  management in the West and to prevent water shortages by building dams  and conveyance systems. Yet, over the past 40 years, Federal  regulations and policies have slowly made it increasingly difficult to  build dams and reservoirs throughout the Western United States.  Presently, it is nearly impossible to even expand the storage capacity  at existing facilities.   The Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act establishes a framework  where the Federal agencies with jurisdiction over new surface water  storage projects must work together, coordinate their schedules, share  technical information and data, and publish their findings publicly.  This important measure will allow water providers to better manage  their systems to modernize and enhance their water storage  infrastructure and optimize water resource management in preparation  for future droughts and shortages, which we know will come.                                time  1330    The Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act will prevent  wildfires and power outages while enabling utilities to safely supply  electricity to rural and Western communities.   H.R. 1873 will ensure that practical measures are taken to protect  power lines and conserve our public lands, which is especially  important in Western States where overgrown Federal forests are too  often the norm rather than the exception.   Mr. Speaker, I believe the rule provides for consideration of two  commonsense measures that will implement much needed improvements to  the Federal management of our water resources, our Federal lands and  forests, and electricity infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to  support this rule as well as the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 392 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       685) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage       domestic insourcing and discourage foreign outsourcing. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and       Means. After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 685.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
