 Madam President, before I get into my initial remarks, let  me commend my colleague, the Senator from Wyoming. I didn't know about  all of the Wyoming women having been first in women's issues. I  congratulate that State, and I hope that, given the record number of  women we have in this body and in the Congress of the United States, we  will continue that march toward progress that Wyoming started over 150  years ago.                                  H.R. 2157    Madam President, today I rise to speak about a disaster so many of  our American citizens have experienced over the last few months. I am  not talking about the historic flooding that has taken place in the  Midwest. I am not talking about the devastating  [[Page S3186]]  tornadoes that have touched down all over the country, including most  recently in my home State of Alabama. I am not even talking about  Hurricane Michael, which hit Alabama's Wiregrass and wiped out entire  fields of crops. We all agree those have been tragic and deadly natural  disasters, but the disaster I want to talk about for a few moments  today is the self-imposed disaster that was created by this U.S.  Government that has taken place in the wake of these storms and natural  disasters.   President Trump and certain Members of Congress on both sides of the  aisle have managed to take what has traditionally been a bipartisan  process and turn it into a political mess. It began last December when  the President decided to insist on funding for some type of wall along  our southern border. That demand resulted in the longest government  shutdown in our Nation's history. It also set off a series of delays  for badly needed disaster relief. Only after the President dropped his  demand for wall funding could the government once again open and resume  full operations.   After the government reopened and disaster relief was proposed in  this new Congress, the President was locked into a political dispute  with leaders in Puerto Rico and refused to provide the necessary aid to  those American citizens--American citizens--and yet another stalemate  thus began. As that stalemate dragged on, the President once again  injected the issue of border security and immigration into the  unrelated discussions regarding disaster relief. Finally, after a delay  of several months that saw the occurrence of additional weather-related  disasters, the President, just as he had done with the most recent  government shutdown in January, resumed his political demands and  signaled he would sign a clean bill that included only disaster relief.   That bill passed the Senate a couple of weeks ago by unanimous  consent. Unfortunately, it did not pass the House last week because of  three individuals who refused to let it pass the House also with  unanimous agreement. It was only after the President withdrew his  demands that the bill got to the Senate floor with enough support to  garner the necessary votes to pass.   What was interesting about the bill that passed by unanimous consent  in the Senate a couple of weeks ago and passed the House of  Representatives just last night was the ``lo and behold'' moment as  Republicans voted for the bill last night. A month ago, they had voted  against an almost identical bill in order to please the President. They  obediently switched their votes to aye when the President signaled his  support.   Folks, I think it is somewhat shameful to play politics with people's  lives the way we have done in this Congress over the last few months-- to play politics with people's lives and their livelihoods, especially  when the political issues that were holding things up had really  nothing to do with the important issues at hand.   You can see it here. This photograph shows what happened in the  Wiregrass area of Alabama just last fall as a result of Hurricane  Michael. On the left side of this graphic is the ``before'' picture. We  had a record cotton crop that was ready to be harvested, and everyone  was excited about the bumper crop we had. Hurricane Michael came  through, and, with no pun intended, it was just gone with the wind-- literally wiped out. That was last fall.   Then it was in March that the tornado season once again hit Alabama.  This is one photograph, but I can show you many of the devastating  effects of the tornado that touched down in Lee County in March,  killing 23 people. I myself visited there with the first responders to  comfort those who had lost loved ones and had lost everything.   What you cannot see in this picture is the littered countryside of  Lee County, littered with not only the splintered trees but with  people's lives--their homes, their belongings, their mobile homes that  were scattered throughout the entire area. All was lost in that area  and in Beauregard and in Smith Station. Yet these folks couldn't get  the disaster relief they needed in a timely manner because it was being  held up by the President and Congress. These folks had been through so  much already, and the fact that we put them through so many months of  uncertainty while they were waiting for help from their elected  representatives is really unconscionable.   Now that this bill has passed--and I am assuming that as soon as the  President comes back, he will sign it, as he signaled he would--I want  to thank my senior colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, and Senator  Leahy for their leadership in getting this bill across the finish line.  I want to also say a special word of thanks to my neighbors from  Georgia, Senator Isakson and Senator Perdue, who worked tirelessly--so  hard--to make this bipartisan deal such that the President would sign  it.   Although it took far too long, I am certainly grateful that farmers  and Americans across the country who have suffered from these  disasters, experienced them firsthand, can finally breathe a sigh of  relief today because of the disaster relief bill that has finally been  passed.   (The remarks of Mr. Jones pertaining to the introduction of S. 1708  and S. 1709 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on  Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the second bill I have introduced today  would create a one-time refundable tax credit of up to $2,500 for  homeowners to build or purchase a storm shelter for their home. It  would ensure that people won't have to travel dangerous distances to  seek shelter in the event of sudden severe weather.   Alabamians know all too well that extreme weather can strike at any  time, especially now as we move from the spring tornado season into the  summer hurricane season. That is why I want to use this opportunity  today to urge every single one of my colleagues to support these bills  and these efforts so that all of our communities can be better prepared  when natural disasters strike, and they will.   In Lee County, I have been discussing with local officials these two  bills, which are just a step. They are obvious steps to me. Not  everybody can afford to buy a storm shelter, so the tax credit would  not be available. So, working with the Lee County M.A. and officials on  the ground, we are trying to learn best practices. What can we better  do to harden those areas where people live in the rural communities so  they will not lose their lives, much less all of their possessions?  That is what we are planning to do, and the two bills today are first  steps.   I sincerely hope going forward that helping fellow Americans who have  suffered disasters will no longer be the partisan issue that it  suddenly became this year and that we can get back to the business of  taking care of our citizens and those who have sent us here to  represent them.                                  ______                                         By Mr. JONES (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Cassidy):   S. 1709. A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to  establish a grant program to improve evacuation routes in rural  communities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment  and Public Works.    Mr. President, while it is critical that communities get  the disaster relief they need after the fact, it is also important that  folks can better prepare for natural disasters and help make our  communities safer so that we can reduce the impact and costs of the  inevitable severe weather we will have in this country.   The 2019 hurricane season is upon us. It started just last Saturday.  Folks in my neck of the woods and especially down in South Alabama know  that means storms can come at any time. Fortunately with hurricanes,  they can get some warning, but for tornadoes like the ones that hit Lee  County, it is just minutes.   It is not a question of whether severe weather will happen; it is a  question of when and where. It is also a question of whether we will be  prepared when it strikes again. That is why today I am introducing two  bills. The first is cosponsored by my Louisiana colleagues, Senators  Kennedy and Cassidy. It would establish a new grant program through the  U.S. Department of Transportation that would award up to $100 million  for projects to improve emergency evacuation routes in small and rural  communities.   Generally in our State and in a lot of the coastal States, there is  only one or two major evacuation routes, which is just not enough to  handle the situation should another hurricane hit the gulf. This grant  money would help expand those routes.   The grants would be used for two purposes: to build State and local  connector roads that would improve access to the broader thoroughfares  and to expand existing roads and bridges so that folks can evacuate  safely during extreme weather events. These infrastructure investments  would also have the additional benefit of serving rural Alabama  communities year-round and expanding and improving some of our aging  roadways. With expanding and improving aging roadways and giving better  access to rural communities, economic expansion will follow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the second bill I have introduced today  would create a one-time refundable tax credit of up to $2,500 for  homeowners to build or purchase a storm shelter for their home.
