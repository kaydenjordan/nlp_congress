 Mr. Speaker, I am glad to rise today in support of  Congressman Steube's H.R. 734. It is amazing how contorted this  argument has become.   This is simply about protecting women and girls in sports. We have  seen what has happened when we don't. We have seen in women's cage  fighting, where you have a biological male cracking the heads of the  women in there. It is so uncompetitive.   Girls in college sports or women's sports when they step up to the  starting line in track meets feel already defeated because there are  two biological males running against them.   Are we going to protect women and girls in sports and the rest of  life or not?   This legislation simply goes in the direction of allowing sports to  be competitive once again for women and  [[Page H1898]]  girls. This legislation is not about all the other things that the  folks on the other side of the aisle are trying to turn it into.   It is simple and it is really essential if we want to have our women  and our girls not feel defeated right out of the chute.   I don't know where the feminists are, but there are a lot of us men  that feel strongly about this, supporting this, and supporting Title  IX, and the whole concept that men and women are different. Girls and  women deserve the same chance as everybody else.                            ____________________
