 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland  for yielding. And I particularly thank the gentlewoman from Washington,  D.C., the 51st State, the Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton for her hard  work.   Madam Speaker, breaking news: The people of Washington, D.C., pay  taxes. Breaking news: They wear the uniform of the United States of  America. And, breaking news: The legislation my friends on the other  side of the aisle are proposing is to propose a dictation, as usual,  from the United States Federal Government on the people of Washington,  D.C.   Is anybody in Washington, D.C., raising their hand to be able to  participate in the legislation that my friends are offering on this  floor, which is to partition--we know what partition means--colored  people in dominance and put them wherever the Federal Government thinks  that they should belong?   I think they need to think twice about that.   And, really, if this is a country of the people and for the people,  if this is a House of Representatives, then the people of Washington,  D.C., deserve to be represented, and they deserve to be represented by  the four squares of the dictates and vote of the people of the United  States Congress.   I am appalled that we would, over the decades, ignore the blood that  was shed by those from Washington, D.C., the history that was made by  those from Washington, D.C., and the service that was given by those  from Washington, D.C.    So I rise to support the legislation that provides for the  Washington, D.C. Admission Act, H.R. 51. I thank the leadership for  that legislation. In the rule, we have a combination of restoring  rights. That is what H.R. 51 does, restoring and igniting rights.   H.R. 1573, Access to Counsel Act, of my friend and colleague from  Washington State, is a commonsense initiative.   We are a nation of laws.   Do we not respect the right to counsel?   Yes, these are persons who are noncitizens, but they have the right,  if in secondary detention, to call a relative, to call a lawyer, which  they pay for.   What about little Ali?   As I rushed to the airport on that fateful day when the President of  the United States, President Trump, declared that all Muslims were  banned, what an outrageous experience; and an outrageous experience  that I have had with other entries that have been detained, where they  couldn't call an uncle or aunt, they couldn't call their mother, their  father, their wife.   Well, little Ali could not call his relatives that were outside the  gate waiting for him.   Where did that 15-year-old Egyptian with documented papers wind up?   He wound up in Chicago, in a children's detention facility.   So I support the right to counsel, H.R. 1573, the Access to Counsel  Act.   And, finally, H.R. 1333. Ali came under the Bagram ban by President  Trump; let's just say it, an outrageous act. We literally got off the  plane, Members of Congress who were flying in from Washington, and  rushed to the airport because of what was happening to our  constituents.   I support the NO BAN Act under H.R. 1333, and I ask my colleagues to  support this legislation. The Constitution reigns.                                time  1530
