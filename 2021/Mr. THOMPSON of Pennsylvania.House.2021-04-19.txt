 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support of the Eliminate  Barriers to Innovation Act offered by my friend from North Carolina and  the ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services, Mr. McHenry.   The CFTC and the SEC have a long history of collaboration in  financial market regulation. The working group created through this  legislation will continue to build on this good work.   Digital assets present unique new questions for regulators: How and  where do these assets fit into the existing regulatory regime? What new  standards are needed to continue to meet our bedrock principle of  customer protection? Where do the CFTC and the SEC need to adjust their  regulations to address the novel features and purposes of digital  assets?   While both the CFTC and the SEC are hard at work applying their  statutory responsibilities and regulations to these digital assets, the  disruptive, novel nature of these new type of assets demand a more  holistic examination. This working group, with its mix of CFTC, SEC,  and nongovernmental members, will be well placed to examine these  important questions.   The Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act is a step forward in  providing clear rules of the road for the creation, exchange, custody,  and use of the full sweep of these new assets.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. McHenry, and his staff  for working with us at the House Committee on Agriculture on  refinements to improve this legislation.   I cannot close, though, without singing the praises of the CFTC. The  Commission has been focused on this explosion in new technology from  the very beginning. The Commission created LabCFTC almost 4 years ago,  and it remains the premier Federal fintech office.   They have proven themselves to be an agile regulator and adept at  understanding new technologies and their implications. The Committee on  Agriculture has welcomed these developments and sought to strengthen  the CFTC's authorities and resources to meet the challenges in  regulating these new financial products. The bill before us today  complements these efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with Mr. McHenry and  Chairwoman Waters on this and other legislation and oversight to build  upon this work. I urge my colleagues to support financial innovation  and vote ``yes'' on this important legislation.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Week of the Young Child.  Sponsored by the National Association for the Education of Young  Children, the Week of the Young Child focuses on celebrating early  learning, young children, their teachers, families, and communities.   This year's celebration took place from April 10th to the 16th. The  National Association for the Education of Young Children first  established the Week of the Young Child in 1971, recognizing the early  childhood years lay the foundation for children's success in school and  later in life.   Children's earliest years are the most important when it comes to  shaping their learning and development. High-quality early care and  educational services directly correlate to the health and well-being of  our communities.   Madam Speaker, with more than 400 childcare facilities in my  district, and as a senior member of the Education and Labor Committee,  I understand the importance of quality early care and education  experiences as well as access to high-quality care.   Madam Speaker, let's take a moment to recognize the vital work  performed by early childcare and education professionals and express  our gratitude.                            ____________________
