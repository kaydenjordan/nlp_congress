 I call up my amendment No. 3114 and ask that it be  reported by number.    Mr. President, in the 11th hour, Democrats added a  provision in the American Rescue Plan that this body did not have time  to vet. Under this provision, if States took the money, they cannot  lower their taxes in any way through 2024.   Six Federal lawsuits have already been filed, including States like  Louisiana, Ohio, and Arizona. West Virginia is leading a lawsuit with  an additional 13 States, including New Hampshire and Montana.   States are not happy with this overreach. We can fix this mistake  now. States have the right to cut their own taxes, and we have no right  to get in their way.   I introduced the Let States Cut Taxes Act with  Dan Bishop, of North  Carolina, to repeal this overstep in the American Rescue Plan. A vote  for this amendment is a vote to protect States' power to impose or cut  their own taxes.   Please join me on this bill across the board, and I ask for the yeas  and the nays.    No. It is a rollcall vote.
