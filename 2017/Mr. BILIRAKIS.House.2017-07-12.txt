 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the passage of the  FDA Reauthorization Act. With this legislation, we can modernize the  FDA and reduce the barriers to innovation and competition.   If America is going to lead the world in biomedical innovation, we  need an FDA that can efficiently review and approve new drugs. The FDA  must act with the same urgency that patients feel waiting for cures.   Importantly, this bill includes a bipartisan provision that I  authored with my colleague Kurt Schrader.                                time  1400    The provision uses free market policies to help spur the development  of new generic drugs, increase competition, and combat high drug  prices.   I am also pleased we are including in the RACE for Children Act an  important provision to advance pediatric cancer research and  development.   With today's bill, we have an opportunity to truly make a difference  for our families, our friends, our neighbors, and the millions of  Americans living with a deadly disease. Let's get this done.
