 Mr. President, speaking against my colleague, I am sure  he is well-meaning, but the language in this underlying amendment would  condition the funds of this bill. Say the taxpayer money provided to  universities on research--think about what we do today with  universities on a lot of subjects. Just ask yourself, would you ever  have an ROI on the COVID vaccine? basic research around lifesaving  medicine? It took 60 years to prove the return on that investment.  There are underlying DARPA funds in this bill. Do you think that all of  those DARPA funds showed return on investment? Say goodbye to those  moneys.   This also says that it can be conditioned for a clawback. Who? So  nuclear research done by one institution and one administration but not  liked by the next administration is clawed back? I think we have  trusted our universities to do this research for us, and that is what a  research economy is about.   We need to dust off our R&D skills and make these investments and  make the commitments. The underlying bill has safeguards on spending in  the bill.   I ask my colleagues to vote no on this motion to instruct.                                Vote on Motion     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an  additional 30 seconds.    I, too, oppose this amendment.   Striking the authorization does strike competition. NASA has asked  for continued competition, and there are many defense contractors who  have expressed interest--Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Dynetics.   So I understand my colleague's frustration and what he wants to  complain about, but this is about safety, and it is about redundancy,  and it is about us authorizing the Artemis program; not just having  appropriators make a decision, but having the authorization of safety  and redundancy that we expect if we as a Nation are going to take the  next woman astronaut all the way to the surface of the Moon.   When I think about what happened with the space shuttle Columbia and  the disaster, NASA suffered great consequences. They have said  redundancy matters, and that is what we are authorizing, and the  competition my colleague just mentioned.
