 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Mike Faber for his significant impact on the community as  an educator, coach, and mentor.   Mike Faber has selflessly served his community by educating young  Montanans in Cut Bank for 21 years and 6 years in Eureka. Mike taught a  wide range of disciplines, from physical education to Native American  history, at both the middle school and high school level.   Truly demonstrating a passion for service, Mike was an instructor not  only in the classroom but also on the field. While in Eureka, he  coached wrestling, football and track and field for 15 years, helping  young Montanans build character and a strong work ethic that will serve  them well in their adult years.   For almost three decades, Mike has lived a life of servant- leadership, his leadership in the classroom and on the field will be  greatly missed by his community. His efforts to help transform young  students into good citizens has impacted the lives of nearly 3,000  young Montanans throughout his 27-year career. I applaud Mike for  leading a life of excellence in educating our nation's youth and  setting a standard for exemplary service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
