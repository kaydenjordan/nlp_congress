 Madam Speaker, it is no surprise to anyone here or  throughout the United States that we have a serious crisis at our  southern border. All anyone has to do is go visit the southern border  to see the devastation, to see the death, to see the desperation, to  see the drugs coming across, Madam Speaker.   Since President Biden has come into office, a record number, over 2  million illegal immigrants, have been apprehended: a 128 percent  increase in apprehensions from the previous year.   And 1.7 million migrants were apprehended illegally just this year,  while 400,000 illegally crossed the border and got away.   But the President and his administration halted the Trump  administration's successful remain in Mexico policy, has reinstated  catch-and-release, has refused to enforce title 42, and is providing  incentives for illegals to come into our country through mass amnesty  proposals, work visas, and driver's licenses. Okay?   This is a serious matter for every State, for my constituents, for my  district. We have the highest level of overdose fatalities ever, and it  is a direct result of the Biden administration policy. This needs to  stop. This is a terrible situation caused by the Biden administration.  I wish it would stop. We could stop it here.                            ____________________
