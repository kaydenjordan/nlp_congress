 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of  Kalwis Lo, a young man from my district in San Gabriel, California, who  told me how his life was saved by the Affordable Care Act.   When he was just out of college, Kalwis was shocked when he was  diagnosed with stage III Hodgkin lymphoma. He learned that this disease  would end his young life if ignored, but was actually easily treatable  in the early stages.   No longer covered by his university, he applied to every type of  health insurance he could, but he was denied every single time because  of his preexisting condition. He knew that through insurance coverage  he could get the chemotherapy treatments that could save his life, but  with each denial, he felt more and more desperate.   Then Kalwis learned about the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan  under the Affordable Care Act. This plan made insurance accessible to  anyone that had been denied due to a preexisting condition. Thankfully,  California was one of the States participating in the program. Finally,  Kalwis got the chemotherapy he needed. He is one of millions of  Americans given the promise of their lives back thanks to the  Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________
