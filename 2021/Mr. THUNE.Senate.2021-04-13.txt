Mr. President, on Good Friday, another Capitol Police  officer lost his life defending this building and all those in it.   Officer Billy Evans was killed when an individual rammed Officer  Evans with his car at the barricade Officer Evans was manning. Another  Capitol Police officer, Officer Ken Shaver, was injured in the attack.   We talk about how police officers leave their homes each day not  knowing what they will face. Good Friday's attack was a reminder of how  true that is.   We can only be thankful that despite the ever-present risk that they  will not make it back to their homes, men and women like Officer Evans  and Officer Shaver still choose to serve--to put themselves on the  frontlines facing evil and danger so that the rest of us don't have to.   I know the officers of the Capitol Police have had an unthinkably  difficult few months. I hope they know how grateful we are for their  service.   Today Officer Billy Evans lies in honor in the Rotunda, a fitting  tribute to a man who lived and died to protect those who serve in this  building.   My thoughts and prayers are with Officer Evans' two children, Logan  and Abigail, with his mother Janice, and with all those who mourn this  brave man. May his memory be eternal.
