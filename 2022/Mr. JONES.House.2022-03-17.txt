 Mr. Speaker, March 23 marks 1 year since the tragic  passing of my constituent, Jared Lloyd, whose memory I wish to honor  today.   Mr. Lloyd was a volunteer firefighter with the Hillcrest Fire  Department in the village of Spring Valley, New York, where I grew up.  On March 23 of last year, Jared Lloyd died a hero. He sacrificed his  life to rescue residents of Evergreen Court Home for Adults from a  horrific fire.   Jared's colleagues have said that he saved as many as 30 lives that  day. I know that I speak on behalf of the people of Rockland County  when I say that I cannot express how incredibly proud I am of him for  his bravery and his selflessness, and how sad I am over his loss.   Jared Lloyd was 35 years old. He was a son, a companion, and a loving  father of two wonderful children, Logan and Darius. Jared was a  schoolmate of mine. He was a graduate of Spring Valley High School. He  had so much life left to live. He will never be forgotten. Today, he is  remembered in the House of Representatives for his heroic actions.
