 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R. 471,  the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous question. The  gentleman from Maryland, my friend, raised some issues about saying  that we are wasting time when we have stunts, he called them, I think,  or I am paraphrasing.   So here I am, and I am going to be talking about an important issue  which, I assume, might be labeled as a  [[Page H4225]]  stunt, to say that I oppose the previous question because there is  something for me that is so critical and so existential to the people I  represent in the State of Texas and to the people across this country,  which is the decision by the CDC, in conjunction with the Department of  Homeland Security Secretary, and the President of the United States, to  end title 42 enforcement on the border of the United States.   Now, our mutual colleague and friend who was in the chair, and the  Speaker from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, who is on the Judiciary Committee,  raised the issue about the imminent harm that may befall us because of  the continued and new strains of COVID in April.   Well, if that is true, why would the CDC say that we should stop  enforcement of title 42 at our border?   We have 8,000 people a day coming across the border of the United  States and being apprehended; 8,000. Half of those are being turned  away under title 42. The estimates by Border Patrol experts are that  those numbers will swell to over 10,000, maybe as high as 15 to 18,000,  when you get to the summer months.   And when that happens, and you stop enforcing title 42, then all of  those individuals will be released into the United States.                                time  1430    That is a major problem because it is not just the numbers  themselves; it is the consequences. When Border Patrol is processing  individuals because of the failed policies of the administration, it  means that you have, as we saw last year, half a million people who  were known got-aways because Border Patrol is now at the locations to  process individuals.   Then you have known got-aways, which means you have massive numbers  of people coming here with criminal records from places all over the  world, 150 to 160 countries, including dangerous individuals from known  terrorist states.   The point here is that we have legislation for this body, the  people's House, to require title 42 to be enforced. Yvette Herrell, my  colleague from New Mexico, introduced that last February. I filed a  discharge petition for that bill last April because, for the people  watching at home, the Speaker of the House controls the floor, and my  Democratic colleagues control the floor. The only way we have power to  change that is through a discharge petition. We have 211 signatures. We  have all Republicans, I think save maybe one, who have signed the  discharge petition.   We are asking our Democratic colleagues to join us in defense of the  United States to call up this discharge petition so we can have a  debate on title 42 and securing the border of the United States, which  is what that conga line was all about: trying to protect our country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I completely agree that we should be trying to help small businesses  who have gotten absolutely railroaded and run over by the power of  government, which amounts to, essentially, a taking. They have had  their livelihoods taken away through the sheer power of government,  Federal, State and local. It is absolutely extraordinary.   It is one of the reasons that I worked with my friend, Dean Phillips,  on the other side of the aisle, on the PPP Flexibility Act 2 years ago.  I would have preferred we not go down this road; that the government  not go down and shut down our economy. But the government did. And I  think that amounts to something akin to a taking.   But now, here we sit and, yet again, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have not met an issue that they can't make worse; and that  is what we are faced with right now.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues are bringing forward a $55 billion bill  which they say is paid for, which is paid for and relies on recaptured,  fraudulent relief funds. We have fraudulent relief funds because you  just dumped $2 trillion out in the economy when you came in here and  did it by voice vote 2 years ago.   So you have got these fraudulent funds that we may or may not  recapture that is, allegedly, what is paying for this. This bill should  be fully paid for out of existing COVID money that has not yet been  spent. And that is what we are offering as an alternative.   But the real problem that the American people need to understand that  my colleagues have got themselves in a pretty vicious box, is because  the administration, with the full support of my colleagues here, made  the allocation of dollars race-based. They made it criteria-based. And  they got slapped down by the court. They got slapped down by the Sixth  Circuit.   The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found race and sex prioritization  was unconstitutional and ordered the Small Business Administration to  halt the practice. But most of the funding had been spent. It was  underfunded. But most of that funding had been spent.   The court said: ``The case is about whether the government can  allocate limited coronavirus relief funds based on the race and sex of  the applicants. We hold that it cannot.   ``The stark realities of the Small Business Administration's racial  gerrymandering are inescapable.'' ``It is indeed `a sordid business'. .  . . ``quoting our Chief Justice John Roberts, `` . . . `a sordid  business' to divide `us up by race.' '' ``And the government's attempt  to do so here violates the Constitution.''   That is the real story. I have introduced the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund Fairness Act. We have got other bills on this side  of the aisle that would pay for it; that would ensure that it won't be  race-based; that would make sure that the 177,000 applicants who were  left on the outside looking in because of race-based governing by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that that would not occur;  and that, again--I want to reiterate--should be paid for without  relying on the possibility of collecting the fraudulent expenditures.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs.  Boebert), and I thank all colleagues from the House Freedom Caucus for  joining me here on the floor.   I thank my friend from Virginia, who joined me down in Del Rio,  Texas, just a month ago, where we saw firsthand what is actually  happening in real-time on the border, something that we know and,  unfortunately, my colleagues on this side of the aisle refuse to  acknowledge and refuse to do anything about.   Now, as you all know, one of our Freedom Caucus colleagues from New  Mexico (Ms. Herrell) filed, 14 months ago, a piece of legislation to  require that title 42 be enforced at our border.   For those listening at home, title 42 is our power as a country to  stop communicable diseases and people with communicable diseases from  coming across our border. It is an important tool that President Trump  and his administration put in place in the last year of his  administration to ensure that we stop the flow of people across the  border from inundating and overwhelming Border Patrol.   We knew this was coming. Fourteen months ago, we knew this was  coming. A year ago, we came together. I filed a discharge petition as  part of this team to say that we can force a vote on the floor of the  House.   Well, the Speaker of the House refuses to bring to a vote a measure  to enforce title 42. Everybody listening at home, the Speaker of the  House, who has control of the floor, refuses to bring forward a vote on  title 42 to require enforcement of the border. We are trying to change  that.   We have almost every single Republican, I think save one, who has  filed that, 210 signatures. We need 218. Where are my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle? Where are those from border States?   Mr. Speaker, we have zero Democrats on that title 42 discharge  position.  [[Page H4394]]    Now, as the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) noted, there are  at least four noteworthy United States Senators who are Democrats who  said we should not end title 42: Mr. Tester, Mr. Manchin, Ms. Sinema,  and Mr. Kelly. Those four Senators have said we should not end title  42.   Now, I will wrap up and pass it to someone else just to say this: How  many dead migrants is enough? How many dead Americans from fentanyl  poisoning is enough? How much money in the pockets of dangerous cartels  is enough? How many bullets need to fly at the border? How many homes  need to be destroyed? How many cars need to be wrecked?   How many DPS agents need to be killed or endangered? How many people  need to be harmed before this administration will do its job? How many  criminals need to be let off in the United States and not prosecuted  under ICE? When are we going to change this and actually secure our  country?   Those are my questions for Secretary Mayorkas.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my fellow border Stater being down  here. You hold those Mounties back up there, okay? Keep them at bay.    Mr. Speaker, I would only add that I have seen some reports  that there are a number of Democrats in the Senate joining with  Republicans in the Senate to try to do something about this. I hope  that is true.   But my little warning to that is, I keep hearing words about, well,  let's keep title 42 in place until we see a plan. Look, I don't want  one of these plans full of words, okay? I want the border secure. I  want title 42 enforced. That ought to be the metric that we are gauging  everything by.                                time  2100
