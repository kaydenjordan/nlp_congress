 I thank the gentleman for yielding, my good  friend, Representative Burgess from Texas.    We are very blessed to have Representative Burgess' leadership on the  Energy and Commerce Subcommittee, as he chairs the Health Subcommittee  and brings his years of experience. I want to thank him for his  leadership and for holding this tonight.   Mr. Speaker, every day, I hear stories from folks all across my  district in the First Congressional District of Georgia, in southeast  Georgia, who have been forced to choose. They have been forced to  choose between paying their monthly insurance premium or buying other  essentials for their families.   I want to give you an example of someone who I am talking about--a  real life example, someone who has experienced this.   Consider the case of Bob Joiner. Bob Joiner is an independent adviser  in south Georgia. His wife, Kim, is an audiologist who works in a small  practice that does not provide healthcare benefits.   Bob and Kim exercise regularly. They watch their nutrition. They are  fortunate to have no health problems. They also have a 28-year-old son,  Wesley. In 2016, Bob's monthly healthcare premium increased 134  percent, and his son's healthcare insurance climbed to an astonishing  190 percent. In total, their 2016 annual premiums were $4,285 for their  son Wesley, and for them it was $19,026.   The Joiners should have been hopeful that in 2017 they could change  their plan for something more affordable. But thanks to ObamaCare, that  wasn't the case. You see, what ObamaCare has done is to limit choices.   In 2017, there was only one ObamaCare-compliant plan that was  accessible to the Joiners on the healthcare.gov website. An additional  policy featuring a higher deductible with lower premiums was available;  however, the plan was not ObamaCare compliant, leaving the Joiners  subjected to the penalty. Before ObamaCare, the Joiner family's annual  premium was $7,400. At the time, they had access to multiple providers  and dozens of plan designs.   Unfortunately, ObamaCare has brought chaos into the healthcare  system. The Joiners are not alone. This is just one example of many  throughout my district and throughout America of what ObamaCare has  done.   ObamaCare has done, essentially, three things. First of all, it has  taken away choice. It has limited choices.   Representative Burgess mentioned the fact that a third of the  counties in America right now only have one provider. Only one  provider. That is not a choice. Five States only have one provider.  That is not a choice. Sixteen counties in Tennessee have no provider.  No one. That is not sustainable.   We have a situation that faced us here in the majority party, the  Republican Party. We had to decide: What are we going to do? Should we  even touch health care or should we just leave it alone?   We did the right thing. We said: We need to rescue the healthcare  system here in America. We have got to act, and we have got to act now.  ObamaCare is imploding. We know that. Premiums have gone up, on average  this year, 25 percent. In seven States, they have gone up over 50  percent. It is simply not sustainable.   It has decreased choices and increased cost. It has also caused much  red tape and many obstacles between patients and their healthcare  providers, between patients and physicians, between patients and  pharmacists. That is not the way health care is supposed to be in  America.   I am a strong believer in health care. I am the only pharmacist  currently serving in Congress. My professional career, like  Representative Burgess, has been dedicated to health care. I am just  not going to sit around and watch the greatest healthcare system in the  world be ruined. That is why we have passed out of three committees  thus far the American Health Care Act.   Representative Burgess mentioned the fact that it has been through  the Energy and Commerce Committee, it has been through the Ways and  Means Committee, it has been through the Budget Committee. Now it will  be on the floor this week.   Thursday will be a historical day for our country. It will be a  historical day for health care in America. What are we going to be  offering? We are going to be offering a plan that increases choices,  that increases accessibility, that cuts red tape, that removes barriers  between patients and healthcare professionals, that empowers people. It  empowers citizens to be able to make their own healthcare choices.   Instead of having Washington, D.C., in their infinite wisdom,  infinite knowledge, tell you what you need to have, you now will decide  what you need to have, what is best for you, what is best for your  family. That is what it is all about. That is one of the many reasons  it is so good.   This plan offers so many good things in it. Health savings accounts.  To be able to put more into a health savings account, to be able to  roll it over from year to year, to be able to increase the amount in  there, and even pass it on to survivors.   We utilize tax credits to make sure that, no, unlike ObamaCare, you  are not penalized for not having insurance, but instead, you are  rewarded for having insurance. That is what we are going to do.   Of all the bad things that I think ObamaCare has done to the  healthcare system in America, first of all, it has taken the free  market out of health care. No more competition, as we noted earlier.  But the second thing has been this Medicaid expansion. That really is  something that I take offense to.   Medicaid is a great program. It is a program that is necessary. It is  a safety net program. It is intended to take care of the aged, the  blind, the disabled, children and mothers. It was  [[Page H2235]]  never intended to be for able-bodied adults. This is not what a safety  net program is about.   Under ObamaCare, I hear the other party say: Well, we have added 20  million people onto the insurance roles. Well, let's look at that. 14.5  million of those people were added on to Medicaid expansion. We  shouldn't be calling this ObamaCare. We should be calling it ObamaCaid.  Able-bodied adults added on to a safety net program. We are revising  Medicaid. We are reforming Medicaid.                                time  2045    Medicaid is going to be even better for those people who need it.  Instead of diluting that program, we are going to make sure that those  people who truly need it--the aged, the blind, the disabled, children,  mothers--have more access to it, as they should.   We promised three things among many things, but we promised, hey, we  are going to keep a couple of things in here. We are going to make sure  that parents can continue to have their children up to age 26 on their  insurance. We promised that we were going to make sure that preexisting  conditions were going to be included and that you would not be kicked  off of your health insurance. We promised that we were going to have a  stable transition. We are doing just that.   We are delivering on those promises. We are making sure--I often get  asked: What about that 100 to 138 percent of the Federal poverty level?  What are you doing for them?   Well, we came up with a refundable tax credit that is actually going  to pay their insurance. That will go directly to pay their insurance.   The American Health Care Act delivers on what we promised. What we  promised is that we would have more choices. What we promised is that  we would have more accessibility. What we promised is that we would  empower patients. We are doing that. We are empowering people. We are  rescuing health care in America. I intend to vote for this plan  Thursday night, and I am going to be very proud to vote for it.   We are going to rescue the healthcare system that I practiced in for  over 30 years. I have seen how competition works in the healthcare  system. I practiced in it. I have competed in it. I have seen how it  lowers costs, and it will lower costs. People now will be empowered to  have the ability to choose their own insurance instead of being  mandated from Washington, D.C., what kind of insurance they should  have.   I thank leadership for what they have done to pull this together. I  thank the President. The President is behind this. President Trump made  it one of his campaign promises: We are going to repeal and we are  going to replace ObamaCare.   You know, it amazes me the media seems to--I get asked quite often:  Can you believe he is doing this? Can you believe he is doing that?   I just think: Didn't he tell you he was going to do this? Didn't he  tell you he was going to do that?   I think they are just amazed that we actually have somebody in the  White House who is delivering on promises that he made, and he is doing  just that.   This is a historical week in Congress. Thursday will be a historical  day. We are rescuing health care. I am going to be proud to vote for  this bill. Again, I thank leadership. I thank the White House. I thank  Representative Burgess, who has been a great leader through all this  and has had a big part in this. I thank him for his part in this as  well.    Again, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  leading this Special Order here tonight, and I thank everyone who has  been involved in this.    Absolutely.    Well, as we say in south Georgia, the proof is  in the pudding, and the proof is right here. Premiums have gone up this  year. Look, one thing that amazes me is we have almost created two new  classes of uninsured. First of all, through ObamaCare, it has mandated  that people have insurance. So you have got a class who have insurance,  but their deductibles are so high they can't afford to use it. So there  you have a new class of literally uninsured. Then you have another  class of people who were able to afford insurance before, but now it  has gotten so expensive, they just pay the penalty. They cannot even  afford it. I think it has done just the opposite of what it was  intended to do.    I have heard this same argument, that we had to do something, that  costs were rising. I will agree that we have to address healthcare  costs. We do. We are. In fact, we are doing it this week. Remember,  this is the first phase. As you pointed out, what we vote on this week  is only the first phase. We have got two more phases to go. In those  two phases, we intend to do a lot that is going to help control  healthcare costs.   I like to give the example, if you will indulge me for just a minute,  when I was still practicing pharmacy--and I tell you this to explain  just how competition works. When I was still practicing pharmacy, I  still had my pharmacy, and I still owned it at the time. This drugstore  opened down the street, a tiny company. I am trying to remember the  name. Oh, yeah, it was Walmart.   They decided they wanted to be a player in the healthcare system, in  the pharmacy system, in the pharmacy market. So they came out with this  idea that they were going to sell a 30-day supply of generics for $4. I  thought to myself, they must be crazy, I can't even buy it for that  much. I bowed my back and I said: I am not going to do that. I am not  going to do that.   Well, guess what. A week later, I was doing it.   I had people leaving my store. And I called my supplier up and I  said: You have got to do something here, you have got to help me.   That is the way competition in health care works. When you have got  choices, when you have got competition, prices go down, quality goes  up. Sometimes we get caught up too much in the numbers game, thinking,  oh, we  [[Page H2236]]  have got all these lives covered. Coverage does not necessarily equate  quality health care, as you well understand. We have to be very careful  with that.   Now, we want people to have coverage, and we want them more so to  have quality health care. This plan addresses that. It addresses it by  increasing choices, by increasing competition, by increasing  accessibility, and by empowering people. I am very proud. I am going to  be very proud to vote for this bill on Thursday.
