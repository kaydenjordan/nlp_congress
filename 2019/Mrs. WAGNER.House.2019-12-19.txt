 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding. I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  USMCA trade agreement.   For months, partisan politics and the Democrats' impeachment charade  have prevented us from finalizing this agreement, but it is clear to  Members on both sides of the aisle that the President has negotiated a  deal that will strengthen our economy and benefit all Missourians and  Americans.   One of every three rows of crops is grown for export in the great  State of Missouri, and this deal expands market access in Canada and  Mexico for our farmers.   It is the first time that a U.S. trade agreement is specifically  addressing biotech, and the St. Louis region is the Silicon Valley for  ag-tech.   USMCA also includes the Wagner language on human trafficking. I  worked with Ambassador Lighthizer to guarantee that the USMCA holds my  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, FOSTA, to help stop online sex  trafficking here at home and now throughout North America.   A ``yes'' on the USMCA is a yes for victims, a yes for jobs, a yes  for farmers, and a yes for the prosperity of all Americans.

The USMCA also includes the ``Wagner Language'' on human trafficking.  I worked with Ambassador Lighthizer to guarantee that the USMCA upholds  my Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) to help stop online sex  trafficking here at home and now throughout North America.   A YES on the USMCA is a yes for victims, a yes for jobs, a yes for  farmers, and a yes for the prosperity of all Americans. Thank you. I  yield back.   This agreement also benefits Missouri's thriving ag tech community by  addressing agricultural biotechnology, including new technologies such  as gene editing.   This is the first time U.S. trade agreement is specifically  addressing biotech, and the St. Louis region is the Silicon Valley for  ag tech. The USMCA will help protect our intellectual property, and I  hope it will be a standard for future trade agreements as well.   The Wagner Language allows our trading partners to enact domestic  laws that enable victims to sue the websites that facilitate the sex  trade and empower law enforcement to enforce criminal laws against the  websites that sell women and children.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 19, 2019, on page H12258, ``*ERR08*'' inadvertently  appeared at four places.
