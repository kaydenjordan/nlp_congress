 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, and I want  to thank him for his commitment and passion to this issue, and for  organizing this effort tonight, and to join with him and our colleague  from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) to focus on the issue of income  inequality.   And for those of us who serve in this institution, we have a moral  obligation, a moral responsibility, to help those who are in punishing  poverty.   It was more than 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson and a  bipartisan Congress worked together to create the social safety net.  And that social safety net is representative of the values of this  great country where it says that it is not every man or woman for  himself or herself, but it is our shared responsibility for one  another, our accountability for one another, and particularly in times  of need.    Their priority--their priority--bipartisan Members of this  institution, was to lift families out of poverty.   Their tools?   Programs to help end hunger, creating good-paying jobs, provide  affordable healthcare, guarantee a quality education for all of our  children.   But, unfortunately, and I will be specific here, we have an  administration,  [[Page H3136]]  we have a President, and we have a Speaker of this body, Mr. Ryan, who  are not fighting a war on poverty. They are fighting a war on working  families and the poor.   President Trump and Speaker Ryan do not value the beneficiaries of  these programs. They do not value these people's lives, unless they  happen to have an estate or a corporate spending account. They want  corporations and the wealthiest Americans to see bigger profits, even  if the poor suffer greater pain.   Republicans have repeatedly gone after the nutrition programs, the  food stamp program, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; programs  that help people bounce back from tough times and to retire with  dignity after a life of hard work.   When I did research for a book that was published last year, ``The  Least Among Us: Waging the Battle for the Vulnerable,'' what I found  is, when it came to nutrition programs, who were the people who were  engaged and involved?   Bob Dole, Republican from Kansas. George McGovern, Democrat.   When you looked at the child tax credits, George Bush was for a child  tax credit, as well as Jay Rockefeller. Democrats and Republicans who  came together on these issues for refundable tax credits for families  to help lift them out of poverty.   When you take a look at a whole variety, Social Security, Medicare,  Medicaid, while there may have been differences in the Chamber as they  debated them, but when it came to the vote, they were passed on a  bipartisan basis because, it is my view, that the folks who served  there understood why they were elected and what this institution is  about and how it provides opportunity for people in this country.   That is what our job is here, is to provide opportunity for the  people of this country. It is about educating needy children, feeding  hungry families, supporting our veterans, and shielding seniors from  poverty.   Those are not the great achievements that the other side of the aisle  looks at. They are grating to our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle. It is about the view that these are the takers, not the makers;  that they relax in a hammock and don't want to get up and go out to  work, demeaning hardworking people in this country.   The majority in this body and in the Senate and in the White House  are forcing everyday Americans to pay for their $2 trillion tax cut for  corporations and for the wealthiest Americans, and now they want to use  this tax cut scam as an excuse to gut services and investments that are  critical to our families and our communities.   I just want to go back for a second, because I was here. This was on  the food stamp program. I was here for the Contract with America. Wow.  1995.   Do you know where it went?   Let's abolish the school lunch program. Let's block grant the food  stamp program. Let Medicare wither on the vine.   The fact is life hasn't changed that much. There is a consistency  about some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   Yesterday, under the guise of reviewing welfare, the Trump  administration is once again targeting the most vulnerable among us.   The President's latest executive order would make it more difficult  for people to access services: healthcare, nutrition, housing. A tax on  our social safety net does not reflect our values, nor does it make  sense at all.   The biggest issue that people are facing today is that they are in  jobs that just do not pay them enough money to live on. So we must do  more to end poverty and to end income inequality, and that does begin  with wages.   Now, the social safety net has helped millions of Americans.  According to Brookings Institution, the poverty rate has declined by  more than one-third since 1967, in large part due to the success of our  safety net programs. It continues to help millions. In an average  month, the food stamp program benefits help feed one in four children  in the United States.   What good news, then, that, Mr. Speaker, his view of what should  happen is that if people are humiliated enough, that in fact they will  try to figure out how to make do for themselves.   That is not what this country is about. It is a slap in the face to  hardworking Americans. It is time for a better deal for Americans, one  that does prioritize job creation, as you have talked about, rising  incomes, a 21st century economy that levels the playing field for the  working class and the working poor.   And I am reminded of the words of Bobby Kennedy, whose legacy  fighting poverty should be a model for all of us, and just let me quote  him. Mr. Speaker, I am sure the gentleman has read this quote, if I  know him: ``I believe that as long as there is plenty, poverty is evil.  Government belongs wherever evil needs an adversary and there are  people in distress.''   This is what our role and our responsibility is, is to help to  provide that opportunity. Do not let people be abandoned in this  country for some ideological views or the sense that we need to make  sure that the wealthiest, the millionaires, the billionaires, the  corporations, need to be the winners in our society.   It is not just Congress' moral obligation to help those in poverty,  it is our duty. That is why we were elected to come to this  institution. We should not be abandoning the people who put their faith  and trust in all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentleman for focusing on this issue  and thank him for including me.                                time  1815
