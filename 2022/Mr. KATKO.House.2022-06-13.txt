 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Small  State and Rural Rescue Act. I thank my friends, Chairman DeFazio and  Ranking Member Graves, for their efforts to bring this bill to the  floor today.   My constituents in central New York are all too familiar with the  significant challenges that come with accessing Federal aid in the wake  of a disaster.   Rural communities along Lake Ontario's southern shore in my district  have seen historic flooding in recent years, and in the aftermath,  local authorities have struggled to navigate the complex bureaucratic  malaise which is the Federal disaster declaration process.   Similarly, across the country, rural communities and relatively small  States are forced to grapple with red tape and often struggle to  demonstrate the severe localized impact of these disasters. In these  instances, FEMA's Small State and Rural Advocate plays a critical role  in helping underserved communities access disaster relief.   The Small State and Rural Advocate's office is intended to help  ensure fair access to FEMA assistance for all disaster-impacted areas,  and it is essential that Congress reinforce its role in facilitating  the delivery of essential aid.   That is why I was proud to introduce the Small State and Rural Rescue  Act alongside Chairwoman Titus and Representatives Gimenez, Pappas,  Guest, and Delgado--a bipartisan bunch.   This legislation takes important steps to expand and codify the  responsibilities of FEMA's Small State and Rural Advocate when it comes  to helping State and local officials respond to a disaster.  Additionally, this legislation directs GAO to conduct a review of how  FEMA mobilizes individual assistance to disaster zones, an essential  part of the disaster relief process.   Legislation like this will go a long way in providing support for the  rural communities and small States that many of us represent. This is  especially important for any of my colleagues on this side of the aisle  who may be concerned about their districts not receiving a fair share  or an equitable share of the Federal disaster aid programs they pay  into.   Mr. Speaker, the Small State and Rural Rescue Act is about fairness  for rural communities. I firmly believe we should pass it into law, and  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 7211.                                time  1530
