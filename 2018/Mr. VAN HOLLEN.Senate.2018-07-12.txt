 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to honor the victims and the  survivors of the terrible shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper  which occurred on June 28. I thank my friend and colleague Senator  Cardin for his remarks earlier today on this floor and thank the Senate  for taking up a resolution in memory of the victims.   Our State of Maryland and the country were horrified by the tragic  attacks on one of our great Maryland institutions--the Capital Gazette  newspaper, the local newspaper of our State capital in Annapolis, which  has been operating since 1727. It was, and is, your quintessential  smalltown newspaper, which serves Annapolis and Anne Arundel County but  is also a newspaper read throughout the State of Maryland.   In that awful shooting, we lost five members of the Capital Gazette:  Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith, and Wendi  Winters.   Gerald Fischman was an editorial page editor whose thoughtful columns  and sly wit shed light on critical community issues. He was well known  for his insatiable curiosity and his love of family, and his talent for  writing extended to poems he composed for his wife Erica.   Rob Hiaasen was a big man with a big presence who applied his  considerable skills as a journalist to mentor others, both fellow  reporters and students at the University of Maryland College of  Journalism. He gave of his time, and he gave of his talent.   John McNamara was a sports writer and sports fan--a big fan of the  University of Maryland Terps. He covered everything from the Orioles to  the local Little League. He was always generous with his time and known  to many who follow sports around the country.   Sales Assistant Rebecca Smith was strong and smart and a fixture at  her fiance Dewayne's softball tournaments. She was also known to be  unfailingly kind and always took the time to make people feel at home  at the Gazette.   Wendi Winters had a great sense of humor and an incredible ability to  pull stories out of just about anyone. Her colleagues say she charged  at the shooter, displaying the bravery and determination she had so  many times before in her life and saving the lives of others at the  newspaper in the process.   Community newspapers like the Capital Gazette are more than just  sources of news; they represent the lifeblood of our communities around  the country and our Nation. They report on everything, big issues and  small issues, because no issue is too small if it affects people in a  particular community. I think all of us know these are the reporters  who stay out late at local council meetings, they are the folks at the  PTA meetings, they are the folks busy collecting news important to  people in a local community. This newspaper has been at this for  hundreds of years.   Even after that awful shooting, the next day the Capital Gazette put  out a newspaper, as they have every day since then, with the help of  fellow journalists at the Baltimore Sun and elsewhere. They put out a  newspaper that talked about the terrible shooting they experienced at  the Capital Gazette and remembered the victims and thanked the first  responders.   I also salute the first responders, an incredible and brave response  from local, State, and Federal agencies. At the local level, they were  on the scene within 60 to 90 seconds. Had that not happened, we would  have had even more than the terrible loss we saw that awful day.   It also should cause all of us to think again about measures we can  take in our communities, in our States, and at the Federal level to  stop the violence. One of the victims, Gerald Fischman, who had been an  editorial writer there, had written earlier in the aftermath of the  terrible shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, and here is what  Gerald Fischman wrote at that time:         Of all the words this week, hopelessness may be the most       dangerous. We must believe there is a solution, a way to       prevent another mass shooting. We must believe that we can       find it if only we try a little harder.    I ask every Member of the Senate, every Member of this Congress,  every elected official, and every citizen, let's work harder to find a  way to end the violence. There are things we can do to reduce the  chances and the awful losses we are seeing around our country, both in  mass shootings and daily violence.   As we remember these victims, I ask that we dedicate ourselves to the  mission of ending the violence.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
