 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule for H.R. 200, the  Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in  Fisheries Management Act. It should be better called the empty oceans  act.   H.R. 200 really risks rolling back science-based conservation  efforts, destroying jobs, and hurting our fisheries and fish stocks. It  undermines successful sustainable fishery management put in place by  the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. That is  why so many fishermen, scientists, and business owners have come out in  opposition to the empty oceans act. Many people whose livelihood comes  from the sea have expressed reservations about the job-destroying  provisions of H.R. 200 and how it poses a threat to the commercial  fishing industry and their jobs, which rely on sustainable practices.  [[Page H6059]]    The Seafood Harvesters of America, a leading trade organization for  fishermen, authored a letter expressing their concerns with the bill.  More than 1,000 individuals and organizations have expressed their  opposition. I had a number of fishermen come by my office today,  telling me that this bill could cost them their jobs.   Since its passage, the goal of Magnuson-Stevens has never wavered:  managing fisheries to ensure sustainability while, of course, realizing  the potential of the resource. Magnuson-Stevens takes a bottom-up  approach to resource management where stakeholders on regional fishery  management councils work to meet the science-based criteria outlined by  the law.   We have some success with this approach. Since the year 2000, we have  seen 44 previously depleted fish stocks rebuilt. Currently, 84 percent  of fish stocks are no longer overfished.   In 1976, Magnuson-Stevens was passed to end unregulated fishing  predominantly by foreign fleets and to develop our own American fleets  that could benefit from our abundant fisheries. The act was  strengthened in 1996 and 2006 through bipartisan reauthorizations that  established science-based fishery management reforms.   The 1996 reauthorization of Magnuson-Stevens bolstered requirements  to prevent overfishing and rebuild fish stocks. And, in 2006, a  bipartisan authorization maintained the commitment to sustainable  fisheries, including accountability and catch limits. These bipartisan  efforts succeeded to help create the sustainable fisheries that support  coastal economies throughout America and, of course, consumers both in  America and worldwide.   Unfortunately, unlike past reauthorizations, H.R. 200 was crafted  through a partisan committee process intent on dismantling much of the  progress made by Magnuson-Stevens over the last 40 years. In fact, the  bill was reported in a party-line vote--Republicans for; Democrats  against--with the Republicans continuing to reject attempts to come up  with a broad bipartisan approach, as this bill has traditionally been  done, that supports both commercial and recreational fishing interests  and, of course, maintaining science-based reforms around  sustainability.                                time  1315    Sadly, H.R. 200 inserts politics into how we manage our fisheries in  several crucial areas. The bill erodes the role that science plays in  managing our fisheries.   The bill guts science-based annual catch limit requirements through  the creation of many exemptions for key species. These exemptions  include many smaller fish that are absolutely critical as prey for  valuable commercial and recreational predator species as part of a  delicately balanced ecosystem. Hundreds of other species are exempted  through this bill which dramatically increases the chances that  overfishing will occur, leading to the devastation, both for sportsmen  and commercial fishermen.   Catch limits are important to help conserve fisheries and are among  the most successful provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. By eroding  those provisions, this bill would allow for a long-term depletion of  fish stocks. It can devastate the economies of local communities,  destroy jobs, and threaten the recovery and stability of our ocean  ecosystems.   This bill also weakens the data collection requirements that ensure  that data-driven, science-based management is used for our fisheries.  Data is currently collected through a broad range of sources, and the  determination of the best available data is used by NOAA Fisheries and  the regional fishery management councils. H.R. 200 would weaken data  collection processes and harm the role of science in successful  management of our fishery resources.   Weakening science-based provisions is only one of the ways that this  bill inserts politics into what should be a scientific question, the  management of our fisheries. This bill not only erodes science-based  management practices, but it rolls back meaningful accountability  requirements for recreational anglers. Large groups representing a few  members of the fishing community and businesses that sell equipment and  boats want to see that these jobs are sustained over time.   According to data from the Recreational Boating & Fishing Foundation  released in May of 2018, participation in recreational fishing has  increased for the past 2 years; 49 million Americans went fishing in  2017, an increase over the prior year. So the recreational side is  strong under the current provisions of Magnuson-Stevens.   And, of course, recreational fishermen are not the only beneficiaries  of the science-based approach. According to the National Marine  Manufacturers Association, U.S. sales of boats and marine products  increased 7 percent since the last passage in 2016.   So from 2016 to 2017, we saw a number of States: Florida, Texas,  Michigan, North Carolina, Minnesota, California, Wisconsin, South  Carolina, and Georgia, with double-digit increases in the sales of new  boats, engines, trailers, and accessories, creating good jobs for  Americans.   Recreational anglers and the businesses that rely upon their support  are doing well and thriving, and this growth is a direct result of  science-based fishery management practices fostered by Magnuson that  this very bill would systematically dismantle, destroying good American  jobs.   Instead of destroying jobs, what the Magnuson-Stevens Act does is  ensure that our maritime industries will thrive now and in the future.  And because of the success of Magnuson-Stevens, U.S. fisheries are  stabilizing and rebounding.   With the bill working as intended, it would be absurd to pass this  bill and roll back these very policies that have led to job creation  and growth, increased enjoyment for recreational fishermen, and better  sustainable practices of ecosystem management.   The Empty Oceans Act also inserts dangerous loopholes into Magnuson  and it is including exemptions to rebuilding requirements that have  helped recover successfully depleted fish stocks.   H.R. 200 potentially exempts hundreds of species from annual catch  limits. That can dramatically increase overfishing, and overfishing may  seem to some lucrative, or to some fun in the short-term, but of course  it has devastating and nonsustainable consequences for our coastal  communities that economically depend on the vital industries of  recreational fishing and sports fishing.   These exemptions increase the chance of overfishing and lengthen the  time it takes to rebuild depleted stocks to healthy levels, if ever.   These loopholes have a devastating effect as well on the commercial  fishing industry and on consumers across the country that enjoy eating  healthy fish. In 2015, commercial and recreational saltwater fishing  generated $208 billion in revenue, supported 1.6 million jobs, and  supported the healthy dining habits of hundreds of millions of American  consumers, billions worldwide.   These economic benefits not only support recreational anglers and  commercial fishing interests but entire towns and cities that rely on  sports fishermen, recreational and commercial, as the entire hub of  their economy.   If the Empty Oceans Act were to pass, the long-term prospects of so  many communities would be devastated. So I think it is important to  have a thoughtful look at how we can continue the bipartisan tradition  of building upon the progress of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, making  corrections where we need to, but making sure that we put science first  in our ocean stewardship, and making sure that we have a sustainable  approach to recreational and commercial fishing.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Carbajal).    I yield the gentleman from California an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we approach another election cycle, it is very important for this  institution to do everything we can to ensure transparency and safety  in our elections and the integrity of the election system itself.                                time  1330    Our democracy is being threatened by corporations, by special  interests, and by foreign powers who are stripping away power from our  people and our voters with dark money spending.   Secret spending in our elections has exploded since the Supreme  Court's 2010 Citizens United decision permitting super-PACs and certain  tax-exempt groups to spend unlimited sums, including, in many cases,  undisclosed funds. The result is unprecedented levels of spending and a  midterm election expected to be the most expensive ever.  [[Page H6061]]    Many of these groups don't even have to disclose their donors,  allowing wealthy corporations and individuals and illicit foreign  influencers to secretly spend unlimited dark money.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Cicilline's  legislation, H.R. 6239, the DISCLOSE Act, which I am proud to be a  cosponsor of. This bicameral bill would require organizations spending  money in Federal elections to disclose their donors and guard against  hidden foreign interference in our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer Mr.  Cicilline's amendment for the DISCLOSE Act. That is why we are talking  about that bill today.   The DISCLOSE Act is an alternative to this job-destroying bill and  anticonsumer bill that we have before us. So I would encourage my  colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can shine a light on  the dark money that continues to pervade and pollute and distort our  political system. I would hope that that is something we can agree on.   I hope my Republican and Democratic friends will vote to defeat the  previous question because it doesn't matter what one's ideology is.  What matters is there should be transparency in money in politics, and  that is a basic tenet that I hope conservatives and liberals and  moderates can agree on, and we can immediately move to that. When we  defeat the previous question, I will offer that amendment based on the  bill by Mr. Cicilline, which I am honored to be a cosponsor of.   Mr. Speaker, this is the third attempt to undermine the provisions of  the Magnuson-Stevens Act that protects jobs and uses science in  decisionmaking with regard to managing our ocean resources. These  attempts failed every time, and the biggest reason they failed is the  framework of Magnuson is working.   We talked about the increase in boat sales. We talked about the  increase in jobs. We talked about the benefit to consumers. I am sure  there is some fine tuning to do, but it is not time to push the reset  button and start over down a very dangerous path that would destroy  jobs and the entire economies of many of our local communities.   This act has been essential, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, in restoring  our depleted fishing populations, helping communities devastated by  overfishing, getting them back in balance. Science-based reforms over  the last two decades have made our fisheries more profitable and  rebuilt overfished stocks and have been of great benefit to consumers.  These reforms have directly benefited recreational fishing interests,  and that is reinforced by their own data of the industry.  [[Page H6062]]    So if we continue down the path of sustainable fisheries management,  commercial and recreational fishermen will see even greater financial  gains and support in the future. In fact, NOAA estimates that fully  rebuilt fisheries would add $31 billion to our economy and create  500,000 new jobs.   We need a benchmark and a path to get there, not a pathway to the  past of unsustainable practices and job destruction, which this bill  does.   These potential jobs and revenues--$31 billion, 500,000 jobs--would  support thousands of coastal communities throughout America, consumers  across our country and the world, far outweighing any short-term  benefit from an empty oceans act.   Only through science-based fisheries management can coastal towns and  cities reap enormous environmental benefits. So, instead of throwing it  away, we should build upon the proven sustainable fisheries management  practices of Magnuson-Stevens in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, this  bill halts decades of progress, ends the science-based approach.   Rather than approving harmful and damaging measures to weaken our  economy and harm the environment, let's start again and begin a true  bipartisan reauthorization, as this Congress did in 1996, as this  Congress did in 2006, to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Act.   I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can move  forward with our discussion of requiring that donations into political  campaigns and allied groups have to be disclosed and to also vote  ``no'' on the rule so that we begin work on a bipartisan  reauthorization of Magnuson-Stevens, building upon the tradition of  this institution and putting science in the front.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
