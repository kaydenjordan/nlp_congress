 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me time to address this very important issue.   I rise today in the best interests of the American people, the  African American community, and my constituents.   I include in the Record this letter from the ACLU about the concerns  of H.R. 2339, Reversing the Youth and Tobacco Epidemic Act.                                                  February 27, 2020.      Re Coalition Concerns with Blanket Prohibition on Menthol and           Other Flavored Tobacco within H.R. 2339, Reversing the           Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.       Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.        The undersigned civil rights and civil liberties       organizations write to express concerns with a broad       prohibition on menthol and other flavored tobacco products       within H.R. 2339, the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic       Act of 2019. While this legislation is a well-intended effort       to address health issues associated with tobacco use among       youth, we have concerns that a blanket prohibition on menthol       and other flavored tobacco products, which will apply to       adults, will (1) disproportionately impact people and       communities of color; (2) trigger criminal penalties,       prioritizing criminalization over public health and harm       reduction; and (3) instigate unconstitutional policing and       other negative interactions with local law enforcement.   I. H.R. 2339 Disproportionately Impacts People and Communities of Color         Of adults, approximately 80 percent of Blacks and 35       percent of Latinx who choose to smoke prefer menthol       cigarettes. Thus, any ban on menthol cigarettes will       disproportionately affect people of color. While H.R. 2339       and similar legislation are often motivated by the desire to       decrease and eliminate smoking among certain populations,       Blacks and other people of color should not       disproportionately bear the brunt of enforcement of such       prohibitions, which a menthol ban would ensure.        Similarly, enforcement of a ban on flavored cigars will       also disproportionally impact people of color given cigar       preferences. Black adults are 60% of cigarillo and nonpremium       cigar smokers, with these products often flavored.       Additionally, at Committee markup, H.R. 2339 was amended to       exempt certain traditional, expensive cigars from a       prohibition of online tobacco sales. There is no       justification for differentiating a La Palina from a Black       and Mild. Making this  [[Page H1264]]       distinction undermines the public health arguments made for       this bill and suggests that some tobacco preferences, within       certain communities, will be prioritized and protected over       others.        II. H.R. 2339 Increases Criminal Penalties Over Public Health         H.R. 2339 prohibits menthol and other flavored tobacco       products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).       This prohibition criminalizes the manufacturing, importing,       distributing, or selling of menthol and other flavored       tobacco products under the FD&C Act, imposing up to three       years of imprisonment. Violating a menthol and flavored       tobacco ban would implicate other federal criminal penalties       as well. For example, the Federal Cigarette Contraband       Trafficking Act would be implicated, allowing up to five       years of imprisonment.        With a criminal legal system that incarcerates Blacks at       nearly six times the rate of white Americans and a prison       population that is 67 percent Black and Latinx, any       prohibition on menthol and flavored tobacco products promises       continued overcriminalization and mass incarceration of       people of color. A ban on menthol and flavored tobacco       products could reintroduce many of the harms imposed by the       failed war on drugs as lawmakers work to legalize cannabis       and take a public health approach to opioids. A bill       criminalizing tobacco is contrary to those efforts. Righting       the wrongs of earlier failed drug policy requires       consideration of the unintended consequences of well-      intentioned policies, especially on the most vulnerable       communities. It also requires us to remember that harm       reduction, including education and counseling, are what work       to reduce usage and harm in our society, not prohibition.              III. H.R. 2339 Encourages Harmful Police Practices         Recent history shows us that drug prohibitions and bans       increase negative interactions between law enforcement and       people of color. The New York Police Department's (NYPD) stop       and frisk program resulted in nearly 700,000 stops in 2011,       with drugs serving as the alleged pretext for most of those       stops. Ninety percent of those stops were of Black and Latinx       people. We are concerned that law enforcement's attempts to       enforce a menthol and flavored tobacco ban will undoubtedly       lead to fines, arrests, and eventual incarceration for those       who continue to use and sell menthol and flavored tobacco       products. While the legislation was amended at Committee to       try to minimize law enforcement practices here, it only       applies in the context of federal enforcement of the FD&C       Act; it does not govern local enforcement around any state       and city prohibition policies that will follow.        The death of Eric Garner in 2014 generated national       attention not only for the brutality he experienced at the       hands of NYPD police, but for the reason that led to the       encounter with law enforcement. Mr. Garner died from an       illegal chokehold having been stopped by police for selling       single cigarettes in violation of state law. Gwendolyn Carr,       Eric Garner's mother, cautions: ``When you ban a product sold       mostly in Black communities, you must consider the reality of       what will happen to that very same overrepresented community       in the criminal justice system.'' With a federal prohibition       on menthol and flavored tobacco products, states will develop       their own prohibition and enforcement policies that could       result in harmful police practices like that witnessed with       Mr. Garner.        Based on our concerns, we urge you to not impose a blanket       ban on menthol and related tobacco products. A prohibition on       all menthol and flavored tobacco products will not achieve a       public heath goal of reducing smoking among Black people,       young people, or others. We hope we can work together to       avoid repetitions of policies that are intended to protect       youth and communities of color, but instead only further       engrain systemic criminalization and racism.            Sincerely,        American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Popular       Democracy, Drug Policy Alliance, Friends Committee on       National Legislation, Law Enforcement Action Partnership,       National Action Network, National Association of Criminal       Defense Lawyers.                                time  0930     While it is indeed a health imperative to  reduce and eliminate the use of tobacco products in our society, I  would like to recognize the inequity, potential harm, and unintended  consequences of a ban on menthol combustible products within the  Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.   This bill's purpose is to curb youth tobacco usage by banning  flavored tobacco products, more specifically ending the scourge of  youth vaping in our Nation and the flavored products used to attract  young people to its use.   However, this legislation has dire, unintended consequences for  African American users, the overwhelming majority of which are over the  age of 21.   It does not treat all flavored tobacco products equally, exempting  premium cigars preferred by White smokers, yet banning menthol  cigarettes. Menthol is the preferred flavor of African American tobacco  users, used by 90 percent of Black tobacco users.   While I would love to assume the best intentions of all parties of  this legislation and hope for the best in regard to law enforcement,  lived experiences demand caution.    Madam Speaker, as a result of this asymmetric  ban, law enforcement would have an additional reason to stop and frisk  menthol tobacco users because menthol would be considered illegal under  this ban.   Having said that, I cannot support H.R. 2339 due to the potentially  dire consequences that would create additional stop and frisk  opportunities of African Americans and the constituents I took an oath  to protect.   I really believe that this is a health imperative, and if that is the  case, the ban should be on all tobacco products and would be the best  answer. Unfortunately, this bill does not do that.
