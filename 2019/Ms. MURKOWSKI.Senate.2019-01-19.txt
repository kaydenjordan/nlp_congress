 Madam President, it is unusual to be here on a  Saturday morning in Washington, DC, but recognizing that we have been  in the midst of a partial government shutdown for now 29 days, it seems  to me that this is an absolutely appropriate place where we should be.  We should be here working. We should be here trying to figure out how  we get back to the business of governing.   I think it is fair to say that there has been a great deal of  frustration. I think the four Senators who are assembled in this  Chamber today are part of a group with whom I have shared that  frustration on a daily, if not hourly, basis.   I think there have been very good-faith efforts to try to advance  discussions on a bipartisan basis and a bicameral basis, trying to  allow for a process that would allow us to consider the work and the  legitimate request of a President who has clear priorities when it  comes to border security and what we need to do and how we might need  to do it, but it is very difficult to do it when we are not fully  governing, when you have a partial government shutdown, when you have  men and women who we are asking to do the work within their Agencies,  but then they are not being paid. They are being told they will be paid  when this is all over, but the uncertainty of when that ``all over'' is  is very heavy on them--very heavy on them and their families.   Today, I want to share with colleagues the view from one community in  Alaska. Alaska is a State that relies heavily on our Coast Guard. We  have about 3,000 active Coast Guard in this State--2,972 exactly, and  285 civilians. We are proud to host the largest Coast Guard Air Station  in the country on Kodiak.   I thought Kodiak was the largest island in the country. It is not.  Hawaii beats us. The Big Island beats us. Kodiak is a large, large  island off of the southeastern, southwestern, and south central part of  the State of Alaska. There are about 6,000 people in Kodiak--6,013  based on the last census.  [[Page S310]]  Within that Coast Guard community of Kodiak, you have 1,141 Active  Duty, 102 civilian employees, and 1 Coast Guard reservist. This is a  community. When they say that we are a Coast Guard town, Kodiak is  truly a Coast Guard town. It is about one-third of the economy that is  based off of the Coast Guard there.   This is an island that--I don't know. I probably should have checked  air prices before I came to the floor, but it seems to me the last time  I flew down there, going out of Anchorage to Kodiak, you are probably  spending $400 to $500 for an airplane ticket.   So you are geographically removed. You are removed certainly from a  financial perspective in terms of your ability to move back and forth.  Jobs are challenging in a community like this. December, January are  usually the highest months of unemployment, but in December, so just  last month, we were at 8.8 percent in Kodiak. You compare that to last  January of 2018, it was 8.4 percent. So there is a lot of unemployment  there. There are not a lot of jobs and job opportunities in a community  like this.   So you have your Coast Guard, and the other economic base for the  community, really, is our fisheries and our local and small businesses.   So within the fisheries, you have your Federal Government Agencies  that are there to provide for the opportunities. Right now, we are  going into the ``A'' season for pollock, I believe, coming up in just a  few days, but this requires your Agencies to be up and functioning. So  it is NOAA. It is NMFS. It is Fish and Wildlife. You need to have these  folks in their offices answering the phone, responding to texts.   We also, on Kodiak Island, have significant refuge land, parkland,  and, again, Fish and Wildlife managers on the refuge there.   So we have an island community cut off from the rest of the State-- probably 4,300, 4,400 miles from where we are sitting here today--and  the reliance on the Federal interest is probably pretty  disproportionate relative to other communities.   Much of the Indigenous population there relies on the Kodiak Area  Native Association Healthcare. So the Indian Health Service is having  challenges because the Department of Interior is shut down. So the  impact in so many different ways on this community of 6,000 people is  extraordinarily substantial.   I made contact with the spouses of the Coast Guard's men and women  there and asked if I could do a Skype, do a FaceTime with them while  they were having coffee because I wanted to understand for myself, what  does it mean when you are the Coast Guard spouse and your husband or  your wife is out either flying as a C-130 pilot down in the Aleutians,  whether it is a helo pilot who is looking to do a medevac out of King  Cove, whether it is the wife of one of the spouses who is out on the  Alex Haley, whether it is the spouse who is at dry dock on the SPAR in  Seward, the aviation instructor--these are all men and women who are  going out, and they are doing really important things for us in Alaska.   This is a time of year when the fishing industry is going strong. It  is crab season, but it is also not cruise weather for those who are out  on the waters, and we rely on the extraordinary efforts of our Coast  Guard's men and women to provide for that search and rescue, if need  be, and fisheries enforcement--so the role the Coast Guard plays in not  only supporting the local economy but making sure that second leg of  our economy, the fisheries, are safe, regulated, and protected.   Let me show you just the base there in Kodiak. It is nothing  grandiose and beautiful and extraordinary. It is actually an  extraordinarily beautiful location to be stationed there in Kodiak.  This is the community. This is where they live and work and raise their  families. There are others who are sitting up on the hillside in  housing, but it is a pretty tight-knit community.   To be able to visit with this group of spouses yesterday was really  quite compelling, and so I wanted to just take a few minutes and share  some of the comments from these, primarily women--and men--about what  is happening right now.   One individual, Sarah, mentioned that her husband is out on the SPAR,  which is a cutter. Well, they are in dry dock in Seward, another Coast  Guard facility, but because they are not being paid, they are sitting  in a community where they really have no resources to do anything. They  have to stay on the ship. It is not like they can go off and go out and  about. You are really kind of stuck there.   She happens to work for the Chamber of Commerce in Kodiak and so was  able to share some of the stories about the impact on the local  businesses, and she was saying that you go on Facebook and there will  be postings of empty restaurants, empty establishments, saying: Please  come. We are looking for customers. There is a discount for coming in  and having a cup of coffee. King's Diner's business is down 50 percent.  They are offering a 10-percent discount to those without paychecks.   We got a call from a gentleman who has a welding business there in  Kodiak, and he says he is out $300,000 in payments from Coast Guard  projects that have already been completed. He said these contracts  equal 10 to 15 percent of his gross annual income. So what is he doing?  He is not a Federal employee, but it is impacting his business in a  significant--significant--way, and he is saying: I am going to have to  go out and get loans.   So the impact on the community writ large is clearly significant.   Some of the other comments we heard was about the effort to provide  for food--so the effort to provide for local food distribution through  a food pantry and the effort to collect donations from around the State  to be able to send down to Kodiak. These are things where you think,  oh, the generosity of Alaskans to come together, but in talking to  these spouses, they reminded me: We are the guardians of our homeland.  We are proud people. We are proud families, and to think that in order  to be able to serve and to keep the family fed, I have to go to a food  pantry? This is really, really very, very hard.   Kodiak, as you saw from the map there, is isolated. Isolation  delivers a lot of different things, and one thing it clearly delivers  is that it is expensive to live there. It is expensive to live there.   We were told that right now the price of gas is about $4 a gallon.  There was a report that came out of NBC this week that mentioned that  one individual said his weekly budget for food was three times more  than his friend who happens to live in Ohio. So it is keeping your  house warm, filling up your vehicle, buying groceries at the store.   Childcare is something we talked about extensively because the hours  at the childcare center have been cut back. There is no alternative,  really, out in the community for childcare for these Coast Guard men  and women. There is, I think she said, not even two facilities where  they were taking children under the age of 6 months. So infants we are  seeing on base--and apparently there has been a good slug of new babies  who have been born. We are growing some new Coast Guard recruits here,  but when you don't have the ability to provide for childcare, and you  need to be working, where do you go? What do you do?   The price of childcare, in talking to one of the spouses there, is  $1,600 a month. So think about that. You have a child, $1,600 a month  for one child, and you are paying $4 a gallon for gas. You are some  4,000 to 5,000 miles away from any family support. So it is not like  you can just say to grandma or to your aunt: Hey, can you come and help  me with the kids? You don't have that kind of support like we do in  other areas.   So when we talk about the impacts of a shutdown, a partial shutdown,  and not getting pay, at least for this period, for an indefinite  period, it is more than just the financial impact. We talked a lot  about that, but even more than the financial impact was the stress that  comes to the families because of the financial impact.   The reality you face as a Coast Guard family is you move a lot. So  you have that stress. You are away from your family support system,  like I mentioned. You have a lot of families with new kids. Now you  don't know when you are going to see that pay. You are in a place where  your costs are really high. You don't have many options for short-term  or short-time work.   I asked: Well, what are you doing? Are any of you getting additional  work  [[Page S311]]  to help bridge this gap? They all just kind of laughed. It wasn't a  happy laugh. It was a cynical laugh, like, where do you expect us to go  to work when the establishments we might go to, whether it is a  restaurant or some small business, is posting things on Facebook,  saying that we need customers? Do you think they are going to hire  people? That is not happening in a community like this.   Further, they don't know how long they may be there. If it requires  some level of training and you can't commit and you say: Well, if the  government gets back to business, maybe, just maybe, I don't need to be  here--well, you are not going to be investing in that individual. So  you have that stressor.   The stress I think our families see--and I have such respect for the  men and women who are staying at home while our Active are serving,  whether they are helping pluck fishermen out of the sea in the north or  whether they are interdicting drugs in the southern waters--spouses  have learned how to hold things together and be tough, just figure it  out. There is not a lot of complaining that is going on.   When you have a mom tell me, as she did yesterday, that the spending  money the kids got for Christmas, they said: We are not going to spend  it, Mom, because we think we might need it for food or when the 13- year-old girl says: I am not going to cash the birthday check I got  from Grandma because we might need it--and I was reminded by several of  these spouses that this is an adult problem. This is not a kids'  problem. Our children should not have to be worrying about this, but  they can't help but pick it up. They know what is going on, and they  are worried. To have a mom tell me--one of the moms said: We are just  doing everything to pull it together, so I am having to say things  like: I am sorry. We are not going to be ordering the yearbook.   This is not paying for fancy sports programs even, it is: I don't  know that we are going to be able to order the yearbook, and it is  canceling tutors. It is making a difference in all of that.   I think, again, about the weight our spouses are bearing and how they  are handling it.   One woman said: Hey, we are lucky. My husband is an avid hunter and a  fisherman. We have a freezer full of meat. We have moose and salmon,  but not everybody is so lucky here.   One woman said: I have made a complete inventory of everything I have  in the pantry just so I know and I can be planning ahead.   This is hard on everyone.   The impact to enlistment is something we need to be thinking about,  and that was raised repeatedly.   One woman said: My husband and I both joined the Coast Guard because  we liked the stability that this offered us--maybe not stability  insofar as moving around from location to location but stability in the  fact that you are a Federal employee. You are going to have that  support from your government.   She said: You know, now, I don't think of this as a very stable  opportunity.   Another thing I learned yesterday is that it was apparently just a  week or so ago--maybe it was a couple of weeks ago--that the Coast  Guard boot camp program where the new recruits come in was completed.  Where did those young Coasties go who have the new shaved, good-looking  tops? They went back home. They sent them back home because they don't  have any place for them to go. What do you think that does to  recruitment?   Another issue that came up that was fascinating to me that we don't  think about in this land of unintended consequences when there is a  partial government shutdown that goes on for 29 days--these Coast Guard  men and women--Federal employees--when they do official travel, it goes  on an official card. That card is issued in your name. So if you are  the Coast Guard member who needs to go out and inspect a boat in Dutch  Harbor and you are based out of Anchorage, a flight to Dutch Harbor  roundtrip, last I checked, is close to $1,000. That goes on the card.  The way the process works is that you are reimbursed on your government  card, but during this shutdown, none of these expenses are being  reimbursed. That card is tied to your name, tied to your credit rating.  That was where the conversation really got lively. The spouses were  talking about, do you know what happens to us when the credit rating  goes south? Do you know what that means in terms of our ability to have  a security clearance? Do you know what that means in terms of our  ability to transfer?   It would be one thing if you could say: Oh well, I will just pay for  it out of my savings.   That was what another spouse said to me. She said: You know, I really  take offense because I feel there are a lot of people out there who  place judgment on us because they say ``You should have saved for  something like this.'' The response is ``I am in the Coast Guard. I  move around.''   Many of these families have invested in a home, and when they are  transferred, they keep that home. They try to make some money off of  it. Many of them rent to another Coast Guard family. Now that family is  not getting paid either. The stress compiled upon stress is just awful.   We were reminded that this is not a natural disaster; this is a  manmade disaster.   Another woman said: The military are proud. They should be honored  and respected.   One really summed it up from the Coast Guard's view, in my opinion.  She said: We are not going to sink. We are not going to sink. We will  still float, but that doesn't mean that we are not upset and we are not  angry.   They shared these stories with a great deal of respect but were truly  begging for us to resolve these issues. They all understand that there  is this effort out there to pay the Active-Duty and military Coast  Guard, but there are Coast Guard families on this base, and there are  Active Coast Guard working side by side with the civilians, helping  them keep those boats in tip-top shape, keeping the helicopters in the  air, keeping the C-130s in the air. They are all working together. So  how is it right that side by side, oftentimes sharing the same job,  that one would get pay and the others would not? So they have said:  Don't forget the civilian side as well.   I want to end my comments because I know the Senator from Virginia  would like to speak as well.   I have a soft spot in my heart for Kodiak. I think that is because I  myself am a Coast Guard kid. When I go to Kodiak, the gathering place  in Kodiak is a great little brewery called Kodiak Brewery. It is a  gathering place for not only the politicians who come to town but all  the Coasties. The community comes together. This is where birthdays  take place. This is where you come and have a beer after work.   This is an online post from yesterday. It says:         This is a sad empty brewery. We're lonely and you're       thirsty, and we want to support our community in a time of       need. We're doing a ``shutdown'' sale: $1 off servings until       sanity prevails! Hopefully we all get through this!    There is not a soul in the place. It is just a reminder of the  extraordinary ripple effect. When you say it is just the Federal  employees, first of all, I think that is offensive because our Federal  employees do extraordinary service for our country. It affects all of  us, and it is up to all of us to get this resolved.   I have been so disappointed this week that we have not been able to  advance a more positive solution, to work on an immediate outcome to  help with this, but my frustration is nothing compared to these  families'--these men and women who are serving, those who are staying  at home--the worry, angst, and stress we see. We owe it to the people  of Kodiak, we owe it to the people of this country to get this place  working again.   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 25, submitted earlier  today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask unanimous consent for a second reading, and  in order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  following the remarks of Senator Warner, the Senate stand adjourned  under the previous order.
