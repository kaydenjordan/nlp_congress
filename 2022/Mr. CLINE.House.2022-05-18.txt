 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Roanoker  Restaurant, an establishment so iconic it carries its city's namesake.   Opened in 1941 by Craft Warren, this Roanoke staple has served as a  gathering place for generations. For nearly 81 years, The Roanoker  provided folks across the Star City a place to come together over a  delicious, home-cooked meal.   Its current owner, Butch Craft, began working at the restaurant more  than 52 years ago before eventually taking over the business.   Over the course of its storied history, the restaurant has moved  throughout Roanoke before making its way to its current and,  unfortunately, final home on Colonial Avenue in 1982.   This week, the entire Star City was saddened to learn that, after  more than eight decades in business, The Roanoker will be closing its  doors at the end of the month.   One resident said it best: It is going to be greatly missed, no doubt  about it. It is going to be so missed.  [[Page H5103]]    It certainly will be, and I will take a moment to thank the Warren  family, Butch Craft, and everyone who has worked at The Roanoker and  made it such a success and made diners feel at home for so many years.                            ____________________
