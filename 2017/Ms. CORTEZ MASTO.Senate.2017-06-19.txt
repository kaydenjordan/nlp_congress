 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues to  speak out on the secret healthcare legislation that Republicans are  attempting to jam through the Senate without any public review or  consideration.   This is an insult to the American people. It is a shameful abdication  of the role of a U.S. Senator to represent the concerns and priorities  of the people of a State and country. We were elected to be a voice for  the people of our individual States. What I am hearing loud and clear  from my State is: Keep the Affordable Care Act. Do not repeal it. Keep  it, and work together to improve it.   Like my colleagues, I wish to share the story of one of the many  Nevadans who have contacted me to share their story about the ACA and  why they so desperately want to avoid its repeal.   Jessica and her husband own a brewery in Reno, NV, and I was lucky  enough to get to meet and speak with her in person when I was home last  month touring the Community Health Alliance Center.   After meeting with her, I had the opportunity to sit and talk with so  many incredible people--doctors, nurses, people who care about the very  faces of women, men, and children we are talking about tonight. This is  Jessica's letter to me, and this is what I would like to share with  you, what she wrote to me.         Dear Senator Cortez Masto,        I am a resident of Nevada, a small business owner, and a       mother. I am writing to express my views about the Affordable       Care Act. The Affordable Care Act has had a tremendously       positive effect on my life, and I would like to share my       story with you.        The Affordable Care Act saved my small business.        When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)       was signed into law in 2010, and when it was upheld by the       Supreme Court in 2012, my husband and I were in the planning       stages of our small business. At the time, my family was       provided health insurance through my corporate job. Knowing       the ACA would take effect gave me the peace of mind to leave       my job and become a full time small business owner. Today,       our business, Under the Rose Brewing Company, is celebrating       our 4th year in existence, and we are in the beginning stages       of a large expansion, which will create many new jobs in       Reno. This business would not have survived without my full-      time dedication. I would not have been able to leave my       corporate job without the ability to procure affordable       healthcare for my family.        The Affordable Care Act allowed me to start my family in a       healthy way.        As my husband and I prepared to sign up for our first year       of health care with the ACA, we found out that I was       pregnant. Prior to the ACA, health insurers were allowed to       consider pregnancy a ``pre-existing condition.'' Instead of       being denied coverage or charged higher premiums, I was able       to receive appropriate and affordable care during my       pregnancy through the ACA.        The Affordable Care Act saved my life and my baby's life.        30 weeks into my pregnancy, at a regular checkup with our       midwife, my husband and I were advised to see a doctor. Since       I didn't look sick or feel sick, we hesitated, but our       midwife was positive it would be for the best. Our insurance       through ACA allowed us to see the recommended OBGYN. Half way       through our appointment he became very concerned and rushed       me into the hospital. My son was born by emergency C-section       a few hours later. Several doctors agreed that neither the       baby nor myself would have survived a further 24 hours of       pregnancy. Having health insurance through the ACA allowed       my husband and I to seek treatment and care without having       to worry about the affordability of following doctor's       orders. This is the first time I could say that the ACA       saved my life and the life of my beautiful baby boy.        The Affordable Care Act saved my baby's health [and       provided us with health insurance].        Thus my son was born 9 weeks early and was admitted into       the NICU. He stayed in the NICU for 32 days and was under       constant doctor care. By the time he left the hospital, we       had incurred well over 1 million dollars in total costs. The       ACA allowed him to start his life without a cap on his total       lifetime healthcare coverage. Prior to the ACA, many NICU       babies reach their lifetime limits before even feeling the       sunshine on their faces. I am eternally grateful for this       provision of the ACA.        One week after bringing our beautiful baby boy home from       our hospital's NICU, I found myself in need of emergency care       for a second time. I suffered a postpartum stroke. I was       taken to the emergency room and admitted to the hospital for       the second time in 2 months. Again, the ACA allowed me to       seek treatment and care without worrying about coverage.        The Affordable Care Act will save my son's healthcare. My       son now has a medical issue with his growth. Should the ACA       be repealed, amended, or replaced with something less       inclusive, this issue will be considered a preexisting       condition. The thought of my 18-month-old son being denied       coverage, or potentially not being able to afford the       healthcare offered to him, makes me sick to my stomach. Why       would our lawmakers vote to take this away from him? I       implore you to consider the great lengths the Affordable Care       Act has gone to not only improve and save lives in my family,       but families across the Great State of Nevada. I further       implore you to consider the children currently covered and       benefitting from the ACA as you contemplate your vote on this       significant matter. I strongly urge you to defend this       crucial legislation. Too many of your Nevadan constituents       rely on this lifesaving, health-saving and financial-saving       legislation.        Thank you for reading my story and considering my views. I       am happy to speak directly with you.        Sincerely, [Jessica] and family.    Mr. President, I know Jessica's story is one of thousands. I hope my  colleagues across the aisle think of Jesse and her family and the  millions of Americans like her who have so much at stake while  continuing to secretly rewrite our country's healthcare laws.   Thank you for listening.   I yield the floor.
