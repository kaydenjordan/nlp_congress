Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Training                Initiative.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the  Committee on Homeland Security for their support for moving my bill,  H.R. 7777, the Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Training Act,  through committee. I thank the Speaker and majority leader for bringing  this measure to the floor today.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 7777 is not only a winning number on a slot  machine; it is a winning formula for bringing cyber hygiene to our  industrial control systems across America.   Every day, we rely on critical infrastructure to power our homes,  fuel our cars, and connect us online. One essential component of  critical infrastructure is industrial control systems, also known as  ICS, which digitally manage operations of these vital systems.   As Congress considers legislation to address cybersecurity threats to  America's interests, my legislation would help to secure vulnerable ICS  at every level of our economy and our government. H.R. 7777 would make  permanent an existing education initiative within the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency, also known as CISA.   This initiative, the ICS training initiative, provides free virtual  and in-person cybersecurity training to public and private security  entities, including critical infrastructure administrators, national  laboratories, and even small businesses.   This training equips technology professionals across all levels with  the tools and expertise necessary to secure themselves against advanced  persistent threats.   When threats turn into successful attacks, it impacts the daily lives  of every American, including sowing discord into our electoral  processes, as we have seen election after election; shutting down our  pipelines; or breaking down supply chains that provide essential food  and other materials.   That means virtually everything that is connected to a network has a  potential vulnerability, or what we would refer to as a left-of-boom  vulnerability, the vulnerability that exists before the attack occurs.  Every person, small business, or government database is a potential  target.   In 2021 alone, cybercrimes inflicted approximately $6 trillion in  damages across the world. Attacks on industrial networks account for a  significant portion of that number, and it is only going to get worse  in the future.   These threats often emerge from sophisticated state actors, like  Russia and China, that have the ability to exploit vulnerabilities to  disrupt and destroy the systems that make our way of life possible.   As Putin and his regime become increasingly isolated because of a  successful sanctions regime and the effort that we are prosecuting to  help keep Ukraine in the fight, we should expect the Kremlin to  progressively target the United States and our allies with  unconventional cyberattacks on our election systems and critical  infrastructure. Any success that Russia has in exploiting  vulnerabilities will inevitably be closely watched by other countries,  particularly China.   In sum, we know this threat is real and that malignant actors will  persistently probe our systems to find additional weaknesses to  exploit, which would cause real harms, harms to Americans that would  blunt innovation, steal American secrets, and destroy America's small  businesses.   In my district, cybersecurity professionals deal with threats to ICS  every single day. I specifically note two major Federal research  centers, Sandia and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, which  play a critical role in protecting against worldwide cyber threats.  They are in the heart of my district in Livermore, California.   This support is leveraged every day by numerous Federal agencies,  including CISA, which sit on the front lines of protecting our  infrastructure from bad actors. We in Congress must do everything we  can to equip our security protectors with the resources they need to  continue the fight, and that is what this legislation does.   Resources must include proactive ways to help cybersecurity-focused  entities retain a competitive workforce. The training programs in my  legislation will equip technology professionals with the skills,  expertise, and resources they need to build resilience against threats  to some of our most sensitive facilities.  [[Page H5691]]    I applaud CISA for increasing these trainings, which H.R. 7777--which  I love saying--would make permanent. This commonsense program is an  easy solution to build resilience against cyberattacks for our most  vulnerable systems.   Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I appreciate the bipartisan, cooperative effort here to make sure  that our cyber professionals across America are ready to meet the  growing threats from Russia, China, and even nonstate cyber actors.  That is exactly what H.R. 7777 seeks to do, by authorizing CISA's ICS  cybersecurity training program and directing CISA to report to Congress  annually about the initiative.   Improving the state of our cybersecurity workforce will be an ongoing  effort, and these reports will help Congress continue to strengthen  this program in the future.   Passing this bill will help us continue to move forward in developing  the cybersecurity workforce we need to defend against the growing cyber  threats that we face. In particular, this will help strengthen small  businesses, particularly those in critical infrastructure, who do not  yet today have cybersecurity defense forces receiving that training.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7777, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7174) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  reauthorize the National Computer Forensics Institute of the United  States Secret Service, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7174, the National Computer  Forensics Institute Reauthorization Act of 2022, introduced in this  House by Ms. Slotkin of Michigan.   Ms. Slotkin's legislation addresses ransomware threats that are on  the rise and are costing American companies and the American people  millions of dollars each year. In fact, former Cisco CEO John Chambers  estimates that in the year 2022, we will see approximately $120,000, on  average, in costs to 60,000 American businesses who will be victims of  ransomware attacks.   Ransomware attacks have targeted our most critical industries, from  the energy sector to food processing to schools and even hospitals.  State and local law enforcement are on the front lines of protecting  against this threat and often are the first people called when an  attack occurs, and they are on the ground in communities to respond.   Recently, FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that within an hour,  if a business calls the FBI, one of his agents can respond, either  virtually or at their doorstep, to assist them.   More than ever, State and local law enforcement need the training and  tools to investigate and respond to ransomware and other cyber-based  attacks. That is where the National Computer Forensics Institute, or  NCFI, comes in.   Established in 2008 by the U.S. Secret Service, NCFI is recognized as  a preeminent Federal facility for State and local law enforcement to  receive cybersecurity training.   At NCFI, the Secret Service trains State, local, Tribal, and  territory officers, prosecutors, and judges in cybercrime  investigations and cyber-incident response.   To date, because of this training, more than 18,000 law enforcement  officers, prosecutors, and judges across all 50 States and territories  have received training at NCFI's center in Hoover, Alabama.   As introduced, Ms. Slotkin's H.R. 7174 would reauthorize NCFI through  2032.   Like many of my colleagues here in Congress, I began my career as a  prosecutor, and I know the importance of training law enforcement,  prosecutors, and judicial officers.   Before a case ever reaches the trial stage, dozens of law enforcement  officers, investigators, and attorneys have pored over every shred of  evidence to ensure justice is served.   Since evidence today is increasingly digital and more and more  meticulous to review, it is imperative that law enforcement,  prosecutors, and judicial officers from communities across the country  have access to necessary training on emerging and digital technologies,  like AI, and equipment to put that training into action. That is what  Ms. Slotkin's bill will do.   H.R. 7174 will ensure that NCFI's operation will continue for 10 more  years and better position the institute for success.   The bill strengthens its operations by requiring privacy, civil  rights, and civil liberties protections be integrated into the  training; it authorizes NCFI to engage in research and development of  different approaches to training for investigations involving  ransomware and threats involving the use of emerging digital assets;  and it requires the Secret Service Director to report on the demand for  training at NCFI, the institute's ability to meet that demand, and  whether to expand further NCFI facilities and training opportunities.   NCFI's authority to continue its training will end in November of  this year, but we know that cyber actors, nation-state and non-nation- state, their efforts will not, which makes H.R. 7174's swift passage so  important.   The House authorized the NCFI by an overwhelming bipartisan vote in  the 115th Congress, and the Committee on  [[Page H5693]]  Homeland Security passed this bipartisan bill by unanimous voice vote  last month. It has 17 bipartisan cosponsors.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleague to support Ms. Slotkin's  legislation once again, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2022.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: This letter is to advise you that       the Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 7174, the ``National Computer       Forensics Institute Reauthorization Act of 2022,'' that fall       within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting       with us on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no       objection to your including them in the bill for       consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 7174, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.

Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 7174, the ``National Computer Forensics Institute       Reauthorization Act of 2022.'' I recognize that the Committee       on the Judiciary has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 7174,       and I appreciate your effort to allow this bill to be       considered on the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on the Judiciary with       respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future, and I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 7174 in the Committee       report on this measure and in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration of this bill. I look forward to working       with you on this legislation and other matters of great       importance to this Nation.            Sincerely,                                             Bennie G. Thompson,                                                           Chairman,                                    Committee on Homeland Security.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As stated, the NCFI training and education program is too important  to expire. It will do so in November. I appreciate the gentlewoman from  Iowa and her side's support for this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge swift passage of H.R. 7174, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5274) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide  training for U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel on the use of  containment devices to prevent secondary exposure to fentanyl and other  potentially lethal substances, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5274         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Prevent Exposure to       Narcotics and Toxics Act of 2021'' or the ``PREVENT ACT of       2021''.       SEC. 2. PROVIDING TRAINING FOR U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER                     PROTECTION PERSONNEL ON THE USE OF CONTAINMENT                     DEVICES TO PREVENT SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO                     FENTANYL AND OTHER POTENTIALLY LETHAL                     SUBSTANCES.         (a) Training.--Paragraph (1) of section 416(b) of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 216(b)) is amended by       adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(C) How to use containment devices to prevent secondary       exposure to fentanyl and other potentially lethal       substances.''.        (b) Availability of Containment Devices.--Section 416(c) of       the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 216(c)) is       amended--        (1) by striking ``and'' after ``equipment'' and inserting a       comma; and        (2) by inserting ``and containment devices'' after       ``naloxone,''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5274, the Prevent  Exposure to Narcotics and Toxics Act, as introduced by my friend and  colleague, Representative Joyce of Ohio. I see that he is here, so I  will let him speak on his bill, and I will follow up shortly.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 5274, the ``PREVENT Act of 2021.'' I recognize that the       Committee on Ways and Means has a jurisdictional interest in       H.R. 5274, and I appreciate your effort to allow this bill to       be considered on the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on Ways and Means with       respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future, and I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 5274 in the Committee       report on this measure and in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration of this bill.

Thompson,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Homeland Security.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                      Washington, DC, June 17, 2022.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chair, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Thompson: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H.R. 5274, the ``PREVENT Act of       2021'', the Committee on Ways and Means agrees to waive       formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that fall       within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and       Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 5274.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,                                                             Chair.
