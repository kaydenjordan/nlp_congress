 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, the Republican conference  met and selected its leadership team for the 118th Congress. I am  deeply honored that my remarkable colleagues on this side of the aisle  decided to rehire me for another term as Republican leader. I am proud  of Senators Thune, Barrasso, Ernst, Capito, and Daines, who were also  elected to take on critical roles for the next 2 years.   We have impressive new Senators-elect. We have outstanding returning  Members. Our conference is brimming with energy, ideas, and enthusiasm  to fight for the millions and millions of Americans who elected  Republican Senators to be their champions and their voice in this  Chamber.   Republicans are a big-tent party that unites around commonsense,  conservative principles and policies to make our Nation stronger and  make American families' lives better. We stand for fiscal sanity  instead of the reckless liberal spending that created jaw-dropping  inflation. We stand for the pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth ideas  that built the best economy for working people in a generation, before  COVID-19. Republican policies have fueled low inflation, low  unemployment, and robust growth, all at the very same time.   We stand for a strong, modern military that can deter and defeat  America's enemies and confident American leadership in the world  instead of this administration's deeply botched retreat from  Afghanistan and desperate cozying up to the murderous regime in Tehran.   We stand for American energy dominance instead of cutting off our own  supplies and canceling out our own pipelines while begging foreign  dictators to produce more.   We stand for real energy independence, not making China rich by  buying solar panel components that make American energy more expensive  and less reliable.   We stand for safer streets, and we understand that real compassion  means ensuring safety and security for innocent people, not giving  shorter sentences to the violent convicts who hurt them.   We stand for securing our border and enforcing our laws instead of  letting unvetted people and illegal drugs pour into our country 24/7.   We stand for putting parents' rights and parents' involvement back  into our Nation's schools and getting radical indoctrination out.   We stand for the quaint notion that judges need to follow our laws  and the Constitution as they are written, not act like a third  legislative branch that our citizens can't vote out.   We stand for free speech, religious liberty, and the freedom of  worship instead of using the courts and the government to prosecute men  and women of faith.   This is where we stand, Madam President, and it just so happens that  the American people stand with us. Last week's exit poll showed that  Republicans are more trusted on the kitchen-table issues that keep  American families awake at night. When the American people got a clear,  unmuddled look at our commonsense, conservative approach to the issues,  they liked what they saw. We have 49 outstanding Members on this side  of the aisle who are living proof of that fact, and in just a few more  weeks, we will have 50.   It is the honor of a lifetime to serve alongside my distinguished  colleagues and to serve our conference in this leadership role.   Now on a related matter, yesterday evening brought confirmation of  some great news for the future of our country. Republicans have secured  the majority in the House of Representatives for the next 2 years. It  will be Senate Republicans' great pleasure to partner closely with and  serve alongside the new Republican House. I want to congratulate soon- to-be Speaker McCarthy and all of the new and returning Members of  Congress across the Capitol whose elections will be transforming the  people's House from a reckless rubberstamp into a sorely needed check  and balance.   The composition of the new House demonstrates that fatigue and  exhaustion with reckless and radical far-left policies are not just  limited to so-called red or purple States. New Republican Congress men  and women have been hired by their neighbors even in deep-blue States  like New York and California--even further evidence that when the  American people get an unmuddled look at our commonsense, conservative  vision on the issues, they like what they see. So I look forward to  working with our House Republican colleagues, new and returning, in the  years to come.                                  Inflation    Madam President, now on a related matter, the Capitol may be  preparing for the next Congress, but hard-working Americans are still  being hurt every day by the reckless, radical, party-line spending that  the Democrats rammed through during this Congress.  [[Page S6751]]    Since President Biden took office and his all-Democratic government  fired up the printing presses, our Nation has been hit with 13.9  percent inflation. In the State of Georgia, inflation is even worse; it  is closer to 15 percent since January of 2021. Families are having to  pay hundreds of dollars extra every month just to maintain their  standard of living from before the Democrats got power, let alone  trying to get ahead. The many Georgia families who can't afford it are  falling farther and farther behind.   Housing inflation alone is costing the average Georgia household an  extra $137 every month. Overall energy costs are up more than 9 percent  in the Atlanta area just in the last 12 months alone. As we head into  winter, nearly 4 in 10 households in Georgia use natural gas as their  main heating fuel. Residential natural gas prices have skyrocketed more  than 200 percent on President Biden's watch. The State's natural gas  prices are way, way higher than the national average, and that is  before you even get to the brandnew natural gas tax that both of  Georgia's Senators voted to pass into law just a few months ago.   The Democrats have passed radical policy on top of radical policy,  and it has brought hard-working Americans like the people of Georgia  pain on top of pain. But Washington Democrats still aren't finished.   A month ago, the Biden administration decided to insult working  Americans by unleashing yet another reckless giveaway that would  actually transfer even more wealth toward highly educated people who  already tend to be more well off.   As one study found, ``Upper-income households account for a  disproportionate share of student loan debt.'' That makes sense. They  borrowed money to obtain a credential that tends to push up people's  salaries in the future. But President Biden decided that working people  who worked their way through college or who already paid off their debt  or who planned entirely different careers to avoid student loans  altogether--President Biden says all those people will now be picking  up the tab for doctors' and lawyers' graduate studies.   Oh, and by the way, our colleague from West Virginia Senator Manchin  has himself admitted this one reckless move would more than eclipse the  supposed deficit reduction that Democrats claimed they bought with  their so-called Inflation Reduction Act. Even according to the generous  estimates of that bill's savings that Democrats actually liked, this  student loan socialism cannibalizes it all. All the supposed savings  that the senior Senator from West Virginia was promised are gone in the  blink of an eye. Apparently, the White House was planning the bait-and- switch all along.   Now, not surprisingly, President Biden's attempt to circumvent  Congress and implement student loan socialism on his own has created  some legal trouble. After all, it was Speaker Pelosi herself who  admitted just months before the administration rolled out this plan  that they actually lacked the proper legal authority to do what they  did.   Earlier this week, a panel of the Eighth Circuit issued an injunction  preventing the Biden administration from going forward with its plan,  but, reportedly, President Biden's team is so desperate to make  inflation even worse in this fashion, they are planning to extend  student loan socialism anyway by extending their endless moratorium on  payments. Washington Democrats' top priority is making sure that  California doctors and Manhattan lawyers don't have to pay their debts,  even if it causes even more inflation, while working people in Georgia  keep getting burned.
