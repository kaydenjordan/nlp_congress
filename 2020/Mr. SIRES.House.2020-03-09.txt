 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 754) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the United States should continue to support the  people of Nicaragua in their peaceful efforts to promote democracy and  human rights, and use the tools under United States law to increase  political and financial pressure on the government of Daniel Ortega, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 754         Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega has concentrated       power and brought about the progressive deterioration of       democratic conditions in Nicaragua;        Whereas recent elections in Nicaragua, including the 2016       Presidential elections, have been marred by irregularities       and characterized by significant restrictions on the       participation of opposition parties and the absence of       credible international and local electoral observers;        Whereas Nicaraguan security forces, parapolice, and other       actors working under the direction of the Ortega regime       committed gross violations of human rights and acts of       repression, resulting in more than 325 deaths, over 2,000       injuries, and at least 800 arbitrary detentions during the       peaceful protests that took place in 2018, according to the       Organization of American States;        Whereas a report by the Interdisciplinary Group of       Independent Experts, appointed by the Organization of       American States Inter-American Commission on Human Rights,       determined that the Ortega regime used deliberate, lethal       force against protesters and committed acts of torture that       meet the international legal standard of crimes against       humanity;        Whereas an estimated 62,000 Nicaraguans fled the country       between April 2018 and April 2019, according to the United       Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;        Whereas the Ortega government reneged on its commitment in       2019 to release all political prisoners by releasing just 392       people, of which 286 were released to house arrest with       charges still pending, while the Blue and White National       Unity coalition alleges that there remain at least 56       political prisoners as of February 15, 2020;        Whereas a United States citizen and Navy veteran, 57-year-      old Eddy Montes, was shot and killed while in the custody of       the Nicaraguan police at La Modelo Prison on May 16, 2019;        Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega has severely       restricted freedom of the press by closing five local       television stations, attacking independent radio stations,       arbitrarily detaining journalists, and illegally restricting       print supplies from entering the country;        Whereas the Ortega regime has violated the economic and       political rights protections of indigenous communities, rural       campesinos, land rights defenders, and those living in the       Caribbean Autonomous Regions of Nicaragua;        Whereas, on November 27, 2018, Executive Order 13851 was       issued, which blocks the property of certain persons       contributing to the situation in Nicaragua, and its       application was expanded on September 4, 2019;        Whereas the Departments of State and the Treasury have       imposed targeted sanctions on over 20 Nicaraguan individuals       and entities, including First Lady and Vice President Rosario       Murillo and Daniel Ortega's son, Laureano Ortega, as well as       Nicaragua's Banco Corporativo (Bancorp);        Whereas the bipartisan Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality       Act (NICA Act), was  [[Page H1544]]       signed into law on December 20, 2018, allowing the Department       of the Treasury to sanction non-United States persons       implicated in egregious human rights abuses and corruption in       Nicaragua;        Whereas, in June 2019, Canada imposed sanctions on 12       members of the Nicaraguan Government engaged in gross and       systemic human rights violations;        Whereas the Ortega government has not complied with efforts       of the commission appointed by the Permanent Council of the       Organization of American States seeking a peaceful resolution       to the social and political crisis;        Whereas, on September 15, 2019, the Ortega government       denied entry into the country to an official Organization of       American States delegation mission; and        Whereas, beginning on November 14, 2019, Nicaraguan police       conducted attacks on churches throughout the country, cut       water to hunger strikers barricaded inside a church in       Masaya, and arrested 13 people attempting to bring them       water: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the Nicaraguan Government to immediately       release all political prisoners without conditions and cease       all acts of violence, repression, and intimidation against       dissenting voices in Nicaragua;        (2) condemns the Nicaraguan Government's continued failure       to comply with agreements made with the Organization of       American States;        (3) urges the Ortega government to respect Nicaraguans'       constitutional rights and implement electoral reforms       including free, fair, multiparty elections open to       international observers, in compliance with the agreement       reached through negotiations with the Civic Alliance for       Justice and Democracy and the Blue and White National Unity       (UNAB) in March 2019;        (4) expresses full support for the people of Nicaragua,       Nicaraguan independent media, and Nicaraguan civil society       organizations that are working for a peaceful return to       democratic order in Nicaragua;        (5) recognizes and supports efforts of the United States       Government to promote democracy in Nicaragua and hold corrupt       actors and human rights abusers in the Nicaraguan Government       accountable for their actions;        (6) urges the United States Government to continue to apply       pressure on the Ortega government and consider additional       sanctions against those Nicaraguan officials who have       violated the human rights of their citizens or committed acts       of significant corruption; and        (7) urges the international community to hold the Ortega       government accountable for human rights abuses, including       attacks on religious freedom, and restrict its access to       foreign financing unless or until it allows for free, fair,       and prompt elections monitored by credible international and       local electoral observers.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 754.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Chairman Engel and Ranking  Member McCaul for their continued focus on the human rights situation  in Nicaragua.   I would also like to thank my colleague, Ranking Member Francis  Rooney from Florida, for working with me to introduce this resolution.   This resolution highlights the severe human rights abuses that have  taken place in Nicaragua and conveys bipartisan support for the  Nicaraguan people as they seek to reclaim their fundamental rights.   In 2018, repression by Nicaraguan security forces resulted in over  325 deaths. According to international human rights groups, Nicaraguan  security forces used a deliberate strategy of shooting to kill,  committing abuses that rose to the level of crimes against humanity.   While President Ortega has since released hundreds of political  prisoners, seemingly in an effort to reduce international pressure,  there remain at least 56 political prisoners in Nicaragua. Moreover,  many of those who were released are still routinely harassed by the  authorities. Political prisoners in Nicaragua are subjected to sexual  abuse, suffocation with plastic bags, and electric shocks.   Over 80,000 Nicaraguans have fled the country since April 2018, many  of them to escape persecution. I urge the administration not to turn  its back to Nicaraguans who come to the United States fleeing violence  and persecution.   This resolution makes clear that the United States Congress stands  with the Nicaraguan people, who are demanding accountability in the  face of such brutal repression. It calls for tangible steps from the  Nicaraguan Government, including immediate release of all political  prisoners and the implementation of electoral reforms that Nicaraguan  civil society organizations have long called for.   I hope that my colleagues will join me in sending this strong  bipartisan message in support of the Nicaraguan people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Consideration of this resolution comes at an important moment for  Nicaragua. As the 2021 elections approach, it will be key for the  international community to speak with one voice in demanding that  specific conditions be met in order for those elections to be deemed  credible.   As a first step, President Ortega must take immediate action to allow  for the creation of a newly comprised and independent electoral  council, the development of a reliable voter registry, and the granting  of full access to international election observers for the 2021  elections.   Absent immediate and tangible steps to implement these electoral  reforms, the United States should increase its pressure on Ortega and  his inner circle.   I hope our allies in Europe will also step up their efforts and work  with the United States toward a coordinated sanctions strategy.   I thank my colleagues for sending this bipartisan message that we  will  [[Page H1545]]  continue to stand with the Nicaraguan people in their efforts to  restore democracy in their country.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join me in supporting the  passage of this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 410) encouraging reunions of divided Korean- American families, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 410         Whereas the Korean Peninsula, with the Republic of Korea       (in this resolution referred to as ``South Korea'') in the       South and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (in this       resolution referred to as ``North Korea'') in the North,       remains divided following the signing of the Korean War       Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953;        Whereas the division of the Korean Peninsula separated more       than 10,000,000 Korean family members, including some who are       now citizens of the United States;        Whereas there have been 21 rounds of family reunions       between South Koreans and North Koreans along the border       since 2000;        Whereas Congress signaled its support for family reunions       between United States citizens and their relatives in North       Korea in section 1265 of the National Defense Authorization       Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181), signed into       law by President George W. Bush on January 28, 2008;        Whereas most of the population of divided family members in       the United States, initially estimated at 100,000 in 2001,       has significantly dwindled as many of the individuals have       passed away;        Whereas the summit between North Korea and South Korea on       April 27, 2018, has prioritized family reunions;        Whereas the United States and North Korea have engaged in       talks during 2 historic summits in June 2018 in Singapore and       February 2019 in Hanoi; and        Whereas many Korean Americans are waiting for a chance to       meet their relatives in North Korea for the first time in       more than 60 years: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the United States and North Korea to begin the       process of reuniting Korean-American divided family members       with their immediate relatives through ways such as--        (A) identifying divided families in the United States and       North Korea who are willing and able to participate in a       pilot program for family reunions;        (B) finding matches for members of such families through       organizations such as the Red Cross; and        (C) working with the Government of South Korea to include       American citizens in inter-Korean video reunions;        (2) reconfirms the institution of family as inalienable       and, accordingly, urges the restoration of contact between       divided families physically, literarily, or virtually; and        (3) calls on the United States and North Korea to pursue       reunions as a humanitarian priority of immediate concern.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 410.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Bass for sponsoring this  resolution, which draws attention to a pressing humanitarian issue  affecting the Korean-American community.   This June will mark 70 years since the beginning of the Korean war,  which separated 10 million Koreans from their immediate family members.  Since 1985, family reunions carried out between the North and the South  briefly reunited more than 20,000 family members, but there are still  thousands more who have brothers, sisters, or parents who have been  separated for decades.   It must be a humanitarian priority for the United States to  facilitate reunions for these separated families. Considering the many  years that have passed, many of these families are older, and if we  don't act soon, they may never see their loved ones again.   The measure before us underscores the long history of U.S. support  for family reunification between Korean Americans and their relatives  still in North Korea. It outlines different ways that North Korea and  the United States can respectively take action, including a pilot  program for family reunions, a family registry supported by the Red  Cross and other organizations, and the use of technology to allow  reunions for those who might not be physically able to travel for in- person reunions.   This is a good, commonsense resolution reiterating our country's  commitment to reuniting families split by the Korean war. I support it,  and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass), the author of this important resolution and the  chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global  Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, most of us can't imagine the pain of going decades  without knowing if your relatives are alive or dead. That is the daily  struggle for thousands of families torn apart by the Korean war.   Mr. Speaker, this measure underscores our support for reuniting these  families, bringing solace and closure to this deep wound left by the  war. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2444) to authorize the Secretary of State to make direct loans  under section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2444         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Eastern European Security       Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that it is in the national       security interest of the United States to--        (1) deter aggression against North Atlantic Treaty       Organization (NATO) allies by Russia or any other adversary;        (2) assist NATO allies in acquiring and deploying modern,       NATO interoperable military equipment and reducing their       dependence on Russian or former Soviet-era defense articles;        (3) ensure that NATO allies meet alliance defense       commitments, including through adequate investments in       national defense;        (4) supplement existing grant assistance to key allies       through foreign military financing loans, at rates       competitive with those already available on commercial       markets, to purchase NATO-interoperable military equipment;       and        (5) work to maintain and strengthen the democratic       institutions and practices of all NATO allies, in accordance       with the goals of Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty.       SEC. 3. FOREIGN MILITARY LOAN AUTHORITY.         (a) In General.--Beginning in fiscal year 2021, subject to       the notification requirements under subsection (b) and to the       availability of appropriations, the President, acting through       the Secretary of State, is authorized--        (1) to make direct loans under section 23 of the Arms       Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763) to NATO member countries       that joined the alliance after March 1, 1999, notwithstanding       the minimum interest rate required by subsection (c)(1) of       such section; and        (2) to charge fees for such loans under paragraph (1),       which shall be collected from borrowers in accordance with       section 502(7) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and       which may be used to cover the costs of such loans as defined       in section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.        (b) Notification.--A loan may not be made under the       authority provided by subsection (a) unless the Secretary of       State submits to the appropriate congressional committees a       certification, not fewer than fifteen days before entering       into an agreement to make such loan, that--        (1) the recipient country is making demonstrable progress       toward meeting its defense spending commitments in accordance       with the 2014 NATO Wales Summit Declaration; and        (2) the government of such recipient country is respecting       that country's constitution and upholds democratic values       such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of       the press, the rule of law, and the rights of religious       minorities.        (c) Repayment.--A loan made under the authority provided by       subsection (a) shall be repaid in not more than 12 years, but       may include a grace period of up to one year on the repayment       of the principal.        (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       Act, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2444.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2444, the Eastern European  Security Act.   I want to thank Ranking Member McCaul for working on this excellent  measure that mirrors Chairman Eliot Engel's bill, the NATO Defense  Financing Act, in pursuit of a stronger transatlantic partnership.   Mr. Speaker, the United States and its European allies have,  together, built the most successful alliance in the history of the  world. The NATO alliance is strengthened by our shared values, mutual  trust, ability to work together, and, if necessary, to fight together.   It is crucial that NATO is ready and able to defend against external  threats and engage in combat. For that to happen, all of our allies  must be able to work together seamlessly. But right now, some of our  Eastern European allies still rely on Russian or old Soviet era  equipment. Modernizing these military forces is a national security  imperative.   The Eastern European Security Act puts in place direct loans to our  security partners so they can update their military equipment to better  address their shifting and complex security needs. As adversaries like  Russia continue to test our alliance's defenses and cohesion, these  loans would be a meaningful step towards ensuring that we are ready and  able to face evolving threats on the horizon.   These loans will complement, not replace, our ongoing U.S. security  assistance effort to Europe and will be conditioned upon our allies  upholding their own constitutions and the democratic values of the  alliance.   The United States must not only support the militaries of our NATO  allies, but also safeguard the continued strength of the democratic  values upon which the alliance is built. I hope all Members will join  me in approving this measure that better supports our European allies  and advances the United States' national security interests.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Congressman McCaul for his hard  work on this measure. He has been a tireless advocate on behalf of this  issue.   NATO security is U.S. security, and the continued protection of every  American is dependent upon a strong NATO alliance. Our allies  selflessly demonstrated this commitment when they came to America's aid  after the terrorist attack of 9/11, and it is important that the United  States remain committed to our allies and our shared democratic values  as well.   This is a good measure, and I am pleased to support it. I urge all  Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1771) to require consultations on reuniting Korean Americans with  family members in North Korea, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1771         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Divided Families       Reunification Act''.       SEC. 2. CONSULTATIONS ON REUNITING KOREAN AMERICANS WITH                     FAMILY MEMBERS IN NORTH KOREA.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The division of the Korean Peninsula into South Korea       and North Korea separated thousands of Koreans from family       members.        (2) Since the signing of the Agreement Concerning a       Military Armistice in Korea, signed at Panmunjom July 27,       1953 (commonly referred to as the ``Korean War Armistice       Agreement''), there has been little to no contact between       Korean Americans and family members who remain in North       Korea.        (3) North Korea and South Korea first agreed to reunions of       divided families in 1985 and have since held 21 face-to-face       reunions and multiple video link reunions.        (4) Those reunions have subsequently given approximately       24,500 Koreans the opportunity to briefly reunite with loved       ones.        (5) The most recent family reunions between North Korea and       South Korea took place in August 2018 and did not include any       Korean Americans.        (6) The United States and North Korea do not maintain       diplomatic relations and certain limitations exist on Korean       Americans participating in face-to-face reunions.        (7) According to the most recent census, more than       1,700,000 people living in the United States are of Korean       descent.        (8) The number of first generation Korean and Korean       American family members divided from family members in North       Korea is rapidly diminishing given the advanced age of those       family members. More than 3,000 elderly South Koreans die       each year without having been reunited with their family       members.        (9) Many Korean Americans with family members in North       Korea have not seen or communicated with those family members       in more than 60 years.        (10) The inclusion of Korean American families in the       reunion process would constitute a positive humanitarian       gesture by the Government of North Korea.        (11) Section 1265 of the National Defense Authorization Act       for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 407)       required the President to submit to Congress a report on       ``efforts, if any, of the United States Government to       facilitate family reunions between United States citizens and       their relatives in North Korea''.        (12) The position of Special Envoy on North Korean Human       Rights Issues has been vacant since January 2017, although       the President is required to appoint a Senate-confirmed       Special Envoy to fill this position in accordance with       section 107 of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22       U.S.C. 7817).        (13) In the report of the Committee on Appropriations of       the House of Representatives accompanying H.R. 3081, 111th       Congress (House Report 111-187), the Committee urged ``the       Special Representative on North Korea Policy, as the senior       official handling North Korea issues, to prioritize the       issues involving Korean divided families and to, if       necessary, appoint a coordinator for such families''.        (b) Consultations.--        (1) Consultations with south korea.--The Secretary of       State, or a designee of the Secretary, should consult with       officials of South Korea, as appropriate, on potential       opportunities to reunite Korean American families with family       members in North Korea from which such Korean American       families were divided after the signing of the Korean War       Armistice Agreement, including potential opportunities for       video reunions for Korean Americans with such family members.        (2) Consultations with korean americans.--The Special Envoy       on North Korean Human Rights Issues of the Department of       State should regularly consult with representatives of Korean       Americans who have family members in North Korea with respect       to efforts to reunite families divided after the signing of       the Korean War Armistice Agreement, including potential       opportunities for video reunions for Korean Americans with       such family members.        (3) No additional authorization of appropriations.--No       additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated to the       Department of State to carry out consultations under this       subsection.        (c) Additional Matter in Report.--The Secretary of State,       acting through the Special Envoy on North Korean Human Rights       Issues, shall include in each report required under section       107(d) of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22       U.S.C. 7817(d)), a description of the consultations described       in subsection (b) conducted during the year preceding the       submission of each report required under such section 107(d).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 1771.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Ms. Meng for sponsoring this  good bill to provide much-needed relief to Korean Americans who have  been separated from their family members, many of them for decades now.   The Korean war tore families apart almost 70 years ago, and it is a  humanitarian tragedy that many of them have been separated ever since.  It is long past time for these families to be able to reunite. People  who lost their parents when they were only toddlers are now senior  citizens with children and grandchildren of their own.   The Divided Families Reunification Act requires the Department of  State to consult with our South Korean allies, and the Korean-American  community to make more of these reunions happen as soon as possible.  Anyone who has seen footage of these reunions can attest to their  profound significance--they demonstrate that the bonds of family cannot  be severed by wars, by decades, by distance, or by government  repression.   This bill also requires the Department of State to report to Congress  on opportunities to facilitate more reunions by video connection, which  is especially important to allow all Korean Americans, including those  who might have difficulty with traveling long distances, a real  opportunity to reconnect with their family members.   An important role in executing this humanitarian policy is the  Special Envoy on North Korean Human Rights issues. It is deeply  concerning that the Trump administration has left this position vacant  for over 2 years, since January 2017. Human rights in North Korea  remains a bipartisan priority for this Congress, but if we are going to  effectively advance these policies, we  [[Page H1548]]  need to make sure that we have the people in place to execute them.   Mr. Speaker, the Divided Families Reunification Act is an excellent,  bipartisan bill to continue United States' efforts to reunite families  torn apart by the Korean war. I hope all Members will join me in  supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill to support the thousands of Korean  Americans whose families were torn apart by the Korean war.   One of the most important tasks carried out by the State Department  is the reunion of Americans with their family members, and this act  would focus that good work on a group of people who have waited decades  for that chance.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the passage of this legislation, and  I urge my colleagues to support the same.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
