 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, during the last week I was home in  Wyoming, traveling the State, visiting with people, talking to  constituents, listening to what they had to say. I had the chance to  attend a couple of health fairs in Rawlins, WY, and Mountain View, WY.  The health fair is a gathering of the community. It is based on  prevention and early detection of problems as ways to help lower the  cost of care. For many years, I was the medical director of the Wyoming  Health Fairs bringing low-cost health screening to people of Wyoming.  At the fair, people come out. There are booths from the heart  association, diabetes association, the American Cancer Society. People  learn information about diseases, how they work, and how they affect  their bodies. It can aid in early detection of problems. People can get  their blood drawn and visit with healthcare providers from the  community to go over blood results. All of this is aimed at prevention,  early detection, and early treatment.   It is interesting that during the same time Democrats running for  President have been traveling the country talking about healthcare as  well, and specifically Senator Bernie Sanders has talked about  ``BernieCare''--Medicare for All.   To me, Medicare for All is going to drive up costs for Americans in  terms of taxes, and it is also going to take away the kind of choice  people look for when I talk with them at Wyoming health fairs.   I come to you today to talk on the floor about the real problems I  see with this so-called Medicare for All, and I come to it as a doctor  who has practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 years, taking care of  patients for decades. When I go to health fairs, more people refer to  me as Dr. Barrasso rather than Senator Barrasso.   I also want to talk as the husband of a breast cancer survivor. My  wife, Bobbi, has had three operations, chemotherapy twice, and is now  disease-free for 15 years, but I know how critically important it is as  a doctor as well as a husband to make sure that people with preexisting  conditions are protected.   I also speak as the son of a 96-year-old mother, and she is a  motivating force in our lives. She is a constant reminder to me that we  must do everything we can to care for our seniors. So as I have been  listening to the Presidential candidates talk about this Medicare for  All proposal, whether it is Senators Harris, Warren, Gillibrand, or  Booker, all of them back what Senator Sanders has been proposing. I am  just not sure most Americans understand what Medicare for All means and  what it would mean for them personally. Maybe some of the Presidential  candidates don't even want people to know what it means.   Senator Sanders has claimed that Medicare for All is, as he said, ``a  struggle for the soul of who we are as a nation.'' Let's be clear.  Americans are facing a critical choice. It is a choice between a big,  government-run healthcare system and a system that gives Americans  access to quality, affordable care that they can choose that is right  for them and their families. That, to me, is the choice we are facing.   Medicare for All essentially means a complete government takeover of  all healthcare in this country. Central planners in Washington, DC,  would then be in control of the healthcare for all of us.   Medicare for All would enroll every American in a government-run  healthcare system. It will take away America's healthcare choices.  Senator Harris talks about, perhaps, a supplemental plan, but the  legislation I have read that has been introduced is crystal clear-- Medicare for All outlaws private health insurance plans. The only  exception, Senator Sanders says, is some limited insurance for cosmetic  surgery--he says procedures like nose jobs.   With about 180 million Americans getting insurance through work,  currently covered through their employers, people who get insurance  through work like the insurance they have. All of them will lose their  coverage under what is proposed under the Medicare for All legislation.  All of them will be forced onto this new government program--every one  of them. Never mind that 71 percent of Americans covered through their  employer actually say they like their current plan. A single-payer  Medicare for All proposal says, basically, if you like your current  healthcare plan, you cannot keep it. The government will take it away  and make it illegal.   Seniors are going to suffer, too, and, actually, I think seniors may  end up suffering the most. I am talking about people who are already on  Medicare because this legislation threatens the 60 million Americans  who currently get their healthcare as part of Medicare. They get their  healthcare today through Medicare. Medicare is already expected to run  out of money by 2026. It was confirmed by last month's trustee report,  but the Democrats' proposal will even outlaw Medicare Advantage, a  program that 22 million Americans currently use for their healthcare.  It is called Medicare Advantage because there are advantages to being  on this program in terms of preventive care and coordinated care. There  is a reason people sign up for Medicare Advantage. All 22 million would  lose that as well under the Democrats' Medicare for All plan.   Healthcare programs benefiting military families and children will  also be eliminated. Democrats plan to abolish servicemembers' TRICARE  and the Children's Health Insurance Plan. All of that goes away under  what the Democrats' radical proposal is talking about.   Perhaps the greatest deception of Medicare for All is the suggestion  that government-run care would be free. Let me say to the American  people: Do not  [[Page S2543]]  be deceived. Do not be deceived. Americans will pay a very high price.  Medicare for All has been estimated at a 10-year pricetag of $32  trillion. There is only one way to even try to pay for this massive  plan and that is to dramatically raise everyone's income taxes to the  point where they may need to pay double. That is what is being  proposed.   So the result will be less freedom, lower quality of care, and longer  lines as people have to wait to get to a doctor, because Washington  will be controlling the doctor-patient medical decisions--and, mark my  words, Washington will ration care. Rationing means delays and delay  means denial of care. Government-run healthcare is notorious for  producing long lines, long waiting periods, delay in care--even  urgently needed care.   The government-run system has failed where they tried to put it in  place in Vermont, in Senator Sanders' home State. They started it and  ended up having to eliminate it. They couldn't afford it. It wasn't  working. It was too complicated. That is in one State.   We also have the situation of what is going on both in England and  Canada right now in terms of costs and limits of care, the denial of  treatment, the delay in treatment.   I think people watching may have seen the stories as a result of what  is happening in England, where elderly patients are going blind in  Britain right now. Why would they be going blind? Because the  government is rationing cataract surgery. People can Google ``going  blind in Britain.'' It is the British healthcare system that is causing  it because of the rationing of care. So Democrats are promoting this  Medicare for All. Basically they are saying that ObamaCare needs to be  repealed and replaced because it has failed the American people. The  solution they are offering is not one that I think would make things  better, but it is one that I think would make things worse.    Republicans, at the same time, are working for meaningful, workable  solutions that lower the costs of prescription drugs, solutions that  increase healthcare choice and transparency, and solutions that expand  all Americans' access to affordable care. We want to make sure patients  can get the care they need from the doctor they choose at a lower cost.   So instead of proposing higher taxes, which is what the Democrats are  proposing, instead of proposing healthcare rationing, which will come  with Medicare for All, Democrats need to begin working with Republicans  to improve healthcare for all Americans, and they should start by  rejecting BernieCare.
