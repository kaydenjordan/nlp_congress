 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for  yielding and for his great leadership.   Madam Speaker, we have a national problem here in America of police  violence, police brutality, and the police use of excessive force. It  requires a national solution. That is why Congress should pass the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Here in America, every Black mother and every Black father has to  have the talk with their child about what to do when approached by the  police because any encounter can turn deadly, not because of criminal  conduct but because of the color of their skin.   Just ask the family of Amadou Diallo, the family of Sean Bell, the  family of Eric Garner, the family of Tamir Rice, the family of Walter  Scott, the family of Oscar Grant, the family of Stephon Clark, the  family of Breonna Taylor. Just ask the family of George Floyd, who  narrated his own death for 8 minutes and 46 seconds and called for his  mama.   It is a difficult conversation. I had to have the talk with my two  sons, and I knew what to say word for word because my father had the  same talk with me decades ago, and nothing has changed.   So all of us in this Chamber, whether you are a Democrat or  Republican, should want to make sure that people like our good friend  and colleague Cedric Richmond shouldn't have to have the same talk with  his beautiful Black son, 6-year-old little Ced.   We have an opportunity to change things today, and that is what we  should do. To the protesters: We hear you; we see you; we are you. We  are sick and tired of being sick and tired.   America is a great country. We have come a long way. We still have a  long way to go.   We are tired of police violence in a country where the Declaration of  Independence promises life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   We are tired of police violence in a country where the Pledge of  Allegiance promises liberty and justice for all.   We are tired of police violence in a country where the Constitution  promises equal protection under the law.   We are sick and tired of being sick and tired. That is why we should  act.   It is time to end racial profiling, time to criminalize the  chokehold, time to demilitarize the police, time to end qualified  immunity, time for a national standard on the excessive use of force,  time for a database on brutal officers, time to expand the Justice  Department Office of Civil Rights' jurisdiction, and time for the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act so we can continue our country's  long, necessary, and majestic march toward a more perfect Union.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman, the  chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, for her tremendous leadership  on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and in moving this  important piece of legislation forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Peters), my good friend and classmate.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, despite the representation that was just made, Speaker  Pelosi, as she always does, has risen to the occasion.   The question is, will you?   The Republican minority leader just said that we have put politics  over people. That is insulting, because it is our children, our sons,  our daughters, our brothers, our sisters, our fathers, our mothers, our  husbands, our wives who are the ones who are being killed.   This is not about politics. We know that racism has been in the soil  of America since 1619. We need transformational action.   The time to talk the talk is over. It is time to walk the walk. That  is why we are moving forward with the George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from New York (Miss Rice), my good friend, a distinguished member of  the New York delegation, a former Federal prosecutor, and a district  attorney of one of the largest prosecutorial offices in the Nation.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my  wholehearted support for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   As my good friend, Mr. Jeffries, just said, I spent the first 20  years of my career as a prosecutor in the criminal justice system. I  have seen where it works and, more often, I have seen where it doesn't  work.   I can say without a doubt that police accountability is one of the  areas that is fundamentally broken, but we need to do more than just  hold individual officers responsible. We need to address the  institutions that protect them and perpetuate systemic racism.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor this bill, which will make  critical changes to this broken system, like reforming the qualified  immunity standard, banning the use of chokeholds, creating a national  police misconduct registry, and modifying the mens rea standard to hold  officers accountable.   I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Congressional Black  Caucus and continue to listen to local Black leaders and activists back  in my district on Long Island as we continue to root out injustice and  discrimination from our society.   Black lives matter, Mr. Speaker, and it is about time our laws and  policies reflect that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), a distinguished gentleman,  the chair of the Homeland Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time we have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), the distinguished chair of  the DCCC, a classmate, and a great Member of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski), a great new member of the  freshman class.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke), my good friend.                                time  1830     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from the great State of Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from the great State of Colorado (Mr. Crow), an  Army Ranger, a patriot, and a great Member of the United States House  of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from the great State of Texas (Mr. Castro), the  chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from the great State of Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have remaining on our  side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from the great State of Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from the great State of Maryland (Mr. Mfume), the former head  of the NAACP as well as the Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I have no  additional speakers. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me begin by thanking the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus  and the prime sponsor of this legislation, Karen Bass, for her  extraordinary leadership on such a critical issue during such a  critical moment in time.   I also want to thank the distinguished chair of the House Judiciary  Committee, Congressman Jerry Nadler, for his tremendous leadership in  ushering this bill through committee and to the floor of the House of  Representatives.                                time  1845    I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and the entire House Democratic Caucus  for rising to the occasion at this particular moment in time.   I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for  participating in the debate and sharing their ideas, though I will note  that many of my Republican colleagues spent this debate talking about  antifa, talking about the autonomous zone, and talking about abolishing  the police, which appears  [[Page H2487]]  nowhere within the four corners of this legislation.   They know what this bill is really all about. It criminalizes the  chokehold, because it is about George Floyd, who was strangled to death  with a knee to his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds while handcuffed.  It is about being handcuffed while Black, about George Floyd.   They know this bill, its really about Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old who  was gunned down while playing in a Cleveland park. It is about Tamir  Rice because the bill will establish a registry for brutal officers so  that jurisdictions will have some visibility into whom they are hiring.  The officer who murdered Tamir Rice, this 12-year-old boy, had been  fired by a neighboring department for brutal behavior, and then he was  hired by the Cleveland Police Department with tragic consequences  because they had no visibility into his record. This bill is about  Tamir Rice.   They know this bill is about Breonna Taylor, sleeping while Black,  gunned down because of a no-knock warrant in a drug case that was  falsely executed in Louisville. Now a husband has lost his wife. It is  about Breonna Taylor. They know that.   This is about countless individuals in this great country of ours  killed by police officers without justification.   Yes, we know that the majority of police officers--certainly the ones  I interact with at home in Brooklyn--are hardworking individuals who  are in the community to protect and serve. But there are violent  officers, there are brutal officers, and there are abusive officers;  and far too often they are not held accountable because of a toxic  culture that exists and that cannot be denied--not month after month,  not year after year, but decade after decade after decade.   We know the names. Many of those names were called today from the  floor of the House of Representatives, but the names are too numerous  to mention. That is why we are here, to do something transformative  about it.   I am thankful for all of those peaceful protesters who have gone out  all throughout the four corners of America, yes, led by young African- American women--I love that--and young African-American men, but joined  by every other race, Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American,  multiracial, multigenerational, and multicultural, coming together and  saying, ``Enough.''   We need to deal with systemic racism in America, and we can start  with the cancer of police brutality. That is what the George Floyd  Justice in Policing bill is all about. It is not about antifa or some  autonomous zone or defunding the police, which they know doesn't appear  in this bill.   I don't want to question anybody's good faith, but let's have a real  debate. You are entitled to your own opinion; you are not entitled to  your own facts. Those words ring true to this very day from the moment  that President John Adams uttered them.   So I am thankful to the House Democratic Caucus for rising to the  occasion. We collectively have said to the protesters of every race  throughout America: We hear you, we see you, and we are you.   Many of you know that the death of George Floyd was not called to my  attention by a fellow Member of Congress, by my chief of staff, or by  my legislative director. It was called to my attention by my young son,  who said: Dad, it has happened again. What are you going to do about  it?   Those words, of course, ran through my heart. But I say to him, and I  say to all of those other Black children throughout America: We are  here today as House Democrats to do something about it.   Pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
