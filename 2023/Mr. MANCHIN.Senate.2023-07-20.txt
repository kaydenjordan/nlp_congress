 Mr. President, I rise in support of the bipartisan  amendment sponsored by my friends and colleagues, Senators Cruz,  Fetterman, Ernst, and myself.   Let me just say about this--this is something that we own. The people  of America own the SPR. It is ours. We don't own the oil from the  private sector, unless we want to nationalize everything. I don't think  we do.   With that being said, I appreciate my good friend and colleague from  Connecticut, and I am happy to work on all of the things that we are  talking about here.   What we have in front of us right now is the ability to finally say  that the strategic oil reserves that the people of the United States  own will not be compromised, especially by people who don't have our  same values and would use it against us. We have seen the horrible  effects of the Ukraine war when Putin basically weaponized energy. He  weaponized oil. We can't allow that to happen.   Here is the other thing about it: Following Putin's invasion of  Ukraine, the United States ramped up production and exports to help  meet global demand that had been devastating to the world. China, on  the other hand, stockpiled oil and held back refinery production. While  China was stockpiling, one of its state-owned companies purchased over  1.4 million barrels from the United States of America, the people of  our great country, from our own stock reserves. That is what we are  trying to stop.   I am happy to work on all the other things. Don't let the perfect be  the enemy of the good. We have something in front of us right now that  can stop this outrageous, basically raiding of our own stock supplies.   So I really, really urge the adoption of this amendment.   I will tell you this: This amendment has tremendous and bipartisan  support in Congress. We have over 20 bipartisan Senators who support  us. In the House, it passed unanimously--unanimously--Democrats and  Republicans. So please don't mess up our bipartisan record right now.  Please vote to support this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 926
