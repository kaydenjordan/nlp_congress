 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R.  2, the Moving Forward Act, and I focus on the fact that this  infrastructure package includes our Nation's schools.   For decades, underserved students and educators have spent nearly  every day in school facilities with outdated air filtration, air- conditioning, and roofing systems that endanger their health. A GAO  report just this year confirmed that more than half the school  districts need to repair unsafe and outdated systems in heating,  ventilation, and air-conditioning in most of their school buildings.   These issues are not about comfort. They are about equal access to  education.   Mr. Speaker, we all want to reopen our schools as soon as possible,  but we cannot take this step when the Centers for Disease Control  guidance requires functioning ventilation systems to prevent the spread  of COVID-19.   The Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act provisions and  infrastructure package offer the solutions our schools need. This  legislation will invest construction funds targeted at high-poverty  school facilities that put the health of our students and staff most at  risk.   Of course, the schools will also benefit from the improvements in  broadband that are also found in the bill.   The school provisions in this bill will create more than 2 million  good-paying jobs over the next 5 years at a time when we face historic  unemployment rates.   The Moving Forward Act is critical to our Nation's economic recovery,  and it is critical for our efforts to achieve equity in education.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill so that all  students will have access to safe and high-quality schools during the  pandemic and for years to come.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Rebuild America's Schools coalition to Speaker Pelosi and Leader  McCarthy in support of both the legislation and the Reopen and Rebuild  America's Schools Act.                                      Rebuild America's Schools,                                      Washington, DC, June 29, 2020.      Re H.R. Moving Forward Act: Reopen and Rebuild America's           Schools       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Madame Speaker and Minority Leader McCarthy: Rebuild       America's Schools appreciates and supports your efforts to       address the impact of COVID-19 on our nation. As Congress       addresses economic recovery, Rebuild America's Schools       supports H.R. 2 The Moving Forward Act to invest in our       nation's infrastructure including grants and bonds to       modernize, renovate and repair local school facilities.        The Government Accounting Office (GAO) June 2020 report       estimates more than half of America's public school districts       need significant repairs to their school facilities. Fifty       four percent of school districts across the country must       replace or update major systems in more than half their       buildings. Grants and infrastructure bonds will assist       communities respond to necessary school facility       modifications, renovations, and repairs to re-open safely for       students, teachers, and staff in the changing COVID-19       environment.        Moving Forward Act: Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools       Act infrastructure grants and bonds will generate economic       activity in every state creating over 100,000 construction       services jobs accomplishing two objectives:        Local communities will use recovery financing to build,       renovate and repair schools  [[Page H2923]]       providing safer, healthier, more modem and more       technologically, energy efficient school facilities advancing       student achievement.        School construction projects in local communities will       generate thousands of construction and building trades jobs       including architects engineers, roofing contractors, and       suppliers who design, build and maintain our nation's       schools.        As COVID-19 profoundly impacts national and state       economies, federal investment in school infrastructure and       safety will have both long- and short-term benefits to the       nation's economic recovery and stability advancing student       achievement.        We look forward to working with you as the House of       Representatives considers The Moving Forward Act to invest in       the infrastructure of local communities helping modernize       schools in every state to support student safety, achievement       and success.        Thank you.            Sincerely,                                                       Bob Canavan,                                                             Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  several en bloc amendments to H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act. This bill  delivers transportation and infrastructure solutions to the American  people, improves the safety of commuters and communities, and increases  community resilience to the climate crisis, while also creating jobs  for the American people. I was pleased that the Rules Committee ruled  in order a number of my amendments to further these goals, improving  water quality in the Chesapeake Bay, supporting National Labs, and  ensuring that modeling and simulation technology is used to ensure  federal dollars are spent in cost-effective ways to improve safety and  protect the environment.   I urge my colleagues to support an amendment I introduced with my  colleague from Florida, Representative Stephanie Murphy, which is  included in amendments in part B, proposed to be considered en bloc.  Our amendment adds an important sense of Congress that the U.S.  Department of Transportation ought to maximize the utilization of  modeling and simulation technology to analyze federally funded highway  and public transit projects. In doing so, we can best ensure that these  projects will increase transportation capacity and safety, alleviate  congestion, reduce travel time and environmental impact, and are as  cost-effective as possible.   Modeling and simulation technologies have beneficial purposes--from  medicine and vaccine development to natural disaster response. Urban  and transportation planners across the country understand the  significant benefits of modeling and simulation and as the technology  continues to rapidly advance, its precision in mimicking real-world  factors and variables continues to yield incredible savings both in  manpower and money.   I also want to urge my colleagues to support the Chesapeake Bay, one  of America's greatest treasures, by supporting two amendments included  in part E, proposed to be considered en bloc to improve water quality  and the quality of life within the Chesapeake's 64,000 square-mile  watershed. I am pleased to introduce the Chesapeake WILD amendment with  Representatives Rob Wittman and John Sarbanes, who co-chair the  Chesapeake Bay Watershed Task Force with me and introduced the  Chesapeake WILD Act with me last year. A great deal has changed since  that time, as Americans respond to the COVID-19 pandemic: many have  lost jobs and outdoor recreation has become an even more important way  for people to stay physically and mentally healthy; yet not everyone in  the Chesapeake region has access to safe recreational spaces. In the  midst of this year's hurricane season, communities throughout the  Chesapeake Bay watershed are also bracing for the possibility of  another emergency, made more severe by the climate crisis. Each of  these challenges has made the Chesapeake WILD grant program more urgent  than ever.   This amendment will help restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay  watershed by investing in green infrastructure, habitat preservation,  and ecosystem restoration to enhance community resilience, and improve  water quality, all while creating jobs and enhancing economic  opportunities throughout the watershed. Along with my friend,  Representative Sarbanes' Chesapeake Gateways amendment, which I was  pleased to cosponsor along with Representatives Wittman and Harris,  this amendment would also increase recreational opportunities in the  region. I am proud to see bipartisan support for these amendments, and  I look forward to securing their passage.   I am also pleased to support an amendment included in part D,  proposed to be considered  [[Page H2939]]  en bloc, which I cosponsored with Congressman Ben Ray Lujan and other  supporters of our nation's 17 National Laboratories, including the  Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility or JLab in my  congressional district, where work is being done to advance our  understanding of nuclear physics. Funding to address the infrastructure  needs and maintenance backlogs across the National Labs system is one  way that we can support the work of scientists there, whether on clean  energy or a vaccine for COVID-19. In modernizing the National Labs  system, we can create shovel-ready construction jobs to put Americans  back to work right away and ensure the best and brightest scientists  are recruited to careers in national service and research for the  common good.   Mr. Speaker, these amendments help us move forward in an evidence- based and cost-effective way, supporting coastal communities,  ecological recovery, commuters, and research in the national interest,  all while creating good jobs. I urge my colleagues to support this bill  and these amendments, so that we can make the necessary investments for  a future that is more resilient, environmentally responsible, and  connected than before.
