 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago today, we lost a brother, a  friend, and a colleague, someone who made a great impact on my home  State of Hawaii and this country.   My friend, Congressman Mark Takai, was someone who lived his entire  life with a full heart committed to serving the people of Hawaii and  his country. Always ready with a helping hand with creative new ideas  and a hearty laugh, Mark was someone who was always on the move.   I had the honor of serving with Mark all the way back in the Hawaii  State Legislature, through our time serving together in the Hawaii Army  National Guard and then, again, here in Congress where we both served  on the Armed Services Committee.   Mark, time and time again, made his decisions based on how best he  could serve the people of Hawaii, and he took a lot of pictures along  the way. Mark led by example with respect and with aloha understanding  and passion building partnerships focused on seeing how he could get  the job done.   So on this day commemorating Mark, my heart is with his family: his  wife, Sami; his kids, Matthew and Kaila; his parents, Naomi and Erik;  our entire National Guard ``family,'' ``ohana,'' and the people of  Hawaii as we remember Mark and honor his entire life and legacy of  service.                            ____________________
