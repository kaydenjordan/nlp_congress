 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 100th  birthday of the National Football League. On September 17, 1920, 15  people who shared a love of football met in an automobile showroom in  Canton, OH, to form what would become the National Football League.  From these humble beginnings, the NFL has grown into a preeminent  American sports league and become a fixture in American life. Today's  NFL is an American institution that brings together millions of  individuals of all ages, races, and backgrounds through a shared love  for the game of football. In fact, last season, the NFL concluded the  celebration of its 100th season with a stunning Super Bowl championship  that was viewed by over 100 million Americans.   At the same time, the NFL has never forgotten its roots in Ohio.  Every year, millions of football fans travel to Canton, which now hosts  the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the accompanying Hall of Fame game  that rings in every new NFL season. Today, in an effort to commemorate  the League's 100th birthday, Canton and the Cleveland Browns will host  my hometown Cincinnati Bengals in a classic rivalry game, known as the  Battle of Ohio. The game will highlight the formation of the league and  its origins in Canton, honor the more than 25,000 players who have  played in the league, and showcase the work the NFL is doing to ensure  its second century is just as successful as the first.   I wish the league all the best as it embarks into its second century  as the foremost steward of ``America's Game.''                            ____________________
