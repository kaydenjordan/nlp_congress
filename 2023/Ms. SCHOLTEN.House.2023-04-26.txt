 Mr. Speaker, as west Michigan's Congresswoman, it is my  top priority to support the next generation. That means regularly  engaging with kids and students across the district.   Since I took office, I have heard from so many young people, having  them write to me about the need to protect endangered species. In  direct response to their concerns, I chose to cosponsor the bipartisan  Manatee Protection Act.   Manatees are wonderfully intelligent mammals. They can be over 10  feet long and hold their breath underwater for nearly 20 minutes.   We are at risk of losing these wonderful creatures forever. There are  only 6,500 West Indian manatees left in the waters off the coast of  Florida.   This piece of legislation will give the West Indian manatees the  protection status they deserve and ensure they do not go extinct  forever. It is time to take action.   I thank the students for sharing their passion for animals and their  love of our world. I heard them, and I am responding to them.
