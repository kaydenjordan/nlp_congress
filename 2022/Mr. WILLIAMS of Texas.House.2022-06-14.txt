 Five years ago today, the Republican baseball  team took to the field for their regular morning practice. That morning  took a dark turn when the team suddenly became a target of a Bernie  Sanders' supporter with an agenda to shoot and kill Republicans.   It could have been the worst political massacre in American history,  but we are alive today, thanks to those brave and honorable law  enforcement officers who were at the field that day and willing to  sacrifice themselves to protect us.   Every day, I wear this wristband stamped with the date of the  shooting and the words, ``In God We Trust'' to remember the angels  watching over us on that life-changing morning. It is a testament to  that day, always living in our hearts and our minds.   There is no doubt that without quick action of Special Agents Griner  and Bailey, along with the Alexandria Police Department, the team would  not be here today. We forever owe a debt of gratitude to our law  enforcement and our first responders who acted swiftly to take down the  gunman and simply save our lives.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
