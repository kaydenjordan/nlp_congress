 Mr. Chair, I also rise to speak in favor of H.R. 140,  the Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act.   It is unfortunate that this bill is necessary today. We all know why  it is necessary.   In the past, the government weighed in on Twitter and Facebook to  lean on them to remove certain posts regarding news stories regarding  eventually President Biden's son and his interactions with Ukraine, as  well as perhaps interactions with regard to China.   The reason the government weighed in this time is because they wanted  to make sure that President Biden won the election.   This is a dangerous thing. There is a certain type of government in  which the government weighs in on private businesses. The private  businesses are able to stay wealthy. The owners of these businesses are  allowed to remain billionaires, provided they play ball with orders  from the government.   In other words, you give up your freedom; you maintain your wealth. I  am afraid that is the type of country we are heading toward.   The scariest thing about this speech is when we looked at the Pew  Research Center and found that 65 percent of Democrats apparently  support some form of censorship by the government, which is really a  scary thing as to where we head.   Soon the day may come in which a majority of Americans--I don't know  the breakdown of that 65 percent, how many were young Americans and old  [[Page H1185]]  Americans. Apparently, our young Americans are being educated that this  is okay, that the government knows best.   Apparently, whether it is on political matters like we had going on  with Hunter Biden, I suppose also with regard to things like COVID and  treatments for COVID, whatever it is, everybody, now we can marshal the  big corporations of America and, under threats of who knows what, we  can ask these big businesses, which don't exactly have monopolies but,  as a practical matter, you have to use them.    As a practical matter, you have to use them, and we  say: Okay. You are worth a billion dollars, to those who own these  companies, but we want you to say such and such.   It is very scary that the type of young people who apparently are  voting Democrat in elections don't have a problem with this.   That is why this bill is introduced today. We want to make sure that,  in the future, when the government has a preferred opinion, be it on a  potential President's relative, be it on a certain treatment for a  disease, that the American public will be able to also get the other  side of the story, the side of the story the government doesn't want  you to know.   That is why it is so scary that the Democratic Party is opposing this  and why it is so scary that apparently their base, if this opinion is  right, doesn't have a problem with a bunch of smart government  bureaucrats deciding which version of the truth you are going to get.   I realize it is difficult, apparently, where your base voter is, for  the Democratic Party to vote for this bill.                                time  1600    I hope you vote for it anyway and I hope you correct what the young  people have apparently been getting in school, that in a free country,  one of the things we should all have is the ability to say what we  want. The news you are getting should not be vetted by the government.    Mr. Speaker, I know normally this hour is taken up with  speeches that I think are not bipartisan enough. I have decided to take  this time to congratulate President Biden on his decision not to veto  the bill we are sending over to him, which will prevent the District of  Columbia from decreasing the penalties for severe crimes committed in  this city.   I think what President Biden has done is finally recognized what a  lot of us have been saying over the last few years. The District of  Columbia is just plainly and simply not capable of self-governance at  this time. I am glad President Biden agrees with us on that topic.   Right now, the District of Columbia has the second-highest spending  per capita in the country on its schools, trailing only New York.  Nevertheless, its test scores are abysmal.   The over 200 murders last year in the Nation's Capital is also an  embarrassment, and that number has skyrocketed this year so far as of  mid-February.   I will tell you, this is the Nation's Capital. There is no city we  should care about more than the District of Columbia. It should be a  shining light to represent the United States. People come here from all  around the world.   I remember once I took a trip to Taipei, the large capital city of  Taiwan. I was there with some friends. I asked our tour guide if there  was anywhere at night we should not go, expecting there were some  places we could not walk to without danger. We were told there was  nowhere in Taipei we can't go. Nowhere in Taipei is not safe.   I was kind of embarrassed about my country because I thought, well, I  was safe going to Taipei, but if I had visitors coming from Taiwan to  Washington, D.C., I would be talking for quite a while, explaining all  the places we couldn't go here.   I don't know whether people are aware that Vladimir Putin makes fun  of our country for allowing such decline in the District of Columbia,  not only how embarrassingly high our crime rate is but how  embarrassingly low our test scores in the schools are, how embarrassing  it is to have so many homeless people wherever you look.   I hope President Biden builds on this new conversion in which he is  admitting the District of Columbia is not capable, apparently, of  setting appropriate punishments for crimes here.   I look forward to working with President Biden on perhaps things we  can do to improve the decisions by the local school board on their  schools, maybe make some changes in their welfare policies that lead to  so many homeless people here.   In any event, like I said, I would like to end tonight's speeches on  an upbeat message, thanking President Biden for his conversion to the  understanding that the people here in the District of Columbia, who, by  the way, he is not a perfect man, but they voted 6 percent for Donald  Trump in the last election. I kind of wondered what type of people  would do that, but they did.   In any event, hopefully, President Biden will be happy to meet with  us and think of other things we can do to improve life in our Nation's  Capital.
