 Madam Speaker, H.R. 5129, the Community Services Block  Grant Modernization Act, improves and expands access to the only  federal program with the overarching goal of reducing poverty,  regardless of cause or condition. Since Congress established the  predecessor of the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) as part of  President Lyndon B. Johnson's ``War on Poverty,'' the program has  helped people achieve economic stability, secure meaningful employment  and education, gain and improve job-related skills, and obtain housing.  Such support is particularly crucial for communities in the Northern  Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa-- where poverty rates are significantly higher than in the rest of  America. In the Marianas, 52.3 percent of the population is considered  low-income, according to census data.   The Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act helps alleviate  such poverty by increasing overall funding for the program, updating  eligibility guidelines, and eliminating the arbitrary grant allocations  to the insular areas. H.R. 5129 provides an increased annual funding  level of $1 billion for the first five years. The bill also permanently  raises income eligibility to 200 percent of the poverty line, as  temporarily provided in the CARES Act, so more people can get the help  they need.   To better align funding allocations to the insular areas to meet its  anti-poverty mission, the Community Services Block Grant Modernization  Act mandates a data-based formula and transparency in how that formula  is calculated. Under current law, the Secretary of Health and Human  Services possesses total discretion to allocate CSBG funding based on  what he or she ``believes'' the need is in each insular area. This  changes under H.R. 5129. Language I included in the bill during the  Education and Labor Committee's markup requires the Secretary to base  its grant allocations on the most recent census poverty data available.  That allocation formula must be published publicly and updated no less  frequently than any time new applicable census data are available.  Using a regularly updated, poverty-based formula will help ensure  communities receive the support necessary to serve individuals and  families in need.   At a time when communities nationwide continue to be impacted by the  coronavirus pandemic, the improvements to the CSBG program under H.R.  5129 will increase help for the most vulnerable in our communities.                                time  1000
