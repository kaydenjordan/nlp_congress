 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  time, and I commend my colleague, Jackie Speier, for her leadership on  this issue. And thanks also to the ranking member for recognizing the  importance, the critical national importance, of the San Francisco Bay  Estuary.   I have the fortune of representing a beautiful district that starts  at the Oregon border but goes all the way down to the Golden Gate  Bridge. That means I represent a good portion of San Francisco Bay, the  North Bay, where we understand all too well how much we have lost--90  percent of the Bay's wetlands have been destroyed.   Starting a century and-a-half ago, there has been incredible  degradation of this vital estuary beginning with the Gold Rush,  continuing to massive water diversions and pollution inputs, the diking  of wetlands, and so on. But despite all of that degradation, San  Francisco Bay continues to play a vital role ecologically in our region  and an even greater role economically.   We have hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity every  year as a product of San Francisco Bay--outdoor recreation, commercial  and recreational fishing, travel and tourism. And we also see the very  real benefits in the San Francisco Bay area of coastal resiliency,  using natural systems as a buffer against rising sea levels.   The citizens of the nine-county Bay area have stepped up. We  recognize the national importance of this resource, and we have  supported a ballot measure to support climate adaption and restoration  funding. And now it is time for the Federal Government to do its part.  That is why I am so pleased to support Congresswoman Speier's bill, the  San Francisco Bay Restoration Act, to provide the much-needed Federal  partnership to help improve water quality in this important estuary to  revive the Bay's wetlands and to protect our coastal communities and  our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.
