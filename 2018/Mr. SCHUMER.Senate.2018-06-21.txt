 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, first, as the Senate continues to  process appropriations bills on the floor, I thank Chairman Shelby and  Ranking Member Leahy for their hard work on the appropriations process.   The Republican leader and I have both committed to work through  appropriations in a bipartisan way, through regular order, which is  something the Senate hasn't achieved in some time. Chairman Shelby and  Ranking Member Leahy are leading the way. We want to continue along  this road in a bipartisan, cooperative way, wherein what we bring to  the floor basically has approval from both sides of the aisle.                           Family Separation Policy    Madam President, on immigration, let me address the humanitarian  crisis at our southern border.   For a little over a month, President Trump's family separation policy  has resulted in more than 2,300 children being separated from their  families. Young children, toddlers, babies are being held alone. I have  seen the pictures of these tiny, little girls with forlorn looks on  their faces--it breaks your heart--and they are being placed into what  are being called tender age facilities. That is an Orwellian term if  there ever were one. Other minors have been flown, scattershot, to  different parts of the country to live in foster homes that are  hundreds of miles away from their parents. A 5-year-old is sent  hundreds of miles away from his or her parents? What kind of country  are we?   Yesterday the President signed an Executive order that made it 100- percent clear that what the Democrats have been saying--that the  President can fix this problem on his own--has been correct. The  President vindicated everything we had been saying and undid everything  he had been saying when he said only Congress could fix this problem.  Of course, he made it partisan.   It is a relief that the President has reversed himself and recognized  the cruelty of his policy of separating children from their parents. I  would like to believe he found it in the goodness of his heart. We  certainly know there was a ton of pressure on him to do this and that  he didn't do it when he first looked at the problem.   After weeks of acting like his administration bore no responsibility  for this policy--contravening all fact and all reality--I hope this  represents a turning point with the President. I hope it means this  President will stop blaming others for problems he creates and will  start fixing them himself. I hope it means the President realizes, just  because he says something, it doesn't make it so. So often, more than  any other President many times over, what he says is just outright  false, made up. It pops into his head, and he says it. Yet this  Executive order raises several questions. That means the President must  continue to deal with these problems, which, again, he can do on his  own.   First, the way the Executive order was drafted means it will not go  into effect until a court rules on its legality. What is the  President's policy on family separation in the meantime? Will he  continue to insist that these heartbreaking separations continue?   Second, the Executive order allows for the indefinite detention of  families who are apprehended at the border. The U.S. Government cannot  be in the business of indefinitely detaining minors.   Third, the Executive order is silent on the more than 2,300 families  who have already been split apart. Will the President and his  administration work to reunite those families? We believe he must do  that immediately. What exactly is the President's plan to accomplish  this? Leader Pelosi and I are sending a letter to the President this  [[Page S4315]]  morning that will demand he use all the necessary resources to reunite  the separated families.   At his rally in Minnesota last night, which is the kind of red meat  thing the President likes--gathering 10,000 people together in a State  of 5, 6, 7, or 8 million so he is a hero with everyone, which is the  way he thinks--the President acted as if he had taken care of the  border crisis, as if all of the problems were in the rearview mirror.   He said: ``I signed an executive order keeping families together  because I think that's probably a very important thing to be doing.''   The only thing is, we in Congress and the American people have a  whole bunch of questions the President hasn't answered, questions which  are listed above that I will repeat. How many kids are in these  facilities now? What are their conditions? Why hasn't the media been  allowed to go in, see, and verify that the conditions are humane? The  Department of Defense has been asked whether it can house 20,000  unaccompanied children from now until the end of the year. How will  that work? Is it even feasible? How is the administration keeping track  of the families who have already been separated? What are the plans and  timetable for their being reunited?   President Trump hasn't taken care of the problem, not by any stretch  of the imagination, but he has certainly admitted that his  administration does have the power to take action. He, in a sense, by  what he did yesterday, increases the burden on himself to solve these  other problems. I urge him to continue to use his power to address  these serious, unresolved issues. Legislation in Congress remains  unlikely and far more difficult to achieve than the simple corrective  actions the President can take immediately and administratively.   Let us not forget that immigration has been the graveyard of  legislation for years in this Congress. Saying Congress can act and  getting Congress to act are two different things, particularly when, on  the House side, we have a group of Congress Members in the Freedom  Caucus--way out of the mainstream by any polling standard, by any real  standard on immigration--that insists that poison pills be added to  anything we do on immigration. Speaker Ryan, thus far, has shown no  ability or desire to resist them. So having Congress get it done is not  going to solve the problem, unfortunately, because immigration is such  a contentious and divisive issue. The President has to do it himself,  and let us hope he does.                               Trade with China    Madam President, on our trade relationship with China, for too long,  China has taken advantage of America's unwillingness to strongly  confront its rapacious trade policies. For too long, China has dumped  artificially cheap products into our market, stolen the intellectual  property of startup and blue-chip American companies, and denied our  companies access to its markets. When companies have good products that  China wants to copy, it has denied our companies access to its markets  so China can steal the know-how of how to do it and then compete with  us. China alone, by its rapacious, unfair trade policies, has accounted  for the loss of millions of American jobs and the decline in pay of  millions of other American jobs.   So I am heartened that President Trump, after making a debacle of the  deal on ZTE, has taken a tougher approach to China in recent days. His  instincts to be tough on China are right on the money. As I said  before, on China, my views are closer to President Trump's than they  were to President Obama's or President Bush's, both of whose  administrations, anyway, let China get away with economic murder.   Now President Trump needs to stay strong. If he backs off at the  first sign of trouble, after the first company calls to complain or  after President Xi calls to complain, then China will know we are weak  and unserious. I am worried China already thinks that because of what  the President has done on ZTE. China is waiting to see if we are tough  enough to ride this out. We need to show China that America means  business because the stakes are too high. Business relocations to China  have cost too many American jobs. The theft of our intellectual  property has been called the greatest transfer of wealth in history by  former four-star general and Commander of the U.S. Cyber Command GEN  Keith Alexander.   The lifeblood of the American economy is on the line, so I urge  President Trump to stay strong on China. At the first sign of  complaint, if we turn, China will know it can push us over, and the  number of jobs we will lose--the amount of wealth we will lose--will  far exceed the kind of damage these tariffs might do.   Please don't mistake my support on this issue as a license for the  President to be reckless or as an endorsement of what the President is  doing to our allies. The tariffs leveled against Canada and our  European allies are misguided and poorly timed. We should be rallying  our allies to work with us against China, which is what they want to  do. Instead, we are poking them. China is our No. 1 economic trade  enemy, and I use the word ``enemy'' advisedly. We have to have the  whole world on our side, and these other actions are poorly timed at  best.                             Republican Tax Bill    Madam President, 6 months ago, in the dead of night, the Republican  majority jammed through a partisan tax bill that lavished tax cuts on  big corporations and the wealthiest few--the old theory of trickle-down  that the Republican Party embraced. My friend from Pennsylvania is one  of the few who will actually say that is what he believes, which I  appreciate, even though I strongly disagree.   It is an appropriate time now to look back on how the tax bill is  faring. While the Republican leader, on a daily basis, celebrates vague  statistics about business confidence, here are some hard, cold facts.   Since the beginning of 2018, corporations have announced plans to  repurchase more than $475 billion in stock buybacks--a record pace. In  the past week, the Washington Post has reported ``wages aren't just  flat, they are falling'' for a strong majority of American workers.  According to a recent analysis by JUST Capital, only 7 percent of the  capital allocated by companies from the tax bill's savings has gone to  employees while 57 percent has gone to shareholders--just what we  Democrats predicted.   When the vast majority of the tax cuts goes to the very wealthy and  to the largest and most powerful corporations, the average worker sees  very little gain--trickle-down--certainly, a smaller proportion of the  gain than the cut. The kind of plan we would have advocated, which  would have helped the middle class predominantly, not the wealthy,  would have been far better for average workers.   Remember what President Trump promised the American people? He said  the Republican tax bill would give a $4,000 raise to the average  American family. In reality, American families are not seeing close to  that figure. A recent Washington Post headline sums it up best: ``The  Republican tax bill's promises of higher wages and more jobs haven't  materialized.''   The truth is that the tax law has failed to deliver for American  workers and American families, and the American people are realizing  it. The polling data shows it is becoming more unpopular. It started  out being very unpopular with all of those little publicity bonuses  that many of them arranged. In January, it was at about 50-50, but now  it is declining again. American families know they are getting the  short end of the stick in this tax bill. Corporations are reaping  record profits as a result of the tax bill, and they refuse to pass  much of those savings on to their workers.   Whatever benefits American families are getting from the tax bill, if  they are getting benefits at all, are starting to get wiped out by the  skyrocketing healthcare costs--the result of Republican sabotage, some  of which was in the tax bill itself. There are millions of American  families now whose tax breaks are far exceeded by the increases in  premiums they are paying for healthcare.   All in all, that is why today, just 6 months since its passage, the  Republicans' signature legislative accomplishment is so deeply  unpopular with the American people and why Republican pundits are  saying we had better go over to the area of immigration because this  tax bill thing isn't working for us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I will be very brief.   I thank the Republican leader and the senior Senator from Tennessee-- the chair of one of the relevant subcommittees--for their comments.   We want to make this process work. It is going to take a little work  to bring it back to the way it used to be on both sides. This is an  outstanding start, and I appreciate that very much.
