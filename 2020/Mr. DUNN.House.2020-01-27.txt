 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 153, the  Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, which is about helping to  expand veterans' job and education opportunities in the sciences. I was  the proud sponsor of the House version of this bill.   The bill directs the National Science Foundation to develop a  veterans' outreach plan and publish data on veterans' participation in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields in its annual  ``Indicators'' report.   The bill also updates the NSF Noyce Teacher Scholarship program,  fellowship programs, and cyber grant programs to include outreach to  veterans.   I thank Senator Rubio and Senator Klobuchar, for their bipartisan,  bicameral support, and Congressman Lamb, a member of the Science  Committee, and a Marine Corps veteran himself, for his work on this  legislation. And I salute my fellow veterans in the Congress who have  joined me in introducing this bill.   This is an excellent opportunity for us all to come together and  support a meritorious piece of legislation. The very nearly identical  piece of legislation passed this body by voice vote 1 year ago.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill and send it to the  President's desk.
