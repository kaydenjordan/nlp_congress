 Mr. Speaker, there are over 21 million Americans who  don't have a photo ID. That is 21 million Americans who can't obtain  employment, lease or purchase a home, or open a bank account.   If you are a veteran, you need an ID to access the VA benefits you  have earned. If you are a single mom, you need an ID to access WIC and  SNAP benefits for your children. In 35 States, you need a photo ID to  vote.   The current process for obtaining an ID is inconsistent across  States. It can be expensive, and it often requires documentation that  many Americans just don't have.   That is why, last week, I introduced the IDs for an Inclusive  Democracy Act. This will provide a free Federal ID to any American  citizen over the age of 14 who wants one.   It will ensure that every American has access to the services that  they need. And no less important, it will ensure that America has the  access to every American's opinion at the ballot box.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues who support our founding  promise of equality and our commitment to democracy to support this  important legislation.                            ____________________
