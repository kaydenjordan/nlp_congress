 Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage cosponsorship of  the Congressional Hispanic Caucus-led Tri-Caucus COVID-19 Vaccination  Equity resolution.   Hispanic, Black, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander,  and Native American communities continue to bear the brunt of the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Not only are communities of color suffering disproportionately from  COVID-19 complications, but they are receiving vaccines at a lower rate  than their White counterparts. These inequities are not new. They  highlight longstanding health, economic, and social disparities.   As chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I worked with my Tri- Caucus colleagues to introduce this resolution, promoting equity in  COVID-19 vaccinations. The resolution calls for solutions like  prioritizing vaccines to communities with the highest rates of  infections and deaths, working  [[Page H2004]]  with trusted community partners, and implementing culturally,  linguistically appropriate strategies.   During National Minority Health Month we must promote vaccine equity  to the benefit of all Americans.                            ____________________
