 Madam Speaker, I want to give context to this before I  talk specifically about the idea of a closed rule here, which I oppose  so much.   First of all, there are about 690,000 in the DACA population, but  there is an estimate that there is another 1 to 1.2 million, though no  one really knows what that number is, who might have applied but chose  not to apply under the Obama-era DACA regulations.   We also have a significant population, post-2012, who have been  brought here. We had a surge in 2013 and a surge in 2014 of  unaccompanied minors. We have again seen a surge in the last few months  even. We don't know what the population looks like for this.   Another way to put this into context is this way: We have a million  people who have absconded from their court dates. That means they  haven't shown up. They got an order to appear, and they are not showing  up. We have another million with active removal orders.   That is 2 million people who are roaming the country. We don't know  who they are, where they are.   We brought in 1.2 million legal immigrants last year. That is a good  thing.   We are going to catch more than 1.2. We will apprehend more than 1.2  million illegal aliens coming across our border this year. These are  numbers that are almost unfathomable.   That population I just mentioned would be the second largest city in  the United States after New York City, more than Los Angeles itself.                                time  1315    When we say that we are going to apprehend 1.2 million this year,  when one talks to Border Patrol agents, people who conduct censuses on  these things, they will say that we have no idea any longer what the  getaway number is. A year ago, they thought they were catching 1 in 2.  Four months ago, they thought they were catching 1 in 3. Today, they  will say that they have absolutely no idea.   Last week, in El Paso alone, one group of over 1,000 people were  apprehended.    A group of 1,000 was apprehended, and 2,200 came in  through El Paso, in 1 day alone, who were apprehended. We are averaging  about 4,500 apprehensions a day in this country.   What happened when this bill came to markup? Why is it, in my  opinion, a real problem that we have a closed rule here? The  Republicans offered a number of amendments. We pointed out issues that  we thought were of concern. We offered amendments to address those  issues, such as allowing repeat criminals and gang members to obtain  green cards. We offered amendments that would allow application  information regarding illegal status to be used for deportation. We  attempted to prevent fraudulent applications from being filed.   But none of these and a whole host of other amendments offered by  Republicans were accepted, even some that were just absolutely  rational, such as those with DUIs that resulted in an accident where  someone was seriously injured or even killed. They were not prevented  from obtaining this path of legalization.   Here we are today, and now they are saying no amendments can be  offered from either side of the aisle. I have essentially opposed every  closed rule since I came to Congress. I think it actually undermines  this process where we represent districts and come to try to offer  amendments. I have offered many amendments and had them all shut down,  quite frankly, whether by vote or in the Rules Committee.   But the reality is, I represent a district, and when the majority  closes a rule like this, it is preventing me from representing a border  State that has a great deal of difficulties because of the rampant  border crossings of illegal aliens.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia.   I can't help but to be struck here as I reflect on the markup that we  had, as we have listened to the Rules debate earlier, plus this debate.   I can't help but be struck by the very notion of this is kind of what  happens whenever you start moving the goalposts on what a law should  be.   So under the Obama Administration, deferred action was provided for  children who were brought into the country by a certain date and time,  through no fault of their own, and that number was about 800,000 people  applied for that.   Now, the estimate is somewhere in the neighborhood of an additional 1  million who might have qualified who didn't file the requisite  application. And now, this particular bill, as several of my colleagues  across the aisle have said, will apply to anywhere from 2.2 to 2.7  million people.   You can see the number starts creeping as we go forward here, as we  change laws, and we acknowledge certain ideas about what the law should  be.   So this actually is not about DACA. We left DACA a long time ago.  And, quite frankly, there is no age limit here. So even an alien who  entered the U.S. illegally 30 or 40 years ago, could be granted a green  card under this bill. So we see that it has other problems as well.   So then we start talking about gang members, and we say, Oh, yeah,  no, no, this is really tough on gang members.   But in fact, the denial provision is written so narrowly that it will  almost never exclude gang members. In fact, it actually prohibits the  use of gang databases to establish gang participation in order to deny  green cards to gang members.   You got that? You can't use gang databases.   And moreover, only the Secretary of Homeland Security--and he or she  cannot delegate that authority to other officials--can provisionally  deny an applicant.   And what makes this particularly intriguing is if there is a denial,  we are charging a fee, so that free attorneys can be hired on to  represent these gang members who are provisionally denied. So they can  challenge the Secretary's determination, and that is done by a de novo  review.   So this is a real problem. It is too narrowly crafted in this area.  And there are some other areas--and some of my colleagues have talked  about it--but ultimately, we get to the heart of this, and it is just  this: There is a border crisis. This bill does nothing to stop that  border crisis. It will do nothing to slow the number of people who are  entering this country illegally. In fact, it will do just the opposite,  because it provides an incentive.  [[Page H4278]]    People respond to incentives. I respond to incentives. You respond to  incentives.   We also respond to deterrence. We remove deterrence here. Instead, we  buttressed incentives.   And so we will have a year where we are going to apprehend about 1.2  million people, at the low end. We know that a year ago we were getting  about half; we were apprehending about half the people.    And we know about 4 months ago, we were getting only about a third of  the people. Now, we have no idea what the getaways are.   You can talk to border patrol agents, ICE agents--whoever you want to  talk to down at the border--and they will tell you, ``we have no idea  the numbers coming in because we are overwhelmed.''   When I was down in Yuma, the Yuma facility is designed for 250  people. A month and a half ago, it held 750 people in inhumane  conditions.   No question. Inhumane conditions.   Today, that number is over 1,000, going through that same facility.  That is inhumane.   And so we are just releasing them. We are releasing them, and we are  saying, Come back in a couple of years.   And you know what? We have got a million people who have absconded  from their court dates. We have got another million people with active  removal orders.   You think this is going to serve this problem long-term? I am sad to  tell you, it won't.   You are going to see more people come because you have got the  incentives in place. And they are not just coming from Mexico or the  Northern Triangle. They are coming from Venezuela; they are coming from  Cuba; they are coming from Africa; they are coming from China.   They are coming from all over the world today. And they are coming  because they know that we have no place for them. They will be released  into the interior, and we will continue to be overwhelmed.   This bill will contribute to that problem.
