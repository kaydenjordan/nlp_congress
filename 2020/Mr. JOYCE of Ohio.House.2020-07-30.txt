 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to appear before you  today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness to the public health  crisis that continues to devastate communities in Ohio and across the  country while we grapple with the unprecedented challenges caused by  the coronavirus pandemic--the opioid crisis.   I have been proud of Congress' bipartisan work over the past several  years to not only advance recovery and treatment efforts, but also to  prevent the trafficking of lethal, illicit opioids, like fentanyl. I  was even prouder when, in 2018, those efforts resulted in our Nation's  first decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 30 years. Tragically,  our progress is slipping away.   The CDC's preliminary 2019 overdose death data shows that fatal  overdoses hit a record high last year, accounting for the deaths of  70,980 Americans. More than half of those deaths, 36,500 to be exact,  involved synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. In total, 37 States saw  their number of fatal overdoses increase or remain stable from 2018.   That deadly trend is ongoing this year as the coronavirus pandemic  continues to impact the mental health and economic security of  Americans across the country. An analysis released by the White House  last month found that overdose deaths were up 11.4 percent from January  to April this year when compared with the same period in 2019.   Mr. Speaker, these are more than just statistics. These are real  people--mothers and fathers, sons and daughters--and their deaths are  causing real pain in communities across our Nation. Back home, a young  man who had been sober for nearly 2 years--2 years--relapsed after the  pandemic began and the place where he worked had to close its doors.  Michael died at the end of March at just 31 years old, with both  fentanyl and carfentanil in his system.   I saw Michael's mom, Cathy, on the local news the other night  speaking out about her son's death, trying to bring awareness to not  only the lack of attention focused on the opioid crisis right now, but  the limited resources available to combat addiction during this  pandemic and the continued rise of synthetic opioids, like those found  in Michael's system when he died.   We have to act now to stop this crisis in its tracks. We have to  redouble our efforts now if we want to prevent other families from  enduring the same kind of loss that Michael's family is currently  suffering. Having met with those on the front lines of the opioid  crisis in my district, ranging from drug court judges to directors of  rehab facilities to law enforcement officers on local drug task forces,  I know that battling this epidemic requires an all-of-the-above  approach that includes prevention and education efforts, promotes  treatment, cracks down on illegal distribution, and enhances resources  for first responders and law enforcement.   That is why I introduced the Comprehensive Opioid Program Extension  Act. My bill, better known as the COPE Act, would help us implement an  all-of-the-above approach by increasing the authorized resources  available for the Department of Justice's comprehensive opioid abuse  program. These grants will help local communities battle the opioid  epidemic by:   Providing training and resources for first responders on opioid  overdose reversal drugs and devices, like Narcan;   Improving collaboration between State criminal justice agencies and  substance abuse agencies;   Enhancing law enforcement efforts to combat the illegal distribution  of opioids;   And developing or expanding programs to prevent youth opioid abuse,  drug take-back initiatives, or for treatment alternatives to  incarceration.   The harsh reality is that everyone in this Chamber knows someone who  has been impacted by this opioid crisis.                                time  945    With the coronavirus pandemic already causing an increase in fatal  overdoses from last year's record high, action is long overdue.   We must advance legislative solutions that allow Democrats and  Republicans to join together in a bipartisan effort to defeat this  opioid crisis. I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to find a bipartisan solution like the COPE Act that will  help us stop the opioid crisis from causing more death, wreaking more  havoc, and resulting in more tragedy.   This crisis has been breaking apart families and threatening the  safety of our communities for far too long, and the American people are  ready for us to help them stop it.                            ____________________
