 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3224, the Deborah  [[Page H8773]]  Sampson Act, as amended. I am proud to join my colleague,  Representative Brownley of California, in support of this most  important bill to improve the healthcare provided for America's more  than 2 million women veterans.   I thank the chairwoman of the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on  Health for including my bipartisan bill, Improving Oversight of Women  Veterans' Care Act.   In 2016, the Government Accountability Office reported that the  Veterans Health Administration had limited information on the VA  medical centers' compliance with certain health standards for women  veterans and access to gender-specific care provided by non-VA doctors.   In response, this legislation requires an annual report on the access  of gender-specific services provided under community care contracts,  including the average wait and driving times.   This bill is also directing the VA to establish a report on  facilities' compliance with environment of care standards.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 3224.
