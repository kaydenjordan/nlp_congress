 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Great  American Outdoors Act.   Our Nation's public lands have long been treasured sources of  enjoyment and beauty available to every American. They also play a  critical role in our economy, with the outdoor recreation industry  supporting 5.2 million jobs.   The hardworking Hoosiers I represent know that better than anyone.  Manufacturers in northern Indiana build products like boats, trailers,  and 80 percent of the Nation's RVs. That is why Elkhart, Indiana, is  known as the RV Capital of the World.   I am a proud cosponsor of the Great American Outdoors Act because it  will support RV and boat manufacturers and their workers, promote  conservation, and revitalize our national parks. By investing in long- delayed maintenance projects, it will ensure our national parks can  continue to be enjoyed by all Americans for generations to come. By  enhancing access to our public lands, it will boost tourism, strengthen  our economy, and support good-paying jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the Great  American Outdoors Act.
