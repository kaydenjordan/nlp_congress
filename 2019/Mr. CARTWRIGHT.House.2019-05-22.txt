 Madam Chair, I thank my colleague from Texas (Mr.  Green) for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Green amendment.   Madam Chair, to the Members of this House, when we file into this  room, we file past a three-times-life-size statue of Thomas Jefferson,  one of our Founders in this Nation. And Jefferson said he considered a  trial by jury ``as the only anchor, ever yet imagined by man, by which  a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.''   Trial by jury was that important to Thomas Jefferson that he said it  was that important.     Daniel Webster, who is quoted up here on our wall, said, ``The law:  It has honored us.'' Let us honor it by executing it in its fullest  severity.   How do we do that? We allow jury trials for American citizens.   We teach our children accountability, responsibility, being  accountable for your actions. The way to do it in America is to allow  jury trials to decide who is at fault.
