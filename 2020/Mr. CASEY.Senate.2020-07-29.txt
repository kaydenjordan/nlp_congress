 Mr. President, I rise this morning to cover a couple of  topics. One is on some comments on the legislation that I hope we are  going to complete to provide relief to the Nation with regard to both  the public health crisis and the jobs crisis, and then I will have two  other sets of remarks in different parts of the Record, but let me  start with what we are facing right now.   We know that it has been 4 months since the CARES Act, way back at  the end of March, and we all expected, I think at that time, that that  piece of legislation and the legislation prior thereto and subsequently  would have an impact on Americans, we hoped, in a positive way. I think  there is some evidence to indicate that the CARES Act had a positive  impact. Obviously, it was not perfect legislation, but I don't think  any of us thought that was the end of the road.   And then we saw, just 10 weeks ago, the Heroes Act pass the House of  Representatives. So you have the CARES Act enacted into law and  operative--and thank goodness for that--as well as several other pieces  of legislation. But the Heroes Act only passed by the House and no  action by the Senate in those intervening 10 weeks.   If you were on the majority side of the aisle, the Republican side,  as Leader McConnell has outlined, and you wanted to delay--wait to see  the full impact of the CARES Act--there is an argument that some would  make in that direction. I don't agree with it. But what I don't  understand is why, even if you believe that you should wait, why would  you not be preparing for the worst? Why would you not be preparing for  the kind of outbreaks we have seen across the country when the  [[Page S4560]]  virus moved away from the Northeast, generally, to the South and  Southwest, and then to the West even more so? Why would you not prepare  at least an outline of legislation? Why would you not begin  negotiations many, many weeks ago, as opposed to waiting until the last  minute not just to respond to the overall problem--the worst public  health challenge in a century--but also, in a particular way, why would  you wait, as the majority did, until the very last minute on the issue  of unemployment insurance when we know benefits are running out in a  matter of hours, really, not even a few days now? So if that is your  perspective that we should have waited, why wouldn't you prepare for  the worst so that when the worst was hitting, or something comparable  to that, you would have legislation ready to go?   The majority chose to delay, and I think, in a real sense, seemed to  adopt the President's kind of virus denial that if you just don't talk  about it or if you try to change the subject or, in the case of the  majority, if you don't legislate about it or prepare--just prepare to  legislate about it, it will somehow recede into the background, and we  don't have to worry about it. Well, that delay and that denial has  proved to be, I think, misguided, and I think that is being charitable.   So we are faced with a number of challenges at the same time as we  face a public health and jobs crisis. I will start with nursing homes  and long-term care and the very related issue of home- and community- based services.   We know that in long-term care settings, most of those settings being  nursing homes, the Nation has endured more than 59,000 deaths. That  number may have hit 60,000, but we know that it is more than 59,000  deaths. So more than 40 percent of all the deaths in the United States  of America, which is now about to reach 151,000, I think, from what we  saw this morning--more than 40 percent of those are in long-term care  settings and most of them in nursing homes. This isn't theoretical to  people out there. This isn't theoretical to families across my home  State of Pennsylvania or a lot of other States where, in many States,  60 percent or more of all the deaths were in long-term care settings.  The deaths are, of course, residents of those nursing homes, in  addition to workers.   So when you combine resident deaths and worker deaths, you get more  than 59,000. We have to ask ourselves as Americans: Is that just going  to be acceptable? Are we going to stand here 3 months from now or 4  months or 6 months from now and say: Wow, it is really tragic, all  these deaths, and another 59,000 people died in long-term care  settings, mostly nursing homes? Is that the America we want? Is that  the America we are going to settle for?   And, oh, I know, I can hear the argument: Oh, you know, it is a  terrible virus. It is. It is a virus that hits the very old in  disproportionately higher numbers, and if you happen to be an older  citizen and you have all kinds of chronic conditions or other health  issues that might compromise your immune system or otherwise, you are  especially susceptible.   So some would argue: Well, this is just going to happen. But we know  exactly how to get the numbers down--the case numbers down and the  death numbers. Is it perfect? No. Can we get the 59,000 to zero? Of  course not. No one would argue that. But the idea that the United  States of America, in addition to not responding effectively to the  onset of the virus itself--I am just talking about a subset or a part  of the tragedy, and that is the tragedy in our nursing homes, both for  residents and their families and for workers and their families.   We know exactly what works, and I have a bill that would  substantially reduce the deaths and the cases. What is it? Well, first  of all, it is important to know the number--3768. That is the bill. I  hope that my bill will be included wholly, or in substantial fashion,  in the next bill. S. 3768, what does it do? It allocates $20 billion.   Now, we have heard numbers that this next piece of legislation might  hit $1 trillion or more, and I think that is likely. We should ask  ourselves: Can't we set aside $20 billion of that, a fraction of that  trillion dollar-plus or more bill that we will pass, we hope? Can't we  set aside a fraction of that for older citizens and their families and  the workers who take care of them? These are Americans who fought our  wars. They worked in our factories. They built the strongest middle  class the world has ever seen over the course of the last 75 or so  years. These are people who were inventors and innovators. These are  people who made America what it is today. They are our fathers and our  mothers, our grandmothers and grandfathers. They gave us life and love.  The least we could do is make an American effort to get the death  numbers down and the case numbers down. Anyone who says we can't do  that is defeatist and I think invoking an anti-American spirit. We know  how to do this.    What will the $20 billion go for? It is simple but could be profound  in its impact.   No. 1, we know that one practice in a nursing home that reduces the  number of cases of people contracting the virus and the death number is  cohorting. What does that mean? Separating--separating those with the  virus in the nursing home from those who don't have it. Nursing homes  that did that were successful in getting their numbers down. They did  it early, way back in early March--maybe even earlier in some cases-- and it worked. It has been implemented in a number of States. But that  has a cost to it. You might have to build out, and you might have to  retrofit.   You also need extra dollars for personal protective equipment. There  should be no question that in the United States of America, every  nursing home has every piece of personal protective equipment it needs.  PPE is lifesaving--lifesaving for the resident to be guarded from  contracting the virus and essential for the workers as well.   What else do we need the money for? If you have a problem in a  nursing home with an outbreak, we ought to be able to surge expertise  from other settings. That nursing home might need more doctors in that  crisis or that outbreak. It might need more nurses or certified nurses  assistants or other personnel. We should have the dollars at the State  level to serve those professions. We also need more money for testing  in nursing homes--vitally important.   I think families across the country expect us to directly address  this. Unfortunately, the Republican bill proposed the other day does  not do that, does not invest, as my bill would.   Here is a headline from just this week, July 24, in the New York  Times. I will not read the story, but the headline is ``FEMA Sends  Faulty Protective Gear to Nursing Homes Battling Virus''--faulty  protective gear. We are months into this, and we have FEMA sending  faulty protective gear. Here are the first lines of the story:         Expired surgical masks. Isolation gowns that resemble       oversize trash bags. Extra-small gloves that are all but       useless for the typical health worker's hands.    It goes on and on. I don't have time to read it all today. But that  article and so many other documented reports indicate that these  facilities don't have the protective gear they need   The second issue is unemployment insurance. We are told that the  majority, in their proposal, wants to cut the $600 per week down to  $200. Do the math--cutting it by $400 a week. This is at a time when we  are told that since February, the United States has lost 15 million  jobs. My recollection is that in the great recession of around a decade  ago--between the fall of 2008 and sometime in the spring of 2009,  roughly--about half a million jobs were lost. We have already lost,  basically, double that--15 million jobs. We were told: Oh, don't worry.  April is going to be a bad month, and May and June are going to be a  lot better. That unemployment rate is just going to roll down from  there.   I was hoping that would be the case, but in Pennsylvania, in April, 1  million were unemployed. What was May? Fortunately, it went down-- 849,000. I expected June in our State to be a lot lower than 849,000.  Maybe it would go down by 100,000 or 150,000; I hoped even more. But,  unfortunately, it went from 849,000 to about 821,000--821,000 people  out of work in Pennsylvania in the month of June.   We still have a jobs crisis that will endure for a good while yet  and, therefore, an unemployment crisis. The worst time to cut those  benefits, those extra benefits, would be right now.  [[Page S4561]]    I know we have heard the argument that if you continue this, you are  creating a disincentive to work. That is what we are told. According to  the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, in a report this month-- just a couple of days ago--they found: ``Lack of opportunities to work,  not a disincentive to work, are keeping unemployment elevated.'' That  is what they found. They documented more than that statement would  entail, but that is what they found in their research. They also found  23 percent fewer job openings in July of 2020 versus July of 2019. So  there were fewer job openings.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor said that  there are almost four unemployed in the United States for every job  opening.   The third issue, State and local funding: The Republican proposal has  nothing to help States and local governments. We know that State and  local governments have to balance their budgets, so extra dollars can  come only from one source--the Federal Government. State and local  governments have had to spend more to protect their citizens with the  onset of the virus, the COVID-19 disease, and the impact of the virus  and the pandemic blew a hole in their budgets.   So what is going to happen? A State, whether it is a red State or  blue State or whatever the political conditions--they are all the same  when it comes to revenue loss. Here is what is going to happen, as sure  as night follows day: They are going to have to cut education. So I  would say to school districts: Get ready for cuts because if your State  cannot balance its budget, there are going to be education cuts.   There will be cuts to healthcare, probably Medicaid in most  instances, and there will be other cuts. Public transit--we were on a  call last night with transit advocates from around Pennsylvania, and  our side is asking for more help for transit. But you can go down a  long list, whether it is education or healthcare or even public safety  itself at the local level.   So we should do a lot more. We should be replicating or at least  approximating what the House did when they allocated $875 billion for  State and local governments combined.   How about the Supplement Nutrition and Assistance Program? The  majority has refused over and over again--categorically refused--to  increase SNAP by the percentage that our side has argued for. I know it  is a little easy in Washington to talk about hunger and food insecurity  as some kind of distant issue because those of us who serve in this  Chamber are not food insure. We don't have to suffer the pain of hunger  that many families are suffering. Many suffered food insecurity long  before the pandemic, but many others--even middle-class families or  people trying to get to the middle class--are suffering from food  insecurity because of the virus and the economic downturn. Families, we  know, are literally choosing between the food they need for their  families or paying the mortgage, choosing between the food they need-- groceries--versus paying for their kids' medications.   The last issue in this part of my remarks is on Medicaid. We know  that the Senate did the right thing in the Families First legislation  way back in early March when it increased the matching dollars for  Medicaid by 6.2 percent. Those matching dollars are vital for States to  be able to pay for Medicaid and to be able to balance their budgets.  The House bill, the Heroes Act, passed 10 weeks ago, I believe, set  forth another increase of a higher amount--14 percent--for those  matching dollars. I think that makes a lot of sense, especially when  people are losing their jobs every day.   We just read a story in the New York Times last week, I think it was.  More than 5 million people in the country have lost their health  insurance because they lost their jobs or for other reasons. So a lot  of those folks who are out of luck when it comes to healthcare itself  are turning to Medicaid. We should increase the matching rate to 14  percent.   The Republican proposal has no additional dollars for Medicaid. I  guess we should not be surprised because the White House budget  proposals in the last several years--and I think supported in large  measure by the Republican majority here in the Senate--have not only  not wanted to increase dollars for Medicaid, but, in fact, the White  House has proposed cuts of several hundred billion dollars to Medicaid  over a 10-year timeframe several years in a row. Republicans in the  Senate have said very little, if anything, against those kinds of  proposals.   Let me just move to a separate set of remarks
