 Mr. Speaker, I am a proud original cosponsor of H.R.  1996, the SAFE Banking Act, and I rise in strong support.   I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter) for his extraordinary leadership on this  legislation.   When the pandemic first hit and stay-at-home orders went into place,  many small cannabis businesses were deemed essential. Yet, just as  States recognized these businesses as critical, Federal law still fails  to provide them the same access to key financial services, like banking  and insurance.   H.R. 1996, the SAFE Banking Act, will address this problem, enabling  them to grow and hire more workers. Failing to allow cannabis  businesses to utilize financial products and services not only creates  artificial barriers for these small businesses, it is also an issue of  public safety, as these high-volume cash businesses are frequently the  target of robberies and break-ins.   That is why the SAFE Banking Act is so important and why, as chair of  the House Small Business Committee and senior member of the Financial  Services Committee, I am proud to stand by it since its first  introduction.   I thank Mr. Perlmutter for his leadership. Let's pass this  legislation once and for all.
