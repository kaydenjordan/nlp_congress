 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Americans have been protesting ever since the nation witnessed the  murder of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement last month.  Today, the House of Representatives is taking action to address  problems in our broken policing and criminal justice systems by passing  The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   The bill has many important provisions--   It bans chokeholds, ends no-knock warrants in drug cases and  prohibits racial profiling.   It creates national standards for policing policies, such as  training, body cameras and use of deadly force.   It provides for data collection.   It removes barriers that make it difficult to hold police officers  accountable for misconduct.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill as  quickly as possible, and to begin the next step in the process:  investing in our communities.
