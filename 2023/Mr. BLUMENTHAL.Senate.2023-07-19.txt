 Madam President, I rise today to recognize Mr.  James ``Jim'' Wade, an expert trial attorney, towering figure in  Connecticut politics, and dear friend to so many, including myself.   Born in Staten Island, NY, and raised in Simsbury, CT, Mr. Wade  received his undergraduate degree from Yale University in 1959 and his  J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1962. Upon  graduating from law school, Jim served honorably as a lawyer for the  Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, a testament to his dedication to  public service.  [[Page S3145]]    Following his service with the Navy, Jim returned to Connecticut and  began a distinguished career as an attorney at Robinson+Cole. He became  known for his willingness to take on diverse legal cases, including  unpopular clients, but Jim's strong legal principles ensured they all  received zealous representation. Jim was well-known for his mentorship  of countless young attorneys. Throughout his long career, he was  honored with numerous awards, including induction to the American  College of Trial Lawyers in 1980 and the Hennessey award, given by the  Connecticut Bar Association to an attorney whose career has manifested  a dedication to the highest ideals and standard of the legal  profession.   In addition to his love for the law, Jim had a passion for politics  and was very actively involved for decades. A lifelong Democrat, he  started his political career as a selectman in the town of Simsbury.  Jim later became a trusted counselor to the Democratic Party in  Connecticut, representing it before the U.S. Supreme Court in a  reapportionment case. He was also a longtime trusted advisor to  Governors, legislators, and others in public service. Jim's commitment  left an indelible mark on Connecticut politics, and our State and  Nation are better because of Jim's many contributions and dedication to  the law.   Jim was truly a remarkable person, who upheld the rule of law with  energy and intellect and epitomized a dedication to public service. I  deeply valued my friendship with Jim and always appreciated his insight  and perspective. My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to  his family during this difficult time, particularly to his wife Helene,  his two children, and his grandchildren. I hope my colleagues will join  me in honoring Jim's life and legacy, both large and lasting.                            ____________________
