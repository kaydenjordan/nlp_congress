 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Military Spouse  Hiring Act with my colleagues Senators Boozman, Hassan, and Rounds.  Enacting this bill would improve financial stability for Blue Star  families across the country.   The families of America's servicemembers make sacrifices that often  go unrecognized. Among them is packing up and moving frequently, with  military spouses regularly having to leave stable employment to move to  a new area and start over. This is compounded by the complex system of  State licensing and certification requirements, which can prevent these  spouses from taking jobs that utilize their expertise and experience.  Because of this, military spouses have unemployment rates substantially  higher than the national average, and they are often underemployed when  they do have jobs. Adding to the financial struggles caused by frequent  periods of unemployment and underemployment, the rising cost of child  care puts a substantial burden on many military families.   The Military Spouse Hiring Act would help these families by making  military spouses an eligible population for the work opportunity tax  credit. This tax credit has proven effective in improving employment  prospects for other groups. Extending it to military spouses would help  them find employment more easily after moving to new areas.   I hope my colleagues will support this bill to help families who have  made the greatest sacrifice for our nation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 3911. A bill to establish the Shenandoah Mountain National Scenic  Area in the State of Virginia, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that is  the product of 18 years of collaborative work from a diverse group of  stakeholders in Virginia, including local recreation groups,  conservationists, timber industry representatives, and sportsmen.   The Shenandoah Mountain Act of 2022 would designate more than 92,000  acres of the George Washington National Forest in Virginia as the  Shenandoah Mountain National Scenic Area, SMNSA.   Congress designates national scenic areas to protect the natural and  scenic value of lands that are also compatible with recreational uses  such as hiking, fishing, hunting, camping, mountain biking, among  others.   The SMNSA encompasses four wilderness areas: Skidmore Fork, Little  River, Ramsey's Draft, and Lynn Hollow, which in total include 10 peaks  above 4,000 feet and 150 miles of trails to attract campers, hikers,  mountain bikers, fishermen, birders, and equestrians. The legislation  also establishes a 5,764 acre wilderness area at Beech Lick Knob,  located 10 miles to the north.   The SMNSA will protect important water resources, as it contains  headwaters for the Potomac and James Rivers and watersheds that provide  drinking water sources for Harrisonburg, Staunton, and communities  farther downstream, such as Washington, DC, and Richmond. It is also a  hotspot for biodiversity. Cold mountain streams in the area are also a  stronghold for native brook trout. Today's legislation would  permanently protect those rivers and streams from industrial  development, and it would also help safeguard plant and wildlife  habitat for black bears, wild turkeys, more than 250 species of birds,  and at-risk species like the Cow Knob and Shenandoah Mountain  salamanders.   The Shenandoah Mountain National Scenic Area will provide a boost to  the region's growing tourism industry. In 2019, the tourism economy  directly employed 5,365 people and generated $601 million in Augusta,  Rockingham, and Highland Counties, as well as Harrisonburg and  Staunton. Designation of the SMNSA would further grow this value.   These challenging past 2 years have underscored that getting out into  nature is critical to our health and well-being. I am proud that the  Shenandoah Mountain Act will expand these opportunities within the  George Washington National Forest for visitors near and far, while also  boosting our local economies, protecting drinking water sources, and  preserving the wildlife that makes this area so special.   The local governments of Staunton, Augusta, Rockingham, and  Harrisonburg, along with over 400 businesses and organizations, have  endorsed the new designation for the vast benefits it will have on the  surrounding communities. I thank my colleague Senator Mark Warner for  joining me in introducing this legislation. I also commend our local  stakeholders for working on this proposal for so many years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Military Spouse  Hiring Act with my colleagues Senators Boozman, Hassan, and Rounds.
