 Mr. President, last month in the Banking Committee, we  passed bipartisan legislation to give our country more tools to respond  to foreign investments from countries like China that pose a threat to  our national security. I appreciate the Presiding Officer's interest in  this issue also.   The Senate Banking bill was attached to the Defense bill in the Armed  Services Committee later that week, and the House also passed a similar  bill through a key committee at the same time. This is good news as we  try to address threats to our national security, and I hope we can get  this to the President's desk quickly.   The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States--so-called  CFIUS--screens foreign investments for national security threats and  blocks those that undermine our national security. But as countries  like China have adopted new tactics and new techniques to acquire our  critical knowledge and know-how, the laws that give CFIUS its authority  haven't been able to keep up with technology; hence, the reason that  Senator Cornyn and Senator Feinstein and Senator Van Hollen and Senator  Crapo and I have worked on this. I want to thank them for introducing  legislation last fall to expand CFIUS's authority to keep up with these  new tactics.   The Banking Committee bill builds on their efforts to modernize CFIUS  to make sure that it has the tools it needs to tackle today's threats.  No country--not even close--no country has been more aggressive than  the People's Republic of China in going after American technology in  aviation, robotics, new energy vehicles, and others where the United  States has established itself as a global leader for a long time.   In just 3 years, from 2013 to 2015--from the beginning of 2013 to the  end of 2015--the number of Chinese acquisitions coming under CFIUS  review jumped 38 percent. And China is getting more clever, more  sneaky--you can choose the word you like--at finding ways to get around  the rules to avoid review at all.   We have seen Chinese companies start to structure deals so that they  can gain access to sensitive technology and information without  triggering the CFIUS review. For example, if a Chinese investor wants  to buy a controlling stake in an American company, CFIUS would review  that deal and have the chance to block it. But if Chinese investors  instead got seats on that company's board, they could still have access  to the same sensitive technology without going through the CFIUS  review. Or some foreign investors also might, for instance, decide to  enter into a joint venture with an American company instead, giving  them access to all of the technology and data and know-how but  bypassing the CFIUS review process.   The American business may not even particularly like joining up with  this Chinese company, but the Chinese company will coerce them into a  joint venture as a condition. This is what China is really good at, and  U.S. corporations have been too weak-kneed in succumbing to this as a  condition for continued access to the Chinese market. They play for  keeps. Our corporations play far too often for narrow profits, even if  at the end it is bad for American national security and even if at the  end it is bad for American economic security.   Our bipartisan bill will give CFIUS and our export control agencies  the tools they need to ensure that these types of investments don't  slip through the cracks. The bill strengthens the CFIUS review process,  the export control laws, and enforcement of both, particularly when it  comes to critical technology and investments from  [[Page S2999]]  State-owned companies. But, so often, and as important as these updates  are, CFIUS was created only to deal with national security threats but  can't do any more than that. Right now, we have no way to evaluate  deals that may pose a threat to our economy.   In 2016, foreign direct investments in the United States totaled $370  billion. None of that--not a dollar of that--was reviewed to ensure it  was in our long-term strategic economic interests. So while some of  those investments were reviewed to protect our national security from  Chinese threats, not one dollar was examined, was screened, was looked  at, was reviewed to ensure that it was in our long-term strategic  economic interests.   That is why I joined with Senator Grassley to introduce the  bipartisan U.S. Foreign Investments Review Act. It would empower the  Department of Commerce to begin screening all types of large foreign  investments for their long-term economic impact and consequences for  American workers and American businesses.   I thank Senator Grassley for working on this important legislation.  Updating CFIUS is important for our national security. That is  paramount, but we also need to expand it because it is important that  our economic interests be protected.   We understand that the Chinese subsidize their energy, water, land,  and capital. They often are state-owned enterprises. They are so often  able to come into our markets and simply break international trade  rules and put our companies out of business and throw our workers out  of work.   (Mr. Kennedy assumed the chair.)   We have seen foreign investments here that have raised serious  concerns, including worries that those companies are pursuing  investments for the sole reason or the principal reason of undermining  American industries and giving their own companies an unfair advantage.  Again, some of these companies are owned or controlled by foreign  governments. When it is Chinese, especially, their water, land,  capital, and energy are subsidized, and it takes away our ability to  compete because we don't do that.   We took a first step with an amendment in the CFIUS reform bill. For  the first time, the Department of Commerce--in this bill that the  Presiding Officer and I worked on in the Banking Committee--for the  first time, the Department of Commerce will be required to study what  American companies China is buying and in what sectors so we can begin  to assess how big the threat is. Now we need to move forward with our  comprehensive bill.   We surely know there are Chinese investments in the Presiding  Officer's State of Louisiana and my State of Ohio. There are Chinese  investments coming in that could, in fact, undermine our economic  security, could cost our companies business, and could cause some  companies to go out of business because of Chinese subsidies for their  investments and ultimately put workers in Louisiana, Ohio, and  elsewhere out of business.   It is simple. Before we do business with a foreign entity--whether  the Government of China or companies subsidized by governments in that  part of the world--let's make sure it will create jobs, let's make sure  it will grow the U.S. economy, and let's make sure it will not  undermine our national security or American industries. We are already  behind when it comes to protecting our economy from Chinese investment.   I welcome investment from around the world, but I don't welcome it if  it is going to undermine our national security, and I don't welcome it  if it is going to put American companies out of business and American  workers out of jobs. Senator Grassley and I will continue working to  change that. It is time to move forward.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
