 Madam Speaker, this is not a vote that I ever thought I  would be asked to take. The idea that this body would find a former  chief of staff to the President of the United States, a former Member  of Congress, in contempt was unthinkable prior to today.   We must approve this resolution, Madam Speaker, because of one simple  fact: 187 minutes. For 187 minutes, Mark Meadows was besieged by cries  for help from citizens, from members of the press, from members of the  President's own family, and from our colleagues in this Chamber,  pleading for Mr. Meadows to intervene and stop the attack.   The American people need to understand exactly what happened during  that 187 minutes. Mr. Meadows knows, which is why he must come forward.  It is increasingly clear that for 187 minutes the Commander in Chief  was derelict of his duty. We know this because Mr. Meadows provided the  evidence to the committee without any assertions of privilege.   And while the records he has handed over are helpful, there are many  questions that we need to ask him.   Mr. Meadows received a text, one of several, from one lawmaker in the  days leading up to the attack saying, ``Check your signal.'' The signal  messages are encrypted. Only Mr. Meadows can tell us what they said, so  we would like to ask him about that.                                time  1800    In the course of our investigation, we have heard from individuals  involved  [[Page H7793]]  in planning the rallies that immediately preceded the violent attack on  the Capitol.   Those people talked with Mr. Meadows.   We want to ask him about that.   We have heard from former White House staffers who ultimately  reported to Mr. Meadows as the chief of staff.   We want to ask him about that.   We have heard from Justice Department officials who received  instructions to amplify false claims about the election which Mr.  Meadows knew about.   We want to ask him about that.   And we have heard from State officials about the pressure campaigns  and the relentless attacks on democracy in Arizona, Michigan, and  Georgia.   Mr. Meadows actually went to Georgia in connection with the recount  effort.   The American people must hear from him about that.   We are investigating an attempt, as one rioter simply put it, and  accurately, ``to overthrow the government.''   Our republic--which I myself served in uniform for 20 years--has  never faced a threat as acute and imminent as what we face today.   Think back to the day of the violent attack. If you believed that  Mark Meadows could help stop that attack, if you were one of the  Members of this body who texted him to stop that attack, you must vote  ``yes'' today.   If, for 187 minutes, you knew the former President could call off the  rioters, you must vote ``yes'' today.
