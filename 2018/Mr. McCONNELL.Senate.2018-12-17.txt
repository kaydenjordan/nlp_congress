 Mr. President, I would like to say a few words  following today's announcement from our dear friend, the senior Senator  from Tennessee.   The great State of Tennessee has been generous to the U.S. Senate  over the years. A number of the State's Senators from both parties have  enriched this institution through especially distinguished service and  built reputations as national leaders.   Nobody embodies this legacy more fully than Lamar Alexander. While I  am sure he will accomplish even more over the next 2 years, Lamar is  already one of the most consequential Senators on domestic policy in  memory. Lamar was a success long before he became a Senator. He had  already been a popular and accomplished Governor and a brilliant  Secretary of Education, but fortunately for this body and for our  Nation, 16 years ago the Volunteer State saw fit to continue that  career of excellence by sending Lamar here.   He has chaired the Republican conference. He has chaired the HELP  Committee. For his colleagues in both parties he is a go-to expert on  some of the most critical subjects that directly impact Americans'  lives, particularly American families, healthcare, and our children's  schools.   The Every Student Succeeds Act and this year's landmark opioids  legislation are two perfect examples of signature Lamar Alexander  accomplishments. They tackle challenging issues in a thoughtful and  substantive way. They tangibly improve Americans' lives, and they  passed both Houses of Congress with big bipartisan majorities.   So the Senate will be lesser without Lamar's wisdom, collegiality,  and expertise when he retires. I am glad that day is 2 years away and  grateful we will keep benefiting from his leadership through the 116th  Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, in recent days I  have  [[Page S7628]]  spoken about the Senate's agenda for the remainder of the 115th  Congress. As was the case at this time last week, there are important  items that have yet to be addressed, but thanks to the bipartisan  progress made last week, we are significantly closer to the finish  line.   Together, guided by Chairman Blunt and Senator Klobuchar, the Senate  met the need to revise how Congress handles claims of sexual  harassment, workplace discrimination, and other workplace violations.   Under the leadership of Chairman Roberts and Senator Stabenow, we  cleared the conference report for the 2018 farm bill, sending my  industrial hemp legislation and other critical provisions for America's  farming communities to the President's desk to become law.   To cap off a year of historic progress on judicial nominations, the  Senate voted to confirm the 30th Federal circuit judge of this Congress  and this administration.   Now we will turn our attention to the remaining priorities in  completing the American people's business. Last week, I announced that  at the request of the President and following improvements that were  secured by several Members, the Senate will take up criminal justice  legislation here on the floor. Later this afternoon, we will vote on  advancing that legislation.   I know the proponents of this bill spent a great deal of time and  energy drafting their proposal. At the same time, there are a number of  Members with outstanding concerns they feel are still unresolved. So if  cloture is invoked later today, the Senate will be considering  amendments before we vote on final passage later this week.   Of course, the most high-profile items still before us are border  security and government funding. We need to make a substantial  investment in the integrity of our border and in the safety of American  families. We need to close out the year's appropriations process and  reach a bipartisan agreement to supply the 25 percent of the Federal  Government for which we haven't already passed funding legislation. I  hope the same bipartisan, collaborative spirit that has carried us this  far will enable the Senate and the House to complete this business  without undue delay.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany S. 1311.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 1042.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, when he retired last month, Ronnie  Ellis closed the book on his long and proud career in journalism. A  native of Glasgow, KY, Ronnie spent his professional life writing about  the issues important to his fellow Kentuckians and the Commonwealth he  loves. In doing so, he shared firsthand insights with his readers about  the happenings in their capital and earned a reputation as one of the  most trusted voices in Frankfort.   Ronnie's first job in journalism came at the Edmonson News, a family- owned weekly publication in South Central Kentucky. He was so eager to  put words in print that he even started working there before he had  finished his studies at Western Kentucky University in nearby Bowling  Green. He clearly had a knack for it. From there, Ronnie worked at both  the, Glasgow Daily Times and Henderson Gleaner, two newspapers with  historic roots in Western Kentucky.   In 2005, he moved to Frankfort and joined the Community Newspaper  Holdings, Inc., CNHI, giving Ronnie the opportunity to have his  articles printed in papers throughout the Commonwealth. His move to  CNHI also brought a change in focus, Leading the organization's bureau  in Frankfort, Ronnie kept a close eye on State government and politics.  In addition to his written columns, he also became a frequent guest on  Kentucky Educational Television's public affairs program, ``Comment on  Kentucky.''   Through the years, I spoke with Ronnie about the issues of the day  and their importance to our home State. He never shied away from the  tough questions, and his professionalism helped set the standard for  other journalists.   There is good news, however, for Ronnie's dedicated readers. We  aren't losing his viewpoint forever. In the new year, Ronnie plans to  continue writing a regular column for CNI. I would like to take this  chance to join Ronnie's audience in thanking him for his years of  reporting and wishing him a fulfilling retirement. I ask my Senate  colleagues to join Elaine and me in thanking Ronnie for his commitment  to journalism in Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to my  friend, David Fields, who is the Butler County judge-executive from my  home State of Kentucky. Earlier this year, David announced that his  time in public service would come to a close soon, ending more than a  decade of leadership and success for those who put their trust in him.   After a successful career owning a body shop with his wife, Virginia,  David chose to dedicate himself to the service of his community. First  elected in 2006, David quickly got to work leading the county. As a  former judge-executive myself, I know firsthand just how many  responsibilities land on your plate, and David accomplished a great  deal along the way.   In particular, David has been a wonderful ally to me here in the  Senate in our work for this region. The Green River, which flows  through Butler County, brings the potential for transportation and  commerce. I had the opportunity to work closely with David  [[Page S7653]]  during our effort to transfer the ownership of the Rochester from the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, USACE, to the local community. The dam,  which is more man 175 years old and provides a vital water supply to  nearly 50,000 Kentuckians, had fallen into disrepair and its uncertain  status with the USACE threatened Butler County's economic future. With  David's advocacy, I inserted a provision in a recent water  infrastructure bill transferring control of the dam to the local  community.   Last year, I also proudly supported the Rochester Dam Regional Water  Commission's application for an economic development grant to renovate  the dam and secure its future for the area. With a $3 million  investment, local leaders like David can continue to help this region  grow and benefit Kentuckians for years to come.   Although I am sorry to see him go, I wish David a wonderful  retirement. I am told he looks forward to spending more time with  Virginia, his son, Greg, and two granddaughters. I would like to thank  David for his leadership of Butler County and for his dedicated service  to its citizens. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in  congratulating David on this remarkable milestone.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  congratulate my friend, Leslie County clerk James Lewis, on his  upcoming retirement from public service. For more than three decades,  James has worked for his neighbors in local government, earning respect  throughout the county and the Commonwealth. As he prepares to leave the  Leslie County Clerk's Office, I want to thank him for his tireless work  and dedication to our State.   First elected in 1985, James has been a fixture of his community for  more than a generation. Of the many responsibilities of a county clerk,  perhaps the most important is the operation and safeguarding of  Americans' access to the ballot box. Throughout his service as county  clerk, James has overseen nearly 60 elections, including every office  from jailer to the President of the United States. Although the  technologies involved may have changed, his commitment to his office  has never wavered. I have had the pleasure to work with James on a  number of projects throughout the years. His passion for the people of  Leslie County is apparent in everything he does, and they have been  served well by his time in office.   James became a respected leader among all 120 county clerks  throughout the Commonwealth. From 1994 to this year, he served as the  chairman of the Kentucky County Clerk's Association Election Committee,  administrating election training for all other clerks for more than 20  years. Between 1999-2000, James served as the association's president.  One of the association's initiatives, which James helped found, is the  Help A Veteran Everyday, H.A.V.E., Program. James spearheaded one of  their projects, which involves repurposing license plates into bird  houses. The finished products can then be purchased at the clerk's  offices. Through these efforts, James is helping support Kentucky's men  and women who served our Nation in uniform.   Whatever retirement may hold in store for James, I wish him all the  best. Perhaps he will spend more time on his hobbies, like gardening or  fishing. I have no doubt that he will be enjoying more time with his  wife, Betty, daughters, Danika and Wendy, and grandchildren, Kelsey and  R.J. As he begins his well-deserved retirement, I would like to  congratulate James on a distinguished career. I urge my Senate  colleagues to join me in thanking James for his remarkable public  service to Leslie County and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is my privilege to salute my friend,  Hart County judge-executive Terry Martin, as he completes his career of  public service. Since he took office in 2005, Terry has dedicated  nearly every waking hour to his constituents. As he begins the next  chapter of his life, I would like to remember his lasting record of  success and to express my sincere gratitude.   After graduating from Western Kentucky University, Terry spent 27  years in education. He was a teacher, an administrator, and a coach  helping to guide the next generation. In 2005, Terry was appointed by  the Governor to serve as Hart County's judge-executive, the leading  elected official in county government. For Terry, entering public  service was like joining the family business. His father, Elroy, was a  city judge, a local fire chief, and a county magistrate. His brother,  Glenn, was also a magistrate and part of this noble family tradition.  The drive to serve his neighbors just seems to run in Terry's veins.   In the county's top job, Terry had a lot of responsibilities. With a  goal to provide essential services to the residents in a fiscally  responsible way, Terry consistently went beyond the typical job  description. I hear he would even drive a snow plow during winter  storms. As a former county judge-executive myself, I know firsthand how  difficult a job this can be. Whatever challenge he may have faced,  Terry consistently excelled and earned the trust of his constituents  and his colleagues.   During his time in office, I have enjoyed working with Terry on a  number of projects to help Kentucky, We collaborated with the Green  River Valley Water District to deliver drinking water to rural parts of  the county. Terry also identified the alarming frequency of collisions  along Interstate 65 in the county. Together, we prioritized resources  to expand the highway, promoting safety for both families and  commercial travelers.   As he begins his well-deserved retirement, I am confident Terry looks  forward to spending more time with his loving family. With Carmen, his  wife of 40 years, they are proud parents to Lynlea and grandparents to  Lyndon and Gwyneth. I wish the entire Martin family the very best as  they take this next step together. Along with all those who have  benefited from Terry's service to Hart County and to our Commonwealth,  I would like to say thank you. He's been a good friend and a strong  leader for Kentucky. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in  congratulating Judge Terry Martin for a job well-done and wishing him a  fulfilling retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to pay tribute  to Sarah Nicholson, a great Kentuckian who recently retired from a  nearly four-decade career with the Kentucky Hospital Association, KHA.  Serving as the vice president of government relations for the statewide  professional trade association representing hospitals throughout the  Commonwealth, Sarah earned a strong reputation for her legislative  acumen and her tireless advocacy.   As the leader of the association's public affairs operations, Sarah  has worked with members of the Kentucky General Assembly and the  executive branch for the advancement of our State's hospitals. She was  also tasked with supporting beneficial legislation at the Federal  level. As my staff and I have worked with the KHA through the years,  Sarah was an effective advocate for its priorities.   In addition to her diligent work for the KHA, Sarah is passionate  about bettering educational opportunities around Kentucky. At her alma  mater, Western Kentucky University, she served on its board of  advisers, its college of health and human services advisory board, and  its alumni board. Sarah was also a representative on the Kentucky  Council on Postsecondary Education Inter-Alumni Council and the Centre  College Parents Advisory Committee.   As Sarah begins the next chapter of her life, I am confident that she  is looking forward to spending more quality time with her family,  especially her husband, retired Jefferson County District Judge James  C. Nicholson, and their three children. I hope she enjoys every well- deserved time with them. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in  congratulating Sarah Nicholson on her retirement and thanking her for  her work on behalf of Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, later this month, one of Louisville's  [[Page S7654]]  finest broadcast journalists, Scott Reynolds, will be signing off the  air at Wave 3 News for the last time. For more than 20 years, Scott has  brought his passion for Louisville and commitment to professionalism to  our local NBC affiliate. Along the way, he has won awards, built  friendships, and earned the respect of his viewers. As he prepares to  leave Wave 3, I would like to take a moment to honor his career of  accomplishment in Kentucky.   Scott grew up on a dairy farm an hour outside of Minneapolis, MN. A  fierce competitor, he loved playing baseball and watching the  professionals on television. Later in his life, Scott would bring that  same competitive nature to his work on the other side of the camera as  a broadcaster. After graduating college, he moved to northern Idaho to  work for a local radio station. Throughout his career, Scott has worked  in several markets, including Cedar Rapids, IA, Las Vegas, NV, and  eventually back near his home in Minneapolis.   It's from there that Wave 3 convinced Scott to accept a new adventure  in Louisville in 1996. He was ready for the intense market, even  describing a constant ``news war'' in local television. He is clearly  thriving in the competition. Now the anchor of the 5, 6, and 11 pm  newscasts, Scott was even recognized among his peers in 2016 winning an  Emmy.   Although he has earned his seat behind the anchor's desk, that  doesn't mean Scott necessary stays there. In fact, I have heard some of  his favorite segments have come from the field, including his coverage  of the U.S. Supreme Court's Bush v. Gore decision in 2000 and his trip  to the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.   I have enjoyed the many times have gotten to speak with Scott about  my work in the U.S. Senate. Discussing a broad range of topics  important to Kentuckians throughout the years, I am grateful for his  balanced demeanor and commitment to integrity. Every time he  interviewed me, it was clear I was talking to one of the best in the  business.   Although broadcast journalism is a fast-paced, time-consuming job,  Scott still finds time for his many hobbies, including charity work  with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the American Red  Cross. The rest of his time is devoted to his wife and five children:  Haley, Connor, Tyler, and twins Matthew and Logan. I would like to  extend my warmest wishes to Scott with gratitude for his work at Wave 3  News. I know his drive and talent will be missed. I would like to ask  my Senate colleague to join me in congratulating Scott Reynolds on a  job well done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life of  John Andrew Rickett of Wayne County, KY, who passed away earlier this  year at the age of 94. As a proud member of the ``greatest  generation,'' J.A. served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War  II before returning to service again to fight in the Korean war. J.A.  was a leader in his community, providing guidance to all those around  him, and he will be remembered by many.   Born and raised in Wofford, J.A. interrupted his high school studies  and was drafted into the Army Air Corps. Arriving in England 1 month  prior to D-Day, J.A. flew as a B17 waist gunner on several missions  over Europe. His service played an important role in helping the Allies  win the war.   After his service in the Second World War, J.A. met the love of his  life, Frieda. He dedicated the next 64 years to the service and love of  his wife and their children. J.A. earned his bachelor's degree in  agriculture from the University of Kentucky, where he was also active  in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, ROTC. Upon graduating, he  received a commission into the Army as a lieutenant and was drafted  once again and sent to Korea.   When he returned, J.A. began working for the UK Extension Service,  initially as an agriculture agent but later as a 4H Agent in  Monticello. His family remembers that it was with the 4H that he found  great joy. Because of his many years of work with the 4H, J.A. is known  for his care and respect for several generations of youth in Wayne  County.   Elaine and I send our condolences to his children, Cassandra, Jerry,  Rebecca, and John, and their friends. I ask my Senate colleagues to  join me in remembering the life of a great man, J.A. Rickett.                            ____________________     Mr. President, after leading the Monroe County  government for nearly a decade, my friend County judge-executive Tommy  Willett will retire at the end of his term. I would like to take a  moment to congratulate him on his accomplishments during his time in  office and to thank him for his leadership.   In 2011, Tommy answered the call of public service, stepping away  from his successful business career to run for office. The job isn't an  easy one. Speaking as a former judge-executive myself, I know firsthand  the broad range of responsibilities that fall into the job description.  But whatever the challenge, Tommy always worked to better the lives of  the men and women of Monroe County.   I would like to mention one particular project I had the privilege to  work on with Tommy. More than a decade ago, the community began  discussing plans to construct its own water treatment facility. At that  time, the county was purchasing water from the city of Tompkinsville,  eventually reaching a high cost of nearly $80,000 per month. When  county officials brought the idea to my attention, I stepped in to  help. In addition to funds raised by the community and at the State  level, I directed Federal resources to the project to help complete it.  Working together with Tommy for a number of years, I was delighted to  see the facility become fully functional earlier this year, with the  capacity to pump 2 million gallons of water per day.   The Monroe County Water District's treatment plant is just one  example of Tommy's lasting impact on behalf of his constituents. With a  constant drive to help Kentuckians however possible, he should be proud  of his time in office. As he ends his public service, I extend my warm  wishes for a restful retirement. Whatever the future may hold for  Tommy, I hope he enjoys more time with his sons, Scott and James, and  his four grandchildren, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in  congratulating Judge-Executive Tommy Willett for his public service in  Kentucky.
