 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of one of  Minocqua, Wisconsin's, very own, Kevin Bolger, who is headed to the  2022 Winter Olympics. He started skiing in the third grade after  following in the footsteps of his older brother. By the way, this  family has been a cornerstone of the community in Minocqua, Wisconsin,  for over 100 years.   It was clear from a young age that Kevin was a natural, and his  interest in the sport continued to grow over the years.   His journey to the Olympics isn't like most of his teammates. After  graduating from high school, he opted out  [[Page H925]]  of going straight to college. Instead, Kevin moved to Idaho and joined  the Sun Valley Ski Education Foundation where they had a program for  kids taking a gap year. There he met and worked with his current ski  coach for 2 years before applying to the University of Utah. He went to  the University of Utah for 4 years, winning a national title his senior  year.   After 3 years on Team USA, he made his first Olympic cut earlier this  year and will be headed to Beijing as a first-time Olympian.   Congratulations, Kevin Bolger, and best of luck.                            ____________________
