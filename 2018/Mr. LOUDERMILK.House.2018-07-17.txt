 Mr. Speaker, let me thank Chairman Hensarling for not  only working on this bill, but working to include these two important  provisions as part of this 32-bill strong, bipartisan package we are  bringing forward today. This is going to go a long way for small  business as well as consumers in this Nation.   I also want to thank Mr. Meeks and Mr. Scott for working with me on  the Exchange Regulatory Improvement Act, which passed the Financial  Services Committee unanimously, and also Mr. Sherman for working with  me on the BUILD Act, which also passed the committee unanimously.   I appreciate the bipartisan work we have seen come together on this  bill,  [[Page H6312]]  and I want to echo my strong support with all of my colleagues in  support of this bill.
