 Mr. Speaker, this past Monday, October 30,  marked 11 years that my son, Harry, has been in long-term recovery from  opioid addiction. Yet even now, I can still feel the fear, the worry,  and hear the fights. What happened to our little boy? Where did his  light and his gifts go?   The years of active addiction were very difficult for our family.  Yet, when Harry finally accepted help, with all the courage and honesty  that that takes, we got him into treatment immediately. We did it as a  family.   I remember October 30 as much as I remember Harry's birthday, a  rebirth, two lifetimes in one.   Back then, it was one week before I was elected to a full term in the  Pennsylvania State house, and now, 11 years later, I stand on the floor  of this House, lifting up my son's recovery, which is the story of so  many others: the pain, the strength, the selflessness, the purpose.  [[Page H5234]]    Today, Harry is married, father of three, one of the strongest people  I know, and helping others reach recovery. His story is the story of  hope and possibilities. Let's dedicate ourselves to helping others find  their own October 30.                            ____________________
