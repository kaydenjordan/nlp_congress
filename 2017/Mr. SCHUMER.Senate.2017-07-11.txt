 Mr. President, first, I thank my good friend from  Florida for his inspiring words. He is always trying to work together  on bipartisan solutions. He represents one of the largest and most  diverse States in the country--a State that very much depends on having  good healthcare. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  will heed his words.
