 Madam Speaker, I want to recognize National Gun Violence  Survivors Week and the 58 percent of Americans who have experienced gun  violence in their lifetimes.   Gun violence kills nearly 40,000 Americans every year; more than half  of those deaths are suicide. Another 100,000 people are physically  caught wounded in the crossfire.   Entire communities suffer, too--those that may never shake the  trauma, fear, anxiety, and sadness of violent tragedy, like my friends  Marge Sexton, Jami Amo, Jennifer Lugar, Julia Spoor, gun violence  survivors who live with the scars of unimaginable tragedy and yet  continue to fight for sensible gun violence prevention legislation.   Our communities should be safe, joyful places. We should not live in  fear of gun violence at our public schools, our places of worship,  movie theaters, music venues, night clubs, or even in our homes.   This National Gun Violence Survivors Week, let's hold survivors  closer in prayer, in love, and in action and promise we will do more  and everything we can to end the crisis of gun violence in this Nation.                            ____________________
