 Mr. President, today, the U.S. Senate will continue its  pursuit of a bipartisan bridge CR to avoid a devastating government  shutdown.   In a little over an hour, we will vote on the motion to proceed to  the FAA reauthorization, which will serve as a vehicle for the CR I  announced with Leader McConnell 2 days ago. Once we are on the bill, I  will be introducing the substitute amendment, which will contain the  legislative text of the bipartisan bridge CR, which the Appropriations  Committee worked so hard on. And, again, I salute Senators Murray and  Collins for the good job they have done. I will file cloture on the  substitute and the underlying bill. So Members can expect to vote for  cloture on Saturday, if not sooner.   Things are coming down to the wire. As I have said for months,  Congress has only one option--one option--to avoid a shutdown:  bipartisanship. It was true yesterday. It is true today. It will be  true tomorrow.   With bipartisanship, we can responsibly fund the government and avoid  the sharp and unnecessary pain for the American people and the economy  that a shutdown will bring. With bipartisanship, we can speed along  this process here in the Senate. We can come to an agreement on voting  on amendments and allow the Senate to work its will in a timely  fashion. With bipartisanship, we can make good on the deal reached  earlier this summer to avoid default.   Remember--remember--bipartisan majorities agreed to funding levels  back in June. The leaders of the House, the Senate, and the White  House--we all shook hands on this deal, but now the Speaker and only  the Speaker is going back on his word. He is the only one of the five  to go back on his word. By being the only one to go back on his word,  Speaker McCarthy is saying he cares more about the whims of the hard  right--the hard, hard right--than avoiding a shutdown.   We cannot have that. We need bipartisanship. If he persists in  partisanship, which he is doing now, by always looking over his hard- right shoulder, he will create a shutdown. Sadly, every move the  Speaker has taken, since the bipartisan deal in June, has been to shred  any prospects of bipartisanship. By focusing on the views of the  radical few, instead of the many, Speaker McCarthy has made a shutdown  far more likely.   Let me say that again. Let me say that again. By focusing on the  views of the radical few, instead of the many, Speaker McCarthy has  made a shutdown far more likely.   Despite the fact that many on both sides want to work together,  despite the fact that, here in the Senate, we are pursuing  bipartisanship, the Speaker has chosen to elevate the whims and desires  of a handful of hard-right extremists and has nothing to show for it.  [[Page S4730]]    We saw a glaring example last night. Last night, on the floor of the  House, the House voted twice, with overwhelming bipartisan majorities,  to keep Ukraine funding in the House Defense appropriations bill--each  time with over 330 votes, a majority of both Democratic and Republican  Members. And yet, after the vote, the Republican leadership in the  House subverted the will of the House by going to the Rules Committee  and cut the aid to Ukraine anyway.   Can you believe that? Ten or so extremists, who don't care at all  about governing, about preserving democracy or America's strength in  the world, hold more sway in Speaker McCarthy's mind than the majority  of his party and the vast majority of the House of Representatives,  which he leads.   We need to be showing strength against Putin, not weakness. We need  to be defending democracy, not abandoning our friends abroad. Speaker  McCarthy is letting a small band of very extreme Members override the  views of everyone else. It is the tail wagging the dog.   That is the crux of the entire shutdown message, and if Speaker  McCarthy continues on his path, it will have consequences for years to  come. If we are forced to abandon Ukraine by a handful of extreme  people who seem to have no sense of the reality of the world, we will  pay a price for years to come.   How can Speaker McCarthy let that happen? How can he let that happen?   A divided government demands compromise. By ignoring this, Speaker  McCarthy is driving the country straight to a shutdown, and the longer  he resists bipartisanship, the greater the damage of a shutdown will be  to the American people.   It has been alarming over the last few days to listen to some of my  House colleagues on the hard right talk so casually about shutting the  government down. Some of them seem proud to do it. They sort of brag  about it. It is incredible. They seem completely unbothered that, in a  shutdown, over a million Active-Duty military members won't get their  pay. A shutdown would degrade troop readiness and devastate our  southern border--something our friends on the other side, who claim to  care about border security, conveniently ignore. Small business would  lose access to capital. Home buyers would be unable to secure loans.  Our supply chains would be imperiled, and costs for American families  would go up and up--all because of a needless shutdown caused by a few  extremists and Speaker McCarthy's obeisance to them.    This will all become a reality, unfortunately, in less than 3 days,  unless Speaker McCarthy abandons his doomed mission of succumbing to  the MAGA radicals. The only way--the only way, once again--and I have  to keep repeating it because maybe it will sink in over there. The only  way we prevent a government shutdown is by voting on legislation that  can get bipartisan support. That is what we will work on here in the  Senate today.   As I have said, the bill before us later today is a bridge, not the  final destination. I urge my colleagues to continue to work to advance  this bipartisan bridge CR and to avoid a reckless and devastating  government shutdown.   The Senate, once again, is called on to lead by example--to lead the  House and the Speaker by example.                              SAFER Banking Act    Mr. President, now on SAFER Banking, yesterday, the SAFER Banking  Act, I am happy to say, was reported out of the Banking Committee with  a good bipartisan majority of 14 to 9. The next step is to bring SAFER  Banking to the floor for a vote, which I will do soon.   I worked long and hard--for years--to get us to this point, and now  the Senate is one crucial step closer to helping cannabis businesses  operate more efficiently, more safely, and more transparently in the  States that allow cannabis to be sold.   I brought together a bipartisan coalition, with Senators Merkley and  Daines, Lummis, Sinema, and Reed, and we committed to reaching a deal  on the issue; and I am really proud of the bipartisan deal we produced.  I also want to thank Chairman Brown and Ranking Member Scott for moving  SAFER Banking through the committee. And, again, let me repeat, my  other colleagues were heavily involved: Senators Lummis and Sinema and  Reed and, of course, Merkley and Daines, the lead sponsors of the SAFER  Banking bill.   SAFER Banking's bipartisan vote in the Banking Committee underscores  how much momentum we have right now on cannabis banking and how  important the issue is for so many business owners and communities  across the country. No industry has the ability to thrive if its  businesses can't access basic banking infrastructure, especially not an  industry growing as quickly and one as new as the cannabis industry.   Congress must always be in the business of promoting entrepreneurs,  promoting small businesses, and promoting job growth. SAFER Banking  will do that precisely in the cannabis industry--connect cannabis  businesses to resources like bank accounts and small business loans-- creating a safer and more transparent environment in which they can  grow.   When I go to the floor, we will add very significant criminal justice  provisions to the bill as well, and that is important as well, and I  will talk more about that at a later time.   So, again, I thank my colleagues on both sides for their cooperation  on this legislation. We have been working on it for years. Now is the  time to get it done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1292 and ask  that it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1293 and ask  that it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I move to commit H.R. 3935 to the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation, with instructions to report back forthwith  with an amendment.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have an amendment to the instructions  at the desk.    I ask to dispense with further reading of the amendment.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, September 28, be  waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we get closer and closer to an  unnecessary and totally avoidable government shutdown, one thing  remains clear: The only way forward is bipartisan cooperation. That is  what we have been pursuing here in the Senate.   I want to salute not only Patty Murray but Susan Collins, Leader  McConnell, and our Republican colleagues as we work to pass this CR.  But that work is not yet done.                              Order of Business    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we will convene  tomorrow at 10 a.m. to continue consideration of the CR so we can avoid  an unnecessary and devastating government shutdown.   Members are also advised that we will hold two rollcall votes  beginning at noon on U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of  California and the Southern District of Mississippi.   I hope that we can come to an agreement to pass the bipartisan CR  quickly. A government shutdown, as we all know, would be a terrible  outcome for the American people. It would gravely impact pay for our  troops, our border, TSA, nutrition programs, food inspections, and so  much more.   If no agreement is reached tomorrow, Members should plan on voting  Saturday morning on cloture.   I thank my colleagues for their good work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 360.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10 a.m. on Friday,  September 29; that following the prayer and pledge, the time for the  two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day and morning  business be closed; that upon conclusion of morning business, the  Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3935; further, that at 12 noon, the  Senate execute the order of September 27, 2023, relating to the Gee and  McGrath nominations, and that all debate time be considered expired and  the Senate vote on confirmation of the nominations in the order listed.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand in recess under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, September 29, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
