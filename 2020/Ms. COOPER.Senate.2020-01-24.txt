 Russia violated the sovereignty of Ukraine's       territory. Russia illegally annexed territory that belonged       to Ukraine. They also denied Ukraine access to its naval       fleet at the time. And to this day, Russia is building a       capability on Crimea designed to expand Russian military       power projection far beyond the immediate region.         I was not in my current position in 2014, but       it is my understanding that there was significant fear about       where Russian aggression would stop.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. One American--a war hero and statesman who was no  stranger to this body--recognized the threat posed by Russia's invasion  of Crimea: Senator John McCain.   In an interview, he declared: ``We are all Ukrainians.'' Senator  McCain advised that this is a chess match reminiscent of the Cold War,  and we need to realize that and act accordingly. He was, of course,  absolutely right.   Consistent with the commitments made to Ukraine in 1994, the United  States and Europe responded to Russia's invasion by imposing  significant sanctions on Russia. We joined Europe in providing Ukraine  billions of dollars in economic support to help it resist Russian  influence, and the Senate approved, by an overwhelming bipartisan  majority, vital security assistance to help rebuild Ukraine's military,  which the former Russian-backed leader of Ukraine had starved of  resources.   This strong bipartisan support for Ukraine reflected what Senator  McCain said was an opportunity for the United States to undermine  Russian leverage in Eastern Europe by building a ``success'' in  Ukraine. Senator McCain outlined this vision:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         JOHN McCAIN. . . . Putin also sees--here's this beautiful       and large and magnificent country called Ukraine. And suppose       Ukraine, finally, after failing in 2004, gets it right,       democracy, gets rid of corruption, economy is really       improving and it's right there on the border of Russia. And       so I think it makes him very nervous if there were a success       in Ukraine in bringing about a free and open society and       economic success, which is not the case in Russia, as you       know, which is propped up by energy.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Achieving the Ukrainian success that Senator  McCain and many of us hoped for proved to be a daunting task, but  several witnesses who testified before the House said Volodymyr  Zelensky's landslide election in April 2019 was a game changer. Here is  how U.S. diplomat David Holmes explained the ``historic opportunity''  created by his election:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         DAVID HOLMES. Despite the Russian aggression, over the past       5 years, Ukrainians have rebuilt a shattered economy, adhered       to a peace process, and moved economically and socially       closer to the West, toward our way of life.        Earlier this year, large majorities of Ukrainians again       chose a fresh start by voting for a political newcomer as       President, replacing 80 percent of their parliament,       endorsing a platform consistent with our democratic values,       our reform priorities, and our strategic interests.        This year's revolution at the ballot box underscores that,       despite its imperfections, Ukraine is a genuine and vibrant       democracy and an example to other post-Soviet countries and       beyond, from Moscow to Hong Kong.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So American support for Ukraine's security and  reform is critical not only to our own national security but to other  allies and emerging democracies around the world. The widely accepted  fact of Ukraine's importance to our national security makes President  Trump's abuse of power and withholding of vital diplomatic and military  support all the more disturbing.   First, witnesses assessed that withholding the military aid likely  helped to prolong the war against Russia. When wars drag on, more  people die. Ambassador Taylor testified to this sober reality.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          It is my belief that, if we were to withdraw       our support, it would embolden Russia. It would also validate       Russia's violation of international law.         Russia.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Russia was not only emboldened on the  battlefield. Ambassador Taylor testified that President Trump's corrupt  withholding of military assistance and his failure to host President  Zelensky in the Oval Office was a ``sign of weakness'' to Moscow. It  harmed Ukraine's negotiating position, even as recently as December 9  when Zelensky and Putin met to discuss the conflict in the east shown  in this photo.   Ambassador Taylor explained:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
