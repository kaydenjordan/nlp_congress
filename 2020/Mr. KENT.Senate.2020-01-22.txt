 Over the course of 2018 and 2019, I became       increasingly aware of an effort by Rudy Giuliani and others,       including his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, to run a       campaign to smear Ambassador Yovanovitch and other officials       at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. The chief agitators on the       Ukrainian side of this effort were some of those same corrupt       former prosecutors I had encountered, particularly Yuriy       Lutsenko and Viktor Shokin. They were now pedaling false       information in order to extract revenge against those who had       exposed their misconduct, including U.S. diplomats, Ukrainian       anticorruption officials, and reform-minded civil society       groups in Ukraine.    Mr. Manager NADLER. As Mr. Kent indicated, the smear campaign against  Ambassador Yovanovitch was orchestrated by a core group of corrupt  Ukrainian officials working at Mr. Giuliani's direction. This group  included two additional characters who have been in the news of late-- Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were of course  indicted last year on several charges, including charges related to  large donations they made to support President Trump.   Simply put, in doing her job well, Ambassador Yovanovitch drew Mr.  Lutsenko's ire, and, as Mr. Kent observed, ``You can't promote  principled anti-corruption efforts without pissing off corrupt  people.''   As it turned out, this statement applied to Yuriy Lutsenko and to  Rudy Giuliani, who feared that the Ambassador would stand in the way of  his corrupt efforts to coerce Ukraine into conducting investigations  that would benefit the political interests of his client, President  Trump.   Giuliani's coordinated smear campaign against Ambassador Yovanovitch  became public in the United States in late March 2019, with the  publication of a series of opinion pieces in The Hill, based on  interviews with Lutsenko. On March 20, 2019, in one piece in The Hill,  Lutsenko falsely alleged that Ambassador Yovanovitch had given him a  so-called ``do-not-prosecute list.'' Not only was the allegation false,  but after having helped originate the claim, Lutsenko himself would  later go on to retract it.   The same piece also falsely stated that Ambassador Yovanovitch had  ``made disparaging statements about President Trump.'' A statement  issued by the State Department declared the allegations to be a total  fabrication.   President Trump promoted Solomon's article in a tweet, which  intensified the public attacks against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Then, on  March 24, Donald Trump, Jr., called Ambassador Yovanovitch a ``joker''  on Twitter and called for her removal.   You can see the slides of the two tweets.   These unfounded smears by the President and his son reverberated in  Ukraine. Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent testified that  ``starting in mid-March,'' Rudy Giuliani was ``almost unmissable'' in  this ``campaign of slander.'' And according to Mr. Kent, Mr. Lutsenko's  press spokeswoman retweeted Donald Trump, Jr.'s tweet attacking the  Ambassador, further undermining her standing in Ukraine--her standing,  the U.S. Ambassador's standing. Mr. Giuliani was not content to stay  behind the scenes, either. He promoted the same attacks on the  Ambassador on Twitter, FOX News, and elsewhere.   At the end of March, the attacks intensified. Ambassador Yovanovitch  sent Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale an email  detailing her concerns and asking for a  [[Page S459]]  strong statement of support from the State Department. In reply, the  State Department told her that they were unwilling to help her--their  own Ambassador--because if they issued a public statement supporting  her, ``it could be undermined,'' by the President and their concern  that ``the rug would be pulled out from underneath the State  Department.''   The State Department cannot express support for an American  Ambassador threatened abroad because they are concerned that if they  express support for that American Ambassador, the rug will be pulled  out from under them by the President. What it must have taken to  convince our State Department to refuse support for its Ambassador.   Phone records show that Giuliani also kept the White House apprised  of these developments, as you can see from these slides.   Again, it is worth remembering that smearing Ambassador Yovanovitch  was a means to an end. Removing her would allow the President's allies  the freedom to pressure Ukraine to announce their sham investigations.   So we should talk for a few minutes about the investigations that  Rudy Giuliani and his henchmen were promoting on behalf of the  President.   Let's focus first on the allegation that Ukraine, not Russia,  interfered in our last Presidential election. In February 2017, shortly  after the intelligence community--the CIA, the FBI, all the  intelligence agencies of the United States--unanimously assessed that  Russia interfered in the election to help Donald Trump, this  alternative theory gained some attention when Russian President Putin  promoted it at a press conference.   ``Second,'' he said--I am quoting from him. It is in the Russian on  these slides, I think.         Second, as we all know, during the presidential campaign in       the United States, the Ukrainian government adopted a       unilateral position in favor of one candidate.        More than that, certain oligarchs, certainly with the       approval of the political leadership funded this candidate,       or female candidate, to be more precise.    That is President Putin talking, shifting the blame to Ukraine.   Dr. Fiona Hill best explained how the Ukraine narrative is a  fictional narrative being propagated by the Russian security services.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          U.S. efforts to counter corruption in Ukraine       focus on building institutional capacity so that the       Ukrainian Government has the ability to go after corruption       and effectively investigate, prosecute, and judge alleged       criminal activities using appropriate institutional       mechanisms; that is, to create and follow the rule of law.       That means that if there are criminal nexuses for activity in       the United States, U.S. law enforcement should pursue the       case. If we think there's been a criminal act overseas that       violates U.S. law, we have the institutional mechanisms to       address that. It could be through the Justice Department and       FBI agents assigned overseas or through treaty mechanisms,       such as the mutual legal assistance treaty.        As a general principle, I do not believe the United States       should ask other countries to engage in selective politically       associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents       of those in power because such selective actions undermine       the rule of law, regardless of the country.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. David Holmes concurred during his testimony.  Holmes also compared the official approach that we believe in, that we  promulgated across the world, with what the President and Mr. Giuliani  actually were doing.
