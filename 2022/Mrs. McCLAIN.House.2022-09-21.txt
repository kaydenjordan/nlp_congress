 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reiterate an important  statement made by our President: The pandemic is over.   This weekend on ``60 Minutes,'' President Biden finally said what  most Americans have known for months: We are no longer in the COVID-19  pandemic.   So if the President just admitted it, that means the national  emergency is over, correct?   If that is the case, then why did the President just tell the country  that the pandemic is so bad that we should forgive billions of dollars  of student debt, or that it is because of the ongoing pandemic that we  must continue to enforce a vaccine mandate on our Nation's military?                                time  1015    I will tell you why--it is because it was never about the pandemic.  It was about the President bypassing Congress and the Constitution to  push his radical socialist agenda.   Mr. Speaker, President Biden himself has said the pandemic is over.  It is past time that we strip him of his emergency powers and end the  vaccine mandates and reject all COVID-related funding requests.                            ____________________
