 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  former Bishop Guilfoyle High School football coach Tom Irwin.   Over his four decades on the sidelines and in the classroom, Coach  Irwin taught thousands of young men to be team players, to work  together for the common good, to sacrifice for one another, and to be  men of character both on the field and off of the field.   As one of Coach Irwin's former players, I personally am grateful for  his leadership.   Through his words and his deeds, Coach Irwin taught his students what  it meant to be an individual of faith,  [[Page H4860]]  what it meant to pray, and to seek God's guidance during both victory  and defeat.   Leading teams of young men onto the football field, Coach Irwin  prepared his students not only to confront the conflict of crossing the  goal line, but to prepare for the trials that each man would face later  throughout their lives.   As a coach, as a teacher, as a mentor, and a counselor, Tom Irwin has  impacted the hearts and the souls of countless young students, both  those who wore football pads and those who did not.                            ____________________
