 Mr. Speaker, I spent 10 years of my professional life  working in health care, both during and after the Affordable Care Act  passed, so let me tell you what a Republican repeal would mean.   It would mean raising prescription drug costs on Illinois seniors by  more than $1,000 every year by reopening the Medicare doughnut hole.   It would mean returning to the days when insurance companies could  discriminate against women by charging them more than men for basic  care.   It would mean telling diabetics, survivors of a heart attack, or even  babies with a birth defect that they aren't qualified for healthcare  coverage because of their preexisting condition.   It would mean denying cancer patients lifesaving care after they have  reached their lifetime limit on their insurance policy.   Republicans have talked about repealing the Affordable Care Act for  almost 7 years, but they have no plan for replacement. Again and again,  we have heard that repealing ObamaCare will make America great again.  Well, I say it will make America sick again.   Please, let's work together. Don't undermine the health of millions  of Americans.                            ____________________
