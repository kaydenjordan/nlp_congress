 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about one of the most  basic rights that serves as the cornerstone of our democracy, and that  is freedom of speech, freedom of expression for all Americans  guaranteed in the First Amendment in our Bill of Rights. It is the  freedom of press; it is the freedom of assembly; it is the freedom to  petition.   This morning, I joined with several fellow Members of Congress and  other Americans to exercise this First Amendment freedom in a  demonstration outside the Turkish Ambassador's residence, the same  place where members of Turkish President Erdogan's security forces  attacked 11 peaceful Americans who were exercising their freedom of  speech on May 16.   This morning, we stood together to demand the protection of the  freedom of expression. We stood together to say that we will never stop  fighting for those basic freedoms that are enshrined in our Bill of  Rights and protected by our Constitution.   Americans have fought for over 241 years and shed blood to protect  our basic freedoms that we hold most dearly. As Supreme Court Justice  Cardozo stated in 1937, freedom of expression is ``the indispensable  condition of nearly every other form of freedom'' that we cherish in  our country.                            ____________________
