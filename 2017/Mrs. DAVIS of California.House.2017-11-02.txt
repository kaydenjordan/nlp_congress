 Mr. Speaker, I have received hundreds of  letters from constituents who are deeply worried about the proposed tax  plan.   One San Diegan told me that, without the State and local tax  deduction, his family of seven faces a loss of over $40,000 in  deductions.   Another constituent told me that his family would lose $20,000 in  take-home pay under this tax plan.   Why on Earth would we do this to middle class families? Why would we  cap the mortgage deductions middle class home buyers depend on to lower  taxes for huge corporations?   This plan is simply reckless and hurtful to the American people and  our economic growth.   Let's take a look at real tax reform for real people, not a plan that  helps those who need it the least.                            ____________________
