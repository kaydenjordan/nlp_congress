 Madam Speaker, I am sorry I am just a little late  because, actually, the Education and Labor Committee, we are doing  markups right now.   I rise to address the ongoing energy crisis and the impact it is  having on families in Orange County. The picture you see here is a  snapshot of what gas prices looked like for my constituents in the past  week. But I heard--actually, this is in Orange County.   Last week, same time--this isn't my district, but in Sacramento that  we have actually hit over $9 per gallon. These prices have increased 30  percent in the last year.   Gas prices in Orange County, and across the country, are rising every  single day. One reason for these skyrocketing costs is policies enacted  by this administration that have weakened our energy independence and  made us dependent on foreign oil.   With the President taking the necessary step of banning Russian oil,  it is even more important that we return to our former energy  independence. We cannot turn from one foreign dictator to another to  meet our energy needs. We have the resources right here to bring down  costs and produce the cleanest energy on Earth.  [[Page H3768]]    I urge all my colleagues to join me in pursuing policies to secure  our energy independence.
