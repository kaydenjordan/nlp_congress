 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This bill will help our  struggling communities combat the opioid epidemic ravaging our Nation  by focusing on providing care to those in need while addressing  prevention of opioid misuse and abuse.   I am proud that two pieces of legislation that I introduced are  included in H.R. 6 as sections 202 and 203. Section 202, which I worked  closely with Representative Peters on to introduce, would incentivize  development of nonopioid pain alternatives for postsurgical pain.   Section 203 would increase screening for chronic pain, address  possible nonopioid pain alternatives, and increase early detection of  opioid use disorder in seniors as they enter Medicare.   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on  solutions to this serious crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 6.
