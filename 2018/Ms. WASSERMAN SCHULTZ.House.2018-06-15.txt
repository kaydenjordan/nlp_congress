 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's cruel attempt  to sabotage affordable healthcare access for more than 130 million  Americans is inhumane and, mark my words, deadly.   If Trump has his way, anyone who has survived or lives with cancer,  asthma, diabetes, mental health issues, or virtually any other medical  conditions that you can think of, and many that you can't, will risk  losing their health coverage. That is because the President is bent on  dismantling the Affordable Care Act, which protects Americans with  preexisting conditions.   Before the ACA, insurance companies refused coverage or charged  people more with these commonplace maladies. They even charged women  more just for being women.   I am a woman, and I also beat breast cancer. And it sickens me to  think of the anxiety and pain this President is causing my sister  survivors right now with this threat. It is absurd, it is  discriminatory, and it is, frankly, monstrous.   Every time it appears that the reckless disregard for people's lives  shown by this administration and their Republican enablers in Congress  couldn't possibly get any worse, they find a new low.   Mr. Speaker, there are too many real problems facing Americans today.  This President and his party need to stop creating deadly new ones.                            ____________________
