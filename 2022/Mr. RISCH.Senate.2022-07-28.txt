 Mr. President, I rise today, colleagues, to urge the  Senate to proceed quickly--quickly--to the consideration of the  accession protocols for Finland and Sweden to join NATO.   Once again the Senate has been given the responsibility of offering  advice and consent to ratifying the accession of two new members to the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We have been advising aggressively  for quite some time, and it is time now to move to the consent portion  of getting this done. NATO is the most successful political-military  alliance in history. It helped bring down the Soviet Union, and it  united Europe so it could rebuild economically.   The Senate has the opportunity to expand NATO and bring both Finland  and Sweden into the alliance. Over the years, these countries never  sought membership. They were content to just partner with NATO, but  they did not join. However, Putin's attempt to rewrite the security  landscape in Europe with his invasion of Ukraine convinced the people  of Finland and Sweden that they should become formal members of NATO.  Why wouldn't they?   After the past 2 weeks--and really the entire summer--the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee has carefully considered and discussed the  prospective membership of our longtime partners, Finland and Sweden.   The Senate has already shown bipartisan support for Finland and  Sweden joining NATO. As my colleagues and I have laid out in a  resolution of support in public statements at Senate Foreign Relations  Committee meetings and hearings in June and in the committee report  submitted to the floor along with the protocols, Finland and Sweden  will make model members of the NATO alliance.   Once approved by all 30 current members of NATO, these two nations  will become integral members of the alliance. Both have strong and  capable militaries and are already net contributors to the security  alliance. Although militarily unaligned for decades, Finland and Sweden  have long defended Europe's high north--a region becoming even more  important with the competition from Russia and China in the Arctic.   Both have already demonstrated the interoperability and commitment  necessary to join the alliance. Finland already spends more than 2  percent of its GDP on defense, and Sweden laid out its plan to reach  that mark shortly--both requirements for joining NATO.   These countries also bring additional capabilities to NATO. Both are  intimately familiar with the north and east flank of Europe. Finland  also trains U.S. forces in cold weather operations and the Finnish Navy  is especially suited to operate and defend the Baltic Sea, where some  Navy ships have less maneuverability, being a blue-water Navy.   They have both participated in NATO missions in Afghanistan, the  Balkans, and Iraq. In fact, these countries operated with less  restrictions on their militaries in these missions than other NATO  members. Finland and Sweden also share our democratic values, have  strong military and defense industries, and extensive experience in  Russian matters.   One only has to take a look at a map to see the benefits of adding  Finland and Sweden to NATO. With their proximity to the Baltic States-- the Baltic States, which are small--they are well-positioned to provide  support, if needed, to our current Baltic NATO allies, just as the rest  of NATO would if the Baltic States have a problem with Russia.   Adding these two nations as full members to our alliance will further  deter any temptation by Russia to engage in military adventurism in the  Baltic area or the Arctic regions. Although my sense is Russia has  already learned this year of the ineptitude, clumsiness, and just plain  inabilities of its way-overrated military, which can't even win against  a small, substantially less-equipped adversary, even when Russia used  barbaric medieval tactics. Russia's efforts have been pitiful and, at  the same time, despicable.   Many Senators have already given firm statements of support for this  succession, and we deserve the timely chance to make our support known  through a vote. Let's get on with it.   There are few things more important than voting on accession for  Finland and Sweden to NATO. This accession process is an important  chance for the United States to demonstrate leadership in NATO and  commitment to its modernization and, very importantly, NATO's future.   When the shooting is over in Ukraine, it won't be over. There is no  doubt that NATO is going to take a long, hard look at what it is doing,  what its priorities are, and, very importantly, hardening the eastern  and northern flanks.   Since this wave of NATO enlargement was first announced, the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee has carefully consulted and coordinated  with our NATO allies, the governments of Sweden and Finland, with the  administration, and within the Senate itself to ensure this process can  move as efficiently and quickly as possible. I can't count the number  of meetings and conversations we have had in this regard.   We now have only one step left until ratification, and it makes no  sense to dillydally at this stage. There should be no issue with moving  this treaty as quickly as possible. The Senate's quick ratification of  Finland and Sweden as new members of NATO will both send a strong  message of transatlantic unity to a now foundering Russia and will  strengthen NATO against Russia's growing threat.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to convey my support for the  Columbia River Federal Power System. The congressionally-authorized  Federal dams on the Columbia River System bring unparalleled benefits  to the Pacific Northwest and stand as an example to other hydropower  projects worldwide. The system's capacity to generate always-on,  baseload carbon-free power is vital to the Northwest. As many other  parts of the country have experienced rolling blackouts, the dams in  the Columbia Basin have consistently kept the lights on.   In the Northwest, we enjoy numerous other benefits from this  infrastructure, including flood control, irrigation, navigation, and  recreation. Due to its remarkable lock and dam system, even my  landlocked home State of Idaho benefits from a seaport, sending Idaho's  agricultural and manufactured products around the world in a cost- effective, low-carbon manner. As additional challenges have risen,  scientists and managers at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have  adapted under the direction of Congress to ensure the dams are still  simultaneously beneficial to humans and our natural environment.   It is due to these important considerations that I speak on the Water  Resources Development Act before the Senate today. Among a list of  studies that can generally be measured in acres or at most counties is  a sweeping and far-reaching study directed at aquatic habitat  restoration in the Columbia River Basin. The Columbia River Basin spans  nearly 260,000 square miles over seven States. This is not just another  small, localized review, but instead authorizes an exhaustive study on  aquatic restoration in one of the largest basins in the country.   I have long supported improving salmon and steelhead populations in  the Northwest. In fact, I worked tirelessly with colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to pass legislation--ultimately supported by the  entire Northwest delegation--to address the predation that was  devastating salmon populations before they had a chance to go upriver.  However, what I cannot support are the constant efforts to remove the  benefits provided by our hydropower system under the guise of salmon  recovery or ``aquatic restoration.''   We have studied this river and these dams ad nauseam. Most recently,  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed the 3-year Columbia River  System Operations review, which intentionally and specifically  considered whether dam breaching was necessary for fish recovery and  determined the opposite. It has been proven, time and again, salmon and  hydropower dams do, can, and should coexist. It is futile and  irresponsible to spend further taxpayer dollars considering dam  breaching. But this reality has not prevented the administration or  other political actors from continually pushing against the intent of  Congress to protect both the species and the numerous benefits from the  Columbia River Federal Power System.   With this in mind, let us revisit the ecosystem study in title II. I  deeply appreciate the chairman and ranking member's attention to this  issue and work to create suitable limitations to ensure this study will  be held strictly to the congressionally authorized purposes of the  system and considerations that would maintain the energy, flood  control, navigation, irrigation, and other benefits it currently  provides. While I still regard this study as too far-reaching and  unfocused to result in timely proposals for anadromous fish recovery-- yet again wasting taxpayer dollars better utilized elsewhere in the  region--with this vital check, I am able to support this version of  WRDA overall and the many essential water infrastructure priorities  contained within it. Should this proposed study be signed into law, I  will take special notice and trust that it meets congressional intent  of preserving the Columbia River Federal Power System, all of its  current infrastructure as authorized by Congress, and its innumerable  benefits.   Despite political maneuvering from the administration, it is an  irrefutable fact that decisions regarding the Columbia River Federal  Power System are solely the responsibility of Congress. I look forward  to continue working with my colleagues to identify solutions to salmon  recovery that do not inhibit the clean energy, flood control,  navigation, agricultural, and recreation benefits of our Federal Power  System.                            ____________________
