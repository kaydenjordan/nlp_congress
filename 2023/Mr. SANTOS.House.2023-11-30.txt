 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   In the matter of Representative Jamaal Bowman from New York;   Whereas, Representative Jamaal Bowman is a Member of the United  States House of Representatives;  [[Page H6000]]    Whereas, on September 30, 2023, Representative Jamaal Bowman  knowingly and willingly gave a false fire alarm in the Cannon House  Office Building;   Whereas, on October 26, 2023, Representative Jamaal Bowman pleaded  guilty to one count of falsely pulling the alarm; and   Whereas, Representative Jamaal Bowman's actions caused the closing of  the Cannon House Office Building and resulted in the disruption of an  official proceeding in the Congress.   Now, therefore, be it resolved that pursuant to Article I, Section 5,  Clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States, Representative  Jamaal Bowman, be and he hereby is, expelled from the House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot about process. We hear a lot  about findings. Before I yield some time to my colleague from Texas, I  just want to point out in the resolution that the distinguished  chairman from Mississippi (Mr. Guest) filed, he states that I engaged  in sexual misconduct when his own report states otherwise. That is just  a clear evidence of how this process has been skewed, how this process  is sloppy, and how it is contradictory to the core.   The fact that in the report it states that that was not the case, but  they still bring it to the floor of the House of Representatives shows  you the lack of respect for one's reputation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Nehls).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, you know, I hear a lot the lines, ``I  encourage Representative Santos to resign,'' and, ``Do the right  thing,'' which is resign. What I hear is people don't want to take this  vote.   I am just here. I am willing to take the vote. Take the vote, guys. I  am okay with it. This is your time. This is what they have all built up  to all year.   The most damning feature of this farce is the total perversion of the  priorities of this body and this Conference, which ran on the  Commitment to America.   Yes, witch hunting George Santos is great. Right there, I remember  that on the top line of the Commitment to America.   This Conference has failed to pass four different appropriations  bills, Mr. Speaker. It had rules fail on the floor. We had Members  weaponizing the Rules Committee because it didn't do what they wanted.  Our borders are wide open. It is a no man's land being run by NGOs.   Yet, this Congress has now taken three measures and the  insurmountable amount of time that goes behind them to expel a Member  duly elected by the people of the Third District of New York.   I didn't think that my tenure in Congress would be this way, Mr.  Speaker. I came here to do work. I came here to pass and work on  conservative legislation. I have a stellar conservative record that I  am proud of. The work I have done in this body I am proud of. The votes  I have taken in this body I am proud of. Every vote that I have taken  that might have been against leadership, I stand by those votes not  because I disrespect leadership but because I want a more conservative  agenda for our country.    Now, I can't say the same thing about some of my colleagues,  especially the ones most adamant to remove me, almost as if we remove  him, there is no comparison. It is that much simpler. They can go home  and say they are conservative. They won't know what a real conservative  will look like on Long Island. That is just the reality. The votes are  there.   Now, let's talk about the fact of due process that everybody seems to  say that I have taken and have received. You know, it is no secret in  this body that, obviously, I have an ongoing process with the DOJ. I  was given a deadline, an unrealistic deadline, to testify before the  committee the same day that I had to go to court. They gave us a hard- line, yes or no answer. They wouldn't settle for anything else.   That was the deadline. I could not surpass that date, which means it  was either I go to New York City to adhere to my DOJ case or go to the  Ethics Committee. No disrespect to the committee--I have incurred over  $200,000 of legal fees that have been predominantly paid for, so to  suggest that I have not complied with them is yet another lie.   They have received every document they have asked for. Documents we  did not have, we have told them that we don't have them. We don't have  access to what you are asking for. They persisted and insisted in  inventing documents, communication between myself and people that did  not exist--thus, communication. We informed them. This was all on the  record.   However, I rise and question again to the chairman: Will he set the  record straight that his expulsion resolution contradicts the findings  of his report? Which one is it? Am I guilty of a sexual harassment  claim, or am I not? The report says I am not. His filing on this  expulsion resolution says I am. That is a very serious allegation, one  that I sought to see the end of where the Office of Congressional  Ethics sent a referral to the investigative subcommittee saying that  they did not suggest further investigation into the matter because it  lacked credibility, yet it sits on their expulsion resolution.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I call that hypocrisy, more lying, more swamp behavior  from this body, the same reason that Americans have no trust in this  body because unfortunately, far too often too many of our colleagues  here will speak from both sides of their mouths without regard to who  it might hurt.  [[Page H6021]]    As it is said, people in this town will hurt people a whole lot so  they can benefit just a little bit.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to have the gentleman from Ohio's  words stricken from the record, please.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, hypocrisy, as I mentioned. My colleague wants to come up  here and call me a crook, the same colleague who is accused of being a  woman beater.   Are we really going to ignore the fact that we all have pasts, and we  all have the media coming out against us on a daily basis?   Every last one of us has struggled with every little ounce of what  happens in public service. I can go and read about all my colleagues.   I am not going to stand here to smear them. I am not going to stand  here and use the time I have to say ill things about my colleagues. I  refuse to stoop to that level.   The only thing I want to make clear is if tomorrow when this vote is  on the floor, it is in the conscience of all my colleagues that they  believe that this is the correct thing to do, so be it.   Take the vote. I am at peace. Whether I get expelled or I don't, I  have accepted that I cannot control that fate, Mr. Speaker.   I have done the best I can to serve in this body and to deliver the  best I can in my campaign promises to vote as a conservative voice in  this body. I stand by that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
