 Mr. Speaker, as one of the first Native American women  elected to Congress and the daughter of two veterans, I am proud that  my bill with Representative   Mike Gallagher, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Tribal Advisory Committee Act, will be included in  this package.  [[Page H7211]]    All veterans deserve the best care that our country can give, but  there are gaps in services for Native American veterans.   The advisory committee established by this bill will ensure that we  look at and remedy the specific barriers Native American veterans face  so they will have access to the same care that other veterans have.   For these reasons and many more, I am thankful for the inclusion of  my bill today and look forward to seeing its implementation by  President-elect Biden.
