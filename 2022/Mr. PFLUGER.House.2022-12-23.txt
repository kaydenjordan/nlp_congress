 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Midland local and  World War II veteran Don McSparran for his service to our community.   For the past 22 years, Mr. McSparran has spent countless hours  patrolling Midland as a volunteer with the Midland Police Department.  With his wife, Doris, in the passenger seat, Mr. McSparran drives  around town assisting folks at any given moment with something as minor  as a local traffic accident or as major as a lost child. He has helped  countless people around Midland and is seen as a staple of the MPD.   Over the years, Mr. McSparran has selflessly given so much of his  time to keep our community safe. Now, at the age of 96, Mr. McSparran  has no intention of slowing down. He continues to serve with the utmost  commitment, dedication, and patriotism. His efforts strengthen and  engage our community, and he improves every life that he touches.   At the beginning of this month, Midland Mayor Patrick Payton  officially declared the day ``Don McSparran Appreciation Day,'' a  wonderful time to recognize Mr. McSparran's lifetime of service and  incredible dedication to our community.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McSparran for his time, for his heart, and  for his efforts to make Midland a better place. Our district is blessed  to have wonderful servant leaders like Don.                            ____________________
