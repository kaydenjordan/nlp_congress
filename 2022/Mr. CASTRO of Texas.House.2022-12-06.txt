 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Veteran  Service Recognition Act because it is time to bring our deported  veterans home.   Five years ago, I led a delegation of lawmakers to meet with a group  of deported veterans at a support house in Tijuana, Mexico.   Most of those folks joined the military after 9/11, putting their  lives on the line to defend American freedom and the freedom of our  allies thousands of miles away.   When they enlisted, our Nation gladly accepted their service--and if  they would have perished on the battlefield, they would have been  buried as American heroes right here in the United States. When they  came back home and struggled, they were kicked out of the Nation they  would have died to protect.   Mr. Speaker, I represent San Antonio, Texas, known as Military City  USA. From how I see it, deporting our veterans is one of the worst acts  of betrayal that our Federal Government can commit.    The Veteran Service Recognition Act will right the wrong by providing  an opportunity for deported veterans to apply for permanent residency,  and it will help current and future servicemembers apply for  naturalization for themselves and their families.   This bill is about doing the right thing for those who served. It is  time to bring our deported veterans back home.
